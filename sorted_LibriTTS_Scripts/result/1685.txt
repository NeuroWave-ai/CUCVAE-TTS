MYSTERY OF THE YELLOW ROOM Produced by Anonymous Project Gutenberg volunteers THE MYSTERY OF THE YELLOW ROOM By Gaston Leroux CHAPTER I In Which We Begin Not to Understand It is not without a certain emotion that I begin to recount here the extraordinary adventures of Joseph Rouletabille Down to the present time he had so firmly opposed my doing it that I had come to despair of ever publishing the most curious of police stories of the past fifteen years I had even imagined that the public would never know the whole truth of the prodigious case known as that of The Yellow Room out of which grew so many mysterious cruel and sensational dramas with which my friend was so closely mixed up if propos of a recent nomination of the illustrious Stangerson to the grade of grandcross of the Legion of Honour an evening journal in an article miserable for its ignorance or audacious for its perfidy had not resuscitated a terrible adventure of which Joseph Rouletabille had told me he wished to be for ever forgotten The Yellow Room Who now remembers this affair which caused so much ink to flow fifteen years ago Events are so quickly forgotten in Paris Has not the very name of the Nayves trial and the tragic history of the death of little Menaldo passed out of mind And yet the public attention was so deeply interested in the details of the trial that the occurrence of a ministerial crisis was completely unnoticed at the time Now The Yellow Room trial which preceded that of the Nayves by some years made far more noise The entire world hung for months over this obscure problem the most obscure it seems to me that has ever challenged the perspicacity of our police or taxed the conscience of our judges The solution of the problem baffled everybody who tried to find it It was like a dramatic rebus with which old Europe and new America alike became fascinated That is in truth I am permitted to say because there cannot be any author s vanity in all this since I do nothing more than transcribe facts on which an exceptional documentation enables me to throw a new light that is because in truth I do not know that in the domain of reality or imagination one can discover or recall to mind anything comparable in its mystery with the natural mystery of The Yellow Room That which nobody could find out Joseph Rouletabille aged eighteen then a reporter engaged on a leading journal succeeded in discovering But when at the Assize Court he brought in the key to the whole case he did not tell the whole truth He only allowed so much of it to appear as sufficed to ensure the acquittal of an innocent man The reasons which he had for his reticence no longer exist Better still the time has come for my friend to speak out fully You are going to know all and without further preamble I am going to place before your eyes the problem of The Yellow Room as it was placed before the eyes of the entire world on the day following the enactment of the drama at the Chateau du Glandier On the twenty fifth of October eighteen ninety two the following note appeared in the latest edition of the Temps A frightful crime has been committed at the Glandier on the border of the forest of Sainte Genevieve above Epinay sur Orge at the house of Professor Stangerson On that night while the master was working in his laboratory an attempt was made to assassinate Mademoiselle Stangerson who was sleeping in a chamber adjoining this laboratory The doctors do not answer for the life of Mdlle Stangerson The impression made on Paris by this news may be easily imagined Already at that time the learned world was deeply interested in the labours of Professor Stangerson and his daughter These labours the first that were attempted in radiography served to open the way for Monsieur and Madame Curie to the discovery of radium It was expected the Professor would shortly read to the Academy of Sciences a sensational paper on his new theory the Dissociation of Matter a theory destined to overthrow from its base the whole of official science which based itself on the principle of the Conservation of Energy On the following day the newspapers were full of the tragedy The Matin among others published the following article entitled A Supernatural Crime These are the only details wrote the anonymous writer in the Matin we have been able to obtain concerning the crime of the Chateau du Glandier The state of despair in which Professor Stangerson is plunged and the impossibility of getting any information from the lips of the victim have rendered our investigations and those of justice so difficult that at present we cannot form the least idea of what has passed in The Yellow Room in which Mdlle Stangerson in her night dress was found lying on the floor in the agonies of death We have at least been able to interview Daddy Jacques as he is called in the country a old servant in the Stangerson family Daddy Jacques entered The Room at the same time as the Professor This chamber adjoins the laboratory Laboratory and Yellow Room are in a pavilion at the end of the park about three hundred metres a thousand feet from the chateau It was half past twelve at night this honest old man told us and I was in the laboratory where Monsieur Stangerson was still working when the thing happened I had been cleaning and putting instruments in order all the evening and was waiting for Monsieur Stangerson to go to bed Mademoiselle Stangerson had worked with her father up to midnight when the twelve strokes of midnight had sounded by the cuckoo clock in the laboratory she rose kissed Monsieur Stangerson and bade him good night To me she said bon soir Daddy Jacques as she passed into The Yellow Room We heard her lock the door and shoot the bolt so that I could not help laughing and said to Monsieur There s Mademoiselle double locking herself in she must be afraid of the Bete du bon Dieu Monsieur did not even hear me he was so deeply absorbed in what he was doing Just then we heard the distant miawing of a cat Is that going to keep us awake all night I said to myself for I must tell you Monsieur that to the end of October I live in an attic of the pavilion over The Yellow Room so that Mademoiselle should not be left alone through the night in the lonely park It was the fancy of Mademoiselle to spend the fine weather in the pavilion no doubt she found it more cheerful than the chateau and for the four years it had been built she had never failed to take up her lodging there in the spring With the return of winter Mademoiselle returns to the chateau for there is no fireplace in The Yellow Room We were staying in the pavilion then Monsieur Stangerson and me We made no noise He was seated at his desk As for me I was sitting on a chair having finished my work and looking at him I said to myself What a man what intelligence what knowledge I attach importance to the fact that we made no noise for because of that the assassin certainly thought that we had left the place And suddenly while the cuckoo was sounding the half after midnight a desperate clamour broke out in The Yellow Room It was the voice of Mademoiselle crying Murder murder help Immediately afterwards revolver shots rang out and there was a great noise of tables and furniture being thrown to the ground as if in the course of a struggle and again the voice of Mademoiselle calling Murder help Papa Papa You may be sure that we quickly sprang up and that Monsieur Stangerson and I threw ourselves upon the door But alas it was locked fast locked on the inside by the care of Mademoiselle as I have told you with key and bolt We tried to force it open but it remained firm Monsieur Stangerson was like a madman and truly it was enough to make him one for we heard Mademoiselle still calling Help help Monsieur Stangerson showered terrible blows on the door and wept with rage and sobbed with despair and helplessness It was then that I had an inspiration The assassin must have entered by the window I cried I will go to the window and I rushed from the pavilion and ran like one out of his mind The inspiration was that the window of The Yellow Room looks out in such a way that the park wall which abuts on the pavilion prevented my at once reaching the window To get up to it one has first to go out of the park I ran towards the gate and on my way met Bernier and his wife the gate keepers who had been attracted by the pistol reports and by our cries In a few words I told them what had happened and directed the concierge to join Monsieur Stangerson with all speed while his wife came with me to open the park gate Five minutes later she and I were before the window of The Yellow Room The moon was shining brightly and I saw clearly that no one had touched the window Not only were the bars that protect it intact but the blinds inside of them were drawn as I had myself drawn them early in the evening as I did every day though Mademoiselle knowing that I was tired from the heavy work I had been doing had begged me not to trouble myself but leave her to do it and they were just as I had left them fastened with an iron catch on the inside The assassin therefore could not have passed either in or out that way but neither could I get in It was unfortunate enough to turn one s brain The door of the room locked on the inside and the blinds on the only window also fastened on the inside and Mademoiselle still calling for help No she had ceased to call She was dead perhaps But I still heard her father in the pavilion trying to break down the door With the concierge I hurried back to the pavilion The door in spite of the furious attempts of Monsieur Stangerson and Bernier to burst it open was still holding firm but at length it gave way before our united efforts and then what a sight met our eyes I should tell you that behind us the concierge held the laboratory lamp a powerful lamp that lit the whole chamber I must also tell you monsieur that The Yellow Room is a very small room Mademoiselle had furnished it with a fairly large iron bedstead a small table a night commode a dressing table and two chairs By the light of the big lamp we saw all at a glance Mademoiselle in her night dress was lying on the floor in the midst of the greatest disorder Tables and chairs had been overthrown showing that there had been a violent struggle Mademoiselle had certainly been dragged from her bed She was covered with blood and had terrible marks of finger nails on her throat the flesh of her neck having been almost torn by the nails From a wound on the right temple a stream of blood had run down and made a little pool on the floor When Monsieur Stangerson saw his daughter in that state he threw himself on his knees beside her uttering a cry of despair He ascertained that she still breathed As to us we searched for the wretch who had tried to kill our mistress and I swear to you monsieur that if we had found him it would have gone hard with him But how to explain that he was not there that he had already escaped It passes all imagination Nobody under the bed nobody behind the furniture All that we discovered were traces blood stained marks of a man s large hand on the walls and on the door a big handkerchief red with blood without any initials an old cap and many fresh footmarks of a man on the floor footmarks of a man with large feet whose boot soles had left a sort of sooty impression How had this man got away How had he vanished Don t forget monsieur that there is no chimney in The Yellow Room He could not have escaped by the door which is narrow and on the threshold of which the concierge stood with the lamp while her husband and I searched for him in every corner of the little room where it is impossible for anyone to hide himself The door which had been forced open against the wall could not conceal anything behind it as we assured ourselves By the window still in every way secured no flight had been possible What then I began to believe in the Devil But we discovered my revolver on the floor Yes my revolver Oh that brought me back to the reality The Devil would not have needed to steal my revolver to kill Mademoiselle The man who had been there had first gone up to my attic and taken my revolver from the drawer where I kept it We then ascertained by counting the cartridges that the assassin had fired two shots

none	none	it was fortunate for me that Monsieur Stangerson was in the laboratory when the affair took place and had seen with his own eyes that I was there with him for otherwise with this business of my revolver I don t know where we should have been I should now be under lock and bar Justice wants no more to send a man to the scaffold The editor of the Matin added to this interview the following lines We have without interrupting him allowed Daddy Jacques to recount to us roughly all he knows about the crime of The Yellow Room We have reproduced it in his own words only sparing the reader the continual lamentations with which he garnished his narrative It is quite understood Daddy Jacques quite understood that you are very fond of your masters and you want them to know it and never cease repeating it especially since the discovery of your revolver It is your right and we see no harm in it We should have liked to put some further questions to Daddy Jacques Jacques Louis Moustier but the inquiry of the examining magistrate which is being carried on at the chateau makes it impossible for us to gain admission at the Glandier and as to the oak wood it is guarded by a wide circle of policemen who are jealously watching all traces that can lead to the pavilion and that may perhaps lead to the discovery of the assassin We have also wished to question the concierges but they are invisible Finally we have waited in a roadside inn not far from the gate of the chateau for the departure of Monsieur de Marquet the magistrate of Corbeil At half past five we saw him and his clerk and before he was able to enter his carriage had an opportunity to ask him the following question Can you Monsieur de Marquet give us any information as to this affair without inconvenience to the course of your inquiry It is impossible for us to do it replied Monsieur de Marquet I can only say that it is the strangest affair I have ever known The more we think we know something the further we are from knowing anything We asked Monsieur de Marquet to be good enough to explain his last words and this is what he said the importance of which no one will fail to recognise If nothing is added to the material facts so far established I fear that the mystery which surrounds the abominable crime of which Mademoiselle Stangerson has been the victim will never be brought to light but it is to be hoped for the sake of our human reason that the examination of the walls and of the ceiling of The Yellow Room an examination which I shall to morrow intrust to the builder who constructed the pavilion four years ago will afford us the proof that may not discourage us For the problem is this we know by what way the assassin gained admission he entered by the door and hid himself under the bed awaiting Mademoiselle Stangerson But how did he leave How did he escape If no trap no secret door no hiding place no opening of any sort is found if the examination of the walls even to the demolition of the pavilion does not reveal any passage practicable not only for a human being but for any being whatsoever if the ceiling shows no crack if the floor hides no underground passage one must really believe in the Devil as Daddy Jacques says And the anonymous writer in the Matin added in this article which I have selected as the most interesting of all those that were published on the subject of this affair that the examining magistrate appeared to place a peculiar significance to the last sentence One must really believe in the Devil as Jacques says The article concluded with these lines We wanted to know what Daddy Jacques meant by the cry of the Bete Du Bon Dieu The landlord of the Donjon Inn explained to us that it is the particularly sinister cry which is uttered sometimes at night by the cat of an old woman Mother Angenoux as she is called in the country Mother Angenoux is a sort of saint who lives in a hut in the heart of the forest not far from the grotto of Sainte Genevieve The Yellow Room the Bete Du Bon Dieu Mother Angenoux the Devil Sainte Genevieve Daddy Jacques here is a well entangled crime which the stroke of a pickaxe in the wall may disentangle for us to morrow Let us at least hope that for the sake of our human reason as the examining magistrate says Meanwhile it is expected that Mademoiselle Stangerson who has not ceased to be delirious and only pronounces one word distinctly Murderer Murderer will not live through the night In conclusion and at a late hour the same journal announced that the Chief of the Surete had telegraphed to the famous detective Frederic Larsan who had been sent to London for an affair of stolen securities to return immediately to Paris CHAPTER II In Which Joseph Roultabille Appears for the First Time I remember as well as if it had occurred yesterday the entry of young Rouletabille into my bedroom that morning It was about eight o clock and I was still in bed reading the article in the Matin relative to the Glandier crime But before going further it is time that I present my friend to the reader I first knew Joseph Rouletabille when he was a young reporter At that time I was a beginner at the Bar and often met him in the corridors of examining magistrates when I had gone to get a permit to communicate for the prison of Mazas or for Saint Lazare He had as they say a good nut He seemed to have taken his head round as a bullet out of a box of marbles and it is from that I think that his comrades of the press all determined billiard players had given him that nickname which was to stick to him and be made illustrious by him He was always as red as a tomato now gay as a lark now grave as a judge How while still so young he was only sixteen and a half years old when I saw him for the first time had he already won his way on the press That was what everybody who came into contact with him might have asked if they had not known his history At the time of the affair of the woman cut in pieces in the Rue Oberskampf another forgotten story he had taken to one of the editors of the Epoque a paper then rivalling the Matin for information the left foot which was missing from the basket in which the gruesome remains were discovered For this left foot the police had been vainly searching for a week and young Rouletabille had found it in a drain where nobody had thought of looking for it To do that he had dressed himself as an extra sewer man one of a number engaged by the administration of the city of Paris owing to an overflow of the Seine When the editor in chief was in possession of the precious foot and informed as to the train of intelligent deductions the boy had been led to make he was divided between the admiration he felt for such detective cunning in a brain of a lad of sixteen years and delight at being able to exhibit in the morgue window of his paper the left foot of the Rue Oberskampf This foot he cried will make a great headline Then when he had confided the gruesome packet to the medical lawyer attached to the journal he asked the lad who was shortly to become famous as Rouletabille what he would expect to earn as a general reporter on the Epoque Two hundred francs a month the youngster replied modestly hardly able to breathe from surprise at the proposal You shall have two hundred and fifty said the editor in chief only you must tell everybody that you have been engaged on the paper for a month Let it be quite understood that it was not you but the Epoque that discovered the left foot of the Rue Oberskampf Here my young friend the man is nothing the paper everything Having said this he begged the new reporter to retire but before the youth had reached the door he called him back to ask his name The other replied Joseph Josephine That s not a name said the editor in chief but since you will not be required to sign what you write it is of no consequence The boy faced reporter speedily made himself many friends for he was serviceable and gifted with a good humour that enchanted the most severe tempered and disarmed the most zealous of his companions At the Bar cafe where the reporters assembled before going to any of the courts or to the Prefecture in search of their news of crime he began to win a reputation as an unraveller of intricate and obscure affairs which found its way to the office of the Chief of the Surete When a case was worth the trouble and Rouletabille he had already been given his nickname had been started on the scent by his editor in chief he often got the better of the most famous detective It was at the Bar cafe that I became intimately acquainted with him Criminal lawyers and journalists are not enemies the former need advertisement the latter information We chatted together and I soon warmed towards him His intelligence was so keen and so original and he had a quality of thought such as I have never found in any other person Some time after this I was put in charge of the law news of the Cri du Boulevard My entry into journalism could not but strengthen the ties which united me to Rouletabille After a while my new friend being allowed to carry out an idea of a judicial correspondence column which he was allowed to sign Business in the Epoque I was often able to furnish him with the legal information of which he stood in need Nearly two years passed in this way and the better I knew him the more I learned to love him for in spite of his careless extravagance I had discovered in him what was considering his age an extraordinary seriousness of mind Accustomed as I was to seeing him gay and indeed often too gay I would many times find him plunged in the deepest melancholy I tried then to question him as to the cause of this change of humour but each time he laughed and made me no answer One day having questioned him about his parents of whom he never spoke he left me pretending not to have heard what I said While things were in this state between us the famous case of The Yellow Room took place It was this case which was to rank him as the leading newspaper reporter and to obtain for him the reputation of being the greatest detective in the world It should not surprise us to find in the one man the perfection of two such lines of activity if we remember that the daily press was already beginning to transform itself and to become what it is to day the gazette of crime Morose minded people may complain of this for myself I regard it a matter for congratulation We can never have too many arms public or private against the criminal To this some people may answer that by continually publishing the details of crimes the press ends by encouraging their commission But then with some people we can never do right Rouletabille as I have said entered my room that morning of the twenty sixth of October eighteen ninety two He was looking redder than usual and his eyes were bulging out of his head as the phrase is and altogether he appeared to be in a state of extreme excitement He waved the Matin with a trembling hand and cried Well my dear Sainclair have you read it The Glandier crime Yes The Yellow Room What do you think of it I think that it must have been the Devil or the Bete du Bon Dieu that committed the crime Be serious Well I don t much believe in murderers who make their escape through walls of solid brick I think Daddy Jacques did wrong to leave behind him the weapon with which the crime was committed and as he occupied the attic immediately above Mademoiselle Stangerson s room the builder s job ordered by the examining magistrate will give us the key of the enigma and it will not be long before we learn by what natural trap or by what secret door the old fellow was able to slip in and out and return immediately to the laboratory to Monsieur Stangerson without his absence being noticed That of course is only an hypothesis Although the original English translation often uses the words murder and murderer the reader may substitute attack and attacker since no murder is actually committed Rouletabille sat down in an armchair lit his pipe which he was never without smoked for a few minutes in silence no doubt to calm the excitement which visibly dominated him and then replied Young man he said in a tone the sad irony of which I will not attempt to render young man you are a lawyer and I doubt not your ability to save the guilty from conviction but if you were a magistrate on the bench how easy it would be for you to condemn innocent persons You are really gifted young man He continued to smoke energetically and then went on No trap will be found and the mystery of The Yellow Room will become more and more mysterious That s why it interests me The examining magistrate is right nothing stranger than this crime has ever been known Have you any idea of the way by which the murderer escaped I asked None replied Rouletabille none for the present But I have an idea as to the revolver the murderer did not use it Good Heavens By whom then was it used Why by Mademoiselle Stangerson I don t understand or rather I have never understood I said Rouletabille shrugged his shoulders Is there nothing in this article in the Matin by which you were particularly struck Nothing I have found the whole of the story it tells equally strange Well but the locked door with the key on the inside That s the only perfectly natural thing in the whole article Really And the bolt The bolt Yes the bolt also inside the room a still further protection against entry Mademoiselle Stangerson took quite extraordinary precautions It is clear to me that she feared someone That was why she took such precautions even Daddy Jacques s revolver without telling him of it No doubt she didn t wish to alarm anybody and least of all her father What she dreaded took place and she defended herself There was a struggle and she used the revolver skilfully enough to wound the assassin in the hand which explains the impression on the wall and on the door of the large blood stained hand of the man who was searching for a means of exit from the chamber But she didn t fire soon enough to avoid the terrible blow on the right temple Then the wound on the temple was not done with the revolver The paper doesn t say it was and I don t think it was because logically it appears to me that the revolver was used by Mademoiselle Stangerson against the assassin Now what weapon did the murderer use The blow on the temple seems to show that the murderer wished to stun Mademoiselle Stangerson after he had unsuccessfully tried to strangle her He must have known that the attic was inhabited by Daddy Jacques and that was one of the reasons I think why he must have used a quiet weapon a life preserver or a hammer All that doesn t explain how the murderer got out of The Yellow Room I observed Evidently replied Rouletabille rising and that is what has to be explained I am going to the Chateau du Glandier and have come to see whether you will go with me I Yes my boy I want you The Epoque has definitely entrusted this case to me and I must clear it up as quickly as possible But in what way can I be of any use to you Monsieur Robert Darzac is at the Chateau du Glandier That s true His despair must be boundless I must have a talk with him Rouletabille said it in a tone that surprised me Is it because you think there is something to be got out of him I asked Yes That was all he would say He retired to my sitting room begging me to dress quickly I knew Monsieur Robert Darzac from having been of great service to him in a civil action while I was acting as secretary to Maitre Barbet Delatour Monsieur Robert Darzac who was at that time about forty years of age was a professor of physics at the Sorbonne He was intimately acquainted with the Stangersons and after an assiduous seven years courtship of the daughter had been on the point of marrying her In spite of the fact that she has become as the phrase goes a person of a certain age she was still remarkably good looking While I was dressing I called out to Rouletabille who was impatiently moving about my sitting room Have you any idea as to the murderer s station in life Yes he replied I think if he isn t a man in society he is at least a man belonging to the upper class But that again is only an impression What has led you to form it Well the greasy cap the common handkerchief and the marks of the rough boots on the floor he replied I understand I said murderers don t leave traces behind them which tell the truth We shall make something out of you yet my dear Sainclair concluded Rouletabille CHAPTER III A Man Has Passed Like a Shadow Through the Blinds Half an hour later Rouletabille and I were on the platform of the Orleans station awaiting the departure of the train which was to take us to Epinay sur Orge On the platform we found Monsieur de Marquet and his Registrar who represented the Judicial Court of Corbeil Monsieur Marquet had spent the night in Paris attending the final rehearsal at the Scala of a little play of which he was the unknown author signing himself simply Castigat Ridendo Monsieur de Marquet was beginning to be a noble old gentleman Generally he was extremely polite and full of gay humour and in all his life had had but one passion that of dramatic art Throughout his magisterial career he was interested solely in cases capable of furnishing him with something in the nature of a drama Though he might very well have aspired to the highest judicial positions he had never really worked for anything but to win a success at the romantic Porte Saint Martin or at the sombre Odeon Because of the mystery which shrouded it the case of The Yellow Room was certain to fascinate so theatrical a mind It interested him enormously and he threw himself into it less as a magistrate eager to know the truth than as an amateur of dramatic embroglios tending wholly to mystery and intrigue who dreads nothing so much as the explanatory final act So that at the moment of meeting him I heard Monsieur de Marquet say to the Registrar with a sigh I hope my dear Monsieur Maleine this builder with his pickaxe will not destroy so fine a mystery Have no fear replied Monsieur Maleine his pickaxe may demolish the pavilion perhaps but it will leave our case intact I have sounded the walls and examined the ceiling and floor and I know all about it I am not to be deceived Having thus reassured his chief Monsieur Maleine with a discreet movement of the head drew Monsieur de Marquet s attention to us The face of that gentleman clouded and as he saw Rouletabille approaching hat in hand he sprang into one of the empty carriages saying half aloud to his Registrar as he did so Above all no journalists Monsieur Maleine replied in the same tone I understand and then tried to prevent Rouletabille from entering the same compartment with the examining magistrate Excuse me gentlemen this compartment is reserved I am a journalist Monsieur engaged on the Epoque said my young friend with a great show of gesture and politeness and I have a word or two to say to Monsieur de Marquet Monsieur is very much engaged with the inquiry he has in hand Ah his inquiry pray believe me is absolutely a matter of indifference to me I am no scavenger of odds and ends he went on with infinite contempt in his lower lip I am a theatrical reporter and this evening I shall have to give a little account of the play at the Scala Get in sir please said the Registrar Rouletabille was already in the compartment I went in after him and seated myself by his side The Registrar followed and closed the carriage door Monsieur de Marquet looked at him Ah sir Rouletabille began You must not be angry with Monsieur de Maleine It is not with Monsieur de Marquet that I desire to have the honour of speaking but with Monsieur Castigat Ridendo Permit me to congratulate you personally as well as the writer for the Epoque And Rouletabille having first introduced me introduced himself Monsieur de Marquet with a nervous gesture caressed his beard into a point and explained to Rouletabille in a few words that he was too modest an author to desire that the veil of his pseudonym should be publicly raised and that he hoped the enthusiasm of the journalist for the dramatist s work would not lead him to tell the public that Monsieur Castigat Ridendo and the examining magistrate of Corbeil were one and the same person The work of the dramatic author may interfere he said after a slight hesitation with that of the magistrate especially in a province where one s labours are little more than routine Oh you may rely on my discretion cried Rouletabille The train was in motion We have started said the examining magistrate surprised at seeing us still in the carriage Yes Monsieur truth has started said Rouletabile smiling amiably on its way to the Chateau du Glandier A fine case Monsieur de Marquet a fine case An obscure incredible unfathomable inexplicable affair and there is only one thing I fear Monsieur Rouletabille that the journalists will be trying to explain it My friend felt this a rap on his knuckles Yes he said simply that is to be feared They meddle in everything As for my interest monsieur I only referred to it by mere chance the mere chance of finding myself in the same train with you and in the same compartment of the same carriage Where are you going then asked Monsieur de Marquet To the Chateau du Glandier replied Rouletabille without turning You ll not get in Monsieur Rouletabille Will you prevent me said my friend already prepared to fight Not I I like the press and journalists too well to be in any way disagreeable to them but Monsieur Stangerson has given orders for his door to be closed against everybody and it is well guarded Not a journalist was able to pass through the gate of the Glandier yesterday Monsieur de Marquet compressed his lips and seemed ready to relapse into obstinate silence He only relaxed a little when Rouletabille no longer left him in ignorance of the fact that we were going to the Glandier for the purpose of shaking hands with an old and intimate friend Monsieur Robert Darzac a man whom Rouletabille had perhaps seen once in his life Poor Robert continued the young reporter this dreadful affair may be his death he is so deeply in love with Mademoiselle Stangerson His sufferings are truly painful to witness escaped like a regret from the lips of Monsieur de Marquet But it is to be hoped that Mademoiselle Stangerson s life will be saved Let us hope so Her father told me yesterday that if she does not recover it will not be long before he joins her in the grave What an incalculable loss to science his death would be The wound on her temple is serious is it not Evidently but by a wonderful chance it has not proved mortal The blow was given with great force Then it was not with the revolver she was wounded said Rouletabille glancing at me in triumph Monsieur de Marquet appeared greatly embarrassed I didn t say anything I don t want to say anything I will not say anything he said And he turned towards his Registrar as if he no longer knew us But Rouletabille was not to be so easily shaken off He moved nearer to the examining magistrate and drawing a copy of the Matin from his pocket he showed it to him and said There is one thing Monsieur which I may enquire of you without committing an indiscretion You have of course seen the account given in the Matin It is absurd is it not Not in the slightest Monsieur What The Yellow Room has but one barred window the bars of which have not been moved and only one door which had to be broken open and the assassin was not found That s so monsieur that s so That s how the matter stands Rouletabille said no more but plunged into thought A quarter of an hour thus passed Coming back to himself again he said addressing the magistrate How did Mademoiselle Stangerson wear her hair on that evening I don t know replied Monsieur de Marquet That s a very important point said Rouletabille Her hair was done up in bands wasn t it I feel sure that on that evening the evening of the crime she had her hair arranged in bands Then you are mistaken Monsieur Rouletabille replied the magistrate Mademoiselle Stangerson that evening had her hair drawn up in a knot on the top of her head her usual way of arranging it her forehead completely uncovered I can assure you for we have carefully examined the wound There was no blood on the hair and the arrangement of it has not been disturbed since the crime was committed You are sure You are sure that on the night of the crime she had not her hair in bands Quite sure the magistrate continued smiling because I remember the Doctor saying to me while he was examining the wound It is a great pity Mademoiselle Stangerson was in the habit of drawing her hair back from her forehead If she had worn it in bands the blow she received on the temple would have been weakened It seems strange to me that you should attach so much importance to this point Oh if she had not her hair in bands I give it up said Rouletabille with a despairing gesture And was the wound on her temple a bad one he asked presently Terrible With what weapon was it made That is a secret of the investigation Have you found the weapon whatever it was The magistrate did not answer And the wound in the throat Here the examining magistrate readily confirmed the decision of the doctor that if the murderer had pressed her throat a few seconds longer Mademoiselle Stangerson would have died of strangulation The affair as reported in the Matin said Rouletabille eagerly seems to me more and more inexplicable Can you tell me Monsieur how many openings there are in the pavilion I mean doors and windows There are five replied Monsieur de Marquet after having coughed once or twice but no longer resisting the desire he felt to talk of the whole of the incredible mystery of the affair he was investigating There are five of which the door of the vestibule is the only entrance to the pavilion a door always automatically closed which cannot be opened either from the outer or inside except with the two special keys which are never out of the possession of either Daddy Jacques or Monsieur Stangerson Mademoiselle Stangerson had no need for one since Daddy Jacques lodged in the pavilion and because during the daytime she never left her father When they all four rushed into The Yellow Room after breaking open the door of the laboratory the door in the vestibule remained closed as usual and of the two keys for opening it Daddy Jacques had one in his pocket and Monsieur Stangerson the other As to the windows of the pavilion there are four the one window of The Yellow Room and those of the laboratory looking out on to the country the window in the vestibule looking into the park It is by that window that he escaped from the pavilion cried Rouletabille How do you know that demanded Monsieur de Marquet fixing a strange look on my young friend We ll see later how he got away from The Yellow Room replied Rouletabille but he must have left the pavilion by the vestibule window Once more how do you know that How Oh the thing is simple enough As soon as he found he could not escape by the door of the pavilion his only way out was by the window in the vestibule unless he could pass through a grated window The window of The Yellow Room is secured by iron bars because it looks out upon the open country the two windows of the laboratory have to be protected in like manner for the same reason As the murderer got away I conceive that he found a window that was not barred that of the vestibule which opens on to the park that is to say into the interior of the estate There s not much magic in all that Yes said Monsieur de Marquet but what you have not guessed is that this single window in the vestibule though it has no iron bars has solid iron blinds Now these iron blinds have remained fastened by their iron latch and yet we have proof that the murderer made his escape from the pavilion by that window Traces of blood on the inside wall and on the blinds as well as on the floor and footmarks of which I have taken the measurements attest the fact that the murderer made his escape that way But then how did he do it seeing that the blinds remained fastened on the inside He passed through them like a shadow But what is more bewildering than all is that it is impossible to form any idea as to how the murderer got out of The Yellow Room or how he got across the laboratory to reach the vestibule Ah yes Monsieur Rouletabille it is altogether as you said a fine case the key to which will not be discovered for a long time I hope You hope Monsieur Monsieur de Marquet corrected himself I do not hope so I think so Could that window have been closed and refastened after the flight of the assassin asked Rouletabille That is what occurred to me for a moment but it would imply an accomplice or accomplices and I don t see After a short silence he added Ah if Mademoiselle Stangerson were only well enough to day to be questioned Rouletabille following up his thought asked And the attic There must be some opening to that Yes there is a window or rather skylight in it which as it looks out towards the country Monsieur Stangerson has had barred like the rest of the windows These bars as in the other windows have remained intact and the blinds which naturally open inwards have not been unfastened For the rest we have not discovered anything to lead us to suspect that the murderer had passed through the attic It seems clear to you then Monsieur that the murderer escaped nobody knows how by the window in the vestibule Everything goes to prove it I think so too confessed Rouletabille gravely After a brief silence he continued If you have not found any traces of the murderer in the attic such as the dirty footmarks similar to those on the floor of The Yellow Room you must come to the conclusion that it was not he who stole Daddy Jacques s revolver There are no footmarks in the attic other than those of Daddy Jacques himself said the magistrate with a significant turn of his head Then after an apparent decision he added Daddy Jacques was with Monsieur Stangerson in the laboratory and it was lucky for him he was Then what part did his revolver play in the tragedy It seems very clear that this weapon did less harm to Mademoiselle Stangerson than it did to the murderer The magistrate made no reply to this question which doubtless embarrassed him Monsieur Stangerson he said tells us that the two bullets have been found in The Yellow Room one embedded in the wall stained with the impression of a red hand a man s large hand and the other in the ceiling Oh oh in the ceiling muttered Rouletabille In the ceiling That s very curious In the ceiling He puffed awhile in silence at his pipe enveloping himself in the smoke When we reached Savigny sur Orge I had to tap him on the shoulder to arouse him from his dream and come out on to the platform of the station There the magistrate and his Registrar bowed to us and by rapidly getting into a cab that was awaiting them made us understand that they had seen enough of us How long will it take to walk to the Chateau du Glandier Rouletabille asked one of the railway porters An hour and a half or an hour and three quarters easy walking the man replied Rouletabille looked up at the sky and no doubt finding its appearance satisfactory took my arm and said Come on I need a walk Are things getting less entangled I asked Not a bit of it he said more entangled than ever It s true I have an idea What s that I asked I can t tell you what it is just at present it s an idea involving the life or death of two persons at least Do you think there were accomplices I don t think it We fell into silence Presently he went on It was a bit of luck our falling in with that examining magistrate and his Registrar eh What did I tell you about that revolver His head was bent down he had his hands in his pockets and he was whistling After a while I heard him murmur Poor woman Is it Mademoiselle Stangerson you are pitying Yes she s a noble woman and worthy of being pitied a woman of a great a very great character I imagine I imagine You know her then Not at all I have never seen her Why then do you say that she is a woman of great character Because she bravely faced the murderer because she courageously defended herself and above all because of the bullet in the ceiling I looked at Rouletabille and inwardly wondered whether he was not mocking me or whether he had not suddenly gone out of his senses But I saw that he had never been less inclined to laugh and the brightness of his keenly intelligent eyes assured me that he retained all his reason Then too I was used to his broken way of talking which only left me puzzled as to his meaning till with a very few clear rapidly uttered words he would make the drift of his ideas clear to me and I saw that what he had previously said and which had appeared to me void of meaning was so thoroughly logical that I could not understand how it was I had not understood him sooner CHAPTER IV In the Bosom of Wild Nature The Chateau du Glandier is one of the oldest chateaux in the Ile de France where so many building remains of the feudal period are still standing Built originally in the heart of the forest in the reign of Philip le Bel it now could be seen a few hundred yards from the road leading from the village of Sainte Genevieve to Monthery A mass of inharmonious structures it is dominated by a donjon When the visitor has mounted the crumbling steps of this ancient donjon he reaches a little plateau where in the seventeenth century Georges Philibert de Sequigny Lord of the Glandier Maisons Neuves and other places built the existing town in an abominably rococo style of architecture It was in this place seemingly belonging entirely to the past that Professor Stangerson and his daughter installed themselves to lay the foundations for the science of the future Its solitude in the depths of woods was what more than all had pleased them They would have none to witness their labours and intrude on their hopes but the aged stones and grand old oaks The Glandier ancient Glandierum was so called from the quantity of glands acorns which in all times had been gathered in that neighbourhood This land of present mournful interest had fallen back owing to the negligence or abandonment of its owners into the wild character of primitive nature The buildings alone which were hidden there had preserved traces of their strange metamorphoses Every age had left on them its imprint a bit of architecture with which was bound up the remembrance of some terrible event some bloody adventure Such was the chateau in which science had taken refuge a place seemingly designed to be the theatre of mysteries terror and death Having explained so far I cannot refrain from making one further reflection If I have lingered a little over this description of the Glandier it is not because I have reached the right moment for creating the necessary atmosphere for the unfolding of the tragedy before the eyes of the reader Indeed in all this matter my first care will be to be as simple as is possible I have no ambition to be an author An author is always something of a romancer and God knows the mystery of The Yellow Room is quite full enough of real tragic horror to require no aid from literary effects I am and only desire to be a faithful reporter My duty is to report the event and I place the event in its frame that is all It is only natural that you should know where the things happened I return to Monsieur Stangerson When he bought the estate fifteen years before the tragedy with which we are engaged occurred the Chateau du Glandier had for a long time been unoccupied Another old chateau in the neighbourhood built in the fourteenth century by Jean de Belmont was also abandoned so that that part of the country was very little inhabited Some small houses on the side of the road leading to Corbeil an inn called the Auberge du Donjon which offered passing hospitality to waggoners these were about all to represent civilisation in this out of the way part of the country but a few leagues from the capital But this deserted condition of the place had been the determining reason for the choice made by Monsieur Stangerson and his daughter Monsieur Stangerson was already celebrated He had returned from America where his works had made a great stir The book which he had published at Philadelphia on the Dissociation of Matter by Electric Action had aroused opposition throughout the whole scientific world Monsieur Stangerson was a Frenchman but of American origin Important matters relating to a legacy had kept him for several years in the United States where he had continued the work begun by him in France whither he had returned in possession of a large fortune This fortune was a great boon to him for though he might have made millions of dollars by exploiting two or three of his chemical discoveries relative to new processes of dyeing it was always repugnant to him to use for his own private gain the wonderful gift of invention he had received from nature He considered he owed it to mankind and all that his genius brought into the world went by this philosophical view of his duty into the public lap If he did not try to conceal his satisfaction at coming into possession of this fortune which enabled him to give himself up to his passion for pure science he had equally to rejoice it seemed to him for another cause Mademoiselle Stangerson was at the time when her father returned from America and bought the Glandier estate twenty years of age She was exceedingly pretty having at once the Parisian grace of her mother who had died in giving her birth and all the splendour all the riches of the young American blood of her parental grandfather William Stangerson A citizen of Philadelphia William Stangerson had been obliged to become naturalised in obedience to family exigencies at the time of his marriage with a French lady she who was to be the mother of the illustrious Stangerson In that way the professor s French nationality is accounted for Twenty years of age a charming blonde with blue eyes milk white complexion and radiant with divine health Mathilde Stangerson was one of the most beautiful marriageable girls in either the old or the new world It was her father s duty in spite of the inevitable pain which a separation from her would cause him to think of her marriage and he was fully prepared for it Nevertheless he buried himself and his child at the Glandier at the moment when his friends were expecting him to bring her out into society Some of them expressed their astonishment and to their questions he answered It is my daughter s wish I can refuse her nothing She has chosen the Glandier Interrogated in her turn the young girl replied calmly Where could we work better than in this solitude For Mademoiselle Stangerson had already begun to collaborate with her father in his work It could not at the time be imagined that her passion for science would lead her so far as to refuse all the suitors who presented themselves to her for over fifteen years So secluded was the life led by the two father and daughter that they showed themselves only at a few official receptions and at certain times in the year in two or three friendly drawing rooms where the fame of the professor and the beauty of Mathilde made a sensation The young girl s extreme reserve did not at first discourage suitors but at the end of a few years they tired of their quest One alone persisted with tender tenacity and deserved the name of eternal fiance a name he accepted with melancholy resignation that was Monsieur Robert Darzac Mademoiselle Stangerson was now no longer young and it seemed that having found no reason for marrying at five and thirty she would never find one But such an argument evidently found no acceptance with Monsieur Robert Darzac He continued to pay his court if the delicate and tender attention with which he ceaselessly surrounded this woman of five and thirty could be called courtship in face of her declared intention never to marry Suddenly some weeks before the events with which we are occupied a report to which nobody attached any importance so incredible did it sound was spread about Paris that Mademoiselle Stangerson had at last consented to crown the inextinguishable flame of Monsieur Robert Darzac It needed that Monsieur Robert Darzac himself should not deny this matrimonial rumour to give it an appearance of truth so unlikely did it seem to be well founded One day however Monsieur Stangerson as he was leaving the Academy of Science announced that the marriage of his daughter and Monsieur Robert Darzac would be celebrated in the privacy of the Chateau du Glandier as soon as he and his daughter had put the finishing touches to their report summing up their labours on the Dissociation of Matter The new household would install itself in the Glandier and the son in law would lend his assistance in the work to which the father and daughter had dedicated their lives The scientific world had barely had time to recover from the effect of this news when it learned of the attempted assassination of Mademoiselle under the extraordinary conditions which we have detailed and which our visit to the chateau was to enable us to ascertain with yet greater precision I have not hesitated to furnish the reader with all these retrospective details known to me through my business relations with Monsieur Robert Darzac On crossing the threshold of The Yellow Room he was as well posted as I was CHAPTER V 
1870-164323-0000	train-other-500	In Which Joseph Rouletabille Makes a Remark to Monsieur Robert Darzac Which Produces Its Little Effect
none	none	 Rouletabille and I had been walking for several minutes by the side of a long wall 
1870-164323-0001	train-other-500	bounding the vast property of Monsieur Stangerson and had already come within sight of the entrance gate when our attention was drawn to an individual who half bent to the ground seemed to be so completely absorbed in what he was doing
none	none	 as not to have seen us coming towards him 
1870-164323-0002	train-other-500	At one time he stooped so low as almost to touch the ground at another he drew himself up and attentively examined the wall then he looked into the palm of one of his hands and walked away
1870-164323-0003	train-other-500	with rapid strides Finally he set off running still looking into the palm of his hand Rouletabille had brought me to a standstill by a gesture Hush Frederic Larsan is at work
1870-164323-0004	train-other-500	Don t let us disturb him Rouletabille had a great admiration for the celebrated detective I had never before seen him but I knew him well by reputation At that time
1870-164323-0005	train-other-500	before Rouletabille had given proof of his unique talent Larsan was reputed as the most skilful unraveller of the most mysterious and complicated crimes His reputation was world wide
1870-164323-0006	train-other-500	and the police of London and even of America often called him in to their aid when their own national inspectors and detectives found themselves at the end of their wits and resources
none	none	 No one was astonished then that the head of the Surete had 
1870-164323-0007	train-other-500	at the outset of the mystery of The Yellow Room
none	none	 telegraphed his precious subordinate to London where he had been sent on a big case of stolen securities 
1870-164323-0008	train-other-500	to return with all haste
none	none	 Frederic who at the Surete was called the great Frederic 
1870-164323-0009	train-other-500	had made all speed doubtless knowing by experience that if he was interrupted in what he was doing it was because his services were urgently needed in another direction so as Rouletabille said he was that morning already at work
1870-164323-0010	train-other-500	We soon found out in what it consisted What he was continually looking at in the palm of his right hand was nothing but his watch the minute hand of which he appeared to be noting intently
1870-164323-0011	train-other-500	Then he turned back still running stopping only when he reached the park gate where he again consulted his watch and then put it away in his pocket shrugging his shoulders with a gesture of discouragement
1870-164323-0012	train-other-500	He pushed open the park gate reclosed and locked it raised his head and through the bars perceived us Rouletabille rushed after him and I followed Frederic Larsan waited for us Monsieur Fred
1870-164323-0013	train-other-500	said Rouletabille raising his hat and showing the profound respect based on admiration which the young reporter felt for the celebrated detective can you tell me whether Monsieur Robert Darzac is at the chateau at this moment Here is one of his friends of the Paris Bar
1870-164323-0014	train-other-500	who desires to speak with him I really don t know Monsieur Rouletabille replied Fred shaking hands with my friend whom he had several times met in the course of his difficult investigations I have not seen him
none	none	 The concierges will be able to inform us no doubt 
1870-164323-0015	train-other-500	said Rouletabille pointing to the lodge the door and windows of which were close shut
none	none	 The concierges 
1870-164323-0016	train-other-500	will not be able to give you any information Monsieur Rouletabille Why not Because they were arrested half an hour ago Arrested cried Rouletabille
1870-164323-0017	train-other-500	then they are the murderers Frederic Larsan shrugged his shoulders When you can t
none	none	 arrest the real murderer 
1870-164323-0018	train-other-500	he said with an air of supreme irony you can always indulge in the luxury of discovering accomplices Did you have them arrested Monsieur Fred Not I I haven t had them arrested
none	none	 In the first place 
1870-164323-0019	train-other-500	I am pretty sure that they have not had anything to do with the affair and then because Because of what asked Rouletabille eagerly Because of nothing said Larsan shaking his head
1870-164323-0020	train-other-500	Because there were no accomplices
none	none	 said Rouletabille Aha 
1870-164323-0021	train-other-500	you have an idea then about this matter said Larsan looking at Rouletabille intently yet
none	none	 you have seen nothing young man 
1870-164323-0022	train-other-500	you have not yet gained admission here I shall get admission I doubt it The orders are strict I shall gain admission if you let me see Monsieur Robert Darzac Do that for me You know we are old friends I beg of you Monsieur Fred
none	none	 Do you remember the article I wrote about you on the gold bar case 
1870-164323-0023	train-other-500	The face of Rouletabille at the moment was really funny to look at It showed such an irresistible desire to cross the threshold beyond which some prodigious mystery had occurred it appealed with so much eloquence not only of the mouth and eyes
1870-164323-0024	train-other-500	but with all its features that I could not refrain from bursting into laughter Frederic Larsan no more than myself could retain his gravity Meanwhile standing on the other side of the gate he calmly put the key
1870-164323-0025	train-other-500	in his pocket I closely scrutinised him He might be about fifty years of age He had a fine head his hair turning grey a colourless complexion and a firm profile
1870-164323-0026	train-other-500	His forehead was prominent his chin and cheeks clean shaven His upper lip without moustache was finely chiselled His eyes were rather small and round with a look in them that was at once searching and disquieting
1870-164323-0027	train-other-500	He was of middle height and well built with a general bearing elegant and gentlemanly There was nothing about him of the vulgar policeman In his way he was an artist and one felt that he had a high opinion of himself
1870-164323-0028	train-other-500	The sceptical tone of his conversation was that of a man who had been taught by experience His strange profession had brought him into contact with so many crimes and villanies that it would have been remarkable if his nature had not been a little hardened
1870-164323-0029	train-other-500	Larsan turned his head at the sound of a vehicle which had come from the chateau and reached the gate behind him
none	none	 We recognised the cab which had conveyed the examining magistrate and his Registrar from the station at Epinay Ah said Frederic Larsan if you want to speak with Monsieur Robert Darzac 
1870-164323-0030	train-other-500	he is here The cab was already at the park gate and Robert Darzac was begging Frederic Larsan to open it for him explaining that he was pressed for time to catch the next train leaving Epinay for Paris Then he recognised me
1870-164323-0031	train-other-500	While Larsan was unlocking the gate Monsieur Darzac inquired what had brought me to the Glandier at such a tragic moment I noticed that he was frightfully pale and that his face was lined as if from the effects of some terrible suffering Is Mademoiselle getting better
1870-164323-0032	train-other-500	I immediately asked Yes he said She will be saved perhaps She must be saved He did not add or it will be my death but I felt that the phrase trembled on his pale lips
1870-164323-0033	train-other-500	Rouletabille intervened You are in a hurry Monsieur but I must speak with you I have something of the greatest importance to tell you Frederic Larsan interrupted May I leave you he asked of Robert Darzac Have you a
none	none	 key or do you wish me to give you this one 
1870-164323-0034	train-other-500	Thank you I have a key and will lock the gate Larsan hurried off in the direction of the chateau the imposing pile of which could be perceived a few hundred yards away
1870-164323-0035	train-other-500	Robert Darzac with knit brow was beginning to show impatience I presented Rouletabille as a good friend of mine but as soon as he learnt that the young man was a journalist he looked at me very reproachfully
1870-164323-0036	train-other-500	excused himself under the necessity of having to reach Epinay in twenty minutes bowed and whipped up his horse But Rouletabille had seized the bridle and to my utter astonishment stopped the carriage with a vigorous hand
1870-164323-0037	train-other-500	Then he gave utterance to a sentence which was utterly meaningless to me The presbytery has lost nothing of its charm nor the garden its brightness The words had no sooner left the lips of Rouletabille
none	none	 than I saw Robert Darzac quail 
1870-164323-0038	train-other-500	Pale as he was he became paler His eyes were fixed on the young man in terror and he immediately descended from the vehicle in an inexpressible state of agitation Come
none	none	 come in 
1870-164323-0039	train-other-500	he stammered Then suddenly and with a sort of fury he repeated Let us go monsieur He turned up by the road he had come from the chateau Rouletabille still retaining his hold on the horse s bridle
1870-164323-0040	train-other-500	I addressed a few words to Monsieur Darzac but he made no answer
none	none	 My looks questioned Rouletabille but his gaze was elsewhere CHAPTER VI In the Heart of the Oak Grove We reached the chateau and as we approached it saw four gendarmes pacing in front of a little door in the ground floor of the donjon We soon learned that in this ground floor which had formerly served as a prison Monsieur and Madame Bernier the concierges were confined Monsieur Robert Darzac led us into the modern part of the chateau by a large door protected by a projecting awning a marquise as it is called Rouletabille who had resigned the horse and the cab to the care of a servant never took his eyes off Monsieur Darzac I followed his look and perceived that it was directed solely towards the gloved hands of the Sorbonne professor When we were in a tiny sitting room fitted with old furniture Monsieur Darzac turned to Rouletabille and said sharply What do you want The reporter answered in an equally sharp tone To shake you by the hand Darzac shrank back What does that mean Evidently he understood what I also understood that my friend suspected him of the abominable attempt on the life of Mademoiselle Stangerson The impression of the blood stained hand on the walls of The Yellow Room was in his mind I looked at the man closely His haughty face with its expression ordinarily so straightforward was at this moment strangely troubled He held out his right hand and referring to me said As you are a friend of Monsieur Sainclair who has rendered me invaluable services in a just cause monsieur I see no reason for refusing you my hand Rouletabille did not take the extended hand Lying with the utmost audacity he said Monsieur I have lived several years in Russia where I have acquired the habit of never taking any but an ungloved hand I thought that the Sorbonne professor would express his anger openly but on the contrary by a visibly violent effort he calmed himself took off his gloves and showed his hands they were unmarked by any cicatrix Are you satisfied No replied Rouletabille My dear friend he said turning to me I am obliged to ask you to leave us alone for a moment I bowed and retired stupefied by what I had seen and heard I could not understand why Monsieur Robert Darzac had not already shown the door to my impertinent insulting and stupid friend I was angry myself with Rouletabille at that moment for his suspicions which had led to this scene of the gloves For some twenty minutes I walked about in front of the chateau trying vainly to link together the different events of the day What was in Rouletabille s mind Was it possible that he thought Monsieur Robert Darzac to be the murderer How could it be thought that this man who was to have married Mademoiselle Stangerson in the course of a few days had introduced himself into The Yellow Room to assassinate his fiancee I could find no explanation as to how the murderer had been able to leave The Yellow Room and so long as that mystery which appeared to me so inexplicable remained unexplained I thought it was the duty of all of us to refrain from suspecting anybody But then that seemingly senseless phrase The presbytery has lost nothing of its charm nor the garden its brightness still rang in my ears What did it mean I was eager to rejoin Rouletabille and question him At that moment the young man came out of the chateau in the company of Monsieur Robert Darzac and extraordinary to relate I saw at a glance that they were the best of friends We are going to The Yellow Room Come with us Rouletabille said to me You know my dear boy I am going to keep you with me all day We ll breakfast together somewhere about here You ll breakfast with me here gentlemen No thanks replied the young man We shall breakfast at the Donjon Inn You ll fare very badly there you ll not find anything Do you think so Well I hope to find something there replied Rouletabille After breakfast we ll set to work again I ll write my article and if you ll be so good as to take it to the office for me Won t you come back with me to Paris No I shall remain here I turned towards Rouletabille He spoke quite seriously and Monsieur Robert Darzac did not appear to be in the least degree surprised We were passing by the donjon and heard wailing voices Rouletabille asked Why have these people been arrested It is a little my fault said Monsieur Darzac I happened to remark to the examining magistrate yesterday that it was inexplicable that the concierges had had time to hear the revolver shots to dress themselves and to cover so great a distance as that which lies between their lodge and the pavilion in the space of two minutes for not more than that interval of time had elapsed after the firing of the shots when they were met by Daddy Jacques That was suspicious evidently acquiesced Rouletabille And were they dressed That is what is so incredible they were dressed completely not one part of their costume wanting The woman wore sabots but the man had on laced boots Now they assert that they went to bed at half past nine On arriving this morning the examining magistrate brought with him from Paris a revolver of the same calibre as that found in the room for he couldn t use the one held for evidence and made his Registrar fire two shots in The Yellow Room while the doors and windows were closed We were with him in the lodge of the concierges and yet we heard nothing not a sound The concierges have lied of that there can be no doubt They must have been already waiting not far from the pavilion waiting for something Certainly they are not to be accused of being the authors of the crime but their complicity is not improbable That was why Monsieur de Marquet had them arrested at once If they had been accomplices said Rouletabille they would not have been there at all When people throw themselves into the arms of justice with the proofs of complicity on them you can be sure they are not accomplices I don t believe there are any accomplices in this affair Then why were they abroad at midnight Why don t they say They have certainly some reason for their silence What that reason is has to be found out for even if they are not accomplices it may be of importance Everything that took place on such a night is important We had crossed an old bridge thrown over the Douve and were entering the part of the park called the Oak Grove The oaks here were centuries old Autumn had already shrivelled their tawny leaves and their high branches black and contorted looked like horrid heads of hair mingled with quaint reptiles such as the ancient sculptors have made on the head of Medusa This place which Mademoiselle found cheerful and in which she lived in the summer season appeared to us as sad and funereal now The soil was black and muddy from the recent rains and the rotting of the fallen leaves the trunks of the trees were black and the sky above us was now as if in mourning charged with great heavy clouds And it was in this sombre and desolate retreat that we saw the white walls of the pavilion as we approached A queer looking building without a window visible on the side by which we neared it A little door alone marked the entrance to it It might have passed for a tomb a vast mausoleum in the midst of a thick forest As we came nearer we were able to make out its disposition The building obtained all the light it needed from the south that is to say from the open country The little door closed on the park Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson must have found it an ideal seclusion for their work and their dreams ditch enclosing wall one d bed i PARK t four c five two h oo oo Traces oo of oo oo oo Footsteps three six ditch door enclosing wall Here is the ground plan of the pavilion It had a ground floor which was reached by a few steps and above it was an attic with which we need not concern ourselves The plan of the ground floor only sketched roughly is what I here submit to the reader one The Yellow Room with its one window and its one door opening into the laboratory two Laboratory with its two large barred windows and its doors one serving for the vestibule the other for The Yellow Room three Vestibule with its unbarred window and door opening into the park four Lavatory five Stairs leading to the attic six Large and the only chimney in the pavilion serving for the experiments of the laboratory The plan was drawn by Rouletabille and I assured myself that there was not a line in it that was wanting to help to the solution of the problem then set before the police With the lines of this plan and the description of its parts before them my readers will know as much as Rouletabille knew when he entered the pavilion for the first time With him they may now ask How did the murderer escape from The Yellow Room Before mounting the three steps leading up to the door of the pavilion Rouletabille stopped and asked Monsieur Darzac point blank What was the motive for the crime Speaking for myself Monsieur there can be no doubt on the matter said Mademoiselle Stangerson s fiance greatly distressed The nails of the fingers the deep scratches on the chest and throat of Mademoiselle Stangerson show that the wretch who attacked her attempted to commit a frightful crime The medical experts who examined these traces yesterday affirm that they were made by the same hand as that which left its red imprint on the wall an enormous hand Monsieur much too large to go into my gloves he added with an indefinable smile Could not that blood stained hand I interrupted have been the hand of Mademoiselle Stangerson who in the moment of falling had pressed it against the wall and in slipping enlarged the impression There was not a drop of blood on either of her hands when she was lifted up replied Monsieur Darzac We are now sure said I that it was Mademoiselle Stangerson who was armed with Daddy Jacques s revolver since she wounded the hand of the murderer She was in fear then of somebody or something Probably Do you suspect anybody
3008_164327_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 No replied Monsieur Darzac 
none	none	looking at Rouletabille Rouletabille then said to me You must know my friend that the inquiry is a little more advanced than Monsieur de Marquet has chosen to tell us He not only knows that Mademoiselle Stangerson defended herself with the revolver but he knows what the weapon was that was used to attack her Monsieur Darzac tells me it was a mutton bone Why is Monsieur de Marquet surrounding this mutton bone with so much mystery No doubt for the purpose of facilitating the inquiries of the agents of the Surete He imagines perhaps that the owner of this instrument of crime the most terrible invented is going to be found amongst those who are well known in the slums of Paris who use it But who can ever say what passes through the brain of an examining magistrate Rouletabille added with contemptuous irony Has a mutton bone been found in The Yellow Room I asked him Yes Monsieur said Robert Darzac at the foot of the bed but I beg of you not to say anything about it I made a gesture of assent It was an enormous mutton bone the top of which or rather the joint was still red with the blood of the frightful wound It was an old bone which may according to appearances have served in other crimes That s what Monsieur de Marquet thinks He has had it sent to the municipal laboratory at Paris to be analysed In fact he thinks he has detected on it not only the blood of the last victim but other stains of dried blood evidences of previous crimes A mutton bone in the hand of a skilled assassin is a frightful weapon said Rouletabille a more certain weapon than a heavy hammer The scoundrel has proved it to be so said Monsieur Robert Darzac sadly The joint of the bone found exactly fits the wound inflicted My belief is that the wound would have been mortal if the murderer s blow had not been arrested in the act by Mademoiselle Stangerson s revolver Wounded in the hand he dropped the mutton bone and fled Unfortunately the blow had been already given and Mademoiselle was stunned after having been nearly strangled If she had succeeded in wounding the man with the first shot of the revolver she would doubtless have escaped the blow with the bone But she had certainly employed her revolver too late the first shot deviated and lodged in the ceiling it was the second only that took effect Having said this Monsieur Darzac knocked at the door of the pavilion I must confess to feeling a strong impatience to reach the spot where the crime had been committed It was some time before the door was opened by a man whom I at once recognised as Daddy Jacques He appeared to be well over sixty years of age He had a long white beard and white hair on which he wore a flat Basque cap He was dressed in a complete suit of chestnut coloured velveteen worn at the sides sabots were on his feet He had rather a waspish looking face the expression of which lightened however as soon as he saw Monsieur Darzac Friends said our guide Nobody in the pavilion Daddy Jacques I ought not to allow anybody to enter Monsieur Robert but of course the order does not apply to you These gentlemen of justice have seen everything there is to be seen and made enough drawings and drawn up enough reports Excuse me Monsieur Jacques one question before anything else said Rouletabille What is it young man If I can answer it Did your mistress wear her hair in bands that evening You know what I mean over her forehead No young man My mistress never wore her hair in the way you suggest neither on that day nor on any other She had her hair drawn up as usual so that her beautiful forehead could be seen pure as that of an unborn child Rouletabille grunted and set to work examining the door finding that it fastened itself automatically He satisfied himself that it could never remain open and needed a key to open it Then we entered the vestibule a small well lit room paved with square red tiles Ah This is the window by which the murderer escaped said Rouletabille So they keep on saying monsieur so they keep on saying But if he had gone off that way we should have been sure to have seen him We are not blind neither Monsieur Stangerson nor me nor the concierges who are in prison Why have they not put me in prison too on account of my revolver Rouletabille had already opened the window and was examining the shutters Were these closed at the time of the crime And fastened with the iron catch inside said Daddy Jacques and I am quite sure that the murderer did not get out that way Are there any blood stains Yes on the stones outside but blood of what Ah said Rouletabille there are footmarks visible on the path the ground was very moist I will look into that presently Nonsense interrupted Daddy Jacques the murderer did not go that way Which way did he go then How do I know Rouletabille looked at everything smelled everything He went down on his knees and rapidly examined every one of the paving tiles Daddy Jacques went on Ah you can t find anything monsieur Nothing has been found And now it is all dirty too many persons have tramped over it They wouldn t let me wash it but on the day of the crime I had washed the floor thoroughly and if the murderer had crossed it with his hobnailed boots I should not have failed to see where he had been he has left marks enough in Mademoiselle s chamber Rouletabille rose When was the last time you washed these tiles he asked and he fixed on Daddy Jacques a most searching look Why as I told you on the day of the crime towards half past five while Mademoiselle and her father were taking a little walk before dinner here in this room they had dined in the laboratory The next day the examining magistrate came and saw all the marks there were on the floor as plainly as if they had been made with ink on white paper Well neither in the laboratory nor in the vestibule which were both as clean as a new pin were there any traces of a man s footmarks Since they have been found near this window outside he must have made his way through the ceiling of The Yellow Room into the attic then cut his way through the roof and dropped to the ground outside the vestibule window But there s no hole neither in the ceiling of The Yellow Room nor in the roof of my attic that s absolutely certain So you see we know nothing nothing And nothing will ever be known It s a mystery of the Devil s own making Rouletabille went down upon his knees again almost in front of a small lavatory at the back of the vestibule In that position he remained for about a minute Well I asked him when he got up Oh nothing very important a drop of blood he replied turning towards Daddy Jacques as he spoke While you were washing the laboratory and this vestibule was the vestibule window open he asked No Monsieur it was closed but after I had done washing the floor I lit some charcoal for Monsieur in the laboratory furnace and as I lit it with old newspapers it smoked so I opened both the windows in the laboratory and this one to make a current of air then I shut those in the laboratory and left this one open when I went out When I returned to the pavilion this window had been closed and Monsieur and Mademoiselle were already at work in the laboratory Monsieur or Mademoiselle Stangerson had no doubt shut it No doubt You did not ask them After a close scrutiny of the little lavatory and of the staircase leading up to the attic Rouletabille to whom we seemed no longer to exist entered the laboratory I followed him It was I confess in a state of great excitement Robert Darzac lost none of my friend s movements As for me my eyes were drawn at once to the door of The Yellow Room It was closed and as I immediately saw partially shattered and out of commission My friend who went about his work methodically silently studied the room in which we were It was large and well lighted Two big windows almost bays were protected by strong iron bars and looked out upon a wide extent of country Through an opening in the forest they commanded a wonderful view through the length of the valley and across the plain to the large town which could be clearly seen in fair weather To day however a mist hung over the ground and blood in that room The whole of one side of the laboratory was taken up with a large chimney crucibles ovens and such implements as are needed for chemical experiments tables loaded with phials papers reports an electrical machine an apparatus as Monsieur Darzac informed me employed by Professor Stangerson to demonstrate the Dissociation of Matter under the action of solar light and other scientific implements Along the walls were cabinets plain or glass fronted through which were visible microscopes special photographic apparatus and a large quantity of crystals Rouletabille who was ferreting in the chimney put his fingers into one of the crucibles Suddenly he drew himself up and held up a piece of half consumed paper in his hand He stepped up to where we were talking by one of the windows Keep that for us Monsieur Darzac he said I bent over the piece of scorched paper which Monsieur Darzac took from the hand of Rouletabille and read distinctly the only words that remained legible Presbytery lost nothing charm nor the gar its brightness Twice since the morning these same meaningless words had struck me and for the second time I saw that they produced on the Sorbonne professor the same paralysing effect Monsieur Darzac s first anxiety showed itself when he turned his eyes in the direction of Daddy Jacques But occupied as he was at another window he had seen nothing Then tremblingly opening his pocket book he put the piece of paper into it sighing My God During this time Rouletabille had mounted into the opening of the fire grate that is to say he had got upon the bricks of a furnace and was attentively examining the chimney which grew narrower towards the top the outlet from it being closed with sheets of iron fastened into the brickwork through which passed three small chimneys Impossible to get out that way he said jumping back into the laboratory Besides even if he had tried to do it he would have brought all that ironwork down to the ground No no it is not on that side we have to search Rouletabille next examined the furniture and opened the doors of the cabinet Then he came to the windows through which he declared no one could possibly have passed At the second window he found Daddy Jacques in contemplation Well Daddy Jacques he said what are you looking at That policeman who is always going round and round the lake Another of those fellows who think they can see better than anybody else You don t know Frederic Larsan Daddy Jacques or you wouldn t speak of him in that way said Rouletabille in a melancholy tone If there is anyone who will find the murderer it will be he And Rouletabille heaved a deep sigh Before they find him they will have to learn how they lost him said Daddy Jacques stolidly At length we reached the door of The Yellow Room itself There is the door behind which some terrible scene took place said Rouletabille with a solemnity which under any other circumstances would have been comical CHAPTER VII In Which Rouletabille Sets Out on an Expedition Under the Bed Rouletabille having pushed open the door of The Yellow Room paused on the threshold saying with an emotion which I only later understood Ah the perfume of the lady in black The chamber was dark Daddy Jacques was about to open the blinds when Rouletabille stopped him Did not the tragedy take place in complete darkness he asked No young man I don t think so Mademoiselle always had a nightlight on her table and I lit it every evening before she went to bed I was a sort of chambermaid you must understand when the evening came The real chambermaid did not come here much before the morning Mademoiselle worked late far into the night Where did the table with the night light stand far from the bed Some way from the bed Can you light the burner now The lamp is broken and the oil that was in it was spilled when the table was upset All the rest of the things in the room remain just as they were I have only to open the blinds for you to see Wait Rouletabille went back into the laboratory closed the shutters of the two windows and the door of the vestibule When we were in complete darkness he lit a wax vesta and asked Daddy Jacques to move to the middle of the chamber with it to the place where the night light was burning that night Daddy Jacques who was in his stockings he usually left his sabots in the vestibule entered The Yellow Room with his bit of a vesta We vaguely distinguished objects overthrown on the floor a bed in one corner and in front of us to the left the gleam of a looking glass hanging on the wall near to the bed That will do you may now open the blinds said Rouletabille Don t come any further Daddy Jacques begged you may make marks with your boots and nothing must be deranged it s an idea of the magistrate s though he has nothing more to do here And he pushed open the shutter The pale daylight entered from without throwing a sinister light on the saffron coloured walls The floor for though the laboratory and the vestibule were tiled The Yellow Room had a flooring of wood was covered with a single yellow mat which was large enough to cover nearly the whole room under the bed and under the dressing table the only piece of furniture that remained upright The centre round table the night table and two chairs had been overturned These did not prevent a large stain of blood being visible on the mat made as Daddy Jacques informed us by the blood which had flowed from the wound on Mademoiselle Stangerson s forehead Besides these stains drops of blood had fallen in all directions in line with the visible traces of the footsteps large and black of the murderer Everything led to the presumption that these drops of blood had fallen from the wound of the man who had for a moment placed his red hand on the wall There were other traces of the same hand on the wall but much less distinct See see this blood on the wall I could not help exclaiming The man who pressed his hand so heavily upon it in the darkness must certainly have thought that he was pushing at a door That s why he pressed on it so hard leaving on the yellow paper the terrible evidence I don t think there are many hands in the world of that sort It is big and strong and the fingers are nearly all one as long as the other The thumb is wanting and we have only the mark of the palm but if we follow the trace of the hand I continued we see that after leaving its imprint on the wall the touch sought the door found it and then felt for the lock No doubt interrupted Rouletabille chuckling only there is no blood either on the lock or on the bolt What does that prove I rejoined with a good sense of which I was proud he might have opened the lock with his left hand which would have been quite natural his right hand being wounded He didn t open it at all Daddy Jacques again exclaimed We are not fools and there were four of us when we burst open the door What a queer hand Look what a queer hand it is I said It is a very natural hand said Rouletabille of which the shape has been deformed by its having slipped on the wall The man dried his hand on the wall He must be a man about five feet eight in height How do you come at that By the height of the marks on the wall My friend next occupied himself with the mark of the bullet in the wall It was a round hole This ball was fired straight not from above and consequently not from below Rouletabille went back to the door and carefully examined the lock and the bolt satisfying himself that the door had certainly been burst open from the outside and further that the key had been found in the lock on the inside of the chamber He finally satisfied himself that with the key in the lock the door could not possibly be opened from without with another key Having made sure of all these details he let fall these words That s better Then sitting down on the ground he hastily took off his boots and in his socks went into the room The first thing he did was to examine minutely the overturned furniture We watched him in silence Young fellow you are giving yourself a great deal of trouble said Daddy Jacques ironically Rouletabille raised his head and said You have spoken the simple truth Daddy Jacques your mistress did not have her hair in bands that evening I was a donkey to have believed she did Then with the suppleness of a serpent he slipped under the bed Presently we heard him ask At what time Monsieur Jacques did Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson arrive at the laboratory At six o clock The voice of Rouletabille continued Yes he s been under here that s certain in fact there was no where else where he could have hidden himself Here too are the marks of his hobnails When you entered all four of you did you look under the bed At once we drew it right out of its place And between the mattresses There was only one on the bed and on that Mademoiselle was placed and Monsieur Stangerson and the concierge immediately carried it into the laboratory Under the mattress there was nothing but the metal netting which could not conceal anything or anybody Remember monsieur that there were four of us and we couldn t fail to see everything the chamber is so small and scantily furnished and all was locked behind in the pavilion I ventured on a hypothesis Perhaps he got away with the mattress in the mattress Anything is possible in the face of such a mystery In their distress of mind Monsieur Stangerson and the concierge may not have noticed they were bearing a double weight especially if the concierge were an accomplice I throw out this hypothesis for what it is worth but it explains many things and particularly the fact that neither the laboratory nor the vestibule bear any traces of the footmarks found in the room If in carrying Mademoiselle on the mattress from the laboratory of the chateau they rested for a moment there might have been an opportunity for the man in it to escape And then asked Rouletabille deliberately laughing under the bed I felt rather vexed and replied I don t know but anything appears possible The examining magistrate had the same idea monsieur said Daddy Jacques and he carefully examined the mattress He was obliged to laugh at the idea monsieur as your friend is doing now for whoever heard of a mattress having a double bottom I was myself obliged to laugh on seeing that what I had said was absurd but in an affair like this one hardly knows where an absurdity begins or ends My friend alone seemed able to talk intelligently He called out from under the bed The mat here has been moved out of place who did it We did monsieur explained Daddy Jacques When we could not find the assassin we asked ourselves whether there was not some hole in the floor
3008_164327_000053_000001	train-clean-360	 There is not 
none	none	replied Rouletabille Is there a cellar No there s no cellar But that has not stopped our searching and has not prevented the examining magistrate and his Registrar from studying the floor plank by plank as if there had been a cellar under it The reporter then reappeared His eyes were sparkling and his nostrils quivered He remained on his hands and knees He could not be better likened than to an admirable sporting dog on the scent of some unusual game And indeed he was scenting the steps of a man the man whom he has sworn to report to his master the manager of the Epoque It must not be forgotten that Rouletabille was first and last a journalist Thus on his hands and knees he made his way to the four corners of the room so to speak sniffing and going round everything everything that we could see which was not much and everything that we could not see which must have been infinite The toilette table was a simple table standing on four legs there was nothing about it by which it could possibly be changed into a temporary hiding place There was not a closet or cupboard Mademoiselle Stangerson kept her wardrobe at the chateau Rouletabille literally passed his nose and hands along the walls constructed of solid brickwork When he had finished with the walls and passed his agile fingers over every portion of the yellow paper covering them he reached to the ceiling which he was able to touch by mounting on a chair placed on the toilette table and by moving this ingeniously constructed stage from place to place he examined every foot of it When he had finished his scrutiny of the ceiling where he carefully examined the hole made by the second bullet he approached the window and once more examined the iron bars and blinds all of which were solid and intact At last he gave a grunt of satisfaction and declared Now I am at ease Well do you believe that the poor dear young lady was shut up when she was being murdered when she cried out for help wailed Daddy Jacques Yes said the young reporter drying his forehead The Yellow Room was as tightly shut as an iron safe That I said is why this mystery is the most surprising I know Edgar Allan Poe in The Murders in the Rue Morgue invented nothing like it The place of that crime was sufficiently closed to prevent the escape of a man but there was that window through which the monkey the perpetrator of the murder could slip away But here there can be no question of an opening of any sort The door was fastened and through the window blinds secure as they were not even a fly could enter or get out True true assented Rouletabille as he kept on drying his forehead which seemed to be perspiring less from his recent bodily exertion than from his mental agitation Indeed it s a great a beautiful and a very curious mystery The Bete du bon Dieu muttered Daddy Jacques the Bete du bon Dieu herself if she had committed the crime could not have escaped Listen Do you hear it Hush Daddy Jacques made us a sign to keep quiet and stretching his arm towards the wall nearest the forest listened to something which we could not hear It s answering he said at length I must kill it It is too wicked but it s the Bete du bon Dieu and every night it goes to pray on the tomb of Sainte Genevieve and nobody dares to touch her for fear that Mother Angenoux should cast an evil spell on them How big is the Bete du bon Dieu Nearly as big as a small retriever a monster I tell you Ah I have asked myself more than once whether it was not her that took our poor Mademoiselle by the throat with her claws But the Bete du bon Dieu does not wear hobnailed boots nor fire revolvers nor has she a hand like that exclaimed Daddy Jacques again pointing out to us the red mark on the wall Besides we should have seen her as well as we would have seen a man Evidently I said Before we had seen this Yellow Room I had also asked myself whether the cat of Mother Angenoux You also cried Rouletabille Didn t you I asked Not for a moment After reading the article in the Matin I knew that a cat had nothing to do with the matter But I swear now that a frightful tragedy has been enacted here You say nothing about the Basque cap or the handkerchief found here Daddy Jacques Of course the magistrate has taken them the old man answered hesitatingly I haven t seen either the handkerchief or the cap yet I can tell you how they are made the reporter said to him gravely Oh you are very clever said Daddy Jacques coughing and embarrassed The handkerchief is a large one blue with red stripes and the cap is an old Basque cap like the one you are wearing now You are a wizard said Daddy Jacques trying to laugh and not quite succeeding How do you know that the handkerchief is blue with red stripes Because if it had not been blue with red stripes it would not have been found at all Without giving any further attention to Daddy Jacques my friend took a piece of paper from his pocket and taking out a pair of scissors bent over the footprints Placing the paper over one of them he began to cut In a short time he had made a perfect pattern which he handed to me begging me not to lose it He then returned to the window and pointing to the figure of Frederic Larsan who had not quitted the side of the lake asked Daddy Jacques whether the detective had like himself been working in The Yellow Room No replied Robert Darzac who since Rouletabille had handed him the piece of scorched paper had not uttered a word He pretends that he does not need to examine The Yellow Room He says that the murderer made his escape from it in quite a natural way and that he will this evening explain how he did it As he listened to what Monsieur Darzac had to say Rouletabille turned pale Has Frederic Larsan found out the truth which I can only guess at he murmured He is very clever very clever and I admire him But what we have to do to day is something more than the work of a policeman something quite different from the teachings of experience We have to take hold of our reason by the right end The reporter rushed into the open air agitated by the thought that the great and famous Fred might anticipate him in the solution of the problem of The Yellow Room I managed to reach him on the threshold of the pavilion Calm yourself my dear fellow I said Aren t you satisfied Yes he confessed to me with a deep sigh I am quite satisfied I have discovered many things Moral or material Several moral one material This for example And rapidly he drew from his waistcoat pocket a piece of paper in which he had placed a light coloured hair from a woman s head CHAPTER VIII The Examining Magistrate Questions Mademoiselle Stangerson Two minutes later as Rouletabille was bending over the footprints discovered in the park under the window of the vestibule a man evidently a servant at the chateau came towards us rapidly and called out to Monsieur Darzac then coming out of the pavilion Monsieur Robert the magistrate you know is questioning Mademoiselle Monsieur Darzac uttered a muttered excuse to us and set off running towards the chateau the man running after him If the corpse can speak I said it would be interesting to be there We must know said my friend Let s go to the chateau And he drew me with him But at the chateau a gendarme placed in the vestibule denied us admission up the staircase of the first floor We were obliged to wait down stairs This is what passed in the chamber of the victim while we were waiting below The family doctor finding that Mademoiselle Stangerson was much better but fearing a relapse which would no longer permit of her being questioned had thought it his duty to inform the examining magistrate of this who decided to proceed immediately with a brief examination At this examination the Registrar Monsieur Stangerson and the doctor were present Later I obtained the text of the report of the examination and I give it here in all its legal dryness Question Are you able mademoiselle without too much fatiguing yourself to give some necessary details of the frightful attack of which you have been the victim Answer I feel much better monsieur and I will tell you all I know When I entered my chamber I did not notice anything unusual there Q Excuse me mademoiselle if you will allow me I will ask you some questions and you will answer them That will fatigue you less than making a long recital A Do so monsieur Q What did you do on that day I want you to be as minute and precise as possible I wish to know all you did that day if it is not asking too much of you A I rose late at ten o clock for my father and I had returned home late on the night previously having been to dinner at the reception given by the President of the Republic in honour of the Academy of Science of Philadelphia When I left my chamber at half past ten my father was already at work in the laboratory We worked together till midday We then took half an hour s walk in the park as we were accustomed to do before breakfasting at the chateau After breakfast we took another walk for half an hour and then returned to the laboratory There we found my chambermaid who had come to set my room in order I went into The Yellow Room to give her some slight orders and she directly afterwards left the pavilion and I resumed my work with my father At five o clock we again went for a walk in the park and afterward had tea Q Before leaving the pavilion at five o clock did you go into your chamber A No monsieur my father went into it at my request to bring me my hat Q And he found nothing suspicious there A Evidently no monsieur Q It is then almost certain that the murderer was not yet concealed under the bed When you went out was the door of the room locked A No there was no reason for locking it Q You were absent from the pavilion some length of time Monsieur Stangerson and you A About an hour Q It was during that hour no doubt that the murderer got into the pavilion But how Nobody knows Footmarks have been found in the park leading away from the window of the vestibule but none has been found going towards it Did you notice whether the vestibule window was open when you went out A I don t remember Monsieur Stangerson It was closed Q And when you returned Mademoiselle Stangerson I did not notice M Stangerson It was still closed I remember remarking aloud Daddy Jacques must surely have opened it while we were away Q Strange Do you recollect Monsieur Stangerson if during your absence and before going out he had opened it You returned to the laboratory at six o clock and resumed work Mademoiselle Stangerson Yes monsieur Q And you did not leave the laboratory from that hour up to the moment when you entered your chamber M Stangerson Neither my daughter nor I monsieur We were engaged on work that was pressing and we lost not a moment neglecting everything else on that account Q Did you dine in the laboratory A For that reason Q Are you accustomed to dine in the laboratory A We rarely dine there Q Could the murderer have known that you would dine there that evening M Stangerson Good Heavens I think not It was only when we returned to the pavilion at six o clock that we decided my daughter and I to dine there At that moment I was spoken to by my gamekeeper who detained me a moment to ask me to accompany him on an urgent tour of inspection in a part of the woods which I had decided to thin I put this off until the next day and begged him as he was going by the chateau to tell the steward that we should dine in the laboratory He left me to execute the errand and I rejoined my daughter who was already at work Q At what hour mademoiselle did you go to your chamber while your father continued to work there A At midnight Q Did Daddy Jacques enter The Yellow Room in the course of the evening A To shut the blinds and light the night light Q He saw nothing suspicious A He would have told us if he had seen Daddy Jacques is an honest man and very attached to me Q You affirm Monsieur Stangerson that Daddy Jacques remained with you all the time you were in the laboratory M Stangerson I am sure of it I have no doubt of that Q When you entered your chamber mademoiselle you immediately shut the door and locked and bolted it That was taking unusual precautions knowing that your father and your servant were there Were you in fear of something then A My father would be returning to the chateau and Daddy Jacques would be going to his bed And in fact I did fear something Q You were so much in fear of something that you borrowed Daddy Jacques s revolver without telling him you had done so A That is true I did not wish to alarm anybody the more because my fears might have proved to have been foolish Q What was it you feared A I hardly know how to tell you For several nights I seemed to hear both in the park and out of the park round the pavilion unusual sounds sometimes footsteps at other times the cracking of branches The night before the attack on me when I did not get to bed before three o clock in the morning on our return from the Elysee I stood for a moment before my window and I felt sure I saw shadows Q How many A Two They moved round the lake then the moon became clouded and I lost sight of them At this time of the season every year I have generally returned to my apartment in the chateau for the winter but this year I said to myself that I would not quit the pavilion before my father had finished the resume of his works on the Dissociation of Matter for the Academy I did not wish that that important work which was to have been finished in the course of a few days should be delayed by a change in our daily habit You can well understand that I did not wish to speak of my childish fears to my father nor did I say anything to Daddy Jacques who I knew would not have been able to hold his tongue Knowing that he had a revolver in his room I took advantage of his absence and borrowed it placing it in the drawer of my night table Q You know of no enemies you have A None Q You understand mademoiselle that these precautions are calculated to cause surprise M Stangerson Evidently my child such precautions are very surprising A No because I have told you that I had been uneasy for two nights M Stangerson You ought to have told me of that This misfortune would have been avoided Q The door of The Yellow Room locked did you go to bed A Yes and being very tired I at once went to sleep Q The night light was still burning A Yes but it gave a very feeble light Q Then mademoiselle tell us what happened A I do not know whether I had been long asleep but suddenly I awoke and uttered a loud cry M Stangerson Yes a horrible cry Murder It still rings in my ears Q You uttered a loud cry A A man was in my chamber He sprang at me and tried to strangle me I was nearly stifled when suddenly I was able to reach the drawer of my night table and grasp the revolver which I had placed in it At that moment the man had forced me to the foot of my bed and brandished in over my head a sort of mace But I had fired He immediately struck a terrible blow at my head All that monsieur passed more rapidly than I can tell it and I know nothing more Q Nothing Have you no idea as to how the assassin could escape from your chamber A None whatever I know nothing more One does not know what is passing around one when one is unconscious Q Was the man you saw tall or short little or big A I only saw a shadow which appeared to me formidable Q You cannot give us any indication A I know nothing more monsieur than that a man threw himself upon me and that I fired at him I know nothing more Here the interrogation of Mademoiselle Stangerson concluded Rouletabille waited patiently for Monsieur Robert Darzac who soon appeared From a room near the chamber of Mademoiselle Stangerson he had heard the interrogatory and now came to recount it to my friend with great exactitude aided by an excellent memory His docility still surprised me Thanks to hasty pencil notes he was able to reproduce almost textually the questions and the answers given It looked as if Monsieur Darzac were being employed as the secretary of my young friend and acted as if he could refuse him nothing nay more as if under a compulsion to do so The fact of the closed window struck the reporter as it had struck the magistrate Rouletabille asked Darzac to repeat once more Mademoiselle Stangerson s account of how she and her father had spent their time on the day of the tragedy as she had stated it to the magistrate The circumstance of the dinner in the laboratory seemed to interest him in the highest degree and he had it repeated to him three times He also wanted to be sure that the forest keeper knew that the professor and his daughter were going to dine in the laboratory and how he had come to know it When Monsieur Darzac had finished I said The examination has not advanced the problem much It has put it back said Monsieur Darzac It has thrown light upon it said Rouletabille thoughtfully

3008_164327_000006_000000	train-clean-360	The three of us went back towards the pavilion 
none	none	At some distance from the building the reporter made us stop and pointing to a small clump of trees to the right of us said
3008_164327_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 That s where the murderer came from to get into the pavilion 
none	none	As there were other patches of trees of the same sort between the great oaks I asked why the murderer had chosen that one rather than any of the others Rouletabille answered me by pointing to the path which ran quite close to the thicket to the door of the pavilion
3008_164327_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 That path is as you see topped with gravel he said the man must have passed along it going to the pavilion since no traces of his steps have been found on the soft ground 
3008_164327_000009_000001	train-clean-360	The man didn t have wings he walked but he walked on the gravel which left no impression of his tread 
none	none	The gravel has in fact been trodden by many other feet since the path is the most direct way between the pavilion and the chateau As to the thicket made of the sort of shrubs that don t flourish in the rough season laurels and fuchsias it offered the murderer a sufficient hiding place until it was time for him to make his way to the pavilion It was while hiding in that clump of trees that he saw Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson and then Daddy Jacques leave the pavilion Gravel has been spread nearly very nearly up to the windows of the pavilion The footprints of a man parallel with the wall marks which we will examine presently and which I have already seen prove that he only needed to make one stride to find himself in front of the vestibule window left open by Daddy Jacques The man drew himself up by his hands and entered the vestibule

3008_164327_000012_000000	train-clean-360	I begged of him not to be angry but he was too much irritated to listen to me and declared ironically that he admired the prudent doubt with which certain people approached the most simple problems risking nothing by saying that is so or that is not so Their intelligence would have produced about the same result if nature had forgotten to furnish their brain pan with a little grey matter 
3008_164327_000012_000001	train-clean-360	As I appeared vexed my young friend took me by the arm and admitted that he had not meant that for me he thought more of me than that 
3008_164327_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 If I did not reason as I do in regard to this gravel he went on I should have to assume a balloon My dear fellow the science of the aerostation of dirigible balloons is not yet developed enough for me to consider it and suppose that a murderer would drop from the clouds 
3008_164327_000013_000001	train-clean-360	So don t say a thing is possible when it could not be otherwise 
none	none	We know now how the man entered by the window and we also know the moment at which he entered during the five o clock walk of the professor and his daughter 
3008_164327_000013_000003	train-clean-360	The fact of the presence of the chambermaid who had come to clean up The Yellow Room in the laboratory when Monsieur Stangerson and his daughter returned from their walk at half past one permits us to affirm that at half past one the murderer was not in the chamber under the bed unless he was in collusion with the chambermaid 
3008_164327_000013_000004	train-clean-360	What do you say Monsieur Darzac 
3008_164327_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Monsieur Darzac shook his head and said he was sure of the chambermaid s fidelity and that she was a thoroughly honest and devoted servant 
3008_164327_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Besides he added at five o clock Monsieur Stangerson went into the room to fetch his daughter s hat 
none	none	There is that also said Rouletabille That the man entered by the window at the time you say I admit I said but why did he shut the window 
3008_164327_000017_000001	train-clean-360	It was an act which would necessarily draw the attention of those who had left it open 
none	none	It may be the window was not shut at once replied the young reporter But if he did shut the window it was because of the bend in the gravel path a dozen yards from the pavilion and on account of the three oaks that are growing at that spot What do you mean by that asked Monsieur Darzac who had followed us and listened with almost breathless attention to all that Rouletabille had said I ll explain all to you later on Monsieur when I think the moment to be ripe for doing so but I don t think I have anything of more importance to say on this affair if my hypothesis is justified
3008_164327_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 And what is your hypothesis 
3008_164327_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 You will never know if it does not turn out to be the truth 
none	none	It is of much too grave a nature to speak of it so long as it continues to be only a hypothesis Have you at least some idea as to who the murderer is No monsieur I don t know who the murderer is but don t be afraid Monsieur Robert Darzac I shall know 
3008_164327_000025_000000	train-clean-360	I could not but observe that Monsieur Darzac was deeply moved and I suspected that Rouletabille s confident assertion was not pleasing to him 
none	none	Why I asked myself if he was really afraid that the murderer should be discovered was he helping the reporter to find him My young friend seemed to have received the same impression for he said bluntly Monsieur Darzac don t you want me to find out who the murderer was Oh I should like to kill him with my own hand cried Mademoiselle Stangerson s fiance with a vehemence that amazed me I believe you said Rouletabille gravely but you have not answered my question 
3008_164327_000029_000000	train-clean-360	We were passing by the thicket of which the young reporter had spoken to us a minute before 
none	none	I entered it and pointed out evident traces of a man who had been hidden there Rouletabille once more was right Yes yes he said We have to do with a thing of flesh and blood who uses the same means that we do It ll all come out on those lines 
3008_164327_000031_000000	train-clean-360	Having said this he asked me for the paper pattern of the footprint which he had given me to take care of and applied it to a very clear footmark behind the thicket 
3008_164327_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 Aha he said rising 
none	none	I thought he was now going to trace back the track of the murderer s footmarks to the vestibule window but he led us instead far to the left saying that it was useless ferreting in the mud and that he was sure now of the road taken by the murderer He went along the wall to the hedge and dry ditch over which he jumped 
3008_164327_000033_000001	train-clean-360	See just in front of the little path leading to the lake that was his nearest way to get out 
none	none	How do you know he went to the lake Because Frederic Larsan has not quitted the borders of it since this morning 
3008_164327_000035_000001	train-clean-360	There must be some important marks there 
3008_164327_000036_000000	train-clean-360	A few minutes later we reached the lake 
none	none	It was a little sheet of marshy water surrounded by reeds on which floated some dead water lily leaves 
3008_164327_000037_000001	train-clean-360	The great Fred may have seen us approaching but we probably interested him very little for he took hardly any notice of us and continued to be stirring with his cane something which we could not see 
none	none	Look said Rouletabille here again are the footmarks of the escaping man they skirt the lake here and finally disappear just before this path which leads to the high road to Epinay 
3008_164327_000038_000001	train-clean-360	The man continued his flight to Paris 
3008_164327_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 What makes you think that I asked since these footmarks are not continued on the path 
3008_164327_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 What makes me think that Why these footprints which I expected to find he cried pointing to the sharply outlined imprint of a neat boot 
3008_164327_000040_000001	train-clean-360	 See and he called to Frederic Larsan 
3008_164327_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Monsieur Fred these neat footprints seem to have been made since the discovery of the crime 
none	none	Yes young man yes they have been carefully made replied Fred without raising his head
3008_164327_000042_000001	train-clean-360	 You see there are steps that come and steps that go back 
3008_164327_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 And the man had a bicycle cried the reporter 
3008_164327_000044_000000	train-clean-360	Here after looking at the marks of the bicycle which followed going and coming the neat footprints I thought I might intervene 
3008_164327_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 The bicycle explains the disappearance of the murderer s big foot prints I said 
3008_164327_000045_000001	train-clean-360	 The murderer with his rough boots mounted a bicycle 
3008_164327_000045_000002	train-clean-360	His accomplice the wearer of the neat boots had come to wait for him on the edge of the lake with the bicycle 
3008_164327_000045_000003	train-clean-360	It might be supposed that the murderer was working for the other 
none	none	No no replied Rouletabille with a strange smile
3008_164327_000046_000001	train-clean-360	 I have expected to find these footmarks from the very beginning 
3008_164327_000046_000002	train-clean-360	These are not the footmarks of the murderer 
3008_164327_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Then there were two 
none	none	No there was but one and he had no accomplice
3008_164327_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 Very good Very good cried Frederic Larsan 
none	none	Look continued the young reporter showing us the ground where it had been disturbed by big and heavy heels the man seated himself there and took off his hobnailed boots which he had worn only for the purpose of misleading detection and then no doubt taking them away with him he stood up in his own boots and quietly and slowly regained the high road holding his bicycle in his hand for he could not venture to ride it on this rough path That accounts for the lightness of the impression made by the wheels along it in spite of the softness of the ground 
3008_164327_000050_000002	train-clean-360	If there had been a man on the bicycle the wheels would have sunk deeply into the soil 
3008_164327_000050_000003	train-clean-360	No no there was but one man there the murderer on foot 
3008_164327_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Bravo bravo cried Fred again and coming suddenly towards us and planting himself in front of Monsieur Robert Darzac he said to him 
3008_164327_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 If we had a bicycle here we might demonstrate the correctness of the young man s reasoning Monsieur Robert Darzac 
3008_164327_000052_000001	train-clean-360	Do you know whether there is one at the chateau 
none	none	No replied Monsieur Darzac There is not I took mine four days ago to Paris the last time I came to the chateau before the crime That s a pity replied Fred very coldly Then turning to Rouletabille he said If we go on at this rate we ll both come to the same conclusion Have you any idea as to how the murderer got away from The Yellow Room
3008_164327_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes said my young friend I have an idea 
none	none	So have I said Fred and it must be the same as yours 
3008_164327_000056_000001	train-clean-360	There are no two ways of reasoning in this affair 
3008_164327_000056_000002	train-clean-360	I am waiting for the arrival of my chief before offering any explanation to the examining magistrate 
none	none	Ah Is the Chief of the Surete coming
3008_164327_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes this afternoon 
3008_164327_000058_000001	train-clean-360	He is going to summon before the magistrate in the laboratory all those who have played any part in this tragedy 
none	none	It will be very interesting It is a pity you won t be able to be present I shall be present said Rouletabille confidently
3008_164327_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 Really you are an extraordinary fellow for your age replied the detective in a tone not wholly free from irony 
3008_164327_000060_000001	train-clean-360	 You d make a wonderful detective if you had a little more method if you didn t follow your instincts and that bump on your forehead 
none	none	As I have already several times observed Monsieur Rouletabille you reason too much you do not allow yourself to be guided by what you have seen What do you say to the handkerchief full of blood and the red mark of the hand on the wall 
3008_164327_000060_000004	train-clean-360	You have seen the stain on the wall but I have only seen the handkerchief 
none	none	Bah cried Rouletabille the murderer was wounded in the hand by Mademoiselle Stangerson s revolver Ah a simply instinctive observation Take care You are becoming too strictly logical Monsieur Rouletabille logic will upset you if you use it indiscriminately 
3008_164327_000062_000002	train-clean-360	You are right when you say that Mademoiselle Stangerson fired her revolver but you are wrong when you say that she wounded the murderer in the hand 
none	none	I am sure of it cried Rouletabille 
3008_164327_000064_000000	train-clean-360	Fred imperturbable interrupted him 
none	none	Defective observation defective observation the examination of the handkerchief the numberless little round scarlet stains the impression of drops which I found in the tracks of the footprints at the moment when they were made on the floor prove to me that the murderer was not wounded at all Monsieur Rouletabille the murderer bled at the nose 
3008_164327_000066_000000	train-clean-360	The great Fred spoke quite seriously 
3008_164327_000066_000001	train-clean-360	However I could not refrain from uttering an exclamation 
3008_164327_000067_000000	train-clean-360	The reporter looked gravely at Fred who looked gravely at him 
none	none	And Fred immediately concluded
3008_164327_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 The man allowed the blood to flow into his hand and handkerchief and dried his hand on the wall 
none	none	The fact is highly important he added because there is no need of his being wounded in the hand for him to be the murderer Rouletabille seemed to be thinking deeply 
3008_164327_000069_000001	train-clean-360	After a moment he said 
3008_164327_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 There is something a something Monsieur Frederic Larsan much graver than the misuse of logic the disposition of mind in some detectives which makes them in perfect good faith twist logic to the necessities of their preconceived ideas 
3008_164327_000070_000001	train-clean-360	You already have your idea about the murderer Monsieur Fred 
none	none	Don t deny it and your theory demands that the murderer should not have been wounded in the hand otherwise it comes to nothing And you have searched and have found something else It s dangerous very dangerous Monsieur Fred to go from a preconceived idea to find the proofs to fit it That method may lead you far astray Beware of judicial error Monsieur Fred it will trip you up 
3008_164327_000071_000000	train-clean-360	And laughing a little in a slightly bantering tone his hands in his pockets Rouletabille fixed his cunning eyes on the great Fred 
3008_164327_000072_000000	train-clean-360	Frederic Larsan silently contemplated the young reporter who pretended to be as wise as himself 
3008_164327_000072_000001	train-clean-360	Shrugging his shoulders he bowed to us and moved quickly away hitting the stones on his path with his stout cane 
none	none	Rouletabille watched his retreat and then turned toward us his face joyous and triumphant
3008_164327_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 I shall beat him he cried 
3008_164327_000074_000001	train-clean-360	 I shall beat the great Fred clever as he is I shall beat them all 
3008_164327_000075_000000	train-clean-360	And he danced a double shuffle 
3008_164327_000075_000001	train-clean-360	Suddenly he stopped 
3008_164327_000075_000002	train-clean-360	My eyes followed his gaze they were fixed on Monsieur Robert Darzac who was looking anxiously at the impression left by his feet side by side with the elegant footmarks 
none	none	There was not a particle of difference between them 
3008_164327_000076_000000	train-clean-360	We thought he was about to faint 
3008_164327_000076_000001	train-clean-360	His eyes bulging with terror avoided us while his right hand with a spasmodic movement twitched at the beard that covered his honest gentle and now despairing face 
none	none	At length regaining his self possession he bowed to us and remarking in a changed voice that he was obliged to return to the chateau left us The deuce exclaimed Rouletabille 
3008_164327_000078_000000	train-clean-360	He also appeared to be deeply concerned 
3008_164327_000078_000001	train-clean-360	From his pocket book he took a piece of white paper as I had seen him do before and with his scissors cut out the shape of the neat bootmarks that were on the ground 
3008_164327_000078_000002	train-clean-360	Then he fitted the new paper pattern with the one he had previously made the two were exactly alike 
none	none	Rising Rouletabille exclaimed again The deuce Presently he added Yet I believe Monsieur Robert Darzac to be an honest man He then led me on the road to the Donjon Inn which we could see on the highway by the side of a small clump of trees 
3008_164328_000002_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER X We Shall Have to Eat Red Meat Now 
3008_164328_000003_000000	train-clean-360	The Donjon Inn was of no imposing appearance but I like these buildings with their rafters blackened with age and the smoke of their hearths these inns of the coaching days crumbling erections that will soon exist in the memory only 
3008_164328_000003_000001	train-clean-360	They belong to the bygone days they are linked with history 
3008_164328_000003_000002	train-clean-360	They make us think of the Road of those days when highwaymen rode 
3008_164328_000004_000000	train-clean-360	I saw at once that the Donjon Inn was at least two centuries old perhaps older 
none	none	Under its sign board over the threshold a man with a crabbed looking face was standing seemingly plunged in unpleasant thought if the wrinkles on his forehead and the knitting of his brows were any indication 
3008_164328_000005_000000	train-clean-360	When we were close to him he deigned to see us and asked us in a tone anything but engaging whether we wanted anything 
3008_164328_000005_000001	train-clean-360	He was no doubt the not very amiable landlord of this charming dwelling place 
3008_164328_000005_000002	train-clean-360	As we expressed a hope that he would be good enough to furnish us with a breakfast he assured us that he had no provisions regarding us as he said this with a look that was unmistakably suspicious 
none	none	You may take us in Rouletabille said to him we are not policemen
3008_164328_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 I m not afraid of the police I m not afraid of anyone replied the man 
3008_164328_000008_000000	train-clean-360	I had made my friend understand by a sign that we should do better not to insist but being determined to enter the inn he slipped by the man on the doorstep and was in the common room 
3008_164328_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Come on he said it is very comfortable here 
none	none	A good fire was blazing in the chimney and we held our hands to the warmth it sent out it was a morning in which the approach of winter was unmistakable 
3008_164328_000010_000001	train-clean-360	The room was a tolerably large one furnished with two heavy tables some stools a counter decorated with rows of bottles of syrup and alcohol 
none	none	Three windows looked out on to the road 
3008_164328_000010_000003	train-clean-360	A coloured advertisement lauded the many merits of a new vermouth 
3008_164328_000010_000004	train-clean-360	On the mantelpiece was arrayed the innkeeper s collection of figured earthenware pots and stone jugs 
none	none	That s a fine fire for roasting a chicken said Rouletabille
3008_164328_000011_000001	train-clean-360	 We have no chicken not even a wretched rabbit said the landlord 
3008_164328_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 I know said my friend slowly I know We shall have to eat red meat now 
none	none	I confess I did not in the least understand what Rouletabille meant by what he had said but the landlord as soon as he heard the words uttered an oath which he at once stifled and placed himself at our orders as obediently as Monsieur Robert Darzac had done when he heard Rouletabille s prophetic sentence The presbytery has lost nothing of its charm nor the garden its brightness Certainly my friend knew how to make people understand him by the use of wholly incomprehensible phrases I observed as much to him but he merely smiled I should have proposed that he give me some explanation but he put a finger to his lips which evidently signified that he had not only determined not to speak but also enjoined silence on my part 
3008_164328_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Meantime the man had pushed open a little side door and called to somebody to bring him half a dozen eggs and a piece of beefsteak 
none	none	The commission was quickly executed by a strongly built young woman with beautiful blonde hair and large handsome eyes who regarded us with curiosity 
3008_164328_000015_000000	train-clean-360	The innkeeper said to her roughly 
none	none	Get out and if the Green Man comes don t let me see him 
3008_164328_000017_000000	train-clean-360	She disappeared 
none	none	Rouletabille took the eggs which had been brought to him in a bowl and the meat which was on a dish placed all carefully beside him in the chimney unhooked a frying pan and a gridiron and began to beat up our omelette before proceeding to grill our beefsteak He then ordered two bottles of cider and seemed to take as little notice of our host as our host did of him 
3008_164328_000017_000002	train-clean-360	The landlord let us do our own cooking and set our table near one of the windows 
none	none	Suddenly I heard him mutter Ah there he is His face had changed expressing fierce hatred He went and glued himself to one of the windows watching the road 
3008_164328_000020_000002	train-clean-360	There was no need for me to draw Rouletabille s attention he had already left our omelette and had joined the landlord at the window 
none	none	I went with him A man dressed entirely in green velvet his head covered with a huntsman s cap of the same colour was advancing leisurely lighting a pipe as he walked 
3008_164328_000021_000001	train-clean-360	He carried a fowling piece slung at his back 
none	none	His movements displayed an almost aristocratic ease 
3008_164328_000021_000003	train-clean-360	He wore eye glasses and appeared to be about five and forty years of age 
none	none	His hair as well as his moustache were salt grey He was remarkably handsome As he passed near the inn he hesitated as if asking himself whether or no he should enter it gave a glance towards us took a few whiffs at his pipe and then resumed his walk at the same nonchalant pace Rouletabille and I looked at our host His flashing eyes his clenched hands his trembling lips told us of the tumultuous feelings by which he was being agitated
3008_164328_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 He has done well not to come in here to day he hissed 
none	none	Who is that man asked Rouletabille returning to his omelette The Green Man growled the innkeeper
3008_164328_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 Don t you know him 
3008_164328_000025_000002	train-clean-360	Then all the better for you 
3008_164328_000025_000003	train-clean-360	He is not an acquaintance to make Well he is Monsieur Stangerson s forest keeper 
none	none	You don t appear to like him very much asked the reporter pouring his omelette into the frying pan Nobody likes him monsieur 
3008_164328_000027_000001	train-clean-360	He s an upstart who must once have had a fortune of his own and he forgives nobody because in order to live he has been compelled to become a servant 
none	none	A keeper is as much a servant as any other isn t he Upon my word one would say that he is the master of the Glandier and that all the land and woods belong to him 
3008_164328_000027_000004	train-clean-360	He ll not let a poor creature eat a morsel of bread on the grass his grass 
3008_164328_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Does he often come here 
3008_164328_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Too often 
3008_164328_000029_000001	train-clean-360	But I ve made him understand that his face doesn t please me and for a month past he hasn t been here 
none	none	The Donjon Inn has never existed for him he hasn t had time been too much engaged in paying court to the landlady of the Three Lilies at Saint Michel A bad fellow There isn t an honest man who can bear him 
3008_164328_000029_000004	train-clean-360	Why the concierges of the chateau would turn their eyes away from a picture of him 
3008_164328_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 The concierges of the chateau are honest people then 
3008_164328_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes they are as true as my name s Mathieu monsieur 
none	none	I believe them to be honest
3008_164328_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Yet they ve been arrested 
3008_164328_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 What does that prove But I don t want to mix myself up in other people s affairs 
none	none	And what do you think of the murder
3008_164328_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Of the murder of poor Mademoiselle Stangerson A good girl much loved everywhere in the country 
none	none	That s what I think of it and many things besides but that s nobody s business Not even mine insisted Rouletabille 
3008_164328_000037_000000	train-clean-360	The innkeeper looked at him sideways and said gruffly 
3008_164328_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Not even yours 
none	none	The omelette ready we sat down at table and were silently eating when the door was pushed open and an old woman dressed in rags leaning on a stick her head doddering her white hair hanging loosely over her wrinkled forehead appeared on the threshold Ah there you are Mother Angenoux It s long since we saw you last said our host I have been very ill very nearly dying said the old woman If ever you should have any scraps for the Bete du Bon Dieu 
3008_164328_000042_000000	train-clean-360	And she entered followed by a cat larger than any I had ever believed could exist 
3008_164328_000042_000001	train-clean-360	The beast looked at us and gave so hopeless a miau that I shuddered 
none	none	I had never heard so lugubrious a cry As if drawn by the cat s cry a man followed the old woman in It was the Green Man He saluted by raising his hand to his cap and seated himself at a table near to ours A glass of cider Daddy Mathieu he said 
3008_164328_000045_000000	train-clean-360	As the Green Man entered Daddy Mathieu had started violently but visibly mastering himself he said 
3008_164328_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 I ve no more cider I served the last bottles to these gentlemen 
none	none	Then give me a glass of white wine said the Green Man without showing the least surprise I ve no more white wine no more anything said Daddy Mathieu surlily How is Madame Mathieu
3008_164328_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Quite well thank you 
none	none	So the young Woman with the large tender eyes whom we had just seen was the wife of this repugnant and brutal rustic whose jealousy seemed to emphasise his physical ugliness Slamming the door behind him the innkeeper left the room 
3008_164328_000052_000001	train-clean-360	Mother Angenoux was still standing leaning on her stick the cat at her feet 
none	none	You ve been ill Mother Angenoux Is that why we have not seen you for the last week asked the Green Man
3008_164328_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes Monsieur keeper 
none	none	I have been able to get up but three times to go to pray to Sainte Genevieve our good patroness and the rest of the time I have been lying on my bed 
3008_164328_000054_000002	train-clean-360	There was no one to care for me but the Bete du bon Dieu 
3008_164328_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 Did she not leave you 
none	none	Neither by day nor by night
3008_164328_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 Are you sure of that 
none	none	As I am of Paradise Then how was it Madame Angenoux that all through the night of the murder nothing but the cry of the Bete du bon Dieu was heard 
3008_164328_000060_000000	train-clean-360	Mother Angenoux planted herself in front of the forest keeper and struck the floor with her stick 
3008_164328_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t know anything about it she said 
3008_164328_000061_000001	train-clean-360	 But shall I tell you something 
3008_164328_000061_000002	train-clean-360	There are no two cats in the world that cry like that 
none	none	Well on the night of the murder I also heard the cry of the Bete du bon Dieu outside and yet she was on my knees and did not mew once I swear 
3008_164328_000061_000004	train-clean-360	I crossed myself when I heard that as if I had heard the devil 
3008_164328_000062_000000	train-clean-360	I looked at the keeper when he put the last question and I am much mistaken if I did not detect an evil smile on his lips 
none	none	At that moment the noise of loud quarrelling reached us We even thought we heard a dull sound of blows as if some one was being beaten 
3008_164328_000062_000003	train-clean-360	The Green Man quickly rose and hurried to the door by the side of the fireplace but it was opened by the landlord who appeared and said to the keeper 
none	none	Don t alarm yourself Monsieur it is my wife she has the toothache And he laughed Here Mother Angenoux here are some scraps for your cat 
3008_164328_000064_000000	train-clean-360	He held out a packet to the old woman who took it eagerly and went out by the door closely followed by her cat 
none	none	Then you won t serve me asked the Green Man Daddy Mathieu s face was placid and no longer retained its expression of hatred I ve nothing for you nothing for you 
3008_164328_000067_000001	train-clean-360	Take yourself off 
3008_164328_000068_000000	train-clean-360	The Green Man quietly refilled his pipe lit it bowed to us and went out 
none	none	No sooner was he over the threshold than Daddy Mathieu slammed the door after him and turning towards us with eyes bloodshot and frothing at the mouth he hissed to us shaking his clenched fist at the door he had just shut on the man he evidently hated
3008_164328_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t know who you are who tell me We shall have to eat red meat now but if it will interest you to know it that man is the murderer 
none	none	With which words Daddy Mathieu immediately left us Rouletabille returned towards the fireplace and said
3008_164328_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 Now we ll grill our steak 
3008_164328_000071_000001	train-clean-360	How do you like the cider It s a little tart but I like it 
3008_164328_000072_000000	train-clean-360	We saw no more of Daddy Mathieu that day and absolute silence reigned in the inn when we left it after placing five francs on the table in payment for our feast 
3008_164328_000073_000000	train-clean-360	Rouletabille at once set off on a three mile walk round Professor Stangerson s estate 
none	none	He halted for some ten minutes at the corner of a narrow road black with soot near to some charcoal burners huts in the forest of Sainte Genevieve which touches on the road from Epinay to Corbeil to tell me that the murderer had certainly passed that way before entering the grounds and concealing himself in the little clump of trees
3008_164328_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 You don t think then that the keeper knows anything of it I asked 
3008_164328_000075_000000	train-clean-360	 We shall see that later he replied 
none	none	For the present I m not interested in what the landlord said about the man 
3008_164328_000075_000002	train-clean-360	The landlord hates him 
none	none	I didn t take you to breakfast at the Donjon Inn for the sake of the Green Man Then Rouletabille with great precaution glided followed by me towards the little building which standing near the park gate served for the home of the concierges who had been arrested that morning 
3008_164328_000076_000001	train-clean-360	With the skill of an acrobat he got into the lodge by an upper window which had been left open and returned ten minutes later 
3008_164328_000076_000002	train-clean-360	He said only Ah a word which in his mouth signified many things 
3008_164328_000077_000000	train-clean-360	We were about to take the road leading to the chateau when a considerable stir at the park gate attracted our attention 
none	none	A carriage had arrived and some people had come from the chateau to meet it Rouletabille pointed out to me a gentleman who descended from it That s the Chief of the Surete he said Now we shall see what Frederic Larsan has up his sleeve and whether he is so much cleverer than anybody else The carriage of the Chief of the Surete was followed by three other vehicles containing reporters who were also desirous of entering the park But two gendarmes stationed at the gate had evidently received orders to refuse admission to anybody The Chief of the Surete calmed their impatience by undertaking to furnish to the press that evening all the information he could give that would not interfere with the judicial inquiry CHAPTER XI In Which Frederic Larsan Explains How the Murderer Was Able to Get Out of The Yellow Room Among the mass of papers legal documents memoirs and extracts from newspapers which I have collected relating to the mystery of The Yellow Room there is one very interesting piece it is a detail of the famous examination which took place that afternoon in the laboratory of Professor Stangerson before the Chief of the Surete This narrative is from the pen of Monsieur Maleine the Registrar who like the examining magistrate had spent some of his leisure time in the pursuit of literature The piece was to have made part of a book which however has never been published and which was to have been entitled My Examinations It was given to me by the Registrar himself some time after the astonishing denouement to this case and is unique in judicial chronicles Here it is It is not a mere dry transcription of questions and answers because the Registrar often intersperses his story with his own personal comments THE REGISTRAR S NARRATIVE The examining magistrate and I the writer relates found ourselves in The Yellow Room in the company of the builder who had constructed the pavilion after Professor Stangerson s designs He had a workman with him Monsieur de Marquet had had the walls laid entirely bare that is to say he had had them stripped of the paper which had decorated them Blows with a pick here and there satisfied us of the absence of any sort of opening The floor and the ceiling were thoroughly sounded We found nothing There was nothing to be found Monsieur de Marquet appeared to be delighted and never ceased repeating What a case What a case We shall never know you ll see how the murderer was able to get out of this room Then suddenly with a radiant face he called to the officer in charge of the gendarmes Go to the chateau he said and request Monsieur Stangerson and Monsieur Robert Darzac to come to me in the laboratory also Daddy Jacques and let your men bring here the two concierges Five minutes later all were assembled in the laboratory The Chief of the Surete who had arrived at the Glandier joined us at that moment I was seated at Monsieur Stangerson s desk ready for work when Monsieur de Marquet made us the following little speech as original as it was unexpected With your permission gentlemen as examinations lead to nothing we will for once abandon the old system of interrogation I will not have you brought before me one by one but we will all remain here as we are Monsieur Stangerson Monsieur Robert Darzac Daddy Jacques and the two concierges the Chief of the Surete the Registrar and myself We shall all be on the same footing The concierges may for the moment forget that they have been arrested We are going to confer together We are on the spot where the crime was committed We have nothing else to discuss but the crime So let us discuss it freely intelligently or otherwise so long as we speak just what is in our minds There need be no formality or method since this won t help us in any way Then passing before me he said in a low voice What do you think of that eh What a scene Could you have thought of that I ll make a little piece out of it for the Vaudeville And he rubbed his hands with glee I turned my eyes on Monsieur Stangerson The hope he had received from the doctor s latest reports which stated that Mademoiselle Stangerson might recover from her wounds had not been able to efface from his noble features the marks of the great sorrow that was upon him He had believed his daughter to be dead and he was still broken by that belief His clear soft blue eyes expressed infinite sorrow I had had occasion many times to see Monsieur Stangerson at public ceremonies and from the first had been struck by his countenance which seemed as pure as that of a child the dreamy gaze with the sublime and mystical expression of the inventor and thinker On those occasions his daughter was always to be seen either following him or by his side for they never quitted each other it was said and had shared the same labours for many years The young lady who was then five and thirty though she looked no more than thirty had devoted herself entirely to science She still won admiration for her imperial beauty which had remained intact without a wrinkle withstanding time and love Who would have dreamed that I should one day be seated by her pillow with my papers and that I should see her on the point of death painfully recounting to us the most monstrous and most mysterious crime I have heard of in my career Who would have thought that I should be that afternoon listening to the despairing father vainly trying to explain how his daughter s assailant had been able to escape from him Why bury ourselves with our work in obscure retreats in the depths of woods if it may not protect us against those dangerous threats to life which meet us in the busy cities Now Monsieur Stangerson said Monsieur de Marquet with somewhat of an important air place yourself exactly where you were when Mademoiselle Stangerson left you to go to her chamber Monsieur Stangerson rose and standing at a certain distance from the door of The Yellow Room said in an even voice and without the least trace of emphasis a voice which I can only describe as a dead voice I was here About eleven o clock after I had made a brief chemical experiment at the furnaces of the laboratory needing all the space behind me I had my desk moved here by Daddy Jacques who spent the evening in cleaning some of my apparatus My daughter had been working at the same desk with me When it was her time to leave she rose kissed me and bade Daddy Jacques goodnight She had to pass behind my desk and the door to enter her chamber and she could do this only with some difficulty That is to say I was very near the place where the crime occurred later And the desk I asked obeying in thus mixing myself in the conversation the express orders of my chief as soon as you heard the cry of murder followed by the revolver shots what became of the desk Daddy Jacques answered We pushed it back against the wall here close to where it is at the present moment so as to be able to get at the door at once I followed up my reasoning to which however I attached but little importance regarding it as only a weak hypothesis with another question Might not a man in the room the desk being so near to the door by stooping and slipping under the desk have left it unobserved You are forgetting interrupted Monsieur Stangerson wearily that my daughter had locked and bolted her door that the door had remained fastened that we vainly tried to force it open when we heard the noise and that we were at the door while the struggle between the murderer and my poor child was going on immediately after we heard her stifled cries as she was being held by the fingers that have left their red mark upon her throat Rapid as the attack was we were no less rapid in our endeavors to get into the room where the tragedy was taking place I rose from my seat and once more examined the door with the greatest care Then I returned to my place with a despairing gesture If the lower panel of the door I said could be removed without the whole door being necessarily opened the problem would be solved But unfortunately that last hypothesis is untenable after an examination of the door it s of oak solid and massive You can see that quite plainly in spite of the injury done in the attempt to burst it open Ah cried Daddy Jacques it is an old and solid door that was brought from the chateau they don t make such doors now We had to use this bar of iron to get it open all four of us for the concierge brave woman she is helped us It pains me to find them both in prison now Daddy Jacques had no sooner uttered these words of pity and protestation than tears and lamentations broke out from the concierges I never saw two accused people crying more bitterly I was extremely disgusted Even if they were innocent I could not understand how they could behave like that in the face of misfortune A dignified bearing at such times is better than tears and groans which most often are feigned Now then enough of that sniveling cried Monsieur de Marquet and in your interest tell us what you were doing under the windows of the pavilion at the time your mistress was being attacked for you were close to the pavilion when Daddy Jacques met you We were coming to help they whined If we could only lay hands on the murderer he d never taste bread again the woman gurgled between her sobs As before we were unable to get two connecting thoughts out of them They persisted in their denials and swore by heaven and all the saints that they were in bed when they heard the sound of the revolver shot It was not one but two shots that were fired You see you are lying If you had heard one you would have heard the other Mon Dieu Monsieur it was the second shot we heard We were asleep when the first shot was fired Two shots were fired said Daddy Jacques I am certain that all the cartridges were in my revolver We found afterward that two had been exploded and we heard two shots behind the door Was not that so Monsieur Stangerson Yes replied the Professor there were two shots one dull and the other sharp and ringing Why do you persist in lying cried Monsieur de Marquet turning to the concierges Do you think the police are the fools you are Everything points to the fact that you were out of doors and near the pavilion at the time of the tragedy What were you doing there So far as I am concerned he said turning to Monsieur Stangerson I can only explain the escape of the murderer on the assumption of help from these two accomplices As soon as the door was forced open and while you Monsieur Stangerson were occupied with your unfortunate child the concierge and his wife facilitated the flight of the murderer who screening himself behind them reached the window in the vestibule and sprang out of it into the park The concierge closed the window after him and fastened the blinds which certainly could not have closed and fastened of themselves That is the conclusion I have arrived at If anyone here has any other idea let him state it Monsieur Stangerson intervened What you say was impossible I do not believe either in the guilt or in the connivance of my concierges though I cannot understand what they were doing in the park at that late hour of the night I say it was impossible because Madame Bernier held the lamp and did not move from the threshold of the room because I as soon as the door was forced open threw myself on my knees beside my daughter and no one could have left or entered the room by the door without passing over her body and forcing his way by me Daddy Jacques and the concierge had but to cast a glance round the chamber and under the bed as I had done on entering to see that there was nobody in it but my daughter lying on the floor What do you think Monsieur Darzac asked the magistrate Monsieur Darzac replied that he had no opinion to express Monsieur Dax the Chief of the Surete who so far had been listening and examining the room at length deigned to open his lips While search is being made for the criminal we had better try to find out the motive for the crime that will advance us a little he said Turning towards Monsieur Stangerson he continued in the even intelligent tone indicative of a strong character I understand that Mademoiselle was shortly to have been married The professor looked sadly at Monsieur Robert Darzac To my friend here whom I should have been happy to call my son to Monsieur Robert Darzac Mademoiselle Stangerson is much better and is rapidly recovering from her wounds The marriage is simply delayed is it not Monsieur insisted the Chief of the Surete I hope so What Is there any doubt about that Monsieur Stangerson did not answer Monsieur Robert Darzac seemed agitated I saw that his hand trembled as it fingered his watchchain Monsieur Dax coughed as did Monsieur de Marquet Both were evidently embarrassed You understand Monsieur Stangerson he said that in an affair so perplexing as this we cannot neglect anything we must know all even the smallest and seemingly most futile thing concerning the victim information apparently the most insignificant Why do you doubt that this marriage will take place You expressed a hope but the hope implies a doubt Why do you doubt Monsieur Stangerson made a visible effort to recover himself Yes Monsieur he said at length you are right It will be best that you should know something which if I concealed it might appear to be of importance Monsieur Darzac agrees with me in this Monsieur Darzac whose pallor at that moment seemed to me to be altogether abnormal made a sign of assent I gathered he was unable to speak I want you to know then continued Monsieur Stangerson that my daughter has sworn never to leave me and adheres firmly to her oath in spite of all my prayers and all that I have argued to induce her to marry We have known Monsieur Robert Darzac many years He loves my child and I believed that she loved him because she only recently consented to this marriage which I desire with all my heart I am an old man Monsieur and it was a happy hour to me when I knew that after I had gone she would have at her side one who loved her and who would help her in continuing our common labours I love and esteem Monsieur Darzac both for his greatness of heart and for his devotion to science But two days before the tragedy for I know not what reason my daughter declared to me that she would never marry Monsieur Darzac A dead silence followed Monsieur Stangerson s words It was a moment fraught with suspense Did Mademoiselle give you any explanation did she tell you what her motive was asked Monsieur Dax She told me she was too old to marry that she had waited too long She said she had given much thought to the matter and while she had a great esteem even affection for Monsieur Darzac she felt it would be better if things remained as they were She would be happy she said to see the relations between ourselves and Monsieur Darzac become closer but only on the understanding that there would be no more talk of marriage That is very strange muttered Monsieur Dax Strange repeated Monsieur de Marquet You ll certainly not find the motive there Monsieur Dax Monsieur Stangerson said with a cold smile In any case the motive was not theft said the Chief impatiently Oh we are quite convinced of that cried the examining magistrate At that moment the door of the laboratory opened and the officer in charge of the gendarmes entered and handed a card to the examining magistrate Monsieur de Marquet read it and uttered a half angry exclamation This is really too much he cried What is it asked the Chief It s the card of a young reporter engaged on the Epoque a Monsieur Joseph Rouletabille It has these words written on it One of the motives of the crime was robbery The Chief smiled Ah young Rouletabille I ve heard of him he is considered rather clever Let him come in Monsieur Joseph Rouletabille was allowed to enter I had made his acquaintance in the train that morning on the way to Epinay sur Orge He had introduced himself almost against my wish into our compartment I had better say at once that his manners and the arrogance with which he assumed to know what was incomprehensible even to us impressed him unfavourably on my mind I do not like journalists They are a class of writers to be avoided as the pest They think that everything is permissible and they respect nothing Grant them the least favour allow them even to approach you and you never can tell what annoyance they may give you This one appears to be scarcely twenty years old and the effrontery with which he dared to question us and discuss the matter with us made him particularly obnoxious to me Besides he had a way of expressing himself that left us guessing as to whether he was mocking us or not I know quite well that the Epoque is an influential paper with which it is well to be on good terms but the paper ought not to allow itself to be represented by sneaking reporters Monsieur Joseph Rouletabille entered the laboratory bowed to us and waited for Monsieur de Marquet to ask him to explain his presence You pretend Monsieur that you know the motive for the crime and that that motive in the face of all the evidence that has been forthcoming was robbery No Monsieur I do not pretend that I do not say that robbery was the motive for the crime and I don t believe it was Then what is the meaning of this card It means that robbery was one of the motives for the crime What leads you to think that If you will be good enough to accompany me I will show you The young man asked us to follow him into the vestibule and we did He led us towards the lavatory and begged Monsieur de Marquet to kneel beside him This lavatory is lit by the glass door and when the door was open the light which penetrated was sufficient to light it perfectly Monsieur de Marquet and Monsieur Joseph Rouletabille knelt down on the threshold and the young man pointed to a spot on the pavement The stones of the lavatory have not been washed by Daddy Jacques for some time he said that can be seen by the layer of dust that covers them Now notice here the marks of two large footprints and the black ash they left where they have been That ash is nothing else than the charcoal dust that covers the path along which you must pass through the forest in order to get directly from Epinay to the Glandier You know there is a little village of charcoal burners at that place who make large quantities of charcoal What the murderer did was to come here at midday when there was nobody at the pavilion and attempt his robbery But what robbery Where do you see any signs of robbery What proves to you that a robbery has been committed we all cried at once What put me on the trace of it continued the journalist Was this interrupted Monsieur de Marquet still on his knees Evidently said Rouletabille And Monsieur de Marquet explained that there were on the dust of the pavement marks of two footsteps as well as the impression freshly made of a heavy rectangular parcel the marks of the cord with which it had been fastened being easily distinguished You have been here then Monsieur Rouletabille I thought I had given orders to Daddy Jacques who Was left in charge of the pavilion not to allow anybody to enter Don t scold Daddy Jacques I came here with Monsieur Robert Darzac Ah Indeed exclaimed Monsieur de Marquet disagreeably casting a side glance at Monsieur Darzac who remained perfectly silent When I saw the mark of the parcel by the side of the footprints I had no doubt as to the robbery replied Monsieur Rouletabille The thief had not brought a parcel with him he had made one here a parcel with the stolen objects no doubt and he put it in this corner intending to take it away when the moment came for him to make his escape He had also placed his heavy boots beside the parcel for see there are no marks of steps leading to the marks left by the boots which were placed side by side That accounts for the fact that the murderer left no trace of his steps when he fled from The Yellow Room nor any in the laboratory nor in the vestibule After entering The Yellow Room in his boots he took them off finding them troublesome or because he wished to make as little noise as possible The marks made by him in going through the vestibule and the laboratory were subsequently washed out by Daddy Jacques Having for some reason or other taken off his boots the murderer carried them in his hand and placed them by the side of the parcel he had made by that time the robbery had been accomplished The man then returned to The Yellow Room and slipped under the bed where the mark of his body is perfectly visible on the floor and even on the mat which has been slightly moved from its place and creased Fragments of straw also recently torn bear witness to the murderer s movements under the bed Yes yes we know all about that said Monsieur de Marquet The robber had another motive for returning to hide under the bed continued the astonishing boy journalist You might think that he was trying to hide himself quickly on seeing through the vestibule window Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson about to enter the pavilion It would have been much easier for him to have climbed up to the attic and hidden there waiting for an opportunity to get away if his purpose had been only flight No No he had to be in The Yellow Room Here the Chief intervened That s not at all bad young man I compliment you If we do not know yet how the murderer succeeded in getting away we can at any rate see how he came in and committed the robbery But what did he steal Something very valuable replied the young reporter At that moment we heard a cry from the laboratory We rushed in and found Monsieur Stangerson his eyes haggard his limbs trembling pointing to a sort of bookcase which he had opened and which we saw was empty At the same instant he sank into the large armchair that was placed before the desk and groaned the tears rolling down his cheeks I have been robbed again For God s sake do not say a word of this to my daughter She would be more pained than I am He heaved a deep sigh and added in a tone I shall never forget After all what does it matter so long as she lives She will live said Monsieur Darzac in a voice strangely touching And we will find the stolen articles said Monsieur Dax But what was in the cabinet Twenty years of my life replied the illustrious professor sadly or rather of our lives the lives of myself and my daughter Yes our most precious documents the records of our secret experiments and our labours of twenty years were in that cabinet It is an irreparable loss to us and I venture to say to science All the processes by which I had been able to arrive at the precious proof of the destructibility of matter were there all The man who came wished to take all from me my daughter and my work my heart and my soul And the great scientist wept like a child We stood around him in silence deeply affected by his great distress Monsieur Darzac pressed closely to his side and tried in vain to restrain his tears a sight which for the moment almost made me like him in spite of an instinctive repulsion which his strange demeanour and his inexplicable anxiety had inspired me Monsieur Rouletabille alone as if his precious time and mission on earth did not permit him to dwell in the contemplation on human suffering had very calmly stepped up to the empty cabinet and pointing at it broke the almost solemn silence He entered into explanations for which there was no need as to why he had been led to believe that a robbery had been committed which included the simultaneous discovery he had made in the lavatory and the empty precious cabinet in the laboratory The first thing that had struck him he said was the unusual form of that piece of furniture It was very strongly built of fire proof iron clearly showing that it was intended for the keeping of most valuable objects Then he noticed that the key had been left in the lock One does not ordinarily have a safe and leave it open he had said to himself This little key with its brass head and complicated wards had strongly attracted him its presence had suggested robbery Monsieur de Marquet appeared to be greatly perplexed as if he did not know whether he ought to be glad of the new direction given to the inquiry by the young reporter or sorry that it had not been done by himself In our profession and for the general welfare we have to put up with such mortifications and bury selfish feelings That was why Monsieur de Marquet controlled himself and joined his compliments with those of Monsieur Dax As for Monsieur Rouletabille he simply shrugged his shoulders and said There s nothing at all in that I should have liked to box his ears especially when he added You will do well Monsieur to ask Monsieur Stangerson who usually kept that key My daughter replied Monsieur Stangerson she was never without it Ah then that changes the aspect of things which no longer corresponds with Monsieur Rouletabille s ideas cried Monsieur de Marquet If that key never left Mademoiselle Stangerson the murderer must have waited for her in her room for the purpose of stealing it and the robbery could not have been committed until after the attack had been made on her But after the attack four persons were in the laboratory I can t make it out The robbery said the reporter could only have been committed before the attack upon Mademoiselle Stangerson in her room When the murderer entered the pavilion he already possessed the brass headed key That is impossible said Monsieur Stangerson in a low voice It is quite possible Monsieur as this proves And the young rascal drew a copy of the Epoque from his pocket dated the twenty first of October I recall the fact that the crime was committed on the night between the twenty fourth and twenty fifth and showing us an advertisement he read Yesterday a black satin reticule was lost in the Grands Magasins de la Louvre It contained amongst other things a small key with a brass head A handsome reward will be given to the person who has found it This person must write poste restante bureau forty to this address M A T H S N Do not these letters suggest Mademoiselle Stangerson continued the reporter The key with a brass head is not this the key I always read advertisements In my business as in yours Monsieur one should always read the personals They are often the keys to intrigues that are not always brass headed but which are none the less interesting This advertisement interested me specially the woman of the key surrounded it with a kind of mystery Evidently she valued the key since she promised a big reward for its restoration And I thought on these six letters M A T H S N The first four at once pointed to a Christian name evidently I said Math is Mathilde But I could make nothing of the two last letters So I threw the journal aside and occupied myself with other matters Four days later when the evening paper appeared with enormous head lines announcing the murder of Mademoiselle Stangerson the letters in the advertisement mechanically recurred to me I had forgotten the two last letters S N When I saw them again I could not help exclaiming Stangerson I jumped into a cab and rushed into the bureau No forty asking Have you a letter addressed to M A T H S N The clerk replied that he had not I insisted begged and entreated him to search He wanted to know if I were playing a joke on him and then told me that he had had a letter with the initials M A T H S N but he had given it up three days ago to a lady who came for it You come to day to claim the letter and the day before yesterday another gentleman claimed it I ve had enough of this he concluded angrily I tried to question him as to the two persons who had already claimed the letter but whether he wished to entrench himself behind professional secrecy he may have thought that he had already said too much or whether he was disgusted at the joke that had been played on him he would not answer any of my questions Rouletabille paused We all remained silent Each drew his own conclusions from the strange story of the poste restante letter It seemed indeed that we now had a thread by means of which we should be able to follow up this extraordinary mystery Then it is almost certain said Monsieur Stangerson that my daughter did lose the key and that she did not tell me of it wishing to spare any anxiety and that she begged whoever had found it to write to the poste restante She evidently feared that by giving our address inquiries would have resulted that would have apprised me of the loss of the key It was quite logical quite natural for her to have taken that course for I have been robbed once before Where was that and when asked the Chief of the Surete Oh many years ago in America in Philadelphia There were stolen from my laboratory the drawings of two inventions that might have made the fortune of a man Not only have I never learnt who the thief was but I have never heard even a word of the object of the robbery doubtless because in order to defeat the plans of the person who had robbed me I myself brought these two inventions before the public and so rendered the robbery of no avail From that time on I have been very careful to shut myself in when I am at work The bars to these windows the lonely situation of this pavilion this cabinet which I had specially constructed this special lock this unique key all are precautions against fears inspired by a sad experience Most interesting remarked Monsieur Dax Monsieur Rouletabille asked about the reticule Neither Monsieur Stangerson nor Daddy Jacques had seen it for several days but a few hours later we learned from Mademoiselle Stangerson herself that the reticule had either been stolen from her or she had lost it She further corroborated all that had passed just as her father had stated She had gone to the poste restante and on the twenty third of October had received a letter which she affirmed contained nothing but a vulgar pleasantry which she had immediately burned To return to our examination or rather to our conversation I must state that the Chief of the Surete having inquired of Monsieur Stangerson under what conditions his daughter had gone to Paris on the twentieth of October we learned that Monsieur Robert Darzac had accompanied her and Darzac had not been again seen at the chateau from that time to the day after the crime had been committed The fact that Monsieur Darzac was with her in the Grands Magasins de la Louvre when the reticule disappeared could not pass unnoticed and it must be said strongly awakened our interest This conversation between magistrates accused victim witnesses and journalist was coming to a close when quite a theatrical sensation an incident of a kind displeasing to Monsieur de Marquet was produced The officer of the gendarmes came to announce that Frederic Larsan requested to be admitted a request that was at once complied with He held in his hand a heavy pair of muddy boots which he threw on the pavement of the laboratory Here he said are the boots worn by the murderer Do you recognise them Daddy Jacques Daddy Jacques bent over them and stupefied recognised a pair of old boots which he had some time back thrown into a corner of his attic He was so taken aback that he could not hide his agitation Then pointing to the handkerchief in the old man s hand Frederic Larsan said That s a handkerchief astonishingly like the one found in The Yellow Room I know said Daddy Jacques trembling they are almost alike And then continued Frederic Larsan the old Basque cap also found in The Yellow Room might at one time have been worn by Daddy Jacques himself All this gentlemen proves I think that the murderer wished to disguise his real personality He did it in a very clumsy way or at least so it appears to us Don t be alarmed Daddy Jacques we are quite sure that you were not the murderer you never left the side of Monsieur Stangerson But if Monsieur Stangerson had not been working that night and had gone back to the chateau after parting with his daughter and Daddy Jacques had gone to sleep in his attic no one would have doubted that he was the murderer He owes his safety therefore to the tragedy having been enacted too soon the murderer no doubt from the silence in the laboratory imagined that it was empty and that the moment for action had come The man who had been able to introduce himself here so mysteriously and to leave so many evidences against Daddy Jacques was there can be no doubt familiar with the house At what hour exactly he entered whether in the afternoon or in the evening I cannot say One familiar with the proceedings and persons of this pavilion could choose his own time for entering The Yellow Room He could not have entered it if anybody had been in the laboratory said Monsieur de Marquet How do we know that replied Larsan There was the dinner in the laboratory the coming and going of the servants in attendance There was a chemical experiment being carried on between ten and eleven o clock with Monsieur Stangerson his daughter and Daddy Jacques engaged at the furnace in a corner of the high chimney Who can say that the murderer an intimate a friend did not take advantage of that moment to slip into The Yellow Room after having taken off his boots in the lavatory It is very improbable said Monsieur Stangerson Doubtless but it is not impossible I assert nothing As to the escape from the pavilion that s another thing the most natural thing in the world For a moment Frederic Larsan paused a moment that appeared to us a very long time The eagerness with which we awaited what he was going to tell us may be imagined I have not been in The Yellow Room he continued but I take it for granted that you have satisfied yourselves that he could have left the room only by way of the door it is by the door then that the murderer made his way out At what time At the moment when it was most easy for him to do so at the moment when it became most explainable so completely explainable that there can be no other explanation Let us go over the moments which followed after the crime had been committed There was the first moment when Monsieur Stangerson and Daddy Jacques were close to the door ready to bar the way There was the second moment during which Daddy Jacques was absent and Monsieur Stangerson was left alone before the door There was a third moment when Monsieur Stangerson was joined by the concierge There was a fourth moment during which Monsieur Stangerson the concierge and his wife and Daddy Jacques were before the door There was a fifth moment during which the door was burst open and The Yellow Room entered The moment at which the flight is explainable is the very moment when there was the least number of persons before the door There was one moment when there was but one person Monsieur Stangerson Unless a complicity of silence on the part of Daddy Jacques is admitted in which I do not believe the door was opened in the presence of Monsieur Stangerson alone and the man escaped Here we must admit that Monsieur Stangerson had powerful reasons for not arresting or not causing the arrest of the murderer since he allowed him to reach the window in the vestibule and closed it after him That done Mademoiselle Stangerson though horribly wounded had still strength enough and no doubt in obedience to the entreaties of her father to refasten the door of her chamber with both the bolt and the lock before sinking on the floor We do not know who committed the crime we do not know of what wretch Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson are the victims but there is no doubt that they both know The secret must be a terrible one for the father had not hesitated to leave his daughter to die behind a door which she had shut upon herself terrible for him to have allowed the assassin to escape For there is no other way in the world to explain the murderer s flight from The Yellow Room The silence which followed this dramatic and lucid explanation was appalling We all of us felt grieved for the illustrious professor driven into a corner by the pitiless logic of Frederic Larsan forced to confess the whole truth of his martyrdom or to keep silent and thus make a yet more terrible admission The man himself a veritable statue of sorrow raised his hand with a gesture so solemn that we bowed our heads to it as before something sacred He then pronounced these words in a voice so loud that it seemed to exhaust him I swear by the head of my suffering child that I never for an instant left the door of her chamber after hearing her cries for help that that door was not opened while I was alone in the laboratory and that finally when we entered The Yellow Room my three domestics and I the murderer was no longer there I swear I do not know the murderer Must I say it in spite of the solemnity of Monsieur Stangerson s words we did not believe in his denial Frederic Larsan had shown us the truth and it was not so easily given up Monsieur de Marquet announced that the conversation was at an end and as we were about to leave the laboratory Joseph Rouletabille approached Monsieur Stangerson took him by the hand with the greatest respect and I heard him say I believe you Monsieur I here close the citation which I have thought it my duty to make from Monsieur Maleine s narrative I need not tell the reader that all that passed in the laboratory was immediately and faithfully reported to me by Rouletabille CHAPTER XII Frederic Larsan s Cane 
1870-164330-0000	train-other-500	It was not till six o clock that I left the chateau taking with me the article hastily written by my friend in the little sitting room
none	none	 which Monsieur Robert Darzac had placed at our disposal 
1870-164330-0001	train-other-500	The reporter was to sleep at the chateau taking advantage of the to me inexplicable hospitality offered him by Monsieur Robert Darzac to whom Monsieur Stangerson in that sad time left the care of all his domestic affairs
1870-164330-0002	train-other-500	Nevertheless he insisted on accompanying me to the station at Epinay In crossing the park he said to me Frederic is really very clever and has not belied his reputation
1870-164330-0003	train-other-500	Do you know how he came to find Daddy Jacques s boots Near the spot where we noticed the traces of the neat boots and the disappearance of the rough ones there was a square hole freshly made in the moist ground
1870-164330-0004	train-other-500	where a stone had evidently been removed Larsan searched for that stone without finding it and at once imagined
none	none	 that it had been used by the murderer 
1870-164330-0005	train-other-500	with which to sink the boots in the lake
none	none	 Fred s calculation was an excellent one as the success of his search proves 
1870-164330-0006	train-other-500	That escaped me but my mind was turned in another direction by the large number of false indications of his track which the murderer left and by the measure of the black foot marks corresponding with that of Daddy Jacques s boots
1870-164330-0007	train-other-500	which I had established without his suspecting it
none	none	 on the floor of The Yellow Room All which was a proof in my eyes 
1870-164330-0008	train-other-500	that the murderer had sought to turn suspicion on to the old servant Up to that point
none	none	 Larsan and I are in accord but no further It is going to be a terrible matter 
1870-164330-0009	train-other-500	for I tell you he is working on wrong lines and I I must fight him with nothing I was surprised at the profoundly grave accent with which my young friend pronounced the last words He repeated
1870-164330-0010	train-other-500	Yes terrible terrible
none	none	 For it is fighting with nothing when you have only an idea to fight with 
1870-164330-0011	train-other-500	At that moment we passed by the back of the chateau Night had come A window on the first floor was partly open A feeble light came from it as well as some sounds which drew our attention
1870-164330-0012	train-other-500	We approached until we had reached the side of a door that was situated just under the window Rouletabille in a low tone made me understand that this was the window of Mademoiselle Stangerson s chamber
1870-164330-0013	train-other-500	The sounds which had attracted our attention ceased then were renewed for a moment and then we heard stifled sobs We were only able to catch these words which reached us distinctly
1870-164330-0014	train-other-500	My poor Robert Rouletabille whispered in my ear
none	none	 If we only knew what was being said in that chamber 
1870-164330-0015	train-other-500	my inquiry would soon be finished He looked about him The darkness of the evening enveloped us we could not see much beyond the narrow path bordered by trees which ran behind the chateau
1870-164330-0016	train-other-500	The sobs had ceased If we can t hear we may at least try to see said Rouletabille And making a sign to me to deaden the sound of my steps
1870-164330-0017	train-other-500	he led me across the path to the trunk of a tall beech tree the white bole of which was visible in the darkness This tree grew exactly in front of the window in which we were so much interested its lower branches
1870-164330-0018	train-other-500	being on a level with the first floor of the chateau From the height of those branches one might certainly see what was passing in Mademoiselle Stangerson s chamber Evidently that was what Rouletabille thought for enjoining me to remain hidden
1870-164330-0019	train-other-500	he clasped the trunk with his vigorous arms and climbed up I soon lost sight of him amid the branches and then followed a deep silence In front of me the open window remained lighted
1870-164330-0020	train-other-500	and I saw no shadow move across it I listened and presently from above me these words reached my ears
none	none	 After you 
1870-164330-0021	train-other-500	After you pray Somebody was overhead speaking exchanging courtesies What was my astonishment to see on the slippery column of the tree two human forms appear and quietly slip down to the ground
1870-164330-0022	train-other-500	Rouletabille had mounted alone and had returned with another Good evening Monsieur Sainclair It was Frederic Larsan The detective had already occupied the post of observation
1870-164330-0023	train-other-500	when my young friend had thought to reach it alone Neither noticed my astonishment I explained that to myself by the fact that they must have been witnesses of some tender and despairing scene between Mademoiselle Stangerson lying in her bed
1870-164330-0024	train-other-500	and Monsieur Darzac on his knees by her pillow I guessed that each had drawn different conclusions from what they had seen It was easy to see that the scene had strongly impressed Rouletabille in favour of Monsieur Robert Darzac
1870-164330-0025	train-other-500	while to Larsan it showed nothing but consummate hypocrisy acted with finished art by Mademoiselle Stangerson s fiance As we reached the park gate Larsan stopped us
none	none	 My cane 
1870-164330-0026	train-other-500	he cried I left it near the tree He left us saying he would rejoin us presently Have you noticed Frederic Larsan s cane asked the young reporter as soon as we were alone
none	none	 It is quite a new one which I have never seen him use before 
1870-164330-0027	train-other-500	He seems to take great care of it it never leaves him One would think he was afraid it might fall into the hands of strangers I never saw it before to day Where did he find it It isn t natural that a man who had never before used a walking stick should
1870-164330-0028	train-other-500	the day after the Glandier crime never move a step without one
none	none	 On the day of our arrival at the chateau as soon as he saw us he put his watch in his pocket 
1870-164330-0029	train-other-500	and picked up his cane from the ground a proceeding to which I was perhaps wrong not to attach some importance We were now out of the park Rouletabille had dropped into silence
1870-164330-0030	train-other-500	His thoughts were certainly still occupied with Frederic Larsan s new cane I had proof of that when as we came near to Epinay he said
none	none	 Frederic Larsan arrived at the Glandier before me 
1870-164330-0031	train-other-500	he began his inquiry before me he has had time to find out things about which I know nothing Where did he find that cane Then he added It is probable that his suspicion
none	none	 more than that his reasoning 
1870-164330-0032	train-other-500	has led him to lay his hand on something tangible Has this cane anything to do with it Where the deuce could he have found it As I had to wait twenty minutes for the train at Epinay
1870-164330-0033	train-other-500	we entered a wine shop Almost immediately the door opened and Frederic Larsan made his appearance brandishing his famous cane
none	none	 I found it 
1870-164330-0034	train-other-500	he said laughingly The three of us seated ourselves at a table Rouletabille never took his eyes off the cane he was so absorbed that he did not notice a sign Larsan made to a railway employe
1870-164330-0035	train-other-500	a young man with a chin decorated by a tiny blond and ill kept beard On the sign he rose paid for his drink bowed and went out I should not myself have attached any importance to the circumstance
none	none	 if it had not been recalled to my mind some months later 
1870-164330-0036	train-other-500	by the reappearance of the man with the beard at one of the most tragic moments of this case I then learned that the youth was one of Larsan s assistants and had been charged by him to watch the going and coming of travellers at the station of Epinay sur Orge
none	none	 Larsan neglected nothing in any case on which he was engaged 
1870-164330-0037	train-other-500	I turned my eyes again on Rouletabille Ah Monsieur Fred
none	none	 he said when did you begin to use a walking stick 
1870-164330-0038	train-other-500	I have always seen you walking with your hands in your pockets It is a present replied the detective Recent insisted Rouletabille No it was given to me in London
none	none	 Ah yes I remember you have just come from London 
1870-164330-0039	train-other-500	May I look at it Oh
none	none	 certainly 
1870-164330-0040	train-other-500	Fred passed the cane to Rouletabille It was a large yellow bamboo with a crutch handle and ornamented with a gold ring
none	none	 Rouletabille after examining it minutely 
1870-164330-0041	train-other-500	returned it to Larsan with a bantering expression on his face saying
none	none	 You were given a French cane in London Possibly said Fred imperturbably Read the mark there in tiny letters Cassette sixa Opera Cannot English people buy canes in Paris When Rouletabille had seen me into the train he said You ll remember the address Yes Cassette sixa Opera Rely on me you shall have word tomorrow morning That evening on reaching Paris I saw Monsieur Cassette dealer in walking sticks and umbrellas 
1870-164330-0044	train-other-500	and wrote to my friend A man unmistakably answering to the description of Monsieur Robert Darzac same height slightly stooping putty coloured overcoat bowler hat purchased a cane similar to the one in which we are interested
1870-164330-0045	train-other-500	on the evening of the crime about eight o clock Monsieur Cassette had not sold another such cane during the last two years Fred s cane is new It is quite clear that it s the same cane Fred did not buy it since he was in London
1870-164330-0046	train-other-500	Like you I think that he found it somewhere near Monsieur Robert Darzac But if as you suppose the murderer was in The Yellow Room for five or even six hours and the crime was not committed until towards midnight
none	none	 the purchase of this cane proves an incontestable alibi for Darzac CHAPTER XIII The Presbytery Has Lost Nothing of Its Charm Nor the Garden Its Brightness A week after the occurrence of the events I have just recounted on the second of November to be exact I received at my home in Paris the following telegraphic message Come to the Glandier by the earliest train Bring revolvers Friendly greetings Rouletabille I have already said I think that at that period being a young barrister with but few briefs I frequented the Palais de Justice rather for the purpose of familiarising myself with my professional duties than for the defence of the widow and orphan I could therefore feel no surprise at Rouletabille disposing of my time Moreover he knew how keenly interested I was in his journalistic adventures in general and above all in the murder at the Glandier I had not heard from him for a week nor of the progress made with that mysterious case except by the innumerable paragraphs in the newspapers and by the very brief notes of Rouletabille in the Epoque Those notes had divulged the fact that traces of human blood had been found on the mutton bone as well as fresh traces of the blood of Mademoiselle Stangerson the old stains belonged to other crimes probably dating years back It may be easily imagined that the crime engaged the attention of the press throughout the world No crime known had more absorbed the minds of people It appeared to me however that the judicial inquiry was making but very little progress and I should have been very glad if on the receipt of my friend s invitation to rejoin him at the Glandier the despatch had not contained the words Bring revolvers That puzzled me greatly Rouletabille telegraphing for revolvers meant that there might be occasion to use them Now I confess it without shame I am not a hero But here was a friend evidently in danger calling on me to go to his aid I did not hesitate long and after assuring myself that the only revolver I possessed was properly loaded I hurried towards the Orleans station On the way I remembered that Rouletabille had asked for two revolvers I therefore entered a gunsmith s shop and bought an excellent weapon for my friend I had hoped to find him at the station at Epinay but he was not there However a cab was waiting for me and I was soon at the Glandier Nobody was at the gate and it was only on the threshold of the chateau that I met the young man He saluted me with a friendly gesture and threw his arms about me inquiring warmly as to the state of my health When we were in the little sitting room of which I have spoken Rouletabille made me sit down It s going badly he said What s going badly I asked Everything He came nearer to me and whispered Frederic Larsan is working with might and main against Darzac This did not astonish me I had seen the poor show Mademoiselle Stangerson s fiance had made at the time of the examination of the footprints However I immediately asked What about that cane It is still in the hands of Frederic Larsan He never lets go of it But doesn t it prove the alibi for Monsieur Darzac Not at all Gently questioned by me Darzac denied having on that evening or on any other purchased a cane at Cassette s However said Rouletabille I ll not swear to anything Monsieur Darzac has such strange fits of silence that one does not know exactly what to think of what he says To Frederic Larsan this cane must mean a piece of very damaging evidence But in what way The time when it was bought shows it could not have been in the murderer s possession The time doesn t worry Larsan He is not obliged to adopt my theory which assumes that the murderer got into The Yellow Room between five and six o clock But there s nothing to prevent him assuming that the murderer got in between ten and eleven o clock at night At that hour Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson assisted by Daddy Jacques were engaged in making an interesting chemical experiment in the part of the laboratory taken up by the furnaces Larsan says unlikely as that may seem that the murderer may have slipped behind them He has already got the examining magistrate to listen to him When one looks closely into it the reasoning is absurd seeing that the intimate if there is one must have known that the professor would shortly leave the pavilion and that the friend had only to put off operating till after the professor s departure Why should he have risked crossing the laboratory while the professor was in it And then when he had got into The Yellow Room There are many points to be cleared up before Larsan s theory can be admitted I sha n t waste my time over it for my theory won t allow me to occupy myself with mere imagination Only as I am obliged for the moment to keep silent and Larsan sometimes talks he may finish by coming out openly against Monsieur Darzac if I m not there added the young reporter proudly For there are surface evidences against Darzac much more convincing than that cane which remains incomprehensible to me all the more so as Larsan does not in the least hesitate to let Darzac see him with it I understand many things in Larsan s theory but I can t make anything of that cane Is he still at the chateau Yes he hardly ever leaves it He sleeps there as I do at the request of Monsieur Stangerson who has done for him what Monsieur Robert Darzac has done for me In spite of the accusation made by Larsan that Monsieur Stangerson knows who the murderer is he yet affords him every facility for arriving at the truth just as Darzac is doing for me But you are convinced of Darzac s innocence At one time I did believe in the possibility of his guilt That was when we arrived here for the first time The time has come for me to tell you what has passed between Monsieur Darzac and myself Here Rouletabille interrupted himself and asked me if I had brought the revolvers I showed him them Having examined both he pronounced them excellent and handed them back to me Shall we have any use for them I asked No doubt this evening We shall pass the night here if that won t tire you On the contrary I said with an expression that made Rouletabille laugh No no he said this is no time for laughing You remember the phrase which was the open sesame of this chateau full of mystery Yes I said perfectly The presbytery has lost nothing of its charm nor the garden its brightness It was the phrase which you found on the half burned piece of paper amongst the ashes in the laboratory Yes at the bottom of the paper where the flame had not reached was this date twenty third of October Remember this date it is highly important I am now going to tell you about that curious phrase On the evening before the crime that is to say on the twenty third Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson were at a reception at the Elysee I know that because I was there on duty having to interview one of the savants of the Academy of Philadelphia who was being feted there I had never before seen either Monsieur or Mademoiselle Stangerson I was seated in the room which precedes the Salon des Ambassadeurs and tired of being jostled by so many noble personages I had fallen into a vague reverie when I scented near me the perfume of the lady in black Do you ask me what is the perfume of the lady in black It must suffice for you to know that it is a perfume of which I am very fond because it was that of a lady who had been very kind to me in my childhood a lady whom I had always seen dressed in black The lady who that evening was scented with the perfume of the lady in black was dressed in white She was wonderfully beautiful I could not help rising and following her An old man gave her his arm and as they passed I heard voices say Professor Stangerson and his daughter It was in that way I learned who it was I was following They met Monsieur Robert Darzac whom I knew by sight Professor Stangerson accosted by mister Arthur William Rance one of the American savants seated himself in the great gallery and Monsieur Robert Darzac led Mademoiselle Stangerson into the conservatory I followed The weather was very mild that evening the garden doors were open Mademoiselle Stangerson threw a fichu shawl over her shoulders and I plainly saw that it was she who was begging Monsieur Darzac to go with her into the garden I continued to follow interested by the agitation plainly exhibited by the bearing of Monsieur Darzac They slowly passed along the wall abutting on the Avenue Marigny I took the central alley walking parallel with them and then crossed over for the purpose of getting nearer to them The night was dark and the grass deadened the sound of my steps They had stopped under the vacillating light of a gas jet and appeared to be both bending over a paper held by Mademoiselle Stangerson reading something which deeply interested them I stopped in the darkness and silence Neither of them saw me and I distinctly heard Mademoiselle Stangerson repeat as she was refolding the paper The presbytery has lost nothing of its charm nor the garden its brightness It was said in a tone at once mocking and despairing and was followed by a burst of such nervous laughter that I think her words will never cease to sound in my ears But another phrase was uttered by Monsieur Robert Darzac Must I commit a crime then to win you He was in an extraordinarily agitated state He took the hand of Mademoiselle Stangerson and held it for a long time to his lips and I thought from the movement of his shoulders that he was crying Then they went away When I returned to the great gallery continued Rouletabille I saw no more of Monsieur Robert Darzac and I was not to see him again until after the tragedy at the Glandier Mademoiselle was near mister Rance who was talking with much animation his eyes during the conversation glowing with a singular brightness Mademoiselle Stangerson I thought was not even listening to what he was saying her face expressing perfect indifference His face was the red face of a drunkard When Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson left he went to the bar and remained there I joined him and rendered him some little service in the midst of the pressing crowd He thanked me and told me he was returning to America three days later that is to say on the twenty sixth the day after the crime I talked with him about Philadelphia he told me he had lived there for five and twenty years and that it was there he had met the illustrious Professor Stangerson and his daughter He drank a great deal of champagne and when I left him he was very nearly drunk Such were my experiences on that evening and I leave you to imagine what effect the news of the attempted murder of Mademoiselle Stangerson produced on me with what force those words pronounced by Monsieur Robert Darzac Must I commit a crime then to win you recurred to me It was not this phrase however that I repeated to him when we met here at Glandier The sentence of the presbytery and the bright garden sufficed to open the gate of the chateau If you ask me if I believe now that Monsieur Darzac is the murderer I must say I do not I do not think I ever quite thought that At the time I could not really think seriously of anything I had so little evidence to go on But I needed to have at once the proof that he had not been wounded in the hand When we were alone together I told him how I had chanced to overhear a part of his conversation with Mademoiselle Stangerson in the garden of the Elysee and when I repeated to him the words Must I commit a crime then to win you he was greatly troubled though much less so than he had been by hearing me repeat the phrase about the presbytery What threw him into a state of real consternation was to learn from me that the day on which he had gone to meet Mademoiselle Stangerson at the Elysee was the very day on which she had gone to the Post Office for the letter It was that letter perhaps which ended with the words The presbytery has lost nothing of its charm nor the garden its brightness My surmise was confirmed by my finding if you remember in the ashes of the laboratory the fragment of paper dated October the twenty third The letter had been written and withdrawn from the Post Office on the same day There can be no doubt that on returning from the Elysee that night Mademoiselle Stangerson had tried to destroy that compromising paper It was in vain that Monsieur Darzac denied that that letter had anything whatever to do with the crime I told him that in an affair so filled with mystery as this he had no right to hide this letter that I was persuaded it was of considerable importance that the desperate tone in which Mademoiselle Stangerson had pronounced the prophetic phrase that his own tears and the threat of a crime which he had professed after the letter was read all these facts tended to leave no room for me to doubt Monsieur Darzac became more and more agitated and I determined to take advantage of the effect I had produced on him You were on the point of being married Monsieur I said negligently and without looking at him and suddenly your marriage becomes impossible because of the writer of that letter because as soon as his letter was read you spoke of the necessity for a crime to win Mademoiselle Stangerson Therefore there is someone between you and her someone who has attempted to kill her so that she should not be able to marry And I concluded with these words Now monsieur you have only to tell me in confidence the name of the murderer The words I had uttered must have struck him ominously for when I turned my eyes on him I saw that his face was haggard the perspiration standing on his forehead and terror showing in his eyes Monsieur he said to me I am going to ask of you something which may appear insane but in exchange for which I place my life in your hands You must not tell the magistrates of what you saw and heard in the garden of the Elysee neither to them nor to anybody I swear to you that I am innocent and I know I feel that you believe me but I would rather be taken for the guilty man than see justice go astray on that phrase The presbytery has lost nothing of its charm nor the garden its brightness The judges must know nothing about that phrase All this matter is in your hands Monsieur I leave it there but forget the evening at the Elysee A hundred other roads are open to you in your search for the criminal I will open them for you myself I will help you Will you take up your quarters here You may remain here to do as you please Eat sleep here watch my actions the actions of all here You shall be master of the Glandier Monsieur but forget the evening at the Elysee Rouletabille here paused to take breath I now understood what had appeared so unexplainable in the demeanour of Monsieur Robert Darzac towards my friend and the facility with which the young reporter had been able to install himself on the scene of the crime My curiosity could not fail to be excited by all I had heard I asked Rouletabille to satisfy it still further What had happened at the Glandier during the past week Had he not told me that there were surface indications against Monsieur Darzac much more terrible than that of the cane found by Larsan Everything seems to be pointing against him replied my friend and the situation is becoming exceedingly grave Monsieur Darzac appears not to mind it much but in that he is wrong I was interested only in the health of Mademoiselle Stangerson which was daily improving when something occurred that is even more mysterious than than the mystery of The Yellow Room Impossible I cried What could be more mysterious than that Let us first go back to Monsieur Robert Darzac said Rouletabille calming me I have said that everything seems to be pointing against him The marks of the neat boots found by Frederic Larsan appear to be really the footprints of Mademoiselle Stangerson s fiance The marks made by the bicycle may have been made by his bicycle He had usually left it at the chateau why did he take it to Paris on that particular occasion Was it because he was not going to return again to the chateau Was it because owing to the breaking off of his marriage his relations with the Stangersons were to cease All who are interested in the matter affirm that those relations were to continue unchanged Frederic Larsan however believes that all relations were at an end From the day when Monsieur Darzac accompanied Mademoiselle Stangerson to the Grands Magasins de la Louvre until the day after the crime he had not been at the Glandier Remember that Mademoiselle Stangerson lost her reticule containing the key with the brass head while she was in his company From that day to the evening at the Elysee the Sorbonne professor and Mademoiselle Stangerson did not see one another but they may have written to each other Mademoiselle Stangerson went to the Post Office to get a letter which Larsan says was written by Robert Darzac for knowing nothing of what had passed at the Elysee Larsan believes that it was Monsieur Darzac himself who stole the reticule with the key with the design of forcing her consent by getting possession of the precious papers of her father papers which he would have restored to him on condition that the marriage engagement was to be fulfilled All that would have been a very doubtful and almost absurd hypothesis as Larsan admitted to me but for another and much graver circumstance In the first place here is something which I have not been able to explain Monsieur Darzac had himself on the twenty fourth gone to the Post Office to ask for the letter which Mademoiselle had called for and received on the previous evening The description of the man who made application tallies in every respect with the appearance of Monsieur Darzac who in answer to the questions put to him by the examining magistrate denies that he went to the Post Office Now even admitting that the letter was written by him which I do not believe he knew that Mademoiselle Stangerson had received it since he had seen it in her hands in the garden at the Elysee It could not have been he then who had gone to the Post Office the day after the twenty fourth to ask for a letter which he knew was no longer there To me it appears clear that somebody strongly resembling him stole Mademoiselle Stangerson s reticule and in that letter had demanded of her something which she had not sent him He must have been surprised at the failure of his demand hence his application at the Post Office to learn whether his letter had been delivered to the person to whom it had been addressed Finding that it had been claimed he had become furious What had he demanded Nobody but Mademoiselle Stangerson knows Then on the day following it is reported that she had been attacked during the night and the next day I discovered that the Professor had at the same time been robbed by means of the key referred to in the poste restante letter It would seem then that the man who went to the Post Office to inquire for the letter must have been the murderer All these arguments Larsan applies as against Monsieur Darzac You may be sure that the examining magistrate Larsan and myself have done our best to get from the Post Office precise details relative to the singular personage who applied there on the twenty fourth of October But nothing has been learned We don t know where he came from or where he went Beyond the description which makes him resemble Monsieur Darzac we know nothing I have announced in the leading journals that a handsome reward will be given to a driver of any public conveyance who drove a fare to No forty Post Office about ten o clock on the morning of the twenty fourth of October Information to be addressed to M R at the office of the Epoque but no answer has resulted The man may have walked but as he was most likely in a hurry there was a chance that he might have gone in a cab Who I keep asking myself night and day is the man who so strongly resembles Monsieur Robert Darzac and who is also known to have bought the cane which has fallen into Larsan s hands The most serious fact is that Monsieur Darzac was at the very same time that his double presented himself at the Post Office scheduled for a lecture at the Sorbonne He had not delivered that lecture and one of his friends took his place When I questioned him as to how he had employed the time he told me that he had gone for a stroll in the Bois de Boulogne What do you think of a professor who instead of giving his lecture obtains a substitute to go for a stroll in the Bois de Boulogne When Frederic Larsan asked him for information on this point he quietly replied that it was no business of his how he spent his time in Paris On which Fred swore aloud that he would find out without anybody s help All this seems to fit in with Fred s hypothesis namely that Monsieur Stangerson allowed the murderer to escape in order to avoid a scandal The hypothesis is further substantiated by the fact that Darzac was in The Yellow Room and was permitted to get away That hypothesis I believe to be a false one Larsan is being misled by it though that would not displease me did it not affect an innocent person Now does that hypothesis really mislead Frederic Larsan That is the question that is the question Perhaps he is right I cried interrupting Rouletabille Are you sure that Monsieur Darzac is innocent It seems to me that these are extraordinary coincidences Coincidences replied my friend are the worst enemies to truth What does the examining magistrate think now of the matter Monsieur de Marquet hesitates to accuse Monsieur Darzac in the absence of absolute proofs Not only would he have public opinion wholly against him to say nothing of the Sorbonne but Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson She adores Monsieur Robert Darzac Indistinctly as she saw the murderer it would be hard to make the public believe that she could not have recognised him if Darzac had been the criminal No doubt The Yellow Room was very dimly lit but a night light however small gives some light Here my boy is how things stood when three days or rather three nights ago an extraordinarily strange incident occurred CHAPTER XIV I Expect the Assassin This Evening I must take you said Rouletabille so as to enable you to understand to the various scenes I myself believe that I have discovered what everybody else is searching for 
2050-164332-0001	train-other-500	namely how the murderer escaped from The Yellow Room without any accomplice and without Mademoiselle Stangerson having had anything to do with it But so long as I am not sure of the real murderer I cannot state the theory on which I am working
none	none	 I can only say that I believe it to be correct and in any case a quite natural and simple one 
2050-164332-0002	train-other-500	As to what happened in this place three nights ago
none	none	 I must say it kept me wondering for a whole day and a night 
2050-164332-0003	train-other-500	It passes all belief The theory I have formed from the incident is so absurd that I would rather matters remained as yet unexplained
none	none	 Saying which the young reporter invited me to go and make the tour of the chateau with him 
2050-164332-0004	train-other-500	The only sound to be heard was the crunching of the dead leaves beneath our feet The silence was so intense that one might have thought the chateau had been abandoned
2050-164332-0005	train-other-500	The old stones the stagnant water of the ditch surrounding the donjon the bleak ground strewn with the dead leaves the dark skeleton like outlines of the trees all contributed to give to the desolate place now filled with its awful mystery
2050-164332-0006	train-other-500	a most funereal aspect As we passed round the donjon we met the Green Man the forest keeper who did not greet us but walked by as if we had not existed He was looking just as I had formerly seen him through the window of the Donjon Inn
2050-164332-0007	train-other-500	He had still his fowling piece slung at his back his pipe was in his mouth and his eye glasses on his nose An odd kind of fish Rouletabille said to me in a low tone Have you spoken to him I asked Yes but
2050-164332-0008	train-other-500	I could get nothing out of him His only answers are grunts and shrugs of the shoulders He generally lives on the first floor of the donjon a big room that once served for an oratory He lives like a bear never goes out without his gun and is only pleasant with the girls
2050-164332-0009	train-other-500	The women for twelve miles round are all setting their caps for him For the present he is paying attention to Madame Mathieu whose husband is keeping a lynx eye upon her in consequence
2050-164332-0010	train-other-500	After passing the donjon which is situated at the extreme end of the left wing we went to the back of the chateau Rouletabille pointing to a window which I recognised as the only one belonging to Mademoiselle Stangerson s apartment said to me
none	none	 If you had been here two nights ago you would have seen your humble servant at the top of a ladder 
2050-164332-0011	train-other-500	about to enter the chateau by that window As I expressed some surprise at this piece of nocturnal gymnastics
none	none	 he begged me to notice carefully the exterior disposition of the chateau We then went back into the building I must now show you the first floor of the chateau where I am living said my friend To enable the reader the better to understand the disposition of these parts of the dwelling I annex a plan of the first floor of the right wing drawn by Rouletabille the day after the extraordinary phenomenon occurred the details of which I am about to relate boudoir \ four Mlle Mlle mister Lumber Strangerson s Strangerson s Strangerson s Room Sitting Bed Room Room Room stair case bath anteroom two Right Gallery Right Wing three Right Gallery Left Wing Roulet W G tabille s I A Right Wing Left Wing Room N L of the D L Chateau Frederic I E Larsan s N R Room G Y one five six Rouletabille motioned me to follow him up a magnificent flight of stairs ending in a landing on the first floor From this landing one could pass to the right or left wing of the chateau by a gallery opening from it 
2050-164332-0012	train-other-500	This gallery high and wide extended along the whole length of the building and was lit from the front of the chateau facing the north The rooms the windows of which looked to the south opened out of the gallery
2050-164332-0013	train-other-500	Professor Stangerson inhabited the left wing of the building Mademoiselle Stangerson had her apartment in the right wing We entered the gallery to the right A narrow carpet laid on the waxed oaken floor which shone like glass deadened the sound of our footsteps
none	none	 Rouletabille asked me in a low tone to walk carefully as we were passing the door of Mademoiselle Stangerson s apartment This consisted of a bed room an ante room a small bath room a boudoir and a drawing room One could pass from one to another of these rooms without having to go by way of the gallery The gallery continued straight to the western end of the building where it was lit by a high window window two on the plan At about two thirds of its length this gallery at a right angle joined another gallery following the course of the right wing The better to follow this narrative we shall call the gallery leading from the stairs to the eastern window the right gallery and the gallery quitting it at a right angle the off turning gallery winding gallery in the plan It was at the meeting point of the two galleries that Rouletabille had his chamber adjoining that of Frederic Larsan the door of each opening on to the off turning gallery while the doors of Mademoiselle Stangerson s apartment opened into the right gallery See the plan Rouletabille opened the door of his room and after we had passed in carefully drew the bolt I had not had time to glance round the place in which he had been installed when he uttered a cry of surprise and pointed to a pair of eye glasses on a side table What are these doing here he asked I should have been puzzled to answer him I wonder he said I wonder if this is what I have been searching for I wonder if these are the eye glasses from the presbytery 
2050-164332-0014	train-other-500	He seized them eagerly his fingers caressing the glass Then looking at me with an expression of terror on his face he murmured Oh Oh He repeated the exclamation again and again as if his thoughts had suddenly turned his brain
none	none	 He rose and putting his hand on my shoulder laughed like one demented as he said Those glasses will drive me silly Mathematically speaking the thing is possible but humanly speaking it is impossible or afterwards or afterwards Two light knocks struck the door 
2050-164332-0015	train-other-500	Rouletabille opened it A figure entered
none	none	 I recognised the concierge whom I had seen when she was being taken to the pavilion for examination 
2050-164332-0016	train-other-500	I was surprised thinking she was still under lock and key This woman said in a very low tone In the grove of the parquet Rouletabille replied Thanks The woman then left He again turned to me his look haggard
none	none	 after having carefully refastened the door muttering some incomprehensible phrases 
2050-164332-0017	train-other-500	If the thing is mathematically possible why should it not be humanly And if it is humanly possible the matter is simply awful I interrupted him in his soliloquy
none	none	 Have they set the concierges at liberty then 
2050-164332-0018	train-other-500	I asked Yes he replied I had them liberated I needed people I could trust The woman is thoroughly devoted to me and her husband would lay down his life for me Oho I said when will he have occasion to do it
2050-164332-0019	train-other-500	This evening for this evening I expect the murderer You expect the murderer this evening Then you know him I shall know him but I should be mad to affirm categorically at this moment that I do know him
2050-164332-0020	train-other-500	The mathematical idea I have of the murderer gives results so frightful
none	none	 so monstrous that I hope it is still possible that I am mistaken 
2050-164332-0021	train-other-500	I hope so with all my heart
none	none	 Five minutes ago you did not know the murderer how can you say that you expect him this evening 
2050-164332-0022	train-other-500	Because I know that he must come Rouletabille very slowly filled his pipe and lit it That meant an interesting story At that moment we heard some one walking in the gallery and passing before our door Rouletabille listened
none	none	 The sound of the footstep died away in the distance 
2050-164332-0023	train-other-500	Is Frederic Larsan in his room I asked pointing to the partition No my friend answered He went to Paris this morning still on the scent of Darzac who also left for Paris That matter will turn out badly
2050-164332-0024	train-other-500	I expect that Monsieur Darzac will be arrested in the course of the next week
none	none	 The worst of it is that everything seems to be in league against him 
2050-164332-0025	train-other-500	circumstances things people Not an hour passes without bringing some new evidence against him The examining magistrate is overwhelmed by it and blind Frederic Larsan however is not a novice I said I thought so
2050-164332-0026	train-other-500	said Rouletabille with a slightly contemptuous turn of his lips I fancied he was a much abler man I had indeed a great admiration for him before I got to know his method of working It s deplorable He owes his reputation solely to his ability
2050-164332-0027	train-other-500	but he lacks reasoning power the mathematics of his ideas are very poor I looked closely at Rouletabille and could not help smiling on hearing this boy of eighteen talking of a man who had proved to the world that he was the finest police sleuth in Europe You smile
none	none	 he said you are wrong I swear I will outwit him and in a striking way 
2050-164332-0028	train-other-500	But I must make haste about it for he has an enormous start on me given him by Monsieur Robert Darzac who is this evening going to increase it still more
none	none	 Think of it 
2050-164332-0029	train-other-500	every time the murderer comes to the chateau Monsieur Darzac by a strange fatality absents himself and refuses to give any account of how he employs his time Every time the assassin comes to the chateau I cried
2050-164332-0030	train-other-500	Has he returned then Yes during that famous night when the strange phenomenon occurred
none	none	 I was now going to learn about the astonishing phenomenon to which Rouletabille had made allusion half an hour earlier without giving me any explanation of it 
2050-164332-0031	train-other-500	But I had learned never to press Rouletabille in his narratives He spoke when the fancy took him and when he judged it to be right He was less concerned about my curiosity than he was for making a complete summing up for himself of any important matter in which he was interested
none	none	 At last in short rapid phrases he acquainted me with things which plunged me into a state bordering on complete bewilderment 
2050-164332-0032	train-other-500	Indeed the results of that still unknown science known as hypnotism for example were not more inexplicable than the disappearance of the matter of the murderer at the moment when four persons were within touch of him I speak of hypnotism as I would of electricity
2050-164332-0033	train-other-500	for of the nature of both we are ignorant and we know little of their laws I cite these examples because at the time the case appeared to me to be only explicable by the inexplicable that is to say by an event outside of known natural laws
none	none	 And yet if I had had Rouletabille s brain I should like him have had a presentiment of the natural explanation 
2050-164332-0034	train-other-500	for the most curious thing about all the mysteries of the Glandier case
none	none	 was the natural manner in which 
1347-164338-0020	train-other-500	he explained
none	none	 them 
2050-164332-0035	train-other-500	I have among the papers that were sent me by the young man after the affair was over a note book of his in which a complete account is given of the phenomenon of the disappearance of the matter of the assassin and the thoughts to which it gave rise in the mind of my young friend
none	none	 It is preferable I think to give the reader this account rather than continue to reproduce my conversation with Rouletabille for I should be afraid in a history of this nature to add a word that was not in accordance with the strictest truth CHAPTER XV The Trap EXTRACT FROM THE NOTE BOOK OF JOSEPH ROULETABILLE Last night the night between the twenty ninth and thirtieth of October wrote Joseph Rouletabille I woke up towards one o clock in the morning Was it sleeplessness or noise without The cry of the Bete du Bon Dieu rang out with sinister loudness from the end of the park I rose and opened the window Cold wind and rain opaque darkness silence I reclosed my window Again the sound of the cat s weird cry in the distance I partly dressed in haste The weather was too bad for even a cat to be turned out in it What did it mean then that imitating of the mewing of Mother Angenoux cat so near the chateau I seized a good sized stick the only weapon I had and without making any noise opened the door The gallery into which I went was well lit by a lamp with a reflector I felt a keen current of air and on turning found the window open at the extreme end of the gallery which I call the off turning gallery to distinguish it from the right gallery on to which the apartment of Mademoiselle Stangerson opened These two galleries cross each other at right angles Who had left that window open Or who had come to open it I went to the window and leaned out Five feet below me there was a sort of terrace over the semi circular projection of a room on the ground floor One could if one wanted jump from the window on to the terrace and allow oneself to drop from it into the court of the chateau Whoever had entered by this road had evidently not had a key to the vestibule door But why should I be thinking of my previous night s attempt with the ladder Because of the open window left open perhaps by the negligence of a servant I reclosed it smiling at the ease with which I built a drama on the mere suggestion of an open window Again the cry of the Bete du Bon Dieu and then silence The rain ceased to beat on the window All in the chateau slept I walked with infinite precaution on the carpet of the gallery On reaching the corner of the right gallery I peered round it cautiously There was another lamp there with a reflector which quite lit up the several objects in it three chairs and some pictures hanging on the wall What was I doing there Perfect silence reigned throughout Everything was sunk in repose What was the instinct that urged me towards Mademoiselle Stangerson s chamber Why did a voice within me cry Go on to the chamber of Mademoiselle Stangerson I cast my eyes down upon the carpet on which I was treading and saw that my steps were being directed towards Mademoiselle Stangerson s chamber by the marks of steps that had already been made there Yes on the carpet were traces of footsteps stained with mud leading to the chamber of Mademoiselle Stangerson Horror Horror I recognised in those footprints the impression of the neat boots of the murderer He had come then from without in this wretched night If you could descend from the gallery by way of the window by means of the terrace then you could get into the chateau by the same means The murderer was still in the chateau for here were marks as of returning footsteps He had entered by the open window at the extremity of the off turning gallery he had passed Frederic Larsan s door and mine had turned to the right and had entered Mademoiselle Stangerson s room I am before the door of her ante room it is open I push it without making the least noise Under the door of the room itself I see a streak of light I listen no sound not even of breathing Ah if I only knew what was passing in the silence that is behind that door I find the door locked and the key turned on the inner side And the murderer is there perhaps He must be there Will he escape this time All depends on me I must be calm and above all I must make no false steps I must see into that room I can enter it by Mademoiselle Stangerson s drawing room but to do that I should have to cross her boudoir and while I am there the murderer may escape by the gallery door the door in front of which I am now standing I am sure that no other crime is being committed on this night for there is complete silence in the boudoir where two nurses are taking care of Mademoiselle Stangerson until she is restored to health As I am almost sure that the murderer is there why do I not at once give the alarm The murderer may perhaps escape but perhaps I may be able to save Mademoiselle Stangerson s life Suppose the murderer on this occasion is not here to murder The door has been opened to allow him to enter by whom And it has been refastened by whom Mademoiselle Stangerson shuts herself up in her apartment with her nurses every night Who turned the key of that chamber to allow the murderer to enter The nurses two faithful domestics The old chambermaid Sylvia It is very improbable Besides they slept in the boudoir and Mademoiselle Stangerson very nervous and careful Monsieur Robert Darzac told me sees to her own safety since she has been well enough to move about in her room which I have not yet seen her leave This nervousness and sudden care on her part which had struck Monsieur Darzac had given me also food for thought At the time of the crime in The Yellow Room there can be no doubt that she expected the murderer Was he expected this night Was it she herself who had opened her door to him Had she some reason for doing so Was she obliged to do it Was it a meeting for purposes of crime Certainly it was not a lover s meeting for I believe Mademoiselle Stangerson adores Monsieur Darzac All these reflections ran through my brain like a flash of lightning What would I not give to know It is possible that there was some reason for the awful silence My intervention might do more harm than good How could I tell How could I know I might not any moment cause another crime If I could only see and know without breaking that silence I left the ante room and descended the central stairs to the vestibule and as silently as possible made my way to the little room on the ground floor where Daddy Jacques had been sleeping since the attack made at the pavilion I found him dressed his eyes wide open almost haggard He did not seem surprised to see me He told me that he had got up because he had heard the cry of the Bete du bon Dieu and because he had heard footsteps in the park close to his window out of which he had looked and just then had seen a black shadow pass by I asked him whether he had a firearm of any kind No he no longer kept one since the examining magistrate had taken his revolver from him We went out together by a little back door into the park and stole along the chateau to the point which is just below Mademoiselle Stangerson s window I placed Daddy Jacques against the wall ordering him not to stir from the spot while I taking advantage of a moment when the moon was hidden by a cloud moved to the front of the window out of the patch of light which came from it for the window was half open If I could only know what was passing in that silent chamber I returned to Daddy Jacques and whispered the word ladder in his ear At first I had thought of the tree which a week ago served me for an observatory but I immediately saw that from the way the window was half opened I should not be able to see from that point of view anything that was passing in the room and I wanted not only to see but to hear and to act Greatly agitated almost trembling Daddy Jacques disappeared for a moment and returned without the ladder but making signs to me with his arms as signals to me to come quickly to him When I got near him he gasped Come I went to the donjon in search of my ladder and in the lower part of the donjon which serves me and the gardener for a lumber room I found the door open and the ladder gone On coming out that s what I caught sight of by the light of the moon And he pointed to the further end of the chateau where a ladder stood resting against the stone brackets supporting the terrace under the window which I had found open The projection of the terrace had prevented my seeing it Thanks to that ladder it was quite easy to get into the off turning gallery of the first floor and I had no doubt of it having been the road taken by the unknown We ran to the ladder but at the moment of reaching it Daddy Jacques drew my attention to the half open door of the little semi circular room situated under the terrace at the extremity of the right wing of the chateau having the terrace for its roof Daddy Jacques pushed the door open a little further and looked in He s not there he whispered Who is not there The forest keeper With his lips once more to my ear he added Do you know that he has slept in the upper room of the donjon ever since it was restored And with the same gesture he pointed to the half open door the ladder the terrace and the windows in the off turning gallery which a little while before I had re closed What were my thoughts then I had no time to think I felt more than I thought Evidently I felt if the forest keeper is up there in the chamber I say if because at this moment apart from the presence of the ladder and his vacant room there are no evidences which permit me even to suspect him if he is there he has been obliged to pass by the ladder and the rooms which lie behind his in his new lodging are occupied by the family of the steward and by the cook and by the kitchens which bar the way by the vestibule to the interior of the chateau And if he had been there during the evening on any pretext it would have been easy for him to go into the gallery and see that the window could be simply pushed open from the outside This question of the unfastened window easily narrowed the field of search for the murderer He must belong to the house unless he had an accomplice which I do not believe he had unless unless Mademoiselle Stangerson herself had seen that that window was not fastened from the inside But then what could be the frightful secret which put her under the necessity of doing away with obstacles that separated her from the murderer I seized hold of the ladder and we returned to the back of the chateau to see if the window of the chamber was still half open The blind was drawn but did not join and allowed a bright stream of light to escape and fall upon the path at our feet I planted the ladder under the window I am almost sure that I made no noise and while Daddy Jacques remained at the foot of the ladder I mounted it very quietly my stout stick in my hand I held my breath and lifted my feet with the greatest care Suddenly a heavy cloud discharged itself at that moment in a fresh downpour of rain At the same instant the sinister cry of the Bete du bon Dieu arrested me in my ascent It seemed to me to have come from close by me only a few yards away Was the cry a signal Had some accomplice of the man seen me on the ladder Would the cry bring the man to the window Perhaps Ah there he was at the window I felt his head above me I heard the sound of his breath I could not look up towards him the least movement of my head and I might be lost Would he see me Would he peer into the darkness No he went away He had seen nothing I felt rather than heard him moving on tip toe in the room and I mounted a few steps higher My head reached to the level of the window sill my forehead rose above it my eyes looked between the opening in the blinds and I saw A man seated at Mademoiselle Stangerson s little desk writing His back was turned toward me A candle was lit before him and he bent over the flame the light from it projecting shapeless shadows I saw nothing but a monstrous stooping back Mademoiselle Stangerson herself was not there Her bed had not been lain on Where then was she sleeping that night Doubtless in the side room with her women Perhaps this was but a guess I must content myself with the joy of finding the man alone I must be calm to prepare my trap But who then is this man writing there before my eyes seated at the desk as if he were in his own home If there had not been that ladder under the window if there had not been those footprints on the carpet in the gallery if there had not been that open window I might have been led to think that this man had a right to be there and that he was there as a matter of course and for reasons about which as yet I knew nothing But there was no doubt that this mysterious unknown was the man of The Yellow Room the man to whose murderous assault Mademoiselle Stangerson without denouncing him had had to submit If I could but see his face Surprise and capture him If I spring into the room at this moment he will escape by the right hand door opening into the boudoir or crossing the drawing room he will reach the gallery and I shall lose him I have him now and in five minutes more he ll be safer than if I had him in a cage What is he doing there alone in Mademoiselle Stangerson s room What is he writing I descend and place the ladder on the ground Daddy Jacques follows me We re enter the chateau I send Daddy Jacques to wake Monsieur Stangerson and instruct him to await my coming in Mademoiselle Stangerson s room and to say nothing definite to him before my arrival I will go and awaken Frederic Larsan It s a bore to have to do it for I should have liked to work alone and to have carried off all the honors of this affair myself right under the very nose of the sleeping detective But Daddy Jacques and Monsieur Stangerson are old men and I am not yet fully developed I might not be strong enough Larsan is used to wrestling and putting on the handcuffs He opened his eyes swollen with sleep ready to send me flying without in the least believing in my reporter s fancies I had to assure him that the man was there That s strange he said I thought I left him this afternoon in Paris He dressed himself in haste and armed himself with a revolver We stole quietly into the gallery Where is he Larsan asked In Mademoiselle Stangerson s room And Mademoiselle Stangerson She is not in there Let s go in Don t go there On the least alarm the man will escape He has four ways by which to do it the door the window the boudoir or the room in which the women are sleeping I ll draw him from below And if you fail If you only succeed in wounding him he ll escape again without reckoning that he is certainly armed No let me direct the expedition and I ll answer for everything As you like he replied with fairly good grace Then after satisfying myself that all the windows of the two galleries were thoroughly secure I placed Frederic Larsan at the end of the off turning gallery before the window which I had found open and had reclosed Under no consideration I said to him must you stir from this post till I call you The chances are even that the man when he is pursued will return to this window and try to save himself that way for it is by that way he came in and made a way ready for his flight You have a dangerous post What will be yours asked Fred I shall spring into the room and knock him over for you Take my revolver said Fred and I ll take your stick Thanks I said You are a brave man I accepted his offer I was going to be alone with the man in the room writing and was really thankful to have the weapon I left Fred having posted him at the window No five on the plan and with the greatest precaution went towards Monsieur Stangerson s apartment in the left wing of the chateau I found him with Daddy Jacques who had faithfully obeyed my directions confining himself to asking his master to dress as quickly as possible In a few words I explained to Monsieur Stangerson what was passing He armed himself with a revolver followed me and we were all three speedily in the gallery Since I had seen the murderer seated at the desk ten minutes had elapsed Monsieur Stangerson wished to spring upon the assassin at once and kill him I made him understand that above all he must not in his desire to kill him miss him When I had sworn to him that his daughter was not in the room and in no danger he conquered his impatience and left me to direct the operations I told them that they must come to me the moment I called to them or when I fired my revolver I then sent Daddy Jacques to place himself before the window at the end of the right gallery No two on my plan I chose that position for Daddy Jacques because I believed that the murderer tracked on leaving the room would run through the gallery towards the window which he had left open and instantly seeing that it was guarded by Larsan would pursue his course along the right gallery There he would encounter Daddy Jacques who would prevent his springing out of the window into the park Under that window there was a sort of buttress while all the other windows in the galleries were at such a height from the ground that it was almost impossible to jump from them without breaking one s neck All the doors and windows including those of the lumber room at the end of the right gallery as I had rapidly assured myself were strongly secured Having indicated to Daddy Jacques the post he was to occupy and having seen him take up his position I placed Monsieur Stangerson on the landing at the head of the stairs not far from the door of his daughter s ante room rather than the boudoir where the women were and the door of which must have been locked by Mademoiselle Stangerson herself if as I thought she had taken refuge in the boudoir for the purpose of avoiding the murderer who was coming to see her In any case he must return to the gallery where my people were awaiting him at every possible exit On coming there he would see on his left Monsieur Stangerson he would turn to the right towards the off turning gallery the way he had pre arranged for flight where at the intersection of the two galleries he would see at once as I have explained on his left Frederic Larsan at the end of the off turning gallery and in front Daddy Jacques at the end of the right gallery Monsieur Stangerson and myself would arrive by way of the back of the chateau He is ours He can no longer escape us I was sure of that The plan I had formed seemed to me the best the surest and the most simple It would no doubt have been simpler still if we had been able to place some one directly behind the door of Mademoiselle s boudoir which opened out of her bedchamber and in that way had been in a position to besiege the two doors of the room in which the man was But we could not penetrate the boudoir except by way of the drawing room the door of which had been locked on the inside by Mademoiselle Stangerson But even if I had had the free disposition of the boudoir I should have held to the plan I had formed because any other plan of attack would have separated us at the moment of the struggle with the man while my plan united us all for the attack at a spot which I had selected with almost mathematical precision the intersection of the two galleries Having so placed my people I again left the chateau hurried to my ladder and replacing it climbed up revolver in hand If there be any inclined to smile at my taking so many precautionary measures I refer them to the mystery of The Yellow Room and to all the proofs we have of the weird cunning of the murderer Further if there be some who think my observations needlessly minute at a moment when they ought to be completely held by rapidity of movement and decision of action I reply that I have wished to report here at length and completely all the details of a plan of attack conceived so rapidly that it is only the slowness of my pen that gives an appearance of slowness to the execution I have wished by this slowness and precision to be certain that nothing should be omitted from the conditions under which the strange phenomenon was produced which until some natural explanation of it is forthcoming seems to me to prove even better than the theories of Professor Stangerson the Dissociation of Matter I will even say the instantaneous Dissociation of Matter CHAPTER XVI Strange Phenomenon of the Dissociation of Matter EXTRACT FROM THE NOTE BOOK OF JOSEPH ROULETABILLE continued I am again at the window sill continues Rouletabille and once more I raise my head above it Through an opening in the curtains the arrangement of which has not been changed I am ready to look anxious to note the position in which I am going to find the murderer whether his back will still be turned towards me whether he is still seated at the desk writing But perhaps perhaps he is no longer there Yet how could he have fled Was I not in possession of his ladder I force myself to be cool I raise my head yet higher I look he is still there I see his monstrous back deformed by the shadow thrown by the candle He is no longer writing now and the candle is on the parquet over which he is bending a position which serves my purpose I hold my breath I mount the ladder I am on the uppermost rung of it and with my left hand seize hold of the window sill In this moment of approaching success I feel my heart beating wildly I put my revolver between my teeth A quick spring and I shall be on the window ledge But the ladder I had been obliged to press on it heavily and my foot had scarcely left it when I felt it swaying beneath me It grated on the wall and fell But already my knees were touching the window sill and by a movement quick as lightning I got on to it But the murderer had been even quicker than I had been He had heard the grating of the ladder on the wall and I saw the monstrous back of the man raise itself I saw his head Did I really see it The candle on the parquet lit up his legs only Above the height of the table the chamber was in darkness I saw a man with long hair a full beard wild looking eyes a pale face framed in large whiskers as well as I could distinguish and as I think red in colour I did not know the face That was in brief the chief sensation I received from that face in the dim half light in which I saw it I did not know it or at least I did not recognise it Now for quick action It was indeed time for that for as I was about to place my legs through the window the man had seen me had bounded to his feet had sprung as I foresaw he would to the door of the ante chamber had time to open it and fled But I was already behind him revolver in hand shouting Help Like an arrow I crossed the room but noticed a letter on the table as I rushed I almost came up with the man in the ante room for he had lost time in opening the door to the gallery I flew on wings and in the gallery was but a few feet behind him He had taken as I supposed he would the gallery on his right that is to say the road he had prepared for his flight Help Jacques help Larsan I cried He could not escape us I raised a shout of joy of savage victory The man reached the intersection of the two galleries hardly two seconds before me for the meeting which I had prepared the fatal shock which must inevitably take place at that spot We all rushed to the crossing place Monsieur Stangerson and I coming from one end of the right gallery Daddy Jacques coming from the other end of the same gallery and Frederic Larsan coming from the off turning gallery The man was not there We looked at each other stupidly and with eyes terrified The man had vanished like a ghost Where is he where is he we all asked It is impossible he can have escaped I cried my terror mastered by my anger I touched him exclaimed Frederic Larsan I felt his breath on my face cried Daddy Jacques Where is he where is he we all cried We raced like madmen along the two galleries we visited doors and windows they were closed hermetically closed They had not been opened Besides the opening of a door or window by this man whom we were hunting without our having perceived it would have been more inexplicable than his disappearance Where is he where is he He could not have got away by a door or a window nor by any other way He could not have passed through our bodies I confess that for the moment I felt done for For the gallery was perfectly lighted and there was neither trap nor secret door in the walls nor any sort of hiding place We moved the chairs and lifted the pictures Nothing nothing We would have looked into a flower pot if there had been one to look into When this mystery thanks to Rouletabille was naturally explained by the help alone of his masterful mind we were able to realise that the murderer had got away neither by a door a window nor the stairs a fact which the judges would not admit CHAPTER XVII The Inexplicable Gallery Mademoiselle Stangerson appeared at the door of her ante room 
2050-164335-0000	train-other-500	continues Rouletabille s note book We were near her door in the gallery where this incredible phenomenon had taken place There are moments when one feels as if one s brain were about to burst A bullet in the head
2050-164335-0001	train-other-500	a fracture of the skull the seat of reason shattered with only these can I compare the sensation which exhausted and left me void of sense Happily Mademoiselle Stangerson appeared on the threshold of her ante room
2050-164335-0002	train-other-500	I saw her and that helped to relieve my chaotic state of mind I breathed her I inhaled the perfume of the lady in black whom I should never see again
none	none	 I would have given ten years of my life half my life to see once more the lady in black 
2050-164335-0003	train-other-500	Alas I no more meet her but from time to time and yet and yet how the memory of that perfume felt by me alone carries me back to the days of my childhood
2050-164335-0004	train-other-500	It was this sharp reminder from my beloved perfume of the lady in black which made me go to her dressed wholly in white and so pale so pale and so beautiful on the threshold of the inexplicable gallery Her beautiful golden hair
2050-164335-0005	train-other-500	gathered into a knot on the back of her neck left visible the red star on her temple which had so nearly been the cause of her death When I first got on the right track of the mystery of this case I had imagined that on the night of the tragedy in The Yellow Room
2050-164335-0006	train-other-500	Mademoiselle Stangerson had worn her hair in bands But then how could I have imagined otherwise when I had not been in The Yellow Room When I wrote these lines Joseph Rouletabille was eighteen years of age and he spoke of his youth
none	none	 I have kept the text of my friend but I inform the reader here that the episode of the mystery of The Yellow Room has no connection with that of the perfume of the lady in black 
2050-164335-0007	train-other-500	It is not my fault if in the document which I have cited Rouletabille thought fit to refer to his childhood But now since the occurrence of the inexplicable gallery I did not reason at all I stood there
2050-164335-0008	train-other-500	stupid before the apparition so pale and so beautiful of Mademoiselle Stangerson She was clad in a dressing gown of dreamy white One might have taken her to be a ghost a lovely phantom
2050-164335-0009	train-other-500	Her father took her in his arms and kissed her passionately as if he had recovered her after being long lost to him
none	none	 I dared not question her He drew her into the room and we followed them for we had to know 
2050-164335-0010	train-other-500	The door of the boudoir was open The terrified faces of the two nurses craned towards us Mademoiselle Stangerson inquired the meaning of all the disturbance That she was not in her own room was quite easily explained quite easily
2050-164335-0011	train-other-500	She had a fancy not to sleep that night in her chamber but in the boudoir with her nurses
none	none	 locking the door on them 
2050-164335-0012	train-other-500	Since the night of the crime she had experienced feelings of terror and fears came over her that are easily to be comprehended But who could imagine that on that particular night when he was to come she would by a mere chance determine to shut herself in with her women
none	none	 Who would think that she would act contrary to her father s wish to sleep in the drawing room Who could believe that the letter which had so recently been on the table in her room would no longer be there 
2050-164335-0013	train-other-500	He who could understand all this would have to assume that Mademoiselle Stangerson knew that the murderer was coming she could not prevent his coming again unknown to her father unknown to all but to Monsieur Robert Darzac For he must know it now perhaps he had known it before
2050-164335-0014	train-other-500	Did he remember that phrase in the Elysee garden Must I commit a crime then to win you Against whom the crime if not against the obstacle against the murderer Ah I would kill him with my own hand
2050-164335-0015	train-other-500	And I replied You have not answered my question That was the very truth In truth in truth Monsieur Darzac knew the murderer so well that while wishing to kill him himself he was afraid I should find him
2050-164335-0016	train-other-500	There could be but two reasons why he had assisted me in my investigation First because I forced him to do it and second because she would be the better protected I am in the chamber her room I look at her
none	none	 also at the place where the letter had just now been 
2050-164335-0017	train-other-500	She has possessed herself of it it was evidently intended for her evidently How she trembles Trembles at the strange story her father is telling her of the presence of the murderer in her chamber and of the pursuit
none	none	 But it is plainly to be seen that she is not wholly satisfied by the assurance given her until she had been told that the murderer 
2050-164335-0018	train-other-500	by some incomprehensible means had been able to elude us Then follows a silence What a silence We are all there looking at her her father Larsan Daddy Jacques and I
2050-164335-0019	train-other-500	What were we all thinking of in the silence After the events of that night of the mystery of the inexplicable gallery
none	none	 of the prodigious fact of the presence of the murderer in her room it seemed to me that all our thoughts might have been translated into the words which were addressed to her You who know of this mystery explain it to us and we shall perhaps be able to save you How I longed to save her 
2050-164335-0020	train-other-500	for herself and from the other It brought the tears to my eyes She is there shedding about her the perfume of the lady in black At last I see her in the silence of her chamber
2050-164335-0021	train-other-500	Since the fatal hour of the mystery of The Yellow Room we have hung about this invisible and silent woman to learn what she knows Our desires our wish to know must be a torment to her Who can tell that should we learn the secret of her mystery
2050-164335-0022	train-other-500	it would not precipitate a tragedy more terrible than that which had already been enacted here Who can tell if it might not mean her death Yet it had brought her close to death and we still knew nothing Or rather
2050-164335-0023	train-other-500	there are some of us who know nothing But I if I knew who I should know all Who Who Not knowing who I must remain silent out of pity for her
none	none	 For there is no doubt that she knows how he escaped from The Yellow Room 
2050-164335-0024	train-other-500	and yet she keeps the secret When I know who I will speak to him to him She looked at us now with a far away look in her eyes as if we were not in the chamber Monsieur Stangerson broke the silence
2050-164335-0025	train-other-500	He declared that henceforth he would no more absent himself from his daughter s apartments She tried to oppose him in vain He adhered firmly to his purpose He would install himself there this very night he said
none	none	 Solely concerned for the health of his daughter he reproached her for having left her bed 
2050-164335-0026	train-other-500	Then he suddenly began talking to her as if she were a little child He smiled at her and seemed not to know either what he said or what he did The illustrious professor had lost his head
none	none	 Mademoiselle Stangerson in a tone of tender distress said Father father Daddy Jacques blows his nose 
2050-164335-0027	train-other-500	and Frederic Larsan himself is obliged to turn away to hide his emotion For myself I am able neither to think or feel I felt an infinite contempt for myself
2050-164335-0028	train-other-500	It was the first time that Frederic Larsan like myself
none	none	 found himself face to face with Mademoiselle Stangerson since the attack in The Yellow Room 
2050-164335-0029	train-other-500	Like me he had insisted on being allowed to question the unhappy lady
none	none	 but he had not any more than had I been permitted 
2050-164335-0030	train-other-500	To him as to me the same answer had always been given Mademoiselle Stangerson was too weak to receive us The questionings of the examining magistrate had over fatigued her
2050-164335-0031	train-other-500	It was evidently intended not to give us any assistance in our researches I was not surprised but Frederic Larsan had always resented this conduct It is true that he and I had a totally different theory of the crime
2050-164335-0032	train-other-500	I still catch myself repeating from the depths of my heart Save her save her without his speaking
none	none	 Who is he the murderer 
2050-164335-0033	train-other-500	Take him and shut his mouth But Monsieur Darzac made it clear that in order to shut his mouth he must be killed Have I the right to kill Mademoiselle Stangerson s murderer No I had not
2050-164335-0034	train-other-500	But let him only give me the chance Let me find out whether he is really a creature of flesh and blood Let me see his dead body since it cannot be taken alive
2050-164335-0035	train-other-500	If I could but make this woman who does not even look at us understand She is absorbed by her fears and by her father s distress of mind And I can do nothing to save her Yes
2050-164335-0036	train-other-500	I will go to work once more and accomplish wonders I move towards her
none	none	 I would speak to her 
2050-164335-0037	train-other-500	I would entreat her to have confidence in me I would in a word make her understand she alone that I know how the murderer escaped from The Yellow Room that I have guessed the motives for her secrecy and that I pity her with all my heart
2050-164335-0038	train-other-500	But by her gestures she begged us to leave her alone expressing weariness and the need for immediate rest Monsieur Stangerson asked us to go back to our rooms and thanked us Frederic Larsan and I bowed to him and followed by Daddy Jacques we regained the gallery
2050-164335-0039	train-other-500	I heard Larsan murmur Strange strange He made a sign to me to go with him into his room On the threshold he turned towards Daddy Jacques Did you see him distinctly he asked Who The man
none	none	 Saw him why he had a big red beard and red hair That s how he appeared to me 
2050-164335-0040	train-other-500	I said And to me said Larsan The great Fred and I were alone in his chamber now to talk over this thing We talked for an hour turning the matter over and viewing it from every side
2050-164335-0041	train-other-500	From the questions put by him from the explanation which he gives me it is clear to me that in spite of all our senses
none	none	 he is persuaded the man disappeared by some secret passage in the chateau 
2050-164335-0042	train-other-500	known to him alone He knows the chateau he said to me he knows it well
none	none	 He is a rather tall man well built 
2050-164335-0043	train-other-500	I suggested He is as tall as he wants to be murmured Fred I understand I said but how do you account for his red hair and beard Too much beard too much hair false says Fred
none	none	 That s easily said You are always thinking of Robert Darzac You can t get rid of that idea I am certain that he is innocent 
2050-164335-0044	train-other-500	So much the better I hope so but everything condemns him Did you notice the marks on the carpet Come and look at them I have seen them they are the marks of the neat boots the same as those we saw on the border of the lake
2050-164335-0045	train-other-500	Can you deny that they belong to Robert Darzac Of course one may be mistaken Have you noticed that those footprints only go in one direction that there are no return marks When the man came from the chamber pursued by all of us
2050-164335-0046	train-other-500	his footsteps left no traces behind them He had perhaps been in the chamber for hours
none	none	 The mud from his boots had dried and he moved with such rapidity on the points of his toes We saw him running but we did not hear his steps 
2050-164335-0047	train-other-500	I suddenly put an end to this idle chatter void of any logic and made a sign to Larsan to listen There below some one is shutting a door I rise Larsan follows me we descend to the ground floor of the chateau
2050-164335-0048	train-other-500	I lead him to the little semi circular room under the terrace beneath the window of the off turning gallery I point to the door now closed open a short time before under which a shaft of light is visible The forest keeper says Fred
none	none	 Come on I whisper Prepared I know not why to believe that the keeper is the guilty man 
2050-164335-0049	train-other-500	I go to the door and rap smartly on it
none	none	 Some might think that we were rather late in thinking of the keeper since our first business after having found that the murderer had escaped us in the gallery ought to have been to search everywhere else around the chateau in the park Had this criticism been made at the time 
2050-164335-0050	train-other-500	we could only have answered that the assassin had disappeared from the gallery in such a way that we thought he was no longer anywhere He had eluded us when we all had our hands stretched out ready to seize him when we were almost touching him
2050-164335-0051	train-other-500	We had no longer any ground for hoping that we could clear up the mystery of that night As soon as I rapped at the door it was opened and the keeper asked us quietly what we wanted He was undressed and preparing to go to bed
none	none	 The bed had not yet been disturbed 
2050-164335-0052	train-other-500	We entered and I affected surprise Not gone to bed yet No he replied roughly I have been making a round of the park and in the woods I am only just back and sleepy Good night Listen I said
2050-164335-0053	train-other-500	An hour or so ago there was a ladder close by your window What ladder I did not see any ladder Good night
none	none	 And he simply put us out of the room 
2050-164335-0054	train-other-500	When we were outside I looked at Larsan His face was impenetrable Well I said Well he repeated
none	none	 Does that open out any new view to you 
2050-164335-0055	train-other-500	There was no mistaking Larsan s bad temper On re entering the chateau I heard him mutter It would be strange
none	none	 very strange if I had deceived myself on that point He seemed to be talking to me rather than to himself He added In any case we shall soon know what to think The morning will bring light with it CHAPTER XVIII Rouletabille Has Drawn a Circle Between the Two Bumps on His Forehead EXTRACT FROM THE NOTE BOOK OF JOSEPH ROULETABILLE continued We separated on the thresholds of our rooms with a melancholy shake of the hands I was glad to have aroused in him a suspicion of error His was an original brain very intelligent but without method I did not go to bed I awaited the coming of daylight and then went down to the front of the chateau and made a detour examining every trace of footsteps coming towards it or going from it These however were so mixed and confusing that I could make nothing of them Here I may make a remark I am not accustomed to attach an exaggerated importance to exterior signs left in the track of a crime The method which traces the criminal by means of the tracks of his footsteps is altogether primitive So many footprints are identical However in the disturbed state of my mind I did go into the deserted court and did look at all the footprints I could find there seeking for some indication as a basis for reasoning If I could but find a right starting point In despair I seated myself on a stone For over an hour I busied myself with the common ordinary work of a policeman Like the least intelligent of detectives I went on blindly over the traces of footprints which told me just no more than they could I came to the conclusion that I was a fool lower in the scale of intelligence than even the police of the modern romancer Novelists build mountains of stupidity out of a footprint on the sand or from an impression of a hand on the wall That s the way innocent men are brought to prison It might convince an examining magistrate or the head of a detective department but it s not proof You writers forget that what the senses furnish is not proof If I am taking cognisance of what is offered me by my senses I do so but to bring the results within the circle of my reason That circle may be the most circumscribed but if it is it has this advantage it holds nothing but the truth Yes I swear that I have never used the evidence of the senses but as servants to my reason I have never permitted them to become my master They have not made of me that monstrous thing worse than a blind man a man who sees falsely And that is why I can triumph over your error and your merely animal intelligence Frederic Larsan Be of good courage then friend Rouletabille it is impossible that the incident of the inexplicable gallery should be outside the circle of your reason You know that Then have faith and take thought with yourself and forget not that you took hold of the right end when you drew that circle in your brain within which to unravel this mysterious play of circumstance To it once again Go back to the gallery Take your stand on your reason and rest there as Frederic Larsan rests on his cane You will then soon prove that the great Fred is nothing but a fool thirtieth October Noon JOSEPH ROULETABILLE I acted as I planned With head on fire I retraced my way to the gallery and without having found anything more than I had seen on the previous night the right hold I had taken of my reason drew me to something so important that I was obliged to cling to it to save myself from falling Now for the strength and patience to find sensible traces to fit in with my thinking and these must come within the circle I have drawn between the two bumps on my forehead thirtieth of October Midnight JOSEPH ROULETABILLE CHAPTER XIX Rouletabille Invites Me to Breakfast at the Donjon Inn It was not until later that Rouletabille sent me the note book in which he had written at length the story of the phenomenon of the inexplicable gallery On the day I arrived at the Glandier and joined him in his room he recounted to me with the greatest detail all that I have now related telling me also how he had spent several hours in Paris where he had learned nothing that could be of any help to him The event of the inexplicable gallery had occurred on the night between the twenty ninth and thirtieth of October that is to say three days before my return to the chateau It was on the second of November then that I went back to the Glandier summoned there by my friend s telegram and taking the revolvers with me I am now in Rouletabille s room and he has finished his recital While he had been telling me the story I noticed him continually rubbing the glass of the eyeglasses he had found on the side table From the evident pleasure he was taking in handling them I felt they must be one of those sensible evidences destined to enter what he had called the circle of the right end of his reason That strange and unique way of his to express himself in terms wonderfully adequate for his thoughts no longer surprised me It was often necessary to know his thought to understand the terms he used and it was not easy to penetrate into Rouletabille s thinking This lad s brain was one of the most curious things I have ever observed Rouletabille went on the even tenor of his way without suspecting the astonishment and even bewilderment he roused in others I am sure he was not himself in the least conscious of the originality of his genius He was himself and at ease wherever he happened to be When he had finished his recital he asked me what I thought of it I replied that I was much puzzled by his question Then he begged me to try in my turn to take my reason in hand by the right end Very well I said It seems to me that the point of departure of my reason would be this there can be no doubt that the murderer you pursued was in the gallery I paused After making so good a start you ought not to stop so soon he exclaimed Come make another effort I ll try Since he disappeared from the gallery without passing through any door or window he must have escaped by some other opening Rouletabille looked at me pityingly smiled carelessly and remarked that I was reasoning like a postman or like Frederic Larsan Rouletabille had alternate fits of admiration and disdain for the great Fred It all depended as to whether Larsan s discoveries tallied with Rouletabille s reasoning or not When they did he would exclaim He is really great When they did not he would grunt and mutter What an ass It was a petty side of the noble character of this strange youth We had risen and he led me into the park When we reached the court and were making towards the gate the sound of blinds thrown back against the wall made us turn our heads and we saw at a window on the first floor of the chateau the ruddy and clean shaven face of a person I did not recognise Hullo muttered Rouletabille Arthur Rance He lowered his head quickened his pace and I heard him ask himself between his teeth Was he in the chateau that night What is he doing here We had gone some distance from the chateau when I asked him who this Arthur Rance was and how he had come to know him He referred to his story of that morning and I remembered that mister Arthur W Rance was the American from Philadelphia with whom he had had so many drinks at the Elysee reception But was he not to have left France almost immediately I asked No doubt that s why I am surprised to find him here still and not only in France but above all at the Glandier He did not arrive this morning and he did not get here last night He must have got here before dinner then Why didn t the concierges tell me I reminded my friend apropos of the concierges that he had not yet told me what had led him to get them set at liberty We were close to their lodge Monsieur and Madame Bernier saw us coming A frank smile lit up their happy faces They seemed to harbour no ill feeling because of their detention My young friend asked them at what hour mister Arthur Rance had arrived They answered that they did not know he was at the chateau He must have come during the evening of the previous night but they had not had to open the gate for him because being a great walker and not wishing that a carriage should be sent to meet him he was accustomed to get off at the little hamlet of Saint Michel from which he came to the chateau by way of the forest He reached the park by the grotto of Sainte Genevieve over the little gate of which giving on to the park he climbed As the concierges spoke I saw Rouletabille s face cloud over and exhibit disappointment a disappointment no doubt with himself Evidently he was a little vexed after having worked so much on the spot with so minute a study of the people and events at the Glandier that he had to learn now that Arthur Rance was accustomed to visit the chateau You say that Monsieur Arthur Rance is accustomed to come to the chateau When did he come here last We can t tell you exactly replied Madame Bernier that was the name of the concierge we couldn t know while they were keeping us in prison Besides as the gentleman comes to the chateau without passing through our gate he goes away by the way he comes Do you know when he came the first time Oh yes Monsieur nine years ago He was in France nine years ago then said Rouletabille and since that time as far as you know how many times has he been at the Glandier Three times When did he come the last time as far as you know A week before the attempt in The Yellow Room Rouletabille put another question this time addressing himself particularly to the woman In the grove of the parquet In the grove of the parquet she replied Thanks said Rouletabille Be ready for me this evening He spoke the last words with a finger on his lips as if to command silence and discretion We left the park and took the way to the Donjon Inn Do you often eat here Sometimes But you also take your meals at the chateau Yes Larsan and I are sometimes served in one of our rooms Hasn t Monsieur Stangerson ever invited you to his own table Never Does your presence at the chateau displease him I don t know but in any case he does not make us feel that we are in his way Doesn t he question you Never He is in the same state of mind as he was in at the door of The Yellow Room when his daughter was being murdered and when he broke open the door and did not find the murderer He is persuaded since he could discover nothing that there s no reason why we should be able to discover more than he did But he has made it his duty since Larsan expressed his theory not to oppose us Rouletabille buried himself in thought again for some time He aroused himself later to tell me of how he came to set the two concierges free I went recently to see Monsieur Stangerson and took with me a piece of paper on which was written I promise whatever others may say to keep in my service my two faithful servants Bernier and his wife I explained to him that by signing that document he would enable me to compel those two people to speak out and I declared my own assurance of their innocence of any part in the crime That was also his opinion The examining magistrate after it was signed presented the document to the Berniers who then did speak They said what I was certain they would say as soon as they were sure they would not lose their place They confessed to poaching on Monsieur Stangerson s estates and it was while they were poaching on the night of the crime that they were found not far from the pavilion at the moment when the outrage was being committed Some rabbits they caught in that way were sold by them to the landlord of the Donjon Inn who served them to his customers or sent them to Paris That was the truth as I had guessed from the first Do you remember what I said on entering the Donjon Inn We shall have to eat red meat now I had heard the words on the same morning when we arrived at the park gate You heard them also but you did not attach any importance to them You recollect when we reached the park gate that we stopped to look at a man who was running by the side of the wall looking every minute at his watch That was Larsan Well behind us the landlord of the Donjon Inn standing on his doorstep said to someone inside We shall have to eat red meat now Why that now When you are as I am in search of some hidden secret you can t afford to have anything escape you You ve got to know the meaning of everything We had come into a rather out of the way part of the country which had been turned topsy turvey by a crime and my reason led me to suspect every phrase that could bear upon the event of the day Now I took to mean since the outrage In the course of my inquiry therefore I sought to find a relation between that phrase and the tragedy We went to the Donjon Inn for breakfast I repeated the phrase and saw by the surprise and trouble on Daddy Mathieu s face that I had not exaggerated its importance so far as he was concerned I had just learned that the concierges had been arrested Daddy Mathieu spoke of them as of dear friends people for whom one is sorry That was a reckless conjunction of ideas I said to myself Now that the concierges are arrested we shall have to eat red meat No more concierges no more game The hatred expressed by Daddy Mathieu for Monsieur Stangerson s forest keeper a hatred he pretended was shared by the concierges led me easily to think of poaching Now as all the evidence showed the concierges had not been in bed at the time of the tragedy why were they abroad that night As participants in the crime I was not disposed to think so I had already arrived at the conclusion by steps of which I will tell you later that the assassin had had no accomplice and that the tragedy held a mystery between Mademoiselle Stangerson and the murderer a mystery with which the concierges had nothing to do With that theory in my mind I searched for proof in their lodge which as you know I entered I found there under their bed some springs and brass wire Ah I thought these things explain why they were out in the park at night I was not surprised at the dogged silence they maintained before the examining magistrate even under the accusation so grave as that of being accomplices in the crime Poaching would save them from the Assize Court but it would lose them their places and as they were perfectly sure of their innocence of the crime they hoped it would soon be established and then their poaching might go on as usual They could always confess later I however hastened their confession by means of the document Monsieur Stangerson signed They gave all the necessary proofs were set at liberty and have now a lively gratitude for me Why did I not get them released sooner Because I was not sure that nothing more than poaching was against them I wanted to study the ground As the days went by my conviction became more and more certain The day after the events of the inexplicable gallery I had need of help I could rely on so I resolved to have them released at once That was how Joseph Rouletabille explained himself Once more I could not but be astonished at the simplicity of the reasoning which had brought him to the truth of the matter Certainly this was no big thing but I think myself that the young man will one of these days explain with the same simplicity the fearful tragedy in The Yellow Room as well as the phenomenon of the inexplicable gallery We reached the Donjon Inn and entered it This time we did not see the landlord but were received with a pleasant smile by the hostess I have already described the room in which we found ourselves and I have given a glimpse of the charming blonde woman with the gentle eyes who now immediately began to prepare our breakfast How s Daddy Mathieu asked Rouletabille Not much better not much better he is still confined to his bed His rheumatism still sticks to him then Yes Last night I was again obliged to give him morphine the only drug that gives him any relief She spoke in a soft voice Everything about her expressed gentleness She was indeed a beautiful woman somewhat with an air of indolence with great eyes seemingly black and blue amorous eyes Was she happy with her crabbed rheumatic husband The scene at which we had once been present did not lead us to believe that she was yet there was something in her bearing that was not suggestive of despair She disappeared into the kitchen to prepare our repast leaving on the table a bottle of excellent cider Rouletabille filled our earthenware mugs loaded his pipe and quietly explained to me his reason for asking me to come to the Glandier with revolvers Yes he said contemplatively looking at the clouds of smoke he was puffing out yes my dear boy I expect the assassin to night A brief silence followed which I took care not to interrupt and then he went on Last night just as I was going to bed Monsieur Robert Darzac knocked at my room When he came in he confided to me that he was compelled to go to Paris the next day that is this morning The reason which made this journey necessary was at once peremptory and mysterious it was not possible for him to explain its object to me I go and yet he added I would give my life not to leave Mademoiselle Stangerson at this moment He did not try to hide that he believed her to be once more in danger It will not greatly astonish me if something happens to morrow night he avowed and yet I must be absent I cannot be back at the Glandier before the morning of the day after to morrow I asked him to explain himself and this is all he would tell me His anticipation of coming danger had come to him solely from the coincidence that Mademoiselle Stangerson had been twice attacked and both times when he had been absent On the night of the incident of the inexplicable gallery he had been obliged to be away from the Glandier On the night of the tragedy in The Yellow Room he had also not been able to be at the Glandier though this was the first time he had declared himself on the matter Now a man so moved who would still go away must be acting under compulsion must be obeying a will stronger than his own That was how I reasoned and I told him so He replied Perhaps I asked him if Mademoiselle Stangerson was compelling him He protested that she was not His determination to go to Paris had been taken without any conference with Mademoiselle Stangerson To cut the story short he repeated that his belief in the possibility of a fresh attack was founded entirely on the extraordinary coincidence If anything happens to Mademoiselle Stangerson he said it would be terrible for both of us For her because her life would be in danger for me because I could neither defend her from the attack nor tell of where I had been I am perfectly aware of the suspicions cast on me The examining magistrate and Monsieur Larsan are both on the point of believing in my guilt Larsan tracked me the last time I went to Paris and I had all the trouble in the world to get rid of him Why do you not tell me the name of the murderer now if you know it I cried Monsieur Darzac appeared extremely troubled by my question and replied to me in a hesitating tone I I know the name of the murderer Why how could I know his name I at once replied From Mademoiselle Stangerson He grew so pale that I thought he was about to faint and I saw that I had hit the nail right on the head Mademoiselle and he knew the name of the murderer When he recovered himself he said to me I am going to leave you Since you have been here I have appreciated your exceptional intelligence and your unequalled ingenuity But I ask this service of you Perhaps I am wrong to fear an attack during the coming night but as I must act with foresight I count on you to frustrate any attempt that may be made Take every step needful to protect Mademoiselle Stangerson Keep a most careful watch of her room Don t go to sleep nor allow yourself one moment of repose The man we dread is remarkably cunning with a cunning that has never been equalled If you keep watch his very cunning may save her because it s impossible that he should not know that you are watching and knowing it he may not venture Have you spoken of all this to Monsieur Stangerson No I do not wish him to ask me as you just now did for the name of the murderer I tell you all this Monsieur Rouletabille because I have great very great confidence in you I know that you do not suspect me The poor man spoke in jerks He was evidently suffering I pitied him the more because I felt sure that he would rather allow himself to be killed than tell me who the murderer was As for Mademoiselle Stangerson I felt that she would rather allow herself to be murdered than denounce the man of The Yellow Room and of the inexplicable gallery The man must be dominating her or both by some inscrutable power They were dreading nothing so much as the chance of Monsieur Stangerson knowing that his daughter was held by her assailant I made Monsieur Darzac understand that he had explained himself sufficiently and that he might refrain from telling me any more than he had already told me I promised him to watch through the night He insisted that I should establish an absolutely impassable barrier around Mademoiselle Stangerson s chamber around the boudoir where the nurses were sleeping and around the drawing room where since the affair of the inexplicable gallery Monsieur Stangerson had slept In short I was to put a cordon round the whole apartment From his insistence I gathered that Monsieur Darzac intended not only to make it impossible for the expected man to reach the chamber of Mademoiselle Stangerson but to make that impossibility so visibly clear that seeing himself expected he would at once go away That was how I interpreted his final words when we parted You may mention your suspicions of the expected attack to Monsieur Stangerson to Daddy Jacques to Frederic Larsan and to anybody in the chateau The poor fellow left me hardly knowing what he was saying My silence and my eyes told him that I had guessed a large part of his secret And indeed he must have been at his wits end to have come to me at such a time and to abandon Mademoiselle Stangerson in spite of his fixed idea as to the consequence When he was gone I began to think that I should have to use even a greater cunning than his so that if the man should come that night he might not for a moment suspect that his coming had been expected Certainly I would allow him to get in far enough so that dead or alive I might see his face clearly He must be got rid of Mademoiselle Stangerson must be freed from this continual impending danger Yes my boy said Rouletabille after placing his pipe on the table and emptying his mug of cider I must see his face distinctly so as to make sure to impress it on that part of my brain where I have drawn my circle of reasoning The landlady re appeared at that moment bringing in the traditional bacon omelette Rouletabille chaffed her a little and she took the chaff with the most charming good humour She is much jollier when Daddy Mathieu is in bed with his rheumatism Rouletabille said to me But I had eyes neither for Rouletabille nor for the landlady s smiles I was entirely absorbed over the last words of my young friend and in thinking over Monsieur Robert Darzac s strange behaviour When he had finished his omelette and we were again alone Rouletabille continued the tale of his confidences When I sent you my telegram this morning he said I had only the word of Monsieur Darzac that perhaps the assassin would come to night I can now say that he will certainly come I expect him What has made you feel this certainty I have been sure since half past ten o clock this morning that he would come I knew that before we saw Arthur Rance at the window in the court Ah I said But again what made you so sure And why since half past ten this morning Because at half past ten I had proof that Mademoiselle Stangerson was making as many efforts to permit of the murderer s entrance as Monsieur Robert Darzac had taken precautions against it Is that possible I cried Haven t you told me that Mademoiselle Stangerson loves Monsieur Robert Darzac I told you so because it is the truth Then do you see nothing strange Everything in this business is strange my friend but take my word for it the strangeness you now feel is nothing to the strangeness that s to come It must be admitted then I said that Mademoiselle Stangerson and her murderer are in communication at any rate in writing Admit it my friend admit it You don t risk anything I told you about the letter left on her table on the night of the inexplicable gallery affair the letter that disappeared into the pocket of Mademoiselle Stangerson Why should it not have been a summons to a meeting Might he not as soon as he was sure of Darzac s absence appoint the meeting for the coming night And my friend laughed silently There are moments when I ask myself if he is not laughing at me The door of the inn opened Rouletabille was on his feet so suddenly that one might have thought he had received an electric shock mister Arthur Rance he cried mister Arthur Rance stood before us calmly bowing CHAPTER XX An Act of Mademoiselle Stangerson You remember me Monsieur 
1347-164338-0000	train-other-500	asked Rouletabille Perfectly replied Arthur Rance I recognise you as the lad at the bar The face of Rouletabille crimsoned at being called a lad I want to shake hands with you
1347-164338-0001	train-other-500	You are a bright little fellow The American extended his hand and Rouletabille relaxing his frown shook it and introduced mister Arthur Rance to me
1347-164338-0002	train-other-500	He invited him to share our meal No thanks I breakfasted with Monsieur Stangerson Arthur Rance spoke French perfectly almost without an accent
none	none	 I did not expect to have the pleasure of seeing you again Monsieur 
1347-164338-0003	train-other-500	I thought you were to have left France the day after the reception at the Elysee Rouletabille and I outwardly indifferent listened most intently
1347-164338-0004	train-other-500	for every word the American would say The man s purplish red face
none	none	 his heavy eyelids 
1347-164338-0005	train-other-500	the nervous twitchings all spoke of his addiction to drink How came it that so sorry a specimen of a man should be so intimate with Monsieur Stangerson
1347-164338-0006	train-other-500	Some days later I learned from Frederic Larsan
none	none	 who 
1347-164338-0007	train-other-500	like ourselves was surprised and mystified by his appearance and reception at the chateau that mister Rance had been an inebriate for only about fifteen years that is to say
1347-164338-0008	train-other-500	since the professor and his daughter left Philadelphia During the time the Stangersons lived in America they were very intimate with Arthur Rance
1347-164338-0009	train-other-500	who was one of the most distinguished phrenologists of the new world Owing to new experiments he had made enormous strides beyond the science of Gall and Lavater
1347-164338-0010	train-other-500	The friendliness with which he was received at the Glandier may be explained by the fact that he had once rendered Mademoiselle Stangerson a great service by stopping
1347-164338-0011	train-other-500	at the peril of his own life the runaway horses of her carriage The immediate result of that could however have been no more than a mere friendly association with the Stangersons
1347-164338-0012	train-other-500	certainly not a love affair Frederic Larsan did not tell me where he had picked up this information but he appeared to be quite sure of what he said
1347-164338-0013	train-other-500	Had we known these facts at the time Arthur Rance met us at the Donjon Inn
none	none	 his presence at the chateau might not have puzzled us 
1347-164338-0014	train-other-500	but they could not have failed to increase our interest in the man himself
none	none	 The American must have been at least forty five years old 
1347-164338-0015	train-other-500	He spoke in a perfectly natural tone in reply to Rouletabille s question I put off my return to America when I heard of the attack on Mademoiselle Stangerson
1347-164338-0016	train-other-500	I wanted to be certain the lady had not been killed and I shall not go away until she is perfectly recovered Arthur Rance then took the lead in talk
1347-164338-0017	train-other-500	paying no heed to some of Rouletabille s questions He gave us without our inviting him his personal views on the subject of the tragedy views which
1347-164338-0018	train-other-500	as well as I could make out were not far from those held by Frederic Larzan The American also thought that Robert Darzac had something to do with the matter
1347-164338-0019	train-other-500	He did not mention him by name but there was no room to doubt whom he meant He told us he was aware of the efforts young Rouletabille was making
none	none	 to unravel the tangled skein of The Yellow Room mystery He explained that Monsieur Stangerson had related to him all 
1347-164338-0021	train-other-500	that had taken place in the inexplicable gallery He several times expressed his regret at Monsieur Darzac s absence from the chateau on all these occasions and thought
1347-164338-0022	train-other-500	that Monsieur Darzac had done cleverly in allying himself with Monsieur Joseph Rouletabille who could not fail sooner or later to discover the murderer
1347-164338-0023	train-other-500	He spoke the last sentence with unconcealed irony Then he rose bowed to us and left
none	none	 the inn 
1347-164338-0024	train-other-500	Rouletabille watched him through the window An
none	none	 odd 
1347-164338-0025	train-other-500	fish that he said Do you think he ll pass the night at the Glandier I asked To my amazement the young reporter answered that it was a matter of entire indifference to him
none	none	 whether he did or not As to how we spent our time during the afternoon all I need say is 
1347-164338-0026	train-other-500	that Rouletabille led me to the grotto of Sainte Genevieve and all the time talked of every subject but the one in which we were most interested
none	none	 Towards evening 
1347-164338-0027	train-other-500	I was surprised to find Rouletabille making none of the preparations I had expected him to make I spoke to him about it when night had come on
1347-164338-0028	train-other-500	and we were once more in his room He replied
none	none	 that all his arrangements had already been made and this time 
1347-164338-0029	train-other-500	the murderer would not get away from him I expressed some doubt on this reminding him of his disappearance in the gallery and suggested that the same phenomenon might occur again
1347-164338-0030	train-other-500	He answered that he hoped it would He desired nothing more I did not insist knowing by experience how useless that would have been He told me that
none	none	 with the help of the concierges 
1347-164338-0031	train-other-500	the chateau had since early dawn been watched in such a way that nobody could approach it without his knowing it and that he had no concern for those who might have left it and remained without
1347-164338-0032	train-other-500	It was then six o clock by his watch Rising he made a sign to me to follow him and without in the least tying to conceal his movements or the sound of his footsteps
1347-164338-0033	train-other-500	he led me through the gallery We reached the right gallery and came to the landing place which we crossed We then continued our way in the gallery of the left wing
1347-164338-0034	train-other-500	passing Professor Stangerson s apartment At the far end of the gallery before coming to the donjon is the room occupied by Arthur Rance We knew that
1347-164338-0035	train-other-500	because we had seen him at the window looking on to the court The door of the room opens on to the end of the gallery exactly facing the east window at the extremity of the right gallery
none	none	 where Rouletabille had placed Daddy Jacques 
1347-164338-0036	train-other-500	and commands an uninterrupted view of the gallery from end to end of the chateau That off turning gallery said Rouletabille I reserve for myself when I tell you
1347-164338-0037	train-other-500	you ll come and take your place here
none	none	 And he made me enter a little dark 
1347-164338-0038	train-other-500	triangular closet built in a bend of the wall to the left of the door of Arthur Rance s room From this recess I could see all that occurred in the gallery
1347-164338-0039	train-other-500	as well as if I had been standing in front of Arthur Rance s door and I could watch that door too The door of the closet which was to be my place of observation
1347-164338-0040	train-other-500	was fitted with panels of transparent glass In the gallery where all the lamps had been lit it was quite light In the closet however it was quite dark
1347-164338-0041	train-other-500	It was a splendid place from which to observe and remain unobserved I was soon to play the part of a spy a common policeman
none	none	 I wonder what my leader at the bar would have said had he known 
1347-164338-0042	train-other-500	I was not altogether pleased with my duties but I could not refuse Rouletabille the assistance he had begged me to give him I took care not to make him see
1347-164338-0043	train-other-500	that I in the least objected and for several reasons I wanted to oblige him I did not wish him to think me a coward I was filled with curiosity
1347-164338-0044	train-other-500	and it was too late for me to draw back even had I determined to do so That I had not had these scruples sooner was because my curiosity had quite got the better of me
1347-164338-0045	train-other-500	I might also urge that I was helping to save the life of a woman and even a lawyer
none	none	 may do that conscientiously 
1347-164338-0046	train-other-500	We returned along the gallery On reaching the door of Mademoiselle Stangerson s apartment it opened from a push given by the steward who was waiting at the dinner table
1347-164338-0047	train-other-500	Monsieur Stangerson had for the last three days dined with his daughter in the drawing room on the first floor As the door remained open we distinctly saw Mademoiselle Stangerson
1347-164338-0048	train-other-500	taking advantage of the steward s absence and while her father was stooping to pick up something he had let fall
none	none	 pour the contents of a phial into Monsieur Stangerson s glass CHAPTER XXI On the Watch The act which staggered me did not appear to affect Rouletabille much We returned to his room and without even referring to what we had seen he gave me his final instructions for the night First we were to go to dinner after dinner I was to take my stand in the dark closet and wait there as long as it was necessary to look out for what might happen If you see anything before I do he explained you must let me know If the man gets into the right gallery by any other way than the off turning gallery you will see him before I shall because you have a view along the whole length of the right gallery while I can only command a view of the off turning gallery All you need do to let me know is to undo the cord holding the curtain of the right gallery window nearest to the dark closet The curtain will fall of itself and immediately leave a square of shadow where previously there had been a square of light To do this you need but stretch your hand out of the closet I shall understand your signal perfectly And then Then you will see me coming round the corner of the off turning gallery What am I to do then You will immediately come towards me behind the man but I shall already be upon him and shall have seen his face I attempted a feeble smile Why do you smile Well you may smile while you have the chance but I swear you ll have no time for that a few hours from now And if the man escapes So much the better said Rouletabille coolly I don t want to capture him He may take himself off any way he can I will let him go after I have seen his face That s all I want I shall know afterwards what to do so that as far as Mademoiselle Stangerson is concerned he shall be dead to her even though he continues to live If I took him alive Mademoiselle Stangerson and Robert Darzac would perhaps never forgive me And I wish to retain their good will and respect Seeing as I have just now seen Mademoiselle Stangerson pour a narcotic into her father s glass so that he might not be awake to interrupt the conversation she is going to have with her murderer you can imagine she would not be grateful to me if I brought the man of The Yellow Room and the inexplicable gallery bound and gagged to her father I realise now that if I am to save the unhappy lady I must silence the man and not capture him To kill a human being is no small thing Besides that s not my business unless the man himself makes it my business On the other hand to render him forever silent without the lady s assent and confidence is to act on one s own initiative and assumes a knowledge of everything with nothing for a basis Fortunately my friend I have guessed no I have reasoned it all out All that I ask of the man who is coming to night is to bring me his face so that it may enter Into the circle Exactly And his face won t surprise me But I thought you saw his face on the night when you sprang into the chamber Only imperfectly The candle was on the floor and his beard Will he wear his beard this evening I think I can say for certain that he will But the gallery is light and now I know or at least my brain knows and my eyes will see If we are here only to see him and let him escape why are we armed Because if the man of The Yellow Room and the inexplicable gallery knows that I know he is capable of doing anything We should then have to defend ourselves And you are sure he will come to night As sure as that you are standing there This morning at half past ten o clock Mademoiselle Stangerson in the cleverest way in the world arranged to have no nurses to night She gave them leave of absence for twenty four hours under some plausible pretexts and did not desire anybody to be with her but her father while they are away Her father who is to sleep in the boudoir has gladly consented to the arrangement Darzac s departure and what he told me as well as the extraordinary precautions Mademoiselle Stangerson is taking to be alone to night leaves me no room for doubt She has prepared the way for the coming of the man whom Darzac dreads That s awful It is And what we saw her do was done to send her father to sleep Yes Then there are but two of us for to night s work Four the concierge and his wife will watch at all hazards I don t set much value on them before but the concierge may be useful after if there s to be any killing Then you think there may be If he wishes it Why haven t you brought in Daddy Jacques Have you made no use of him to day No replied Rouletabille sharply I kept silence for awhile then anxious to know his thoughts I asked him point blank Why not tell Arthur Rance He may be of great assistance to us Oh said Rouletabille crossly then you want to let everybody into Mademoiselle Stangerson s secrets Come let us go to dinner it is time This evening we dine in Frederic Larsan s room at least if he is not on the heels of Darzac He sticks to him like a leech But anyhow if he is not there now I am quite sure he will be to night He s the one I am going to knock over At this moment we heard a noise in the room near us It must be he said Rouletabille I forgot to ask you I said if we are to make any allusion to to night s business when we are with this policeman I take it we are not Is that so Evidently We are going to operate alone on our own personal account So that all the glory will be ours Rouletabille laughed We dined with Frederic Larsan in his room He told us he had just come in and invited us to be seated at table We ate our dinner in the best of humours and I had no difficulty in appreciating the feelings of certainty which both Rouletabille and Larsan felt Rouletabille told the great Fred that I had come on a chance visit and that he had asked me to stay and help him in the heavy batch of writing he had to get through for the Epoque I was going back to Paris he said by the eleven o clock train taking his copy which took a story form recounting the principal episodes in the mysteries of the Glandier Larsan smiled at the explanation like a man who was not fooled and politely refrains from making the slightest remark on matters which did not concern him With infinite precautions as to the words they used and even as to the tones of their voices Larsan and Rouletabille discussed for a long time mister Arthur Rance s appearance at the chateau and his past in America about which they expressed a desire to know more at any rate so far as his relations with the Stangersons At one time Larsan who appeared to me to be unwell said with an effort I think Monsieur Rouletabille that we ve not much more to do at the Glandier and that we sha n t sleep here many more nights I think so too Monsieur Fred Then you think the conclusion of the matter has been reached I think indeed that we have nothing more to find out replied Rouletabille Have you found your criminal asked Larsan Have you Yes So have I said Rouletabille Can it be the same man I don t know if you have swerved from your original idea said the young reporter Then he added with emphasis Monsieur Darzac is an honest man Are you sure of that asked Larsan Well I am sure he is not So it s a fight then Yes it is a fight But I shall beat you Monsieur Frederic Larsan Youth never doubts anything said the great Fred laughingly and held out his hand to me by way of conclusion Rouletabille s answer came like an echo Not anything Suddenly Larsan who had risen to wish us goodnight pressed both his hands to his chest and staggered He was obliged to lean on Rouletabille for support and to save himself from falling Oh Oh he cried What is the matter with me Have I been poisoned He looked at us with haggard eyes We questioned him vainly he did not answer us He had sunk into an armchair and we could get not a word from him We were extremely distressed both on his account and on our own for we had partaken of all the dishes he had eaten He seemed to be out of pain but his heavy head had fallen on his shoulder and his eyelids were tightly closed Rouletabille bent over him listening for the beatings of the heart My friend s face however when he stood up was as calm as it had been a moment before agitated He is asleep he said He led me to his chamber after closing Larsan s room The drug I asked Does Mademoiselle Stangerson wish to put everybody to sleep to night Perhaps replied Rouletabille but I could see he was thinking of something else But what about us I exclaimed How do we know that we have not been drugged Do you feel indisposed Rouletabille asked me coolly Not in the least Do you feel any inclination to go to sleep None whatever Well then my friend smoke this excellent cigar And he handed me a choice Havana one Monsieur Darzac had given him while he lit his briarwood his eternal briarwood We remained in his room until about ten o clock without a word passing between us Buried in an armchair Rouletabille sat and smoked steadily his brow in thought and a far away look in his eyes On the stroke of ten he took off his boots and signalled to me to do the same As we stood in our socks he said in so low a tone that I guessed rather than heard the word Revolver I drew my revolver from my jacket pocket Cock it he said I did as he directed Then moving towards the door of his room he opened it with infinite precaution it made no sound We were in the off turning gallery Rouletabille made another sign to me which I understood to mean that I was to take up my post in the dark closet When I was some distance from him he rejoined me and embraced me and then I saw him with the same precaution return to his room Astonished by his embrace and somewhat disquieted by it I arrived at the right gallery without difficulty crossing the landing place and reaching the dark closet Before entering it I examined the curtain cord of the window and found that I had only to release it from its fastening with my fingers for the curtain to fall by its own weight and hide the square of light from Rouletabille the signal agreed upon The sound of a footstep made me halt before Arthur Rance s door He was not yet in bed then How was it that being in the chateau he had not dined with Monsieur Stangerson and his daughter I had not seen him at table with them at the moment when we looked in I retired into the dark closet I found myself perfectly situated I could see along the whole length of the gallery Nothing absolutely nothing could pass there without my seeing it But what was going to pass there Rouletabille s embrace came back to my mind I argued that people don t part from each other in that way unless on an important or dangerous occasion Was I then in danger My hand closed on the butt of my revolver and I waited I am not a hero but neither am I a coward I waited about an hour and during all that time I saw nothing unusual The rain which had begun to come down strongly towards nine o clock had now ceased My friend had told me that probably nothing would occur before midnight or one o clock in the morning It was not more than half past eleven however when I heard the door of Arthur Rance s room open very slowly The door remained open for a minute which seemed to me a long time As it opened into the gallery that is to say outwards I could not see what was passing in the room behind the door At that moment I noticed a strange sound three times repeated coming from the park Ordinarily I should not have attached any more importance to it than I would to the noise of cats on the roof But the third time the mew was so sharp and penetrating that I remembered what I had heard about the cry of the Bete du bon Dieu As the cry had accompanied all the events at the Glandier I could not refrain from shuddering at the thought Directly afterwards I saw a man appear on the outside of the door and close it after him At first I could not recognise him for his back was towards me and he was bending over a rather bulky package When he had closed the door and picked up the package he turned towards the dark closet and then I saw who he was He was the forest keeper the Green Man He was wearing the same costume that he had worn when I first saw him on the road in front of the Donjon Inn There was no doubt about his being the keeper As the cry of the Bete du Bon Dieu came for the third time he put down the package and went to the second window counting from the dark closet I dared not risk making any movement fearing I might betray my presence Arriving at the window he peered out on to the park The night was now light the moon showing at intervals The Green Man raised his arms twice making signs which I did not understand then leaving the window he again took up his package and moved along the gallery towards the landing place Rouletabille had instructed me to undo the curtain cord when I saw anything Was Rouletabille expecting this It was not my business to question All I had to do was obey instructions I unfastened the window cord my heart beating the while as if it would burst The man reached the landing place but to my utter surprise I had expected to see him continue to pass along the gallery I saw him descend the stairs leading to the vestibule What was I to do I looked stupidly at the heavy curtain which had shut the light from the window The signal had been given and I did not see Rouletabille appear at the corner of the off turning gallery Nobody appeared I was exceedingly perplexed Half an hour passed an age to me What was I to do now even if I saw something The signal once given I could not give it a second time To venture into the gallery might upset all Rouletabille s plans After all I had nothing to reproach myself for and if something had happened that my friend had not expected he could only blame himself Unable to be of any further assistance to him by means of a signal I left the dark closet and still in my socks made my way to the off turning gallery There was no one there I went to the door of Rouletabille s room and listened I could hear nothing I knocked gently There was no answer I turned the door handle and the door opened I entered Rouletabille lay extended at full length on the floor CHAPTER XXII The Incredible Body I bent in great anxiety over the body of the reporter and had the joy to find that he was deeply sleeping the same unhealthy sleep that I had seen fall upon Frederic Larsan He had succumbed to the influence of the same drug that had been mixed with our food How was it then that I also had not been overcome by it I reflected that the drug must have been put into our wine because that would explain my condition I never drink when eating Naturally inclined to obesity I am restricted to a dry diet I shook Rouletabille but could not succeed in waking him This no doubt was the work of Mademoiselle Stangerson She had certainly thought it necessary to guard herself against this young man as well as her father I recalled that the steward in serving us had recommended an excellent Chablis which no doubt had come from the professor s table More than a quarter of an hour passed I resolved under the pressing circumstances to resort to extreme measures I threw a pitcher of cold water over Rouletabille s head He opened his eyes I beat his face and raised him up I felt him stiffen in my arms and heard him murmur Go on go on but don t make any noise I pinched him and shook him until he was able to stand up We were saved They sent me to sleep he said Ah I passed an awful quarter of an hour before giving way But it is over now Don t leave me He had no sooner uttered those words than we were thrilled by a frightful cry that rang through the chateau a veritable death cry Malheur roared Rouletabille we shall be too late He tried to rush to the door but he was too dazed and fell against the wall I was already in the gallery revolver in hand rushing like a madman towards Mademoiselle Stangerson s room The moment I arrived at the intersection of the off turning gallery and the right gallery I saw a figure leaving her apartment which in a few strides had reached the landing place I was not master of myself I fired The report from the revolver made a deafening noise but the man continued his flight down the stairs I ran behind him shouting Stop stop or I will kill you As I rushed after him down the stairs I came face to face with Arthur Rance coming from the left wing of the chateau yelling What is it What is it We arrived almost at the same time at the foot of the staircase The window of the vestibule was open We distinctly saw the form of a man running away Instinctively we fired our revolvers in his direction He was not more than ten paces in front of us he staggered and we thought he was going to fall We had sprung out of the window but the man dashed off with renewed vigour I was in my socks and the American was barefooted There being no hope of overtaking him we fired our last cartridges at him But he still kept on running going along the right side of the court towards the end of the right wing of the chateau which had no other outlet than the door of the little chamber occupied by the forest keeper The man though he was evidently wounded by our bullets was now twenty yards ahead of us Suddenly behind us and above our heads a window in the gallery opened and we heard the voice of Rouletabille crying out desperately Fire Bernier Fire At that moment the clear moonlight night was further lit by a broad flash By its light we saw Daddy Bernier with his gun on the threshold of the donjon door He had taken good aim The shadow fell But as it had reached the end of the right wing of the chateau it fell on the other side of the angle of the building that is to say we saw it about to fall but not the actual sinking to the ground Bernier Arthur Rance and myself reached the other side twenty seconds later The shadow was lying dead at our feet Aroused from his lethargy by the cries and reports Larsan opened the window of his chamber and called out to us Rouletabille quite awake now joined us at the same moment and I cried out to him He is dead is dead So much the better he said Take him into the vestibule of the chateau Then as if on second thought he said No no Let us put him in his own room Rouletabille knocked at the door Nobody answered Naturally this did not surprise me He is evidently not there otherwise he would have come out said the reporter Let us carry him to the vestibule then Since reaching the dead shadow a thick cloud had covered the moon and darkened the night so that we were unable to make out the features Daddy Jacques who had now joined us helped us to carry the body into the vestibule where we laid it down on the lower step of the stairs On the way I had felt my hands wet from the warm blood flowing from the wounds Daddy Jacques flew to the kitchen and returned with a lantern He held it close to the face of the dead shadow and we recognised the keeper the man called by the landlord of the Donjon Inn the Green Man whom an hour earlier I had seen come out of Arthur Rance s chamber carrying a parcel But what I had seen I could only tell Rouletabille later when we were alone Rouletabille and Frederic Larsan experienced a cruel disappointment at the result of the night s adventure They could only look in consternation and stupefaction at the body of the Green Man Daddy Jacques showed a stupidly sorrowful face and with silly lamentations kept repeating that we were mistaken the keeper could not be the assailant We were obliged to compel him to be quiet He could not have shown greater grief had the body been that of his own son I noticed while all the rest of us were more or less undressed and barefooted that he was fully clothed Rouletabille had not left the body Kneeling on the flagstones by the light of Daddy Jacques s lantern he removed the clothes from the body and laid bare its breast Then snatching the lantern from Daddy Jacques he held it over the corpse and saw a gaping wound Rising suddenly he exclaimed in a voice filled with savage irony The man you believe to have been shot was killed by the stab of a knife in his heart I thought Rouletabille had gone mad but bending over the body I quickly satisfied myself that Rouletabille was right Not a sign of a bullet anywhere the wound evidently made by a sharp blade had penetrated the heart CHAPTER XXIII The Double Scent I had hardly recovered from the surprise into which this new discovery had plunged me when Rouletabille touched me on the shoulder and asked me to follow him into his room What are we going to do there To think the matter over I confess I was in no condition for doing much thinking nor could I understand how Rouletabille could so control himself as to be able calmly to sit down for reflection when he must have known that Mademoiselle Stangerson was at that moment almost on the point of death But his self control was more than I could explain Closing the door of his room he motioned me to a chair and seating himself before me took out his pipe We sat there for some time in silence and then I fell asleep When I awoke it was daylight It was eight o clock by my watch Rouletabille was no longer in the room I rose to go out when the door opened and my friend re entered He had evidently lost no time How about Mademoiselle Stangerson I asked him Her condition though very alarming is not desperate When did you leave this room Towards dawn I guess you have been hard at work Rather Have you found out anything Two sets of footprints Do they explain anything Yes Have they anything to do with the mystery of the keeper s body Yes the mystery is no longer a mystery This morning walking round the chateau I found two distinct sets of footprints made at the same time last night They were made by two persons walking side by side I followed them from the court towards the oak grove Larsan joined me They were the same kind of footprints as were made at the time of the assault in The Yellow Room one set was from clumsy boots and the other was made by neat ones except that the big toe of one of the sets was of a different size from the one measured in The Yellow Room incident I compared the marks with the paper patterns I had previously made Still following the tracks of the prints Larsan and I passed out of the oak grove and reached the border of the lake There they turned off to a little path leading to the high road to Epinay where we lost the traces in the newly macadamised highway We went back to the chateau and parted at the courtyard We met again however in Daddy Jacques s room to which our separate trains of thinking had led us both We found the old servant in bed His clothes on the chair were wet through and his boots very muddy He certainly did not get into that state in helping us to carry the body of the keeper It was not raining then Then his face showed extreme fatigue and he looked at us out of terror stricken eyes On our first questioning him he told us that he had gone to bed immediately after the doctor had arrived On pressing him however for it was evident to us he was not speaking the truth he confessed that he had been away from the chateau He explained his absence by saying that he had a headache and went out into the fresh air but had gone no further than the oak grove When we then described to him the whole route he had followed he sat up in bed trembling And you were not alone cried Larsan Did you see it then gasped Daddy Jacques What I asked The phantom the black phantom Then he told us that for several nights he had seen what he kept calling the black phantom It came into the park at the stroke of midnight and glided stealthily through the trees it appeared to him to pass through the trunks of the trees Twice he had seen it from his window by the light of the moon and had risen and followed the strange apparition The night before last he had almost overtaken it but it had vanished at the corner of the donjon Last night however he had not left the chateau his mind being disturbed by a presentiment that some new crime would be attempted Suddenly he saw the black phantom rush out from somewhere in the middle of the court He followed it to the lake and to the high road to Epinay where the phantom suddenly disappeared Did you see his face demanded Larsan No I saw nothing but black veils Did you go out after what passed on the gallery I could not I was terrified Daddy Jacques I said in a threatening voice you did not follow it you and the phantom walked to Epinay together arm in arm No he cried turning his eyes away I did not It came on to pour and I turned back I don t know what became of the black phantom We left him and when we were outside I turned to Larsan looking him full in the face and put my question suddenly to take him off his guard An accomplice How can I tell he replied shrugging his shoulders You can t be sure of anything in a case like this Twenty four hours ago I would have sworn that there was no accomplice He left me saying he was off to Epinay Well what do you make of it I asked Rouletabille after he had ended his recital Personally I am utterly in the dark I can t make anything out of it What do you gather Everything Everything he exclaimed But he said abruptly let s find out more about Mademoiselle Stangerson CHAPTER XXIV Rouletabille Knows the Two Halves of the Murderer Mademoiselle Stangerson had been almost murdered for the second time Unfortunately she was in too weak a state to bear the severer injuries of this second attack as well as she had those of the first She had received three wounds in the breast from the murderer s knife and she lay long between life and death Her strong physique however saved her but though she recovered physically it was found that her mind had been affected The slightest allusion to the terrible incident sent her into delirium and the arrest of Robert Darzac which followed on the day following the tragic death of the keeper seemed to sink her fine intelligence into complete melancholia Robert Darzac arrived at the chateau towards half past nine I saw him hurrying through the park his hair and clothes in disorder and his face a deadly white Rouletabille and I were looking out of a window in the gallery He saw us and gave a despairing cry I m too late Rouletabille answered She lives A minute later Darzac had gone into Mademoiselle Stangerson s room and through the door we could hear his heart rending sobs There s a fate about this place groaned Rouletabille Some infernal gods must be watching over the misfortunes of this family If I had not been drugged I should have saved Mademoiselle Stangerson I should have silenced him forever And the keeper would not have been killed Monsieur Darzac came in to speak with us His distress was terrible Rouletabille told him everything his preparations for Mademoiselle Stangerson s safety his plans for either capturing or for disposing of the assailant for ever and how he would have succeeded had it not been for the drugging If only you had trusted me said the young man in a low tone If you had but begged Mademoiselle Stangerson to confide in me But then everybody here distrusts everybody else the daughter distrusts her father and even her lover While you ask me to protect her she is doing all she can to frustrate me That was why I came on the scene too late At Monsieur Robert Darzac s request Rouletabille described the whole scene Leaning on the wall to prevent himself from falling he had made his way to Mademoiselle Stangerson s room while we were running after the supposed murderer The ante room door was open and when he entered he found Mademoiselle Stangerson lying partly thrown over the desk Her dressing gown was dyed with the blood flowing from her bosom Still under the influence of the drug he felt he was walking in a horrible nightmare He went back to the gallery automatically opened a window shouted his order to fire and then returned to the room He crossed the deserted boudoir entered the drawing room and tried to rouse Monsieur Stangerson who was lying on a sofa Monsieur Stangerson rose stupidly and let himself be drawn by Rouletabille into the room where on seeing his daughter s body he uttered a heart rending cry Both united their feeble strength and carried her to her bed On his way to join us Rouletabille passed by the desk On the floor near it he saw a large packet He knelt down and finding the wrapper loose he examined it and made out an enormous quantity of papers and photographs On one of the papers he read New differential electroscopic condenser Fundamental properties of substance intermediary between ponderable matter and imponderable ether Strange irony of fate that the professor s precious papers should be restored to him at the very time when an attempt was being made to deprive him of his daughter s life What are papers worth to him now The morning following that awful night saw Monsieur de Marquet once more at the chateau with his Registrar and gendarmes Of course we were all questioned Rouletabille and I had already agreed on what to say I kept back any information as to my being in the dark closet and said nothing about the drugging We did not wish to suggest in any way that Mademoiselle Stangerson had been expecting her nocturnal visitor The poor woman might perhaps never recover and it was none of our business to lift the veil of a secret the preservation of which she had paid for so dearly Arthur Rance told everybody in a manner so natural that it astonished me that he had last seen the keeper towards eleven o clock of that fatal night He had come for his valise he said which he was to take for him early next morning to the Saint Michel station and had been kept out late running after poachers Arthur Rance had indeed intended to leave the chateau and according to his habit to walk to the station Monsieur Stangerson confirmed what Rance had said adding that he had not asked Rance to dine with him because his friend had taken his final leave of them both earlier in the evening Monsieur Rance had had tea served him in his room because he had complained of a slight indisposition Bernier testified instructed by Rouletabille that the keeper had ordered him to meet at a spot near the oak grove for the purpose of looking out for poachers Finding that the keeper did not keep his appointment he Bernier had gone in search of him He had almost arrived at the donjon when he saw a figure running swiftly in a direction opposite to him towards the right wing of the chateau He heard revolver shots from behind the figure and saw Rouletabille at one of the gallery windows He heard Rouletabille call out to him to fire and he had fired He believed he had killed the man until he learned after Rouletabille had uncovered the body that the man had died from a knife thrust Who had given it he could not imagine Nobody could have been near the spot without my seeing him When the examining magistrate reminded him that the spot where the body was found was very dark and that he himself had not been able to recognise the keeper before firing Daddy Bernier replied that neither had they seen the other body nor had they found it In the narrow court where five people were standing it would have been strange if the other body had it been there could have escaped The only door that opened into the court was that of the keeper s room and that door was closed and the key of it was found in the keeper s pocket However that might be the examining magistrate did not pursue his inquiry further in this direction He was evidently convinced that we had missed the man we were chasing and we had come upon the keeper s body in our chase This matter of the keeper was another matter entirely He wanted to satisfy himself about that without any further delay Probably it fitted in with the conclusions he had already arrived at as to the keeper and his intrigues with the wife of Mathieu the landlord of the Donjon Inn This Mathieu later in the afternoon was arrested and taken to Corbeil in spite of his rheumatism He had been heard to threaten the keeper and though no evidence against him had been found at his inn the evidence of carters who had heard the threats was enough to justify his retention The examination had proceeded thus far when to our surprise Frederic Larsan returned to the chateau He was accompanied by one of the employees of the railway At that moment Rance and I were in the vestibule discussing Mathieu s guilt or innocence while Rouletabille stood apart buried apparently in thought The examining magistrate and his Registrar were in the little green drawing room while Darzac was with the doctor and Stangerson in the lady s chamber As Frederic Larsan entered the vestibule with the railway employed Rouletabille and I at once recognised him by the small blond beard We exchanged meaningful glances Larsan had himself announced to the examining magistrate by the gendarme and entered with the railway servant as Daddy Jacques came out Some ten minutes went by during which Rouletabille appeared extremely impatient The door of the drawing room was then opened and we heard the magistrate calling to the gendarme who entered Presently he came out mounted the stairs and coming back shortly went in to the magistrate and said Monsieur Monsieur Robert Darzac will not come What Not come cried Monsieur de Marquet He says he cannot leave Mademoiselle Stangerson in her present state Very well said Monsieur de Marquet then we ll go to him Monsieur de Marquet and the gendarme mounted the stairs He made a sign to Larsan and the railroad employe to follow Rouletabille and I went along too On reaching the door of Mademoiselle Stangerson s chamber Monsieur de Marquet knocked A chambermaid appeared It was Sylvia with her hair all in disorder and consternation showing on her face Is Monsieur Stangerson within asked the magistrate Yes Monsieur Tell him that I wish to speak with him Stangerson came out His appearance was wretched in the extreme What do you want he demanded of the magistrate May I not be left in peace Monsieur Monsieur said the magistrate it is absolutely necessary that I should see Monsieur Darzac at once If you cannot induce him to come I shall be compelled to use the help of the law The professor made no reply He looked at us all like a man being led to execution and then went back into the room Almost immediately after Monsieur Robert Darzac came out He was very pale He looked at us and his eyes falling on the railway servant his features stiffened and he could hardly repress a groan We were all much moved by the appearance of the man We felt that what was about to happen would decide the fate of Monsieur Robert Darzac Frederic Larsan s face alone was radiant showing a joy as of a dog that had at last got its prey Pointing to the railway servant Monsieur de Marquet said to Monsieur Darzac Do you recognise this man Monsieur I do said Monsieur Darzac in a tone which he vainly tried to make firm He is an employe at the station at Epinay sur Orge This young man went on Monsieur de Marquet affirms that he saw you get off the train at Epinay sur Orge That night said Monsieur Darzac interrupting at half past ten it is quite true An interval of silence followed Monsieur Darzac the magistrate went on in a tone of deep emotion Monsieur Darzac what were you doing that night at Epinay sur Orge at that time Monsieur Darzac remained silent simply closing his eyes Monsieur Darzac insisted Monsieur de Marquet can you tell me how you employed your time that night Monsieur Darzac opened his eyes He seemed to have recovered his self control No Monsieur Think Monsieur For if you persist in your strange refusal I shall be under the painful necessity of keeping you at my disposition I refuse Monsieur Darzac in the name of the law I arrest you The magistrate had no sooner pronounced the words than I saw Rouletabille move quickly towards Monsieur Darzac He would certainly have spoken to him but Darzac by a gesture held him off As the gendarme approached his prisoner a despairing cry rang through the room Robert Robert We recognised the voice of Mademoiselle Stangerson We all shuddered Larsan himself turned pale Monsieur Darzac in response to the cry had flown back into the room The magistrate the gendarme and Larsan followed closely after Rouletabille and I remained on the threshold It was a heart breaking sight that met our eyes Mademoiselle Stangerson with a face of deathly pallor had risen on her bed in spite of the restraining efforts of two doctors and her father She was holding out her trembling arms towards Robert Darzac on whom Larsan and the gendarme had laid hands Her distended eyes saw she understood her lips seemed to form a word but nobody made it out and she fell back insensible Monsieur Darzac was hurried out of the room and placed in the vestibule to wait for the vehicle Larsan had gone to fetch We were all overcome by emotion and even Monsieur de Marquet had tears in his eyes Rouletabille took advantage of the opportunity to say to Monsieur Darzac Are you going to put in any defense No replied the prisoner Very well then I will Monsieur You cannot do it said the unhappy man with a faint smile I can and I will Rouletabille s voice had in it a strange strength and confidence I can do it Monsieur Robert Darzac because I know more than you do Come Come murmured Darzac almost angrily Have no fear I shall know only what will benefit you You must know nothing young man if you want me to be grateful Rouletabille shook his head going close up to Darzac Listen to what I am about to say he said in a low tone and let it give you confidence You do not know the name of the murderer Mademoiselle Stangerson knows it but only half of it but I know his two halves I know the whole man Robert Darzac opened his eyes with a look that showed he had not understood a word of what Rouletabille had said to him At that moment the conveyance arrived driven by Frederic Larsan Darzac and the gendarme entered it Larsan remaining on the driver s seat The prisoner was taken to Corbeil CHAPTER XXV Rouletabille Goes on a Journey That same evening Rouletabille and I left the Glandier We were very glad to get away and there was nothing more to keep us there I declared my intention to give up the whole matter It had been too much for me Rouletabille with a friendly tap on my shoulder confessed that he had nothing more to learn at the Glandier he had learned there all it had to tell him We reached Paris about eight o clock dined and then tired out we separated agreeing to meet the next morning at my rooms Rouletabille arrived next day at the hour agreed on He was dressed in a suit of English tweed with an ulster on his arm and a valise in his hand Evidently he had prepared himself for a journey How long shall you be away I asked A month or two he said It all depends I asked him no more questions Do you know he asked what the word was that Mademoiselle Stangerson tried to say before she fainted No nobody heard it I heard it replied Rouletabille She said Speak Do you think Darzac will speak Never I was about to make some further observations but he wrung my hand warmly and wished me good bye I had only time to ask him one question before he left Are you not afraid that other attempts may be made while you re away No Not now that Darzac is in prison he answered With this strange remark he left I was not to see him again until the day of Darzac s trial at the court when he appeared to explain the inexplicable CHAPTER XXVI In Which Joseph Rouletabille Is Awaited with Impatience On the fifteenth of January that is to say two months and a half after the tragic events I have narrated the Epoque printed as the first column of the front page the following sensational article The Seine et Oise jury is summoned to day to give its verdict on one of the most mysterious affairs in the annals of crime There never has been a case with so many obscure incomprehensible and inexplicable points And yet the prosecution has not hesitated to put into the prisoner s dock a man who is respected esteemed and loved by all who knew him a young savant the hope of French science whose whole life has been devoted to knowledge and truth When Paris heard of Monsieur Robert Darzac s arrest a unanimous cry of protest arose from all sides The whole Sorbonne disgraced by this act of the examining magistrate asserted its belief in the innocence of Mademoiselle Stangerson s fiance Monsieur Stangerson was loud in his denunciation of this miscarriage of justice There is no doubt in the mind of anybody that could the victim speak she would claim from the jurors of Seine et Oise the man she wishes to make her husband and whom the prosecution would send to the scaffold It is to be hoped that Mademoiselle Stangerson will shortly recover her reason which has been temporarily unhinged by the horrible mystery at the Glandier The question before the jury is the one we propose to deal with this very day We have decided not to permit twelve worthy men to commit a disgraceful miscarriage of justice We confess that the remarkable coincidences the many convicting evidences and the inexplicable silence on the part of the accused as well as a total absence of any evidence for an alibi were enough to warrant the bench of judges in assuming that in this man alone was centered the truth of the affair The evidences are in appearance so overwhelming against Monsieur Robert Darzac that a detective so well informed so intelligent and generally so successful as Monsieur Frederic Larsan may be excused for having been misled by them Up to now everything has gone against Monsieur Robert Darzac in the magisterial inquiry To day however we are going to defend him before the jury and we are going to bring to the witness stand a light that will illumine the whole mystery of the Glandier For we possess the truth If we have not spoken sooner it is because the interests of certain parties in the case demand that we should take that course Our readers may remember the unsigned reports we published relating to the Left foot of the Rue Oberkampf at the time of the famous robbery of the Credit Universel and the famous case of the Gold Ingots of the Mint In both those cases we were able to discover the truth long before even the excellent ingenuity of Frederic Larsan had been able to unravel it These reports were written by our youngest reporter Joseph Rouletabille a youth of eighteen whose fame to morrow will be world wide When attention was first drawn to the Glandier case our youthful reporter was on the spot and installed in the chateau when every other representative of the press had been denied admission He worked side by side with Frederic Larsan He was amazed and terrified at the grave mistake the celebrated detective was about to make and tried to divert him from the false scent he was following but the great Fred refused to receive instructions from this young journalist We know now where it brought Monsieur Robert Darzac But now France must know the whole world must know that on the very evening on which Monsieur Darzac was arrested young Rouletabille entered our editorial office and informed us that he was about to go away on a journey How long I shall be away he said I cannot say perhaps a month perhaps two perhaps three perhaps I may never return Here is a letter If I am not back on the day on which Monsieur Darzac is to appear before the Assize Court have this letter opened and read to the court after all the witnesses have been heard Arrange it with Monsieur Darzac s counsel Monsieur Darzac is innocent In this letter is written the name of the murderer and that is all I have to say I am leaving to get my proofs for the irrefutable evidence of the murderer s guilt Our reporter departed For a long time we were without news from him but a week ago a stranger called upon our manager and said Act in accordance with the instructions of Joseph Rouletabille if it becomes necessary to do so The letter left by him holds the truth The gentleman who brought us this message would not give us his name To day the fifteenth of January is the day of the trial Joseph Rouletabille has not returned It may be we shall never see him again The press also counts its heroes its martyrs to duty It may be he is no longer living We shall know how to avenge him Our manager will this afternoon be at the Court of Assize at Versailles with the letter the letter containing the name of the murderer Those Parisians who flocked to the Assize Court at Versailles to be present at the trial of what was known as the Mystery of The Yellow Room will certainly remember the terrible crush at the Saint Lazare station The ordinary trains were so full that special trains had to be made up The article in the Epoque had so excited the populace that discussion was rife everywhere even to the verge of blows Partisans of Rouletabille fought with the supporters of Frederic Larsan Curiously enough the excitement was due less to the fact that an innocent man was in danger of a wrongful conviction than to the interest taken in their own ideas as to the Mystery of The Yellow Room Each had his explanation to which each held fast Those who explained the crime on Frederic Larsan s theory would not admit that there could be any doubt as to the perspicacity of the popular detective Others who had arrived at a different solution naturally insisted that this was Rouletabille s explanation though they did not as yet know what that was With the day s Epoque in their hands the Larsans and the Rouletabilles fought and shoved each other on the steps of the Palais de Justice right into the court itself Those who could not get in remained in the neighbourhood until evening and were with great difficulty kept back by the soldiery and the police They became hungry for news welcoming the most absurd rumours At one time the rumour spread that Monsieur Stangerson himself had been arrested in the court and had confessed to being the murderer This goes to show to what a pitch of madness nervous excitement may carry people Rouletabille was still expected Some pretended to know him and when a young man with a pass crossed the open space which separated the crowd from the Court House a scuffle took place Cries were raised of Rouletabille there s Rouletabille The arrival of the manager of the paper was the signal for a great demonstration Some applauded others hissed The trial itself was presided over by Monsieur de Rocouz a judge filled with the prejudice of his class but a man honest at heart The witnesses had been called I was there of course as were all who had in any way been in touch with the mysteries of the Glandier Monsieur Stangerson looking many years older and almost unrecognisable Larsan Arthur Rance with his face ruddy as ever Daddy Jacques Daddy Mathieu who was brought into court handcuffed between two gendarmes Madame Mathieu in tears the two Berniers the two nurses the steward all the domestics of the chateau the employe of the Paris Post Office the railway employe from Epinay some friends of Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson and all Monsieur Darzac s witnesses I was lucky enough to be called early in the trial so that I was then able to watch and be present at almost the whole of the proceedings The court was so crowded that many lawyers were compelled to find seats on the steps Behind the bench of justices were representatives from other benches Monsieur Robert Darzac stood in the prisoner s dock between policemen tall handsome and calm A murmur of admiration rather than of compassion greeted his appearance He leaned forward towards his counsel Maitre Henri Robert who assisted by his chief secretary Maitre Andre Hesse was busily turning over the folios of his brief Many expected that Monsieur Stangerson after giving his evidence would have gone over to the prisoner and shaken hands with him but he left the court without another word It was remarked that the jurors appeared to be deeply interested in a rapid conversation which the manager of the Epoque was having with Maitre Henri Robert The manager later sat down in the front row of the public seats Some were surprised that he was not asked to remain with the other witnesses in the room reserved for them The reading of the indictment was got through as it always is without any incident I shall not here report the long examination to which Monsieur Darzac was subjected He answered all the questions quickly and easily His silence as to the important matters of which we know was dead against him It would seem as if this reticence would be fatal for him He resented the President s reprimands He was told that his silence might mean death Very well he said I will submit to it but I am innocent With that splendid ability which has made his fame Maitre Robert took advantage of the incident and tried to show that it brought out in noble relief his client s character for only heroic natures could remain silent for moral reasons in face of such a danger The eminent advocate however only succeeded in assuring those who were already assured of Darzac s innocence At the adjournment Rouletabille had not yet arrived Every time a door opened all eyes there turned towards it and back to the manager of the Epoque who sat impassive in his place When he once was feeling in his pocket a loud murmur of expectation followed The letter It is not however my intention to report in detail the course of the trial My readers are sufficiently acquainted with the mysteries surrounding the Glandier case to enable me to go on to the really dramatic denouement of this ever memorable day When the trial was resumed Maitre Henri Robert questioned Daddy Mathieu as to his complicity in the death of the keeper His wife was also brought in and was confronted by her husband She burst into tears and confessed that she had been the keeper s mistress and that her husband had suspected it She again however affirmed that he had had nothing to do with the murder of her lover Maitre Henri Robert thereupon asked the court to hear Frederic Larsan on this point In a short conversation which I have had with Frederic Larsan during the adjournment declared the advocate he has made me understand that the death of the keeper may have been brought about otherwise than by the hand of Mathieu It will be interesting to hear Frederic Larsan s theory Frederic Larsan was brought in His explanation was quite clear I see no necessity he said for bringing Mathieu in this I have told Monsieur de Marquet that the man s threats had biassed the examining magistrate against him To me the attempt to murder Mademoiselle and the death of the keeper are the work of one and the same person Mademoiselle Stangerson s murderer flying through the court was fired on it was thought he was struck perhaps killed As a matter of fact he only stumbled at the moment of his disappearance behind the corner of the right wing of the chateau There he encountered the keeper who no doubt tried to seize him The murderer had in his hand the knife with which he had stabbed Mademoiselle Stangerson and with this he killed the keeper This very simple explanation appeared at once plausible and satisfying A murmur of approbation was heard And the murderer What became of him asked the President He was evidently hidden in an obscure corner at the end of the court After the people had left the court carrying with them the body of the keeper the murderer quietly made his escape The words had scarcely left Larsan s mouth when from the back of the court came a youthful voice I agree with Frederic Larsan as to the death of the keeper but I do not agree with him as to the way the murderer escaped Everybody turned round astonished The clerks of the court sprang towards the speaker calling out silence and the President angrily ordered the intruder to be immediately expelled The same clear voice however was again heard It is I Monsieur President Joseph Rouletabille CHAPTER XXVII In Which Joseph Rouletabille Appears in All His Glory The excitement was extreme Cries from fainting women were to be heard amid the extraordinary bustle and stir The majesty of the law was utterly forgotten The President tried in vain to make himself heard Rouletabille made his way forward with difficulty but by dint of much elbowing reached his manager and greeted him cordially The letter was passed to him and pocketing it he turned to the witness box He was dressed exactly as on the day he left me even to the ulster over his arm Turning to the President he said I beg your pardon Monsieur President but I have only just arrived from America The steamer was late My name is Joseph Rouletabille The silence which followed his stepping into the witness box was broken by laughter when his words were heard Everybody seemed relieved and glad to find him there as if in the expectation of hearing the truth at last But the President was extremely incensed So you are Joseph Rouletabille he replied well young man I ll teach you what comes of making a farce of justice By virtue of my discretionary power I hold you at the court s disposition I ask nothing better Monsieur President I have come here for that purpose I humbly beg the court s pardon for the disturbance of which I have been the innocent cause I beg you to believe that nobody has a greater respect for the court than I have I came in as I could He smiled Take him away ordered the President Maitre Henri Robert intervened He began by apologising for the young man who he said was moved only by the best intentions He made the President understand that the evidence of a witness who had slept at the Glandier during the whole of that eventful week could not be omitted and the present witness moreover had come to name the real murderer Are you going to tell us who the murderer was asked the President somewhat convinced though still sceptical I have come for that purpose Monsieur President replied Rouletabille An attempt at applause was silenced by the usher Joseph Rouletabille said Maitre Henri Robert has not been regularly subpoenaed as a witness but I hope Monsieur President you will examine him in virtue of your discretionary powers Very well said the President we will question him But we must proceed in order The Advocate General rose It would perhaps be better he said if the young man were to tell us now whom he suspects The President nodded ironically If the Advocate General attaches importance to the deposition of Monsieur Joseph Rouletabille I see no reason why this witness should not give us the name of the murderer A pin drop could have been heard Rouletabille stood silent looking sympathetically at Darzac who for the first time since the opening of the trial showed himself agitated Well cried the President we wait for the name of the murderer Rouletabille feeling in his waistcoat pocket drew his watch and looking at it said Monsieur President I cannot name the murderer before half past six o clock Loud murmurs of disappointment filled the room Some of the lawyers were heard to say He s making fun of us The President in a stern voice said This joke has gone far enough You may retire Monsieur into the witnesses room I hold you at our disposition Rouletabille protested I assure you Monsieur President he cried in his sharp clear voice that when I do name the murderer you will understand why I could not speak before half past six I assert this on my honour I can however give you now some explanation of the murder of the keeper Monsieur Frederic Larsan who has seen me at work at the Glandier can tell you with what care I studied this case I found myself compelled to differ with him in arresting Monsieur Robert Darzac who is innocent Monsieur Larsan knows of my good faith and knows that some importance may be attached to my discoveries which have often corroborated his own Frederic Larsan said Monsieur President it will be interesting to hear Monsieur Joseph Rouletabille especially as he differs from me A murmur of approbation greeted the detective s speech He was a good sportsman and accepted the challenge The struggle between the two promised to be exciting As the President remained silent Frederic Larsan continued We agree that the murderer of the keeper was the assailant of Mademoiselle Stangerson but as we are not agreed as to how the murderer escaped I am curious to hear Monsieur Rouletabille s explanation I have no doubt you are said my friend General laughter followed this remark The President angrily declared that if it was repeated he would have the court cleared Now young man said the President you have heard Monsieur Frederic Larsan how did the murderer get away from the court Rouletabille looked at Madame Mathieu who smiled back at him sadly Since Madame Mathieu he said has freely admitted her intimacy with the keeper Why it s the boy exclaimed Daddy Mathieu Remove that man ordered the President Mathieu was removed from the court Rouletabille went on Since she has made this confession I am free to tell you that she often met the keeper at night on the first floor of the donjon in the room which was once an oratory These meetings became more frequent when her husband was laid up by his rheumatism She gave him morphine to ease his pain and to give herself more time for the meetings Madame Mathieu came to the chateau that night enveloped in a large black shawl which served also as a disguise This was the phantom that disturbed Daddy Jacques She knew how to imitate the mewing of Mother Angenoux cat and she would make the cries to advise the keeper of her presence The recent repairs of the donjon did not interfere with their meetings in the keeper s old room in the donjon since the new room assigned to him at the end of the right wing was separated from the steward s room by a partition only Previous to the tragedy in the courtyard Madame Mathieu and the keeper left the donjon together I learnt these facts from my examination of the footmarks in the court the next morning Bernier the concierge whom I had stationed behind the donjon as he will explain himself could not see what passed in the court He did not reach the court until he heard the revolver shots and then he fired When the woman parted from the man she went towards the open gate of the court while he returned to his room He had almost reached the door when the revolvers rang out He had just reached the corner when a shadow bounded by Meanwhile Madame Mathieu surprised by the revolver shots and by the entrance of people into the court crouched in the darkness The court is a large one and being near the gate she might easily have passed out unseen But she remained and saw the body being carried away In great agony of mind she neared the vestibule and saw the dead body of her lover on the stairs lit up by Daddy Jacques lantern She then fled and Daddy Jacques joined her That same night before the murder Daddy Jacques had been awakened by the cat s cry and looking through his window had seen the black phantom Hastily dressing himself he went out and recognised her He is an old friend of Madame Mathieu and when she saw him she had to tell him of her relations with the keeper and begged his assistance Daddy Jacques took pity on her and accompanied her through the oak grove out of the park past the border of the lake to the road to Epinay From there it was but a very short distance to her home Daddy Jacques returned to the chateau and seeing how important it was for Madame Mathieu s presence at the chateau to remain unknown he did all he could to hide it I appeal to Monsieur Larsan who saw me next morning examine the two sets of footprints Here Rouletabille turning towards Madame Mathieu with a bow said The footprints of Madame bear a strange resemblance to the neat footprints of the murderer Madame Mathieu trembled and looked at him with wide eyes as if in wonder at what he would say next Madame has a shapely foot long and rather large for a woman The imprint with its pointed toe is very like that of the murderer s A movement in the court was repressed by Rouletabille He held their attention at once I hasten to add he went on that I attach no importance to this Outward signs like these are often liable to lead us into error if we do not reason rightly Monsieur Robert Darzac s footprints are also like the murderer s and yet he is not the murderer The President turning to Madame Mathieu asked Is that in accordance with what you know occurred Yes Monsieur President she replied it is as if Monsieur Rouletabille had been behind us Did you see the murderer running towards the end of the right wing Yes as clearly as I saw them afterwards carrying the keeper s body What became of the murderer You were in the courtyard and could easily have seen I saw nothing of him Monsieur President It became quite dark just then Then Monsieur Rouletabille said the President must explain how the murderer made his escape Rouletabille continued It was impossible for the murderer to escape by the way he had entered the court without our seeing him or if we couldn t see him we must certainly have felt him since the court is a very narrow one enclosed in high iron railings Then if the man was hemmed in that narrow square how is it you did not find him I have been asking you that for the last half hour Monsieur President replied Rouletabille I cannot answer that question before half past six By this time the people in the court room were beginning to believe in this new witness They were amused by his melodramatic action in thus fixing the hour but they seemed to have confidence in the outcome As for the President it looked as if he also had made up his mind to take the young man in the same way He had certainly been impressed by Rouletabille s explanation of Madame Mathieu s part Well Monsieur Rouletabille he said as you say but don t let us see any more of you before half past six Rouletabille bowed to the President and made his way to the door of the witnesses room I quietly made my way through the crowd and left the court almost at the same time as Rouletabille He greeted me heartily and looked happy I ll not ask you my dear fellow I said smiling what you ve been doing in America because I ve no doubt you ll say you can t tell me until after half past six No my dear Sainclair I ll tell you right now why I went to America I went in search of the name of the other half of the murderer The name of the other half Exactly When we last left the Glandier I knew there were two halves to the murderer and the name of only one of them I went to America for the name of the other half I was too puzzled to answer Just then we entered the witnesses room and Rouletabille was immediately surrounded He showed himself very friendly to all except Arthur Rance to whom he exhibited a marked coldness of manner Frederic Larsan came in also Rouletabille went up and shook him heartily by the hand His manner toward the detective showed that he had got the better of the policeman Larsan smiled and asked him what he had been doing in America Rouletabille began by telling him some anecdotes of his voyage They then turned aside together apparently with the object of speaking confidentially I therefore discreetly left them and being curious to hear the evidence returned to my seat in the court room where the public plainly showed its lack of interest in what was going on in their impatience for Rouletabille s return at the appointed time On the stroke of half past six Joseph Rouletabille was again brought in It is impossible for me to picture the tense excitement which appeared on every face as he made his way to the bar Darzac rose to his feet frightfully pale The President addressing Rouletabille said gravely I will not ask you to take the oath because you have not been regularly summoned but I trust there is no need to urge upon you the gravity of the statement you are about to make Rouletabille looked the President quite calmly and steadily in the face and replied Yes Monsieur At your last appearance here said the President we had arrived at the point where you were to tell us how the murderer escaped and also his name Now Monsieur Rouletabille we await your explanation Very well Monsieur began my friend amidst a profound silence I had explained how it was impossible for the murderer to get away without being seen And yet he was there with us in the courtyard And you did not see him At least that is what the prosecution declares No We all of us saw him Monsieur le President cried Rouletabille Then why was he not arrested Because no one besides myself knew that he was the murderer It would have spoiled my plans to have had him arrested and I had then no proof other than my own reasoning I was convinced we had the murderer before us and that we were actually looking at him I have now brought what I consider the indisputable proof Speak out Monsieur Tell us the murderer s name You will find it on the list of names present in the court on the night of the tragedy replied Rouletabille The people present in the court room began showing impatience Some of them even called for the name and were silenced by the usher The list includes Daddy Jacques Bernier the concierge and mister Arthur Rance said the President Do you accuse any of these No Monsieur Then I do not understand what you are driving at There was no other person at the end of the court Yes Monsieur there was not at the end but above the court who was leaning out of the window Do you mean Frederic Larsan exclaimed the President Yes Frederic Larsan replied Rouletabille in a ringing tone Frederic Larsan is the murderer The court room became immediately filled with loud and indignant protests So astonished was he that the President did not attempt to quiet it The quick silence which followed was broken by the distinctly whispered words from the lips of Robert Darzac It s impossible He s mad You dare to accuse Frederic Larsan Monsieur asked the President If you are not mad what are your proofs Proofs Monsieur Do you want proofs Well here is one cried Rouletabille shrilly Let Frederic Larsan be called Usher call Frederic Larsan The usher hurried to the side door opened it and disappeared The door remained open while all eyes turned expectantly towards it The clerk re appeared and stepping forward said Monsieur President Frederic Larsan is not here He left at about four o clock and has not been seen since That is my proof cried Rouletabille triumphantly Explain yourself demanded the President My proof is Larsan s flight said the young reporter He will not come back You will see no more of Frederic Larsan Unless you are playing with the court Monsieur why did you not accuse him when he was present He would then have answered you He could give no other answer than the one he has now given by his flight We cannot believe that Larsan has fled There was no reason for his doing so Did he know you d make this charge He did I told him I would Do you mean to say that knowing Larsan was the murderer you gave him the opportunity to escape Yes Monsieur President I did replied Rouletabille proudly I am not a policeman I am a journalist and my business is not to arrest people My business is in the service of truth and is not that of an executioner If you are just Monsieur you will see that I am right You can now understand why I refrained until this hour to divulge the name I gave Larsan time to catch the four seventeen train for Paris where he would know where to hide himself and leave no traces You will not find Frederic Larsan declared Rouletabille fixing his eyes on Monsieur Robert Darzac He is too cunning He is a man who has always escaped you and whom you have long searched for in vain If he did not succeed in outwitting me he can yet easily outwit any police This man who four years ago introduced himself to the Surete and became celebrated as Frederic Larsan is notorious under another name a name well known to crime Frederic Larsan Monsieur President is Ballmeyer Ballmeyer cried the President Ballmeyer exclaimed Robert Darzac springing to his feet Ballmeyer It was true then Ah Monsieur Darzac you don t think I am mad now cried Rouletabille Ballmeyer Ballmeyer No other word could be heard in the courtroom The President adjourned the hearing Those of my readers who may not have heard of Ballmeyer will wonder at the excitement the name caused And yet the doings of this remarkable criminal form the subject matter of the most dramatic narratives of the newspapers and criminal records of the past twenty years It had been reported that he was dead and thus had eluded the police as he had eluded them throughout the whole of his career Ballmeyer was the best specimen of the high class gentleman swindler He was adept at sleight of hand tricks and no bolder or more ruthless crook ever lived He was received in the best society and was a member of some of the most exclusive clubs On many of his depredatory expeditions he had not hesitated to use the knife and the mutton bone No difficulty stopped him and no operation was too dangerous He had been caught but escaped on the very morning of his trial by throwing pepper into the eyes of the guards who were conducting him to Court It was known later that in spite of the keen hunt after him by the most expert of detectives he had sat that same evening at a first performance in the Theatre Francais without the slightest disguise He left France later to work America The police there succeeded in capturing him once but the extraordinary man escaped the next day It would need a volume to recount the adventures of this master criminal And yet this was the man Rouletabille had allowed to get away Knowing all about him and who he was he afforded the criminal an opportunity for another laugh at the society he had defied I could not help admiring the bold stroke of the young journalist because I felt certain his motive had been to protect both Mademoiselle Stangerson and rid Darzac of an enemy at the same time The crowd had barely recovered from the effect of the astonishing revelation when the hearing was resumed The question in everybody s mind was Admitting that Larsan was the murderer how did he get out of The Yellow Room Rouletabille was immediately called to the bar and his examination continued You have told us said the President that it was impossible to escape from the end of the court Since Larsan was leaning out of his window he had left the court How did he do that He escaped by a most unusual way He climbed the wall sprang onto the terrace and while we were engaged with the keeper s body reached the gallery by the window He then had little else to do than to open the window get in and call out to us as if he had just come from his own room To a man of Ballmeyer s strength all that was mere child s play And here Monsieur is the proof of what I say Rouletabille drew from his pocket a small packet from which he produced a strong iron peg This Monsieur he said is a spike which perfectly fits a hole still to be seen in the cornice supporting the terrace Larsan who thought and prepared for everything in case of any emergency had fixed this spike into the cornice All he had to do to make his escape good was to plant one foot on a stone which is placed at the corner of the chateau another on this support one hand on the cornice of the keeper s door and the other on the terrace and Larsan was clear of the ground The rest was easy His acting after dinner as if he had been drugged was make believe He was not drugged but he did drug me Of course he had to make it appear as if he also had been drugged so that no suspicion should fall on him for my condition Had I not been thus overpowered Larsan would never have entered Mademoiselle Stangerson s chamber that night and the attack on her would not have taken place A groan came from Darzac who appeared to be unable to control his suffering You can understand added Rouletabille that Larsan would feel himself hampered from the fact that my room was so close to his and from a suspicion that I would be on the watch that night Naturally he could not for a moment believe that I suspected him But I might see him leaving his room when he was about to go to Mademoiselle Stangerson He waited till I was asleep and my friend Sainclair was busy trying to rouse me Ten minutes after that Mademoiselle was calling out Murder How did you come to suspect Larsan asked the President My pure reason pointed to him That was why I watched him But I did not foresee the drugging He is very cunning Yes my pure reason pointed to him but I required tangible proof so that my eyes could see him as my pure reason saw him What do you mean by your pure reason That power of one s mind which admits of no disturbing elements to a conclusion The day following the incident of the inexplicable gallery I felt myself losing control of it I had allowed myself to be diverted by fallacious evidence but I recovered and again took hold of the right end I satisfied myself that the murderer could not have left the gallery either naturally or supernaturally I narrowed the field of consideration to that small circle so to speak The murderer could not be outside that circle Now who was in it There was first the murderer Then there were Daddy Jacques Monsieur Stangerson Frederic Larsan and myself Five persons in all counting in the murderer And yet in the gallery there were but four Now since it had been demonstrated to me that the fifth could not have escaped it was evident that one of the four present in the gallery must be a double he must be himself and the murderer also Why had I not seen this before Simply because the phenomenon of the double personality had not occurred before in this inquiry Now who of the four persons in the gallery was both that person and the assassin I went over in my mind what I had seen I had seen at one and the same time Monsieur Stangerson and the murderer Daddy Jacques and the murderer myself and the murderer so that the murderer then could not be either Monsieur Stangerson Daddy Jacques or myself Had I seen Frederic Larsan and the murderer at the same time No Two seconds had passed during which I lost sight of the murderer for as I have noted in my papers he arrived two seconds before Monsieur Stangerson Daddy Jacques and myself at the meeting point of the two galleries That would have given Larsan time to go through the off turning gallery snatch off his false beard return and hurry with us as if like us in pursuit of the murderer I was sure now I had got hold of the right end in my reasoning With Frederic Larsan was now always associated in my mind the personality of the unknown of whom I was in pursuit the murderer in other words That revelation staggered me I tried to regain my balance by going over the evidences previously traced but which had diverted my mind and led me away from Frederic Larsan What were these evidences first I had seen the unknown in Mademoiselle Stangerson s chamber On going to Frederic Larsan s room I had found Larsan sound asleep second The ladder third I had placed Frederic Larsan at the end of the off turning gallery and had told him that I would rush into Mademoiselle Stangerson s room to try to capture the murderer Then I returned to Mademoiselle Stangerson s chamber where I had seen the unknown The first evidence did not disturb me much It is likely that when I descended from my ladder after having seen the unknown in Mademoiselle Stangerson s chamber Larsan had already finished what he was doing there Then while I was re entering the chateau Larsan went back to his own room and undressing himself went to sleep Nor did the second evidence trouble me If Larsan were the murderer he could have no use for a ladder but the ladder might have been placed there to give an appearance to the murderer s entrance from without the chateau especially as Larsan had accused Darzac and Darzac was not in the chateau that night Further the ladder might have been placed there to facilitate Larsan s flight in case of absolute necessity But the third evidence puzzled me altogether Having placed Larsan at the end of the off turning gallery I could not explain how he had taken advantage of the moment when I had gone to the left wing of the chateau to find Monsieur Stangerson and Daddy Jacques to return to Mademoiselle Stangerson s room It was a very dangerous thing to do He risked being captured and he knew it And he was very nearly captured He had not had time to regain his post as he had certainly hoped to do He had then a very strong reason for returning to his room As for myself when I sent Daddy Jacques to the end of the right gallery I naturally thought that Larsan was still at his post Daddy Jacques in going to his post had not looked when he passed to see whether Larsan was at his post or not What then was the urgent reason which had compelled Larsan to go to the room a second time I guessed it to be some evidence of his presence there He had left something very important in that room What was it And had he recovered it I begged Madame Bernier who was accustomed to clean the room to look and she found a pair of eye glasses this pair Monsieur President And Rouletabille drew the eye glasses of which we know from his pocket When I saw these eye glasses he continued I was utterly nonplussed I had never seen Larsan wear eye glasses What did they mean Suddenly I exclaimed to myself I wonder if he is long sighted I had never seen Larsan write He might then be long sighted They would certainly know at the Surete and also know if the glasses were his Such evidence would be damning That explained Larsan s return I know now that Larsan or Ballmeyer is long sighted and that these glasses belonged to him I now made one mistake I was not satisfied with the evidence I had obtained I wished to see the man s face Had I refrained from this the second terrible attack would not have occurred But asked the President why should Larsan go to Mademoiselle Stangerson s room at all Why should he twice attempt to murder her Because he loves her Monsieur President That is certainly a reason but It is the only reason He was madly in love and because of that and other things he was capable of committing any crime Did Mademoiselle Stangerson know this Yes Monsieur but she was ignorant of the fact that the man who was pursuing her was Frederic Larsan otherwise of course he would not have been allowed to be at the chateau I noticed when he was in her room after the incident in the gallery that he kept himself in the shadow and that he kept his head bent down He was looking for the lost eye glasses Mademoiselle Stangerson knew Larsan under another name Monsieur Darzac asked the President did Mademoiselle Stangerson in any way confide in you on this matter How is it that she has never spoken about it to anyone If you are innocent she would have wished to spare you the pain of being accused Mademoiselle Stangerson told me nothing replied Monsieur Darzac Does what this young man says appear probable to you the President asked Mademoiselle Stangerson has told me nothing he replied stolidly How do you explain that on the night of the murder of the keeper the President asked turning to Rouletabille the murderer brought back the papers stolen from Monsieur Stangerson How do you explain how the murderer gained entrance into Mademoiselle Stangerson s locked room The last question is easily answered A man like Larsan or Ballmeyer could have had made duplicate keys As to the documents I think Larsan had not intended to steal them at first Closely watching Mademoiselle with the purpose of preventing her marriage with Monsieur Robert Darzac he one day followed her and Monsieur into the Grands Magasins de la Louvre There he got possession of the reticule which she lost or left behind In that reticule was a key with a brass head He did not know there was any value attached to the key till the advertisement in the newspapers revealed it He then wrote to Mademoiselle as the advertisement requested No doubt he asked for a meeting making known to her that he was also the person who had for some time pursued her with his love He received no answer He went to the Post Office and ascertained that his letter was no longer there He had already taken complete stock of Monsieur Darzac and having decided to go to any lengths to gain Mademoiselle Stangerson he had planned that whatever might happen Monsieur Darzac his hated rival should be the man to be suspected I do not think that Larsan had as yet thought of murdering Mademoiselle Stangerson but whatever he might do he made sure that Monsieur Darzac should suffer for it He was very nearly of the same height as Monsieur Darzac and had almost the same sized feet It would not be difficult to take an impression of Monsieur Darzac s footprints and have similar boots made for himself Such tricks were mere child s play for Larsan or Ballmeyer Receiving no reply to his letter he determined since Mademoiselle Stangerson would not come to him that he would go to her His plan had long been formed He had made himself master of the plans of the chateau and the pavilion So that one afternoon while Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson were out for a walk and while Daddy Jacques was away he entered the latter by the vestibule window He was alone and being in no hurry he began examining the furniture One of the pieces resembling a safe had a very small keyhole That interested him He had with him the little key with the brass head and associating one with the other he tried the key in the lock The door opened He saw nothing but papers They must be very valuable to have been put away in a safe and the key to which to be of so much importance Perhaps a thought of blackmail occurred to him as a useful possibility in helping him in his designs on Mademoiselle Stangerson He quickly made a parcel of the papers and took it to the lavatory in the vestibule Between the time of his first examination of the pavilion and the night of the murder of the keeper Larsan had had time to find out what those papers contained He could do nothing with them and they were rather compromising That night he took them back to the chateau Perhaps he hoped that by returning the papers he might obtain some gratitude from Mademoiselle Stangerson But whatever may have been his reasons he took the papers back and so rid himself of an encumbrance Rouletabille coughed It was evident to me that he was embarrassed He had arrived at a point where he had to keep back his knowledge of Larsan s true motive The explanation he had given had evidently been unsatisfactory Rouletabille was quick enough to note the bad impression he had made for turning to the President he said And now we come to the explanation of the Mystery of The Yellow Room A movement of chairs in the court with a rustling of dresses and an energetic whispering of Hush showed the curiosity that had been aroused It seems to me said the President that the Mystery of The Yellow Room Monsieur Rouletabille is wholly explained by your hypothesis Frederic Larsan is the explanation We have merely to substitute him for Monsieur Robert Darzac Evidently the door of The Yellow Room was open at the time Monsieur Stangerson was alone and that he allowed the man who was coming out of his daughter s chamber to pass without arresting him perhaps at her entreaty to avoid all scandal No Monsieur President protested the young man You forget that stunned by the attack made on her Mademoiselle Stangerson was not in a condition to have made such an appeal Nor could she have locked and bolted herself in her room You must also remember that Monsieur Stangerson has sworn that the door was not open That however is the only way in which it can be explained The Yellow Room was as closely shut as an iron safe To use your own expression it was impossible for the murderer to make his escape either naturally or supernaturally When the room was broken into he was not there He must therefore have escaped That does not follow What do you mean There was no need for him to escape if he was not there Not there Evidently not He could not have been there if he were not found there But what about the evidences of his presence asked the President That Monsieur President is where we have taken hold of the wrong end From the time Mademoiselle Stangerson shut herself in the room to the time her door was burst open it was impossible for the murderer to escape He was not found because he was not there during that time But the evidences They have led us astray In reasoning on this mystery we must not take them to mean what they apparently mean Why do we conclude the murderer was there Because he left his tracks in the room Good But may he not have been there before the room was locked Nay he must have been there before Let us look into the matter of these traces and see if they do not point to my conclusion After the publication of the article in the Matin and my conversation with the examining magistrate on the journey from Paris to Epinaysur Orge I was certain that The Yellow Room had been hermetically sealed so to speak and that consequently the murderer had escaped before Mademoiselle Stangerson had gone into her chamber at midnight At the time I was much puzzled Mademoiselle Stangerson could not have been her own murderer since the evidences pointed to some other person The assassin then had come before If that were so how was it that Mademoiselle had been attacked after or rather that she appeared to have been attacked after It was necessary for me to reconstruct the occurrence and make of it two phases each separated from the other in time by the space of several hours One phase in which Mademoiselle Stangerson had really been attacked the other phase in which those who heard her cries thought she was being attacked I had not then examined The Yellow Room What were the marks on Mademoiselle Stangerson There were marks of strangulation and the wound from a hard blow on the temple The marks of strangulation did not interest me much they might have been made before and Mademoiselle Stangerson could have concealed them by a collarette or any similar article of apparel I had to suppose this the moment I was compelled to reconstruct the occurrence by two phases Mademoiselle Stangerson had no doubt her own reasons for so doing since she had told her father nothing of it and had made it understood to the examining magistrate that the attack had taken place in the night during the second phase She was forced to say that otherwise her father would have questioned her as to her reason for having said nothing about it But I could not explain the blow on the temple I understood it even less when I learned that the mutton bone had been found in her room She could not hide the fact that she had been struck on the head and yet that wound appeared evidently to have been inflicted during the first phase since it required the presence of the murderer I thought Mademoiselle Stangerson had hidden the wound by arranging her hair in bands on her forehead As to the mark of the hand on the wall that had evidently been made during the first phase when the murderer was really there All the traces of his presence had naturally been left during the first phase the mutton bone the black footprints the Basque cap the handkerchief the blood on the wall on the door and on the floor If those traces were still all there they showed that Mademoiselle Stangerson who desired that nothing should be known had not yet had time to clear them away This led me to the conclusion that the two phases had taken place one shortly after the other She had not had the opportunity after leaving her room and going back to the laboratory to her father to get back again to her room and put it in order Her father was all the time with her working So that after the first phase she did not re enter her chamber till midnight Daddy Jacques was there at ten o clock as he was every night but he went in merely to close the blinds and light the night light Owing to her disturbed state of mind she had forgotten that Daddy Jacques would go into her room and had begged him not to trouble himself All this was set forth in the article in the Matin Daddy Jacques did go however and in the dim light of the room saw nothing Mademoiselle Stangerson must have lived some anxious moments while Daddy Jacques was absent but I think she was not aware that so many evidences had been left After she had been attacked she had only time to hide the traces of the man s fingers on her neck and to hurry to the laboratory Had she known of the bone the cap and the handkerchief she would have made away with them after she had gone back to her chamber at midnight She did not see them and undressed by the uncertain glimmer of the night light She went to bed worn out by anxiety and fear a fear that had made her remain in the laboratory as late as possible My reasoning had thus brought me to the second phase of the tragedy when Mademoiselle Stangerson was alone in the room I had now to explain the revolver shots fired during the second phase Cries of Help Murder had been heard How to explain these As to the cries I was in no difficulty since she was alone in her room these could result from nightmare only My explanation of the struggle and noise that were heard is simply that in her nightmare she was haunted by the terrible experience she had passed through in the afternoon In her dream she sees the murderer about to spring upon her and she cries Help Murder Her hand wildly seeks the revolver she had placed within her reach on the night table by the side of her bed but her hand striking the table overturns it and the revolver falling to the floor discharges itself the bullet lodging in the ceiling I knew from the first that the bullet in the ceiling must have resulted from an accident Its very position suggested an accident to my mind and so fell in with my theory of a nightmare I no longer doubted that the attack had taken place before Mademoiselle had retired for the night After wakening from her frightful dream and crying aloud for help she had fainted My theory based on the evidence of the shots that were heard at midnight demanded two shots one which wounded the murderer at the time of his attack and one fired at the time of the nightmare The evidence given by the Berniers before the examining magistrate was to the effect that only one shot had been heard Monsieur Stangerson testified to hearing a dull sound first followed by a sharp ringing sound The dull sound I explained by the falling of the marble topped table the ringing sound was the shot from the revolver I was now convinced I was right The shot that had wounded the hand of the murderer and had caused it to bleed so that he left the bloody imprint on the wall was fired by Mademoiselle in self defence before the second phase when she had been really attacked The shot in the ceiling which the Berniers heard was the accidental shot during the nightmare I had now to explain the wound on the temple It was not severe enough to have been made by means of the mutton bone and Mademoiselle had not attempted to hide it It must have been made during the second phase It was to find this out that I went to The Yellow Room and I obtained my answer there Rouletabille drew a piece of white folded paper from his pocket and drew out of it an almost invisible object which he held between his thumb and forefinger This Monsieur President he said is a hair a blond hair stained with blood it is a hair from the head of Mademoiselle Stangerson I found it sticking to one of the corners of the overturned table The corner of the table was itself stained with blood a tiny stain hardly visible but it told me that on rising from her bed Mademoiselle Stangerson had fallen heavily and had struck her head on the corner of its marble top I still had to learn in addition to the name of the assassin which I did later the time of the original attack I learned this from the examination of Mademoiselle Stangerson and her father though the answers given by the former were well calculated to deceive the examining magistrate Mademoiselle Stangerson had stated very minutely how she had spent the whole of her time that day We established the fact that the murderer had introduced himself into the pavilion between five and six o clock At a quarter past six the professor and his daughter had resumed their work At five the professor had been with his daughter and since the attack took place in the professor s absence from his daughter I had to find out just when he left her The professor had stated that at the time when he and his daughter were about to re enter the laboratory he was met by the keeper and held in conversation about the cutting of some wood and the poachers Mademoiselle Stangerson was not with him then since the professor said I left the keeper and rejoined my daughter who was at work in the laboratory It was during that short interval of time that the tragedy took place That is certain In my mind s eye I saw Mademoiselle Stangerson re enter the pavilion go to her room to take off her hat and find herself faced by the murderer He had been in the pavilion for some time waiting for her He had arranged to pass the whole night there He had taken off Daddy Jacques s boots he had removed the papers from the cabinet and had then slipped under the bed Finding the time long he had risen gone again into the laboratory then into the vestibule looked into the garden and had seen coming towards the pavilion Mademoiselle Stangerson alone He would never have dared to attack her at that hour if he had not found her alone His mind was made up He would be more at ease alone with Mademoiselle Stangerson in the pavilion than he would have been in the middle of the night with Daddy Jacques sleeping in the attic So he shut the vestibule window That explains why neither Monsieur Stangerson nor the keeper who were at some distance from the pavilion had heard the revolver shot Then he went back to The Yellow Room Mademoiselle Stangerson came in What passed must have taken place very quickly Mademoiselle tried to call for help but the man had seized her by the throat Her hand had sought and grasped the revolver which she had been keeping in the drawer of her night table since she had come to fear the threats of her pursuer The murderer was about to strike her on the head with the mutton bone a terrible weapon in the hands of a Larsan or Ballmeyer but she fired in time and the shot wounded the hand that held the weapon The bone fell to the floor covered with the blood of the murderer who staggered clutched at the wall for support imprinting on it the red marks and fearing another bullet fled She saw him pass through the laboratory and listened He was long at the window At length he jumped from it She flew to it and shut it The danger past all her thoughts were of her father Had he either seen or heard At any cost to herself she must keep this from him Thus when Monsieur Stangerson returned he found the door of The Yellow Room closed and his daughter in the laboratory bending over her desk at work Turning towards Monsieur Darzac Rouletabille cried You know the truth Tell us then if that is not how things happened I don t know anything about it replied Monsieur Darzac I admire you for your silence said Rouletabille but if Mademoiselle Stangerson knew of your danger she would release you from your oath She would beg of you to tell all she has confided to you She would be here to defend you Monsieur Darzac made no movement nor uttered a word He looked at Rouletabille sadly However said the young reporter since Mademoiselle is not here I must do it myself But believe me Monsieur Darzac the only means to save Mademoiselle Stangerson and restore her to her reason is to secure your acquittal What is this secret motive that compels Mademoiselle Stangerson to hide her knowledge from her father asked the President That Monsieur I do not know said Rouletabille It is no business of mine The President turning to Monsieur Darzac endeavoured to induce him to tell what he knew Do you still refuse Monsieur to tell us how you employed your time during the attempts on the life of Mademoiselle Stangerson I cannot tell you anything Monsieur The President turned to Rouletabille as if appealing for an explanation We must assume Monsieur President that Monsieur Robert Darzac s absences are closely connected with Mademoiselle Stangerson s secret and that Monsieur Darzac feels himself in honour bound to remain silent It may be that Larsan who since his three attempts has had everything in training to cast suspicion on Monsieur Darzac had fixed on just those occasions for a meeting with Monsieur Darzac at a spot most compromising Larsan is cunning enough to have done that The President seemed partly convinced but still curious he asked But what is this secret of Mademoiselle Stangerson That I cannot tell you said Rouletabille I think however you know enough now to acquit Monsieur Robert Darzac Unless Larsan should return and I don t think he will he added with a laugh One question more said the President Admitting your explanation we know that Larsan wished to turn suspicion on Monsieur Robert Darzac but why should he throw suspicion on Daddy Jacques also There came in the professional detective Monsieur who proves himself an unraveller of mysteries by annihilating the very proofs he had accumulated He s a very cunning man and a similar trick had often enabled him to turn suspicion from himself He proved the innocence of one before accusing the other You can easily believe Monsieur that so complicated a scheme as this must have been long and carefully thought out in advance by Larsan I can tell you that he had long been engaged on its elaboration If you care to learn how he had gathered information you will find that he had on one occasion disguised himself as the commissionaire between the Laboratory of the Surete and Monsieur Stangerson of whom experiments were demanded In this way he had been able before the crime on two occasions to take stock of the pavilion He had made up so that Daddy Jacques had not recognised him And yet Larsan had found the opportunity to rob the old man of a pair of old boots and a cast off Basque cap which the servant had tied up in a handkerchief with the intention of carrying them to a friend a charcoal burner on the road to Epinay When the crime was discovered Daddy Jacques had immediately recognised these objects as his They were extremely compromising which explains his distress at the time when we spoke to him about them Larsan confessed it all to me He is an artist at the game He did a similar thing in the affair of the Credit Universel and in that of the Gold Ingots of the Mint Both these cases should be revised Since Ballmeyer or Larsan has been in the Surete a number of innocent persons have been sent to prison CHAPTER XXVIII In Which It Is Proved That One Does Not Always Think of Everything Great excitement prevailed when Rouletabille had finished The court room became agitated with the murmurings of suppressed applause Maitre Henri Robert called for an adjournment of the trial and was supported in his motion by the public prosecutor himself The case was adjourned The next day Monsieur Robert Darzac was released on bail while Daddy Jacques received the immediate benefit of a no cause for action Search was everywhere made for Frederic Larsan but in vain Monsieur Darzac finally escaped the awful calamity which at one time had threatened him After a visit to Mademoiselle Stangerson he was led to hope that she might by careful nursing one day recover her reason Rouletabille naturally became the man of the hour On leaving the Palais de Justice the crowd bore him aloft in triumph The press of the whole world published his exploits and his photograph He who had interviewed so many illustrious personages had himself become illustrious and was interviewed in his turn I am glad to say that the enormous success in no way turned his head We left Versailles together after having dined at The Dog That Smokes In the train I put a number of questions to him which during our meal had been on the tip of my tongue but which I had refrained from uttering knowing he did not like to talk shop while eating My friend I said that Larsan case is wonderful It is worthy of you He begged me to say no more and humorously pretended an anxiety for me should I give way to silly praise of him because of a personal admiration for his ability I ll come to the point then I said not a little nettled I am still in the dark as to your reason for going to America When you left the Glandier you had found out if I rightly understand all about Frederic Larsan you had discovered the exact way he had attempted the murder Quite so And you he said turning the conversation did you suspect nothing Nothing It s incredible I don t see how I could have suspected anything You took great pains to conceal your thoughts from me Had you already suspected Larsan when you sent for me to bring the revolvers Yes I had come to that conclusion through the incident of the inexplicable gallery Larsan s return to Mademoiselle Stangerson s room however had not then been cleared up by the eye glasses My suspicions were the outcome of my reasoning only and the idea of Larsan being the murderer seemed so extraordinary that I resolved to wait for actual evidence before venturing to act Nevertheless the suspicion worried me and I sometimes spoke to the detective in a way that ought to have opened your eyes I spoke disparagingly of his methods But until I found the eye glasses I could but look upon my suspicion of him in the light of an absurd hypothesis only You can imagine my elation after I had explained Larsan s movements I remember well rushing into my room like a mad man and crying to you I ll get the better of the great Fred I ll get the better of him in a way that will make a sensation I was then thinking of Larsan the murderer It was that same evening that Darzac begged me to watch over Mademoiselle Stangerson I made no efforts until after we had dined with Larsan until ten o clock He was right there before me and I could afford to wait You ought to have suspected because when we were talking of the murderer s arrival I said to you I am quite sure Larsan will be here to night But one important point escaped us both It was one which ought to have opened our eyes to Larsan Do you remember the bamboo cane I was surprised to find Larsan had made no use of that evidence against Robert Darzac Had it not been purchased by a man whose description tallied exactly with that of Darzac Well just before I saw him off at the train after the recess during the trial I asked him why he hadn t used the cane evidence He told me he had never had any intention of doing so that our discovery of it in the little inn at Epinay had much embarrassed him If you will remember he told us then that the cane had been given him in London Why did we not immediately say to ourselves Fred is lying He could not have had this cane in London He was not in London He bought it in Paris Then you found out on inquiry at Cassette s that the cane had been bought by a person dressed very like Robert Darzac though as we learned later from Darzac himself it was not he who had made the purchase Couple this with the fact we already knew from the letter at the poste restante that there was actually a man in Paris who was passing as Robert Darzac why did we not immediately fix on Fred himself Of course his position at the Surete was against us but when we saw the evident eagerness on his part to find convicting evidence against Darzac nay even the passion he displayed in his pursuit of the man the lie about the cane should have had a new meaning for us If you ask why Larsan bought the cane if he had no intention of manufacturing evidence against Darzac by means of it the answer is quite simple He had been wounded in the hand by Mademoiselle Stangerson so that the cane was useful to enable him to close his hand in carrying it You remember I noticed that he always carried it All these details came back to my mind when I had once fixed on Larsan as the criminal But they were too late then to be of any use to me On the evening when he pretended to be drugged I looked at his hand and saw a thin silk bandage covering the signs of a slight healing wound Had we taken a quicker initiative at the time Larsan told us that lie about the cane I am certain he would have gone off to avoid suspicion All the same we worried Larsan or Ballmeyer without our knowing it But I interrupted if Larsan had no intention of using the cane as evidence against Darzac why had he made himself up to look like the man when he went in to buy it He had not specially made up as Darzac to buy the cane he had come straight to Cassette s immediately after he had attacked Mademoiselle Stangerson His wound was troubling him and as he was passing along the Avenue de l Opera the idea of the cane came to his mind and he acted on it It was then eight o clock And I who had hit upon the very hour of the occurrence of the tragedy almost convinced that Darzac was not the criminal and knowing of the cane I still never suspected Larsan There are times There are times I said when the greatest intellects Rouletabille shut my mouth I still continued to chide him but finding he did not reply I saw he was no longer paying any attention to what I was saying I found he was fast asleep CHAPTER XXIX The Mystery of Mademoiselle Stangerson During the days that followed I had several opportunities to question him as to his reason for his voyage to America but I obtained no more precise answers than he had given me on the evening of the adjournment of the trial when we were on the train for Paris One day however on my still pressing him he said Can t you understand that I had to know Larsan s true personality No doubt I said but why did you go to America to find that out He sat smoking his pipe and made no further reply I began to see that I was touching on the secret that concerned Mademoiselle Stangerson Rouletabille evidently had found it necessary to go to America to find out what the mysterious tie was that bound her to Larsan by so strange and terrible a bond In America he had learned who Larsan was and had obtained information which closed his mouth He had been to Philadelphia And now what was this mystery which held Mademoiselle Stangerson and Monsieur Robert Darzac in so inexplicable a silence After so many years and the publicity given the case by a curious and shameless press now that Monsieur Stangerson knows all and has forgiven all all may be told In every phase of this remarkable story Mademoiselle Stangerson had always been the sufferer The beginning dates from the time when as a young girl she was living with her father in Philadelphia A visitor at the house a Frenchman had succeeded by his wit grace and persistent attention in gaining her affections He was said to be rich and had asked her of her father Monsieur Stangerson on making inquiries as to Monsieur Jean Roussel found that the man was a swindler and an adventurer Jean Roussel was but another of the many names under which the notorious Ballmeyer a fugitive from France tried to hide himself Monsieur Stangerson did not know of his identity with Ballmeyer he learned that the man was simply undesirable for his daughter He not only refused to give his consent to the marriage but denied him admission into the house Mathilde Stangerson however had fallen in love To her Jean Roussel was everything that her love painted him She was indignant at her father s attitude and did not conceal her feelings Her father sent her to stay with an aunt in Cincinnati There she was joined by Jean Roussel and in spite of the reverence she felt for her father ran away with him to get married They went to Louisville and lived there for some time One morning however a knock came at the door of the house in which they were and the police entered to arrest Jean Roussel It was then that Mathilde Stangerson or Roussel learned that her husband was no other than the notorious Ballmeyer The young woman in her despair tried to commit suicide She failed in this and was forced to rejoin her aunt in Cincinnati The old lady was overjoyed to see her again She had been anxiously searching for her and had not dared to tell Monsieur Stangerson of her disappearance Mathilde swore her to secrecy so that her father should not know she had been away A month later Mademoiselle Stangerson returned to her father repentant her heart dead within her hoping only one thing that she would never again see her husband the horrible Ballmeyer A report was spread a few weeks later that he was dead and she now determined to atone for her disobedience by a life of labour and devotion for her father And she kept her word All this she had confessed to Robert Darzac and believing Ballmeyer dead had given herself to the joy of a union with him But fate had resuscitated Jean Roussel the Ballmeyer of her youth He had taken steps to let her know that he would never allow her to marry Darzac that he still loved her Mademoiselle Stangerson never for one moment hesitated to confide in Monsieur Darzac She showed him the letter in which Jean Roussel asked her to recall the first hours of their union in their beautiful and charming Louisville home The presbytery has lost nothing of its charm nor the garden its brightness he had written The scoundrel pretended to be rich and claimed the right of taking her back to Louisville She had told Darzac that if her father should know of her dishonour she would kill herself Monsieur Darzac had sworn to silence her persecutor even if he had to kill him He was outwitted and would have succumbed had it not been for the genius of Rouletabille Mademoiselle Stangerson was herself helpless in the hands of such a villain She had tried to kill him when he had first threatened and then attacked her in The Yellow Room She had unfortunately failed and felt herself condemned to be for ever at the mercy of this unscrupulous wretch who was continually demanding her presence at clandestine interviews When he sent her the letter through the Post Office asking her to meet him she had refused The result of her refusal was the tragedy of The Yellow Room The second time he wrote asking for a meeting the letter reaching her in her sick chamber she had avoided him by sleeping with her servants In that letter the scoundrel had warned her that since she was too ill to come to him he would come to her and that he would be in her chamber at a particular hour on a particular night Knowing that she had everything to fear from Ballmeyer she had left her chamber on that night It was then that the incident of the inexplicable gallery occurred The third time she had determined to keep the appointment He asked for it in the letter he had written in her own room on the night of the incident in the gallery which he left on her desk In that letter he threatened to burn her father s papers if she did not meet him It was to rescue these papers that she made up her mind to see him She did not for one moment doubt that the wretch would carry out his threat if she persisted in avoiding him and in that case the labours of her father s lifetime would be for ever lost Since the meeting was thus inevitable she resolved to see her husband and appeal to his better nature It was for this interview that she had prepared herself on the night the keeper was killed They did meet and what passed between them may be imagined He insisted that she renounce Darzac She on her part affirmed her love for him He stabbed her in his anger determined to convict Darzac of the crime As Larsan he could do it and had so managed things that Darzac could never explain how he had employed the time of his absence from the chateau Ballmeyer s precautions were most cunningly taken Larsan had threatened Darzac as he had threatened Mathilde with the same weapon and the same threats He wrote Darzac urgent letters declaring himself ready to deliver up the letters that had passed between him and his wife and to leave them for ever if he would pay him his price He asked Darzac to meet him for the purpose of arranging the matter appointing the time when Larsan would be with Mademoiselle Stangerson When Darzac went to Epinay expecting to find Ballmeyer or Larsan there he was met by an accomplice of Larsan s and kept waiting until such time as the coincidence could be established It was all done with Machiavellian cunning but Ballmeyer had reckoned without Joseph Rouletabille Now that the Mystery of The Yellow Room has been cleared up this is not the time to tell of Rouletabille s adventures in America Knowing the young reporter as we do we can understand with what acumen he had traced step by step the story of Mathilde Stangerson and Jean Roussel At Philadelphia he had quickly informed himself as to Arthur William Rance There he learned of Rance s act of devotion and the reward he thought himself entitled to for it A rumour of his marriage with Mademoiselle Stangerson had once found its way into the drawing rooms of Philadelphia He also learned of Rance s continued attentions to her and his importunities for her hand He had taken to drink he had said to drown his grief at his unrequited love It can now be understood why Rouletabille had shown so marked a coolness of demeanour towards Rance when they met in the witnesses room on the day of the trial The strange Roussel Stangerson mystery had now been laid bare Who was this Jean Roussel Rouletabille had traced him from Philadelphia to Cincinnati In Cincinnati he became acquainted with the old aunt and had found means to open her mouth The story of Ballmeyer s arrest threw the right light on the whole story He visited the presbytery a small and pretty dwelling in the old colonial style which had indeed lost nothing of its charm Then abandoning his pursuit of traces of Mademoiselle Stangerson he took up those of Ballmeyer He followed them from prison to prison from crime to crime Finally as he was about leaving for Europe he learned in New York that Ballmeyer had five years before embarked for France with some valuable papers belonging to a merchant of New Orleans whom he had murdered And yet the whole of this mystery has not been revealed Mademoiselle Stangerson had a child by her husband a son The infant was born in the old aunt s house No one knew of it so well had the aunt managed to conceal the event What became of that son That is another story which so far I am not permitted to relate About two months after these events I came upon Rouletabille sitting on a bench in the Palais de Justice looking very depressed What s the matter old man I asked You are looking very down cast How are your friends getting on Apart from you he said I have no friends I hope that Monsieur Darzac No doubt And Mademoiselle Stangerson How is she Better much better Then you ought not to be sad I am sad he said because I am thinking of the perfume of the lady in black The perfume of the lady in black I have heard you often refer to it Tell me why it troubles you Perhaps some day some day said Rouletabille And he heaved a profound sigh
