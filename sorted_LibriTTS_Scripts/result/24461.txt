4172-25907-0000	train-other-500	I have travelled up north as far as Lahore down south up to Tranquebar and from Karachi to Calcutta Having resorted to third class travelling
4172-25907-0001	train-other-500	among other reasons for the purpose of studying the conditions under which this class of passengers travel I have naturally made as critical observations as I could
4172-25907-0002	train-other-500	I have fairly covered the majority of railway systems during this period Now and then I have entered into correspondence with the management of the different railways about the defects that have come under my notice
4172-25907-0003	train-other-500	But I think that the time has come when I should invite the press and the public to join in a crusade against a grievance which has too long remained unredressed
4172-25907-0004	train-other-500	though much of it is capable of redress without great difficulty On the twelfth instant I booked at Bombay for Madras by the mail train
none	none	 and paid Rs thirteen nine 
4172-25907-0005	train-other-500	It was labelled to carry twenty two passengers These could only have seating accommodation There were no bunks in this carriage whereon passengers could lie with any degree of safety or comfort
4172-25907-0006	train-other-500	There were two nights to be passed in this train before reaching Madras If not more than twenty two passengers found their way into my carriage before we reached Poona it was because the bolder ones kept the others at bay
4172-25907-0007	train-other-500	With the exception of two or three insistent passengers all had to find their sleep being seated all the time
none	none	 After reaching Raichur 
4172-25907-0008	train-other-500	the pressure became unbearable The rush of passengers could not be stayed The fighters among us found the task almost beyond them The guards or other railway servants came in only to push in more passengers
4172-25907-0009	train-other-500	A defiant Memon merchant protested against this packing of passengers like sardines In vain did he say that this was his fifth night on the train The guard insulted him and referred him to the management at the terminus
4172-25907-0010	train-other-500	There were during this night as many as thirty five passengers in the carriage during the greater part of it Some lay on the floor in the midst of dirt and some had to keep standing
4172-25907-0011	train-other-500	A free fight was at one time avoided only by the intervention of some of the older passengers who did not want to add to the discomfort by an exhibition of temper On the way passengers got for tea
4172-25907-0012	train-other-500	tannin water with filthy sugar and a whitish looking liquid mis called milk which gave this water a muddy appearance I can vouch for the appearance but I cite the testimony of the passengers
4172-25907-0013	train-other-500	as to the taste Not during the whole of the journey was the compartment once swept or cleaned The result was that every time you walked on the floor or rather cut your way through the passengers seated on the floor
4172-25907-0014	train-other-500	you waded through dirt The closet was also not cleaned during the journey and there was no water in the water tank Refreshments sold to the passengers were dirty looking
4172-25907-0015	train-other-500	handed by dirtier hands coming out of filthy receptacles and weighed in equally unattractive scales These were previously sampled by millions of flies
4172-25907-0016	train-other-500	I asked some of the passengers who went in for these dainties to give their opinion Many of them used choice expressions as to the quality but were satisfied to state that they were helpless in the matter
4172-25907-0017	train-other-500	they had to take things as they came On reaching the station I found that the ghari wala would not take me unless I paid the fare he wanted I mildly protested and told him
4172-25907-0018	train-other-500	I would pay him the authorised fare I had to turn passive resister before I could be taken I simply told him he would have to pull me out of the ghari or call the policeman
4172-25907-0019	train-other-500	The return journey was performed in no better manner The carriage was packed already and but for a friend s intervention I could not have been able to secure even a seat My admission was certainly beyond the authorised number
4172-25907-0020	train-other-500	This compartment was constructed to carry nine passengers but it had constantly twelve in it At one place an important railway servant swore at a protestant
4172-25907-0021	train-other-500	threatened to strike him and locked the door over the passengers whom he had with difficulty squeezed in To this compartment there was a closet falsely so called
4172-25907-0022	train-other-500	It was designed as a European closet but could hardly be used as such There was a pipe in it but no water and I say without fear of challenge that it was pestilentially dirty The compartment itself was evil looking
4172-25907-0023	train-other-500	Dirt was lying thick upon the wood work and I do not know that it had ever seen soap or water The compartment had an exceptional assortment of passengers
4172-25907-0024	train-other-500	There were three stalwart Punjabi Mahomedans two refined Tamilians and two Mahomedan merchants who joined us later The merchants related the bribes they had to give to procure comfort
4172-25907-0025	train-other-500	One of the Punjabis had already travelled three nights and was weary and fatigued But he could not stretch himself He said he had sat the whole day at the Central Station watching passengers
none	none	 giving bribe to procure their tickets Another said he had himself to pay Rs five before he could get his ticket and his seat 
4172-25907-0026	train-other-500	These three men were bound for Ludhiana and had still more nights of travel in store for them What I have described is not exceptional but normal
none	none	 I have got down at Raichur Dhond Sonepur Chakradharpur 
4172-25907-0027	train-other-500	Purulia Asansol and other junction stations and been at the Mosafirkhanas attached to these stations They are discreditable looking places where there is no order no cleanliness
4172-25907-0028	train-other-500	but utter confusion and horrible din and noise Passengers have no benches or not enough to sit on They squat on dirty floors and eat dirty food
4172-25907-0029	train-other-500	They are permitted to throw the leavings of their food and spit where they like sit how they like and smoke everywhere The closets attached to these places defy description
4172-25907-0030	train-other-500	I have not the power adequately to describe them without committing a breach of the laws of decent speech Disinfecting powder ashes or disinfecting fluids are unknown
4172-25907-0031	train-other-500	The army of flies buzzing about them warns you against their use But a third class traveller is dumb and helpless He does not want to complain even though to go to these places may be to court death
4172-25907-0032	train-other-500	I know passengers who fast while they are travelling just in order to lessen the misery of their life in the trains
none	none	 At Sonepur flies having failed wasps have come forth to warn the public and the authorities 
4172-25907-0033	train-other-500	but yet to no purpose At the Imperial Capital a certain third class booking office is a Black Hole fit only to be destroyed
4172-25907-0034	train-other-500	Is it any wonder that plague has become endemic in India Any other result is impossible where passengers always leave some dirt where they go and take more on leaving
4172-25907-0035	train-other-500	On Indian trains alone passengers smoke with impunity in all carriages irrespective of the presence of the fair sex and irrespective of the protest of non smokers And this
4172-25907-0036	train-other-500	notwithstanding a bye law which prevents a passenger from smoking without the permission of his fellows in the compartment which is not allotted to smokers
4172-25907-0037	train-other-500	The existence of the awful war cannot be allowed to stand in the way of the removal of this gigantic evil War can be no warrant for tolerating dirt and overcrowding
4172-25907-0038	train-other-500	One could understand an entire stoppage of passenger traffic in a crisis like this but never a continuation or accentuation of insanitation and conditions that must undermine health and morality
4172-25907-0039	train-other-500	Compare the lot of the first class passengers with that of the third class In the Madras case the first class fare is over five times as much as the third class fare
4172-25907-0040	train-other-500	Does the third class passenger get one fifth even one tenth of the comforts of his first class fellow It is but simple justice to claim that some relative proportion be observed between the cost
4172-25907-0041	train-other-500	and comfort It is a known fact that the third class traffic pays for the ever increasing luxuries of first and second class travelling Surely a third class passenger is entitled at least
4172-25907-0042	train-other-500	to the bare necessities of life In neglecting the third class passengers opportunity of giving a splendid education to millions in orderliness sanitation decent composite life
4172-25907-0043	train-other-500	and cultivation of simple and clean tastes is being lost Instead of receiving an object lesson in these matters third class passengers
4172-25907-0044	train-other-500	have their sense of decency and cleanliness blunted during their travelling experience Among the many suggestions that can be made for dealing with the evil here described I would respectfully include this
4172-25907-0045	train-other-500	let the people in high places the Viceroy the Commander in Chief the Rajas Maharajas the Imperial Councillors and others who generally travel in superior classes
4172-25907-0046	train-other-500	without previous warning go through the experiences now and then of third class travelling
none	none	 We would then soon see a remarkable change in the conditions of third class travelling 
4172-25907-0047	train-other-500	and the uncomplaining millions will get some return for the fares they pay under the expectation of being carried from place to place
none	none	 with ordinary creature comforts FOOTNOTE one Ranchi September twenty five nineteen seventeen VERNACULARS AS MEDIA OF INSTRUCTION two It is to be hoped that doctor Mehta s labour of love will receive the serious attention of English educated India The following pages were written by him for the Vedanta Kesari of Madras and are now printed in their present form for circulation throughout India The question of vernaculars as media of instruction is of national importance neglect of the vernaculars means national suicide One hears many protagonists of the English language being continued as the medium of instruction pointing to the fact that English educated Indians are the sole custodians of public and patriotic work It would be monstrous if it were not so For the only education given in this country is through the English language The fact however is that the results are not all proportionate to the time we give to our education We have not reacted on the masses But I must not anticipate doctor Mehta He is in earnest He writes feelingly He has examined the pros and cons and collected a mass of evidence in support of his arguments The latest pronouncement on the subject is that of the Viceroy Whilst His Excellency is unable to offer a solution he is keenly alive to the necessity of imparting instruction in our schools through the vernaculars The Jews of Middle and Eastern Europe who are scattered in all parts of the world finding it necessary to have a common tongue for mutual intercourse have raised Yiddish to the status of a language and have succeeded in translating into Yiddish the best books to be found in the world s literature Even they could not satisfy the soul s yearning through the many foreign tongues of which they are masters nor did the learned few among them wish to tax the masses of the Jewish population with having to learn a foreign language before they could realise their dignity So they have enriched what was at one time looked upon as a mere jargon but what the Jewish children learnt from their mothers by taking special pains to translate into it the best thought of the world This is a truly marvellous work It has been done during the present generation and Webster s Dictionary defines it as a polyglot jargon used for inter communication by Jews from different nations But a Jew of Middle and Eastern Europe would feel insulted if his mother tongue were now so described If these Jewish scholars have succeeded within a generation in giving their masses a language of which they may feel proud surely it should be an easy task for us to supply the needs of our own vernaculars which are cultured languages South Africa teaches us the same lesson There was a duel there between the Taal a corrupt form of Dutch and English The Boer mothers and the Boer fathers were determined that they would not let their children with whom they in their infancy talked in the Taal be weighed down with having to receive instruction through English The case for English here was a strong one It had able pleaders for it But English had to yield before Boer patriotism It may be observed that they rejected even the High Dutch The school masters therefore who are accustomed to speak the published Dutch of Europe are compelled to teach the easier Taal And literature of an excellent character is at the present moment growing up in South Africa in the Taal which was only a few years ago the common medium of speech between simple but brave rustics If we have lost faith in our vernaculars it is a sign of want of faith in ourselves it is the surest sign of decay And no scheme of self government however benevolently or generously it may be bestowed upon us will ever make us a self governing nation if we have no respect for the languages our mothers speak FOOTNOTE two Introduction to doctor Mehta s Self Government Series SWADESHI three It was not without great diffidence that I undertook to speak to you at all And I was hard put to it in the selection of my subject I have chosen a very delicate and difficult subject It is delicate because of the peculiar views I hold upon Swadeshi and it is difficult because I have not that command of language which is necessary for giving adequate expression to my thoughts I know that I may rely upon your indulgence for the many shortcomings you will no doubt find in my address the more so when I tell you that there is nothing in what I am about to say that I am not either already practising or am not preparing to practise to the best of my ability It encourages me to observe that last month you devoted a week to prayer in the place of an address I have earnestly prayed that what I am about to say may bear fruit and I know that you will bless my word with a similar prayer After much thinking I have arrived at a definition of Swadeshi that perhaps best illustrates my meaning Swadeshi is that spirit in us which restricts us to the use and service of our immediate surroundings to the exclusion of the more remote Thus as for religion in order to satisfy the requirements of the definition I must restrict myself to my ancestral religion That is the use of my immediate religious surrounding If I find it defective I should serve it by purging it of its defects In the domain of politics I should make use of the indigenous institutions and serve them by curing them of their proved defects In that of economics I should use only things that are produced by my immediate neighbours and serve those industries by making them efficient and complete where they might be found wanting It is suggested that such Swadeshi if reduced to practice will lead to the millennium And as we do not abandon our pursuit after the millennium because we do not expect quite to reach it within our times so may we not abandon Swadeshi even though it may not be fully attained for generations to come Let us briefly examine the three branches of Swadeshi as sketched above Hinduism has become a conservative religion and therefore a mighty force because of the Swadeshi spirit underlying it It is the most tolerant because it is non proselytising and it is as capable of expansion today as it has been found to be in the past It has succeeded not in driving out as I think it has been erroneously held but in absorbing Buddhism By reason of the Swadeshi spirit a Hindu refuses to change his religion not necessarily because he considers it to be the best but because he knows that he can complement it by introducing reforms And what I have said about Hinduism is I suppose true of the other great faiths of the world only it is held that it is specially so in the case of Hinduism But here comes the point I am labouring to reach If there is any substance in what I have said will not the great missionary bodies of India to whom she owes a deep debt of gratitude for what they have done and are doing do still better and serve the spirit of Christianity better by dropping the goal of proselytising while continuing their philanthropic work I hope you will not consider this to be an impertinence on my part I make the suggestion in all sincerity and with due humility Moreover I have some claim upon your attention I have endeavoured to study the Bible I consider it as part of my scriptures The spirit of the Sermon on the Mount competes almost on equal terms with the Bhagavad Gita for the domination of my heart I yield to no Christian in the strength of devotion with which I sing Lead kindly light and several other inspired hymns of a similar nature I have come under the influence of noted Christian missionaries belonging to different denominations And enjoy to this day the privilege of friendship with some of them You will perhaps therefore allow that I have offered the above suggestion not as a biased Hindu but as a humble and impartial student of religion with great leanings towards Christianity May it not be that Go ye unto all the world message has been somewhat narrowly interpreted and the spirit of it missed It will not be denied I speak from experience that many of the conversions are only so called In some cases the appeal has gone not to the heart but to the stomach And in every case a conversion leaves a sore behind it which I venture to think is avoidable Quoting again from experience a new birth a change of heart is perfectly possible in every one of the great faiths I know I am now treading upon thin ice But I do not apologise in closing this part of my subject for saying that the frightful outrage that is just going on in Europe perhaps shows that the message of Jesus of Nazareth the Son of Peace had been little understood in Europe and that light upon it may have to be thrown from the East I have sought your help in religious matters which it is yours to give in a special sense But I make bold to seek it even in political matters I do not believe that religion has nothing to do with politics The latter divorced from religion is like a corpse only fit to be buried As a matter of fact in your own silent manner you influence politics not a little And I feel that if the attempt to separate politics from religion had not been made as it is even now made they would not have degenerated as they often appear to have done No one considers that the political life of the country is in a happy state Following out the Swadeshi spirit I observe the indigenous institutions and the village panchayats hold me India is really a republican country and it is because it is that that it has survived every shock hitherto delivered Princes and potentates whether they were Indian born or foreigners have hardly touched the vast masses except for collecting revenue The latter in their turn seem to have rendered unto Caesar what was Caesar s and for the rest have done much as they have liked The vast organisation of caste answered not only the religious wants of the community but it answered to its political needs The villagers managed their internal affairs through the caste system and through it they dealt with any oppression from the ruling power or powers It is not possible to deny of a nation that was capable of producing the caste system its wonderful power of organisation One had but to attend the great Kumbha Mela at Hardwar last year to know how skilful that organisation must have been which without any seeming effort was able effectively to cater for more than a million pilgrims Yet it is the fashion to say that we lack organising ability This is true I fear to a certain extent of those who have been nurtured in the new traditions We have laboured under a terrible handicap owing to an almost fatal departure from the Swadeshi spirit We the educated classes have received our education through a foreign tongue We have therefore not reacted upon the masses We want to represent the masses but we fail They recognise us not much more than they recognise the English officers Their hearts are an open book to neither Their aspirations are not ours Hence there is a break And you witness not in reality failure to organise but want of correspondence between the representatives and the represented If during the last fifty years we had been educated through the vernaculars our elders and our servants and our neighbours would have partaken of our knowledge the discoveries of a Bose or a Ray would have been household treasures as are the Ramayan and the Mahabharat As it is so far as the masses are concerned those great discoveries might as well have been made by foreigners Had instruction in all the branches of learning been given through the vernaculars I make bold to say that they would have been enriched wonderfully The question of village sanitation et cetera would have been solved long ago The village panchayats would be now a living force in a special way and India would almost be enjoying self government suited to its requirements and would have been spared the humiliating spectacle of organised assassination on its sacred soil It is not too late to mend And you can help if you will as no other body or bodies can And now for the last division of Swadeshi much of the deep poverty of the masses is due to the ruinous departure from Swadeshi in the economic and industrial life If not an article of commerce had been brought from outside India she would be today a land flowing with milk and honey But that was not to be We were greedy and so was England The connection between England and India was based clearly upon an error But she does not remain in India in error It is her declared policy that India is to be held in trust for her people If this be true Lancashire must stand aside And if the Swadeshi doctrine is a sound doctrine Lancashire can stand aside without hurt though it may sustain a shock for the time being I think of Swadeshi not as a boycott movement undertaken by way of revenge I conceive it as religious principle to be followed by all I am no economist but I have read some treatises which show that England could easily become a self sustained country growing all the produce she needs This may be an utterly ridiculous proposition and perhaps the best proof that it cannot be true is that England is one of the largest importers in the world But India cannot live for Lancashire or any other country before she is able to live for herself And she can live for herself only if she produces and is helped to produce everything for her requirements within her own borders She need not be she ought not to be drawn into the vertex of mad and ruinous competition which breeds fratricide jealousy and many other evils But who is to stop her great millionaires from entering into the world competition Certainly not legislation Force of public opinion proper education however can do a great deal in the desired direction The hand loom industry is in a dying condition I took special care during my wanderings last year to see as many weavers as possible and my heart ached to find how they had lost how families had retired from this once flourishing and honourable occupation If we follow the Swadeshi doctrine it would be your duty and mine to find out neighbours who can supply our wants and to teach them to supply them where they do not know how to proceed assuming that there are neighbours who are in want of healthy occupation Then every village of India will almost be a self supporting and self contained unit exchanging only such necessary commodities with other villages where they are not locally producible This may all sound nonsensical Well India is a country of nonsense It is nonsensical to parch one s throat with thirst when a kindly Mahomedan is ready to offer pure water to drink And yet thousands of Hindus would rather die of thirst than drink water from a Mahomedan household These nonsensical men can also once they are convinced that their religion demands that they should wear garments manufactured in India only and eat food only grown in India decline to wear any other clothing or eat any other food Lord Curzon set the fashion for tea drinking And that pernicious drug now bids fair to overwhelm the nation It has already undermined the digestive apparatus of hundreds of thousands of men and women and constitutes an additional tax upon their slender purses Lord Hardinge can set the fashion for Swadeshi and almost the whole of India forswear foreign goods There is a verse in the Bhagavad Gita which freely rendered means masses follow the classes It is easy to undo the evil if the thinking portion of the community were to take the Swadeshi vow even though it may for a time cause considerable inconvenience I hate legislative interference in any department of life At best it is the lesser evil But I would tolerate welcome indeed plead for a stiff protective duty upon foreign goods Natal a British colony protected its sugar by taxing the sugar that came from another British colony Mauritius England has sinned against India by forcing free trade upon her It may have been food for her but it has been poison for this country It has often been urged that India cannot adopt Swadeshi in the economic life at any rate Those who advance this objection do not look upon Swadeshi as a rule of life With them it is a mere patriotic effort not to be made if it involved any self denial Swadeshi as defined here is a religious discipline to be undergone in utter disregard of the physical discomfort it may cause to individuals Under its spell the deprivation of a pin or a needle because these are not manufactured in India need cause no terror A Swadeshist will learn to do without hundreds of things which today he considers necessary Moreover those who dismiss Swadeshi from their minds by arguing the impossible forget that Swadeshi after all is a goal to be reached by steady effort And we would be making for the goal even if we confined Swadeshi to a given set of articles allowing ourselves as a temporary measure to use such things as might not be procurable in the country There now remains for me to consider one more objection that has been raised against Swadeshi The objectors consider it to be a most selfish doctrine without any warrant in the civilised code of morality With them to practise Swadeshi is to revert to barbarism I cannot enter into a detailed analysis of the position But I would urge that Swadeshi is the only doctrine consistent with the law of humility and love It is arrogance to think of launching out to serve the whole of India when I am hardly able to serve even my own family It were better to concentrate my effort upon the family and consider that through them I was serving the whole nation and if you will the whole of humanity This is humility and it is love The motive will determine the quality of the act I may serve my family regardless of the sufferings I may cause to others As for instance I may accept an employment which enables me to extort money from people I enrich myself thereby and then satisfy many unlawful demands of the family Here I am neither serving the family nor the State Or I may recognise that God has given me hands and feet only to work with for my sustenance and for that of those who may be dependent upon me I would then at once simplify my life and that of those whom I can directly reach In this instance I would have served the family without causing injury to anyone else Supposing that everyone followed this mode of life we should have at once an ideal state All will not reach that state at the same time But those of us who realising its truth enforce it in practice will clearly anticipate and accelerate the coming of that happy day Under this plan of life in seeming to serve India to the exclusion of every other country I do not harm any other country My patriotism is both exclusive and inclusive It is exclusive in the sense that in all humility I confine my attention to the land of my birth but it is inclusive in the sense that my service is not of a competitive or antagonistic nature Sic utere tuo ut alienum non la is not merely a legal maxim but it is a grand doctrine of life It is the key to a proper practice of Ahimsa or love It is for you the custodians of a great faith to set the fashion and show by your preaching sanctified by practice that patriotism based on hatred killeth and that patriotism based on love giveth life FOOTNOTE three Address delivered before the Missionary Conference on February fourteen nineteen sixteen AHIMSA four There seems to be no historical warrant for the belief that an exaggerated practice of Ahimsa synchronises with our becoming bereft of manly virtues During the past fifteen hundred years we have as a nation given ample proof of physical courage but we have been torn by internal dissensions and have been dominated by love of self instead of love of country We have that is to say been swayed by the spirit of irreligion rather than of religion 
4773-25910-0000	train-other-500	I do not know how far the charge of unmanliness can be made good against the Jains I hold no brief for them By birth I am a Vaishnavite and was taught Ahimsa in my childhood
4773-25910-0001	train-other-500	I have derived much religious benefit from Jain religious works as I have from scriptures of the other great faiths of the world I owe much to the living company of the deceased philosopher Rajachand Kavi who was a Jain by birth
4773-25910-0002	train-other-500	Thus though my views on Ahimsa are a result of my study of most of the faiths of the world they are now no longer dependent upon the authority of these works They are a part of my life and
4773-25910-0003	train-other-500	if I suddenly discovered that the religious books read by me bore a different interpretation from the one I had learnt to give them I should still hold to the view of Ahimsa
none	none	 as I am about to set forth here 
4773-25910-0004	train-other-500	Our Shastras seem to teach that a man who really practises Ahimsa in its fulness has the world at his feet he so affects his surroundings
4773-25910-0005	train-other-500	that even the snakes and other venomous reptiles do him no harm This is said to have been the experience of saint Francis of Assisi In its negative form
none	none	 it means not injuring any living being 
4773-25910-0006	train-other-500	whether by body or mind It may not therefore hurt the person of any wrong doer or bear any ill will to him and so cause him mental suffering This statement does not cover suffering caused to the wrong doer
4773-25910-0007	train-other-500	by natural acts of mine which do not proceed from ill will It therefore does not prevent me from withdrawing from his presence a child whom he we shall imagine is about to strike Indeed the proper practice of Ahimsa
4773-25910-0008	train-other-500	requires me to withdraw the intended victim from the wrong doer if I am in any way whatsoever the guardian of such a child It was therefore most proper for the passive resisters of South Africa
none	none	 to have resisted the evil that the Union Government sought to do to them 
4773-25910-0009	train-other-500	They bore no ill will to it They showed this by helping the Government whenever it needed their help Their resistance consisted of disobedience of the orders of the Government
4773-25910-0010	train-other-500	even to the extent of suffering death at their hands Ahimsa requires deliberate self suffering not a deliberate injuring of the supposed wrong doer In its positive form Ahimsa means
4773-25910-0011	train-other-500	the largest love the greatest charity If I am a follower of Ahimsa I must love my enemy I must apply the same rules to the wrong doer who is my enemy or a stranger to me
4773-25910-0012	train-other-500	as I would to my wrong doing father or son This active Ahimsa necessarily includes truth and fearlessness As man cannot deceive the loved one he does not fear or frighten him or her
4773-25910-0013	train-other-500	Gift of life is the greatest of all gifts a man who gives it in reality disarms all hostility He has paved the way for an honourable understanding
4773-25910-0014	train-other-500	And none who is himself subject to fear can bestow that gift He must therefore be himself fearless A man cannot then practice Ahimsa and be a coward at the same time
4773-25910-0015	train-other-500	The practice of Ahimsa calls forth the greatest courage It is the most soldierly of a soldier s virtues General Gordon has been represented in a famous statue as bearing only a stick
4773-25910-0016	train-other-500	This takes us far on the road to Ahimsa But a soldier who needs the protection of even a stick is to that extent so much the less a soldier He is the true soldier who knows how to die
4773-25910-0017	train-other-500	and stand his ground in the midst of a hail of bullets Such a one was Ambarisha who stood his ground without lifting a finger
none	none	 though Duryasa did his worst 
4773-25910-0018	train-other-500	The Moors who were being pounded by the French gunners and who rushed to the guns mouths with Allah on their lips showed much the same type of courage Only theirs was the courage of desperation Ambarisha s was due to love
4773-25910-0019	train-other-500	Yet the Moorish valour readiness to die conquered the gunners They frantically waved their hats ceased firing and greeted their erstwhile enemies as comrades And so the South African passive resisters
4773-25910-0020	train-other-500	in their thousands were ready to die rather than sell their honour for a little personal ease This was Ahimsa in its active form It never barters away honour A helpless girl
4773-25910-0021	train-other-500	in the hands of a follower of Ahimsa finds better and surer protection than in the hands of one who is prepared to defend her only to the point to which his weapons would carry him The tyrant in the first instance
4773-25910-0022	train-other-500	will have to walk to his victim over the dead body of her defender in the second he has but to overpower the defender for it is assumed that the cannon of propriety in the second instance will be satisfied
none	none	 when the defender has fought to the extent of his physical valour In the first instance as the defender has matched his very soul against the mere body of the tyrant the odds are that the soul in the latter will be awakened and the girl would stand an infinitely greater chance of her honour being protected than in any other conceivable circumstance barring of course that of her own personal courage If we are unmanly today 
4773-25910-0023	train-other-500	we are so not because we do not know how to strike but because we fear to die He is no follower of Mahavira the apostle of Jainism or of Buddha or of the Vedas
4773-25910-0024	train-other-500	who being afraid to die takes flight before any danger real or imaginary all the while wishing that somebody else would remove the danger by destroying the person causing it He is no follower of Ahimsa
4773-25910-0025	train-other-500	who does not care a straw if he kills a man by inches by deceiving him in trade or who would protect by force of arms a few cows and make away with the butcher or who
none	none	 in order to do a supposed good to his country 
4773-25910-0026	train-other-500	does not mind killing off a few officials All these are actuated by hatred cowardice and fear Here the love of the cow or the country is a vague thing intended to satisfy one s vanity
4773-25910-0027	train-other-500	or soothe a stinging conscience Ahimsa truly understood is in my humble opinion a panacea for all evils mundane and extra mundane We can never overdo it
none	none	 Just at present we are not doing it at all Ahimsa does not displace the practice of other virtues but renders their practice imperatively necessary before it can be practised even in its rudiments 
4773-25910-0028	train-other-500	Mahavira and Buddha were soldiers and so was Tolstoy Only they saw deeper and truer into their profession and found the secret of a true happy honourable and godly life
none	none	 Let us be joint sharers with these teachers and this land of ours will once more be the abode of gods FOOTNOTE four The Modern Review October nineteen sixteen 
4773-25911-0000	train-other-500	THE MORAL BASIS OF company OPERATION
none	none	 five The only claim I have on your indulgence 
4773-25911-0001	train-other-500	is that some months ago I attended with mister Ewbank a meeting of mill hands to whom he wanted to explain the principles of company operation The chawl in which they were living was as filthy as it well could be
4773-25911-0002	train-other-500	Recent rains had made matters worse And I must frankly confess that had it not been for mister Ewbank s great zeal for the cause he has made his own I should have shirked the task But there we were
4773-25911-0003	train-other-500	seated on a fairly worn out charpai surrounded by men women and children mister Ewbank opened fire on a man who had put himself forward and who wore not a particularly innocent countenance After he had engaged him
4773-25911-0004	train-other-500	and the other people about him in Gujrati conversation he wanted me to speak to the people Owing to the suspicious looks of the man who was first spoken to I naturally pressed home the moralities of company operation
4773-25911-0005	train-other-500	I fancy that mister Ewbank rather liked the manner in which I handled the subject Hence I believe his kind invitation to me to tax your patience for a few moments upon a consideration of company operation from a moral standpoint
4773-25911-0006	train-other-500	My knowledge of the technicality of company operation is next to nothing My brother Devadhar has made the subject his own Whatever he does naturally attracts me
4773-25911-0007	train-other-500	and predisposes me to think that there must be something good in it and the handling of it must be fairly difficult mister Ewbank very kindly placed at my disposal some literature too on the subject
none	none	 And I have had a unique opportunity of watching the effect of some company operative effort 
4773-25911-0008	train-other-500	in Champaran I have gone through mister Ewbank s ten main points which are like the Commandments
none	none	 and I have gone through the twelve points of mister Collins of Behar 
4773-25911-0009	train-other-500	which remind me of the law of the Twelve Tables There are so called agricultural banks in Champaran They were to me disappointing efforts if they were meant to be demonstrations of the success of company operation
4773-25911-0010	train-other-500	On the other hand there is quiet work in the same direction being done by mister Hodge a missionary whose efforts are leaving their impress on those who come in contact with him mister Hodge is a company operative enthusiast
4773-25911-0011	train-other-500	and probably considers that the result which he sees flowing from his efforts are due to the working of company operation I who was able to watch the efforts had no hesitation in inferring that the personal equation counted for success in the one
4773-25911-0012	train-other-500	and failure in the other instance I am an enthusiast myself but twenty five years of experimenting and experience
none	none	 have made me a cautious and discriminating enthusiast 
4773-25911-0013	train-other-500	Workers in a cause necessarily though quite unconsciously exaggerate its merits and often succeed in turning its very defects into advantages In spite of my caution
none	none	 I consider the little institution I am conducting in Ahmedabad as the finest thing in the world It alone gives me sufficient inspiration Critics tell me that it represents a soulless soul force and that its severe discipline has made it merely mechanical I suppose both the critics and I are wrong It is at best a humble attempt to place at the disposal of the nation 
4773-25911-0014	train-other-500	a home where men and women may have scope for free and unfettered development of character in keeping with the national genius and if its controllers do not take care the discipline that is the foundation of character may frustrate the very end in view
4773-25911-0015	train-other-500	I would venture therefore to warn enthusiasts in company operation against entertaining false hopes With Sir Daniel Hamilton it has become a religion On the thirteenth January last
4773-25911-0016	train-other-500	he addressed the students of the Scottish Churches College and in order to point a moral he instanced Scotland s poverty of two hundred years ago and showed how that great country was raised from a condition of poverty to plenty
none	none	 There were two powers which raised her the Scottish Church and the Scottish banks The Church manufactured the men and the banks manufactured the money to give the men a start in life The Church disciplined the nation in the fear of God 
4773-25911-0017	train-other-500	which is the beginning of wisdom and in the parish schools of the Church the children learned that the chief end of man s life was to glorify God and to enjoy Him for ever Men were trained to believe in God and in themselves
4773-25911-0018	train-other-500	and on the trustworthy character so created the Scottish banking system was built Sir Daniel then shows that it was possible to build up the marvellous Scottish banking system only on the character so built
4773-25911-0019	train-other-500	So far there can only be perfect agreement with Sir Daniel for that without character there is no company operation is a sound maxim But he would have us go much further He thus waxes eloquent on company operation
4773-25911-0020	train-other-500	Whatever may be your daydreams of India s future never forget this that it is to weld India into one and so enable her to take her rightful place in the world that the British Government is here
4773-25911-0021	train-other-500	and the welding hammer in the hand of the Government is the company operative movement In his opinion it is the panacea of all the evils that afflict India at the present moment In its extended sense
4773-25911-0022	train-other-500	it can justify the claim on one condition which need not be mentioned here in the limited sense in which Sir Daniel has used it I venture to think it is an enthusiast s exaggeration Mark his peroration
4773-25911-0023	train-other-500	Credit which is only Trust and Faith is becoming more and more the money power of the world and in the parchment bullet into which is impressed the faith which removes mountains India will find victory and peace
none	none	 Here there is evident confusion of thought The credit which is becoming the money power of the world has little moral basis and is not a synonym for Trust or Faith which are purely moral qualities After twenty years experience of hundreds of men who had dealings with banks in South Africa the opinion I had so often heard expressed has become firmly rooted in me that the greater the rascal the greater the credit he enjoys with his banks The banks do not pry into his moral character 
4773-25911-0024	train-other-500	they are satisfied that he meets his overdrafts and promissory notes punctually The credit system has encircled this beautiful globe of ours like a serpent s coil and if we do not mind
4773-25911-0025	train-other-500	it bids fair to crush us out of breath I have witnessed the ruin of many a home through the system and it has made no difference whether the credit was labelled company operative or otherwise
4773-25911-0026	train-other-500	The deadly coil has made possible the devastating spectacle in Europe which we are helplessly looking on It was perhaps never so true as it is today that as in law so in war
none	none	 the longest purse finally wins I have ventured to give prominence to the current belief about credit system in order to emphasise the point that the company operative movement will be a blessing to India only to the extent 
4773-25911-0027	train-other-500	that it is a moral movement strictly directed by men fired with religious fervour It follows therefore that company operation should be confined to men wishing to be morally right but failing to do so
none	none	 because of grinding poverty or of the grip of the Mahajan 
4773-25911-0028	train-other-500	Facility for obtaining loans at fair rates will not make immoral men moral But the wisdom of the Estate or philanthropists demands that they should help on the onward path men struggling to be good
4773-25911-0029	train-other-500	Too often do we believe that material prosperity means moral growth It is necessary that a movement which is fraught with so much good to India should not degenerate into one for merely advancing cheap loans
4773-25911-0030	train-other-500	I was therefore delighted to read the recommendation in the Report of the Committee on company operation in India that they wish clearly to express their opinion that it is to true company operation alone that is
4773-25911-0031	train-other-500	to a company operation which recognises the moral aspect of the question that Government must look for the amelioration of the masses and not to a pseudo company operative edifice however imposing which is built in ignorance of company operative principles
4773-25911-0032	train-other-500	With this standard before us we will not measure the success of the movement by the number of company operative societies formed but by the moral condition of the company operators The registrars will in that event
4773-25911-0033	train-other-500	ensure the moral growth of existing societies before multiplying them And the Government will make their promotion conditional not upon the number of societies they have registered but the moral success of the existing institutions
4773-25911-0034	train-other-500	This will mean tracing the course of every pie lent to the members Those responsible for the proper conduct of company operative societies will see to it that the money advanced does not find its way into the toddy seller s bill
none	none	 or into the pockets of the keepers of gambling dens 
4773-25911-0035	train-other-500	I would excuse the rapacity of the Mahajan if it has succeeded in keeping the gambling die or toddy from the ryot s home A word perhaps about the Mahajan will not be out of place company operation is not a new device
4773-25911-0036	train-other-500	The ryots company operate to drum out monkeys or birds that destroy their crops They company operate to use a common thrashing floor I have found them company operate to protect their cattle to the extent of their devoting the best land for the grazing of their cattle
none	none	 And they have been found company operating against a particular rapacious Mahajan 
4773-25911-0037	train-other-500	Doubts have been expressed as to the success of company operation because of the tightness of the Mahajan s hold on the ryots I do not share the fears The mightiest Mahajan must if he represent an evil force
4773-25911-0038	train-other-500	bend before company operation conceived as an essentially moral movement
none	none	 But my limited experience of the Mahajan of Champaran has made me revise the accepted opinion about his blighting influence I have found him to be not always relentless not always exacting of the last pie He sometimes serves his clients in many ways 
4773-25911-0039	train-other-500	and even comes to their rescue in the hour of their distress My observation is so limited that I dare not draw any conclusions from it but I respectfully enquire whether it is not possible to make a serious effort
none	none	 to draw out the good in the Mahajan and help him or induce him to throw out the evil in him May he not be induced to join the army of company operation or has experience proved that he is past praying for 
4773-25911-0040	train-other-500	I note that the movement takes note of all indigenous industries I beg publicly to express my gratitude to Government for helping me in my humble effort to improve the lot of the weaver
none	none	 The experiment I am conducting shows that there is a vast field for work in this direction No well wisher of India no patriot dare look upon the impending destruction of the hand loom weaver with equanimity 
4773-25911-0041	train-other-500	As doctor Mann has stated this industry used to supply the peasant with an additional source of livelihood and an insurance against famine Every registrar who will nurse back to life this important and graceful industry
4773-25911-0042	train-other-500	will earn the gratitude of India My humble effort consists firstly in making researches as to the possibilities of simple reforms in the orthodox hand looms secondly
4773-25911-0043	train-other-500	in weaning the educated youth from the craving for Government or other services and the feeling that education renders him unfit for independent occupation and inducing him to take to weaving
none	none	 as a calling as honourable as that of a barrister or a doctor and thirdly by helping those weavers who have abandoned their occupation to revert to it I will not weary the audience with any statement 
4773-25911-0044	train-other-500	on the first two parts of the experiment The third may be allowed a few sentences as it has a direct bearing upon the subject before us I was able to enter upon it only six months ago Five families
4773-25911-0045	train-other-500	that had left off the calling have reverted to it and they are doing a prosperous business The Ashram supplies them at their door with the yarn they need its volunteers take delivery of the cloth woven paying them cash at the market rate
none	none	 The Ashram merely loses interest on the loan advanced for the yarn It has as yet suffered no loss and is able to restrict its loss to a minimum by limiting the loan to a particular figure All future transactions are strictly cash We are able to command a ready sale for the cloth received The loss of interest therefore on the transaction is negligible 
4773-25911-0046	train-other-500	I would like the audience to note its purely moral character from start to finish The Ashram depends for its existence on such help as friends render it We therefore can have no warrant for charging interest
4773-25911-0047	train-other-500	The weavers could not be saddled with it Whole families that were breaking to pieces are put together again The use of the loan is pre determined And we the middlemen being volunteers obtain the privilege of entering into the lives of these families
none	none	 I hope for their and our betterment We cannot lift them without being lifted ourselves This last relationship has not yet been developed but we hope at an early date to take in hand the education too of these families 
4773-25911-0048	train-other-500	and not rest satisfied till we have touched them at every point This is not too ambitious a dream God willing it will be a reality some day I have ventured to dilate upon the small experiment
4773-25911-0049	train-other-500	to illustrate what I mean by company operation to present it to others for imitation Let us be sure of our ideal We shall ever fail to realise it but we should never cease to strive for it
none	none	 Then there need be no fear of company operation of scoundrels that Ruskin so rightly dreaded FOOTNOTE five Paper contributed to the Bombay Provincial company operative Conference September seventeen nineteen seventeen NATIONAL DRESS six I have hitherto successfully resisted to temptation of either answering your or mister Irwin s criticism of the humble work I am doing in Champaran Nor am I going to succumb now except with regard to a matter which mister Irwin has thought fit to dwell upon and about which he has not even taken the trouble of being correctly informed I refer to his remarks on my manner of dressing My familiarity with the minor amenities of Western civilisation has taught me to respect my national costume and it may interest mister Irwin to know that the dress I wear in Champaran is the dress I have always worn in India except that for a very short period in India I fell an easy prey in common with the rest of my countrymen to the wearing of semi European dress in the courts and elsewhere outside Kathiawar I appeared before the Kathiawar courts now twenty one years ago in precisely the dress I wear in Champaran One change I have made and it is that having taken to the occupation of weaving and agriculture and having taken the vow of Swadeshi my clothing is now entirely hand woven and hand sewn and made by me or my fellow workers mister Irwin s letter suggests that I appear before the ryots in a dress I have temporarily and specially adopted in Champaran to produce an effect The fact is that I wear the national dress because it is the most natural and the most becoming for an Indian I believe that our copying of the European dress is a sign of our degradation humiliation and our weakness and that we are committing a national sin in discarding a dress which is best suited to the Indian climate and which for its simplicity art and cheapness is not to be beaten on the face of the earth and which answers hygienic requirements Had it not been for a false pride and equally false notions of prestige Englishmen here would long ago have adopted the Indian costume I may mention incidentally that I do not go about Champaran bare headed I do avoid shoes for sacred reasons But I find too that it is more natural and healthier to avoid them whenever possible I am sorry to inform mister Irwin and your readers that my esteemed friend Babu Brijakishore Prasad the ex honorable Member of Council still remains unregenerate and retains the provincial cap and never walks barefoot and kicks up a terrible noise even in the house we are living in by wearing wooden sandals He has still not the courage in spite of most admirable contact with me to discard his semi anglicised dress and whenever he goes to see officials he puts his legs into the bifurcated garment and on his own admission tortures himself by cramping his feet in inelastic shoes I cannot induce him to believe that his clients won t desert him and the courts won t punish him if he wore his more becoming and less expensive dhoti I invite you and mister Irwin not to believe the stories that the latter hears about me and my friends but to join me in the crusade against educated Indians abandoning their manners habits and customs which are not proved to be bad or harmful Finally I venture to warn you and mister Irwin that you and he will ill serve the cause both of you consider is in danger by reason of my presence in Champaran if you continue as you have done to base your strictures on unproved facts I ask you to accept my assurance that I should deem myself unworthy of the friendship and confidence of hundreds of my English friends and associates not all of them fellow cranks if in similar circumstances I acted towards them differently from my own countrymen FOOTNOTE six Reply to mister Irwin s criticism of his dress in the Pioneer Printed by K R Sondhi at the Allied Press Lahore and published by R P Soni for Gandhi Publications League Lahore
