PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MOLL FLANDERS The Fortunes Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders c Who was Born in Newgate and during a Life of continu d Variety for Threescore Years besides her Childhood was Twelve Year a Whore five times a Wife whereof once to her own Brother Twelve Year a Thief Eight Year a Transported Felon in Virginia at last grew Rich liv d Honest and dies a Penitent Written from her own Memorandums by Daniel Defoe THE AUTHOR S PREFACE The world is so taken up of late with novels and romances that it will be hard for a private history to be taken for genuine where the names and other circumstances of the person are concealed and on this account we must be content to leave the reader to pass his own opinion upon the ensuing sheet and take it just as he pleases The author is here supposed to be writing her own history and in the very beginning of her account she gives the reasons why she thinks fit to conceal her true name after which there is no occasion to say any more about that It is true that the original of this story is put into new words and the style of the famous lady we here speak of is a little altered particularly she is made to tell her own tale in modester words that she told it at first the copy which came first to hand having been written in language more like one still in Newgate than one grown penitent and humble as she afterwards pretends to be The pen employed in finishing her story and making it what you now see it to be has had no little difficulty to put it into a dress fit to be seen and to make it speak language fit to be read When a woman debauched from her youth nay even being the offspring of debauchery and vice comes to give an account of all her vicious practices and even to descend to the particular occasions and circumstances by which she ran through in threescore years an author must be hard put to it wrap it up so clean as not to give room especially for vicious readers to turn it to his disadvantage All possible care however has been taken to give no lewd ideas no immodest turns in the new dressing up of this story no not to the worst parts of her expressions To this purpose some of the vicious part of her life which could not be modestly told is quite left out and several other parts are very much shortened What is left tis hoped will not offend the chastest reader or the modest hearer and as the best use is made even of the worst story the moral tis hoped will keep the reader serious even where the story might incline him to be otherwise To give the history of a wicked life repented of necessarily requires that the wicked part should be make as wicked as the real history of it will bear to illustrate and give a beauty to the penitent part which is certainly the best and brightest if related with equal spirit and life It is suggested there cannot be the same life the same brightness and beauty in relating the penitent part as is in the criminal part If there is any truth in that suggestion I must be allowed to say tis because there is not the same taste and relish in the reading and indeed it is to true that the difference lies not in the real worth of the subject so much as in the gust and palate of the reader But as this work is chiefly recommended to those who know how to read it and how to make the good uses of it which the story all along recommends to them so it is to be hoped that such readers will be more leased with the moral than the fable with the application than with the relation and with the end of the writer than with the life of the person written of There is in this story abundance of delightful incidents and all of them usefully applied There is an agreeable turn artfully given them in the relating that naturally instructs the reader either one way or other The first part of her lewd life with the young gentleman at Colchester has so many happy turns given it to expose the crime and warn all whose circumstances are adapted to it of the ruinous end of such things and the foolish thoughtless and abhorred conduct of both the parties that it abundantly atones for all the lively description she gives of her folly and wickedness The repentance of her lover at the Bath and how brought by the just alarm of his fit of sickness to abandon her the just caution given there against even the lawful intimacies of the dearest friends and how unable they are to preserve the most solemn resolutions of virtue without divine assistance these are parts which to a just discernment will appear to have more real beauty in them all the amorous chain of story which introduces it In a word as the whole relation is carefully garbled of all the levity and looseness that was in it so it all applied and with the utmost care to virtuous and religious uses None can without being guilty of manifest injustice cast any reproach upon it or upon our design in publishing it The advocates for the stage have in all ages made this the great argument to persuade people that their plays are useful and that they ought to be allowed in the most civilised and in the most religious government namely that they are applied to virtuous purposes and that by the most lively representations they fail not to recommend virtue and generous principles and to discourage and expose all sorts of vice and corruption of manners and were it true that they did so and that they constantly adhered to that rule as the test of their acting on the theatre much might be said in their favour Throughout the infinite variety of this book this fundamental is most strictly adhered to there is not a wicked action in any part of it but is first and last rendered unhappy and unfortunate there is not a superlative villain brought upon the stage but either he is brought to an unhappy end or brought to be a penitent there is not an ill thing mentioned but it is condemned even in the relation nor a virtuous just thing but it carries its praise along with it What can more exactly answer the rule laid down to recommend even those representations of things which have so many other just objections leaving against them namely of example of bad company obscene language and the like Upon this foundation this book is recommended to the reader as a work from every part of which something may be learned and some just and religious inference is drawn by which the reader will have something of instruction if he pleases to make use of it All the exploits of this lady of fame in her depredations upon mankind stand as so many warnings to honest people to beware of them intimating to them by what methods innocent people are drawn in plundered and robbed and by consequence how to avoid them Her robbing a little innocent child dressed fine by the vanity of the mother to go to the dancing school is a good memento to such people hereafter as is likewise her picking the gold watch from the young lady s side in the Park Her getting a parcel from a hare brained wench at the coaches in saint John Street her booty made at the fire and again at Harwich all give us excellent warnings in such cases to be more present to ourselves in sudden surprises of every sort Her application to a sober life and industrious management at last in Virginia with her transported spouse is a story fruitful of instruction to all the unfortunate creatures who are obliged to seek their re establishment abroad whether by the misery of transportation or other disaster letting them know that diligence and application have their due encouragement even in the remotest parts of the world and that no case can be so low so despicable or so empty of prospect but that an unwearied industry will go a great way to deliver us from it will in time raise the meanest creature to appear again the world and give him a new case for his life There are a few of the serious inferences which we are led by the hand to in this book and these are fully sufficient to justify any man in recommending it to the world and much more to justify the publication of it There are two of the most beautiful parts still behind which this story gives some idea of and lets us into the parts of them but they are either of them too long to be brought into the same volume and indeed are as I may call them whole volumes of themselves viz one The life of her governess as she calls her who had run through it seems in a few years all the eminent degrees of a gentlewoman a whore and a bawd a midwife and a midwife keeper as they are called a pawnbroker a childtaker a receiver of thieves and of thieves purchase that is to say of stolen goods and in a word herself a thief a breeder up of thieves and the like and yet at last a penitent The second is the life of her transported husband a highwayman who it seems lived a twelve years life of successful villainy upon the road and even at last came off so well as to be a volunteer transport not a convict and in whose life there is an incredible variety But as I have said these are things too long to bring in here so neither can I make a promise of the coming out by themselves We cannot say indeed that this history is carried on quite to the end of the life of this famous Moll Flanders as she calls herself for nobody can write their own life to the full end of it unless they can write it after they are dead But her husband s life being written by a third hand gives a full account of them both how long they lived together in that country and how they both came to England again after about eight years in which time they were grown very rich and where she lived it seems to be very old but was not so extraordinary a penitent as she was at first it seems only that indeed she always spoke with abhorrence of her former life and of every part of it In her last scene at Maryland and Virginia many pleasant things happened which makes that part of her life very agreeable but they are not told with the same elegancy as those accounted for by herself so it is still to the more advantage that we break off here MOLL FLANDERS My true name is so well known in the records or registers at Newgate and in the Old Bailey and there are some things of such consequence still depending there relating to my particular conduct that it is not be expected I should set my name or the account of my family to this work perhaps after my death it may be better known at present it would not be proper no not though a general pardon should be issued even without exceptions and reserve of persons or crimes It is enough to tell you that as some of my worst comrades who are out of the way of doing me harm having gone out of the world by the steps and the string as I often expected to go knew me by the name of Moll Flanders so you may give me leave to speak of myself under that name till I dare own who I have been as well as who I am I have been told that in one of neighbour nations whether it be in France or where else I know not they have an order from the king that when any criminal is condemned either to die or to the galleys or to be transported if they leave any children as such are generally unprovided for by the poverty or forfeiture of their parents so they are immediately taken into the care of the Government and put into a hospital called the House of Orphans where they are bred up clothed fed taught and when fit to go out are placed out to trades or to services so as to be well able to provide for themselves by an honest industrious behaviour Had this been the custom in our country I had not been left a poor desolate girl without friends without clothes without help or helper in the world as was my fate and by which I was not only exposed to very great distresses even before I was capable either of understanding my case or how to amend it but brought into a course of life which was not only scandalous in itself but which in its ordinary course tended to the swift destruction both of soul and body But the case was otherwise here My mother was convicted of felony for a certain petty theft scarce worth naming viz having an opportunity of borrowing three pieces of fine holland of a certain draper in Cheapside The circumstances are too long to repeat and I have heard them related so many ways that I can scarce be certain which is the right account However it was this they all agree in that my mother pleaded her belly and being found quick with child she was respited for about seven months in which time having brought me into the world and being about again she was called down as they term it to her former judgment but obtained the favour of being transported to the plantations and left me about half a year old and in bad hands you may be sure This is too near the first hours of my life for me to relate anything of myself but by hearsay it is enough to mention that as I was born in such an unhappy place I had no parish to have recourse to for my nourishment in my infancy nor can I give the least account how I was kept alive other than that as I have been told some relation of my mother s took me away for a while as a nurse but at whose expense or by whose direction I know nothing at all of it The first account that I can recollect or could ever learn of myself was that I had wandered among a crew of those people they call gypsies or Egyptians but I believe it was but a very little while that I had been among them for I had not had my skin discoloured or blackened as they do very young to all the children they carry about with them nor can I tell how I came among them or how I got from them It was at Colchester in Essex that those people left me and I have a notion in my head that I left them there that is that I hid myself and would not go any farther with them but I am not able to be particular in that account only this I remember that being taken up by some of the parish officers of Colchester I gave an account that I came into the town with the gypsies but that I would not go any farther with them and that so they had left me but whither they were gone that I knew not nor could they expect it of me for though they send round the country to inquire after them it seems they could not be found I was now in a way to be provided for for though I was not a parish charge upon this or that part of the town by law yet as my case came to be known and that I was too young to do any work being not above three years old compassion moved the magistrates of the town to order some care to be taken of me and I became one of their own as much as if I had been born in the place In the provision they made for me it was my good hap to be put to nurse as they call it to a woman who was indeed poor but had been in better circumstances and who got a little livelihood by taking such as I was supposed to be and keeping them with all necessaries till they were at a certain age in which it might be supposed they might go to service or get their own bread This woman had also had a little school which she kept to teach children to read and to work and having as I have said lived before that in good fashion she bred up the children she took with a great deal of art as well as with a great deal of care But that which was worth all the rest she bred them up very religiously being herself a very sober pious woman very house wifely and clean and very mannerly and with good behaviour So that in a word expecting a plain diet coarse lodging and mean clothes we were brought up as mannerly and as genteelly as if we had been at the dancing school I was continued here till I was eight years old when I was terrified with news that the magistrates as I think they called them had ordered that I should go to service I was able to do but very little service wherever I was to go except it was to run of errands and be a drudge to some cookmaid and this they told me of often which put me into a great fright for I had a thorough aversion to going to service as they called it that is to be a servant though I was so young and I told my nurse as we called her that I believed I could get my living without going to service if she pleased to let me for she had taught me to work with my needle and spin worsted which is the chief trade of that city and I told her that if she would keep me I would work for her and I would work very hard I talked to her almost every day of working hard and in short I did nothing but work and cry all day which grieved the good kind woman so much that at last she began to be concerned for me for she loved me very well One day after this as she came into the room where all we poor children were at work she sat down just over against me not in her usual place as mistress but as if she set herself on purpose to observe me and see me work I was doing something she had set me to as I remember it was marking some shirts which she had taken to make and after a while she began to talk to me Thou foolish child says she thou art always crying for I was crying then prithee what dost cry for Because they will take me away says I and put me to service and I can t work housework Well child says she but though you can t work housework as you call it you will learn it in time and they won t put you to hard things at first Yes they will says I and if I can t do it they will beat me and the maids will beat me to make me do great work and I am but a little girl and I can t do it and then I cried again till I could not speak any more to her This moved my good motherly nurse so that she from that time resolved I should not go to service yet so she bid me not cry and she would speak to mister Mayor and I should not go to service till I was bigger Well this did not satisfy me for to think of going to service was such a frightful thing to me that if she had assured me I should not have gone till I was twenty years old it would have been the same to me I should have cried I believe all the time with the very apprehension of its being to be so at last When she saw that I was not pacified yet she began to be angry with me And what would you have says she don t I tell you that you shall not go to service till your are bigger Ay said I but then I must go at last Why what said she is the girl mad What would you be a gentlewoman Yes says I and cried heartily till I roared out again This set the old gentlewoman a laughing at me as you may be sure it would Well madam forsooth says she gibing at me you would be a gentlewoman and pray how will you come to be a gentlewoman What will you do it by your fingers end Yes says I again very innocently Why what can you earn says she what can you get at your work Threepence said I when I spin and fourpence when I work plain work Alas poor gentlewoman said she again laughing what will that do for thee It will keep me says I if you will let me live with you And this I said in such a poor petitioning tone that it made the poor woman s heart yearn to me as she told me afterwards But says she that will not keep you and buy you clothes too and who must buy the little gentlewoman clothes says she and smiled all the while at me I will work harder then says I and you shall have it all Poor child it won t keep you says she it will hardly keep you in victuals Then I will have no victuals says I again very innocently let me but live with you Why can you live without victuals says she Yes again says I very much like a child you may be sure and still I cried heartily I had no policy in all this you may easily see it was all nature but it was joined with so much innocence and so much passion that in short it set the good motherly creature a weeping too and she cried at last as fast as I did and then took me and led me out of the teaching room Come says she you shan t go to service you shall live with me and this pacified me for the present Some time after this she going to wait on the Mayor and talking of such things as belonged to her business at last my story came up and my good nurse told mister Mayor the whole tale He was so pleased with it that he would call his lady and his two daughters to hear it and it made mirth enough among them you may be sure However not a week had passed over but on a sudden comes missus Mayoress and her two daughters to the house to see my old nurse and to see her school and the children When they had looked about them a little Well missus says the Mayoress to my nurse and pray which is the little lass that intends to be a gentlewoman I heard her and I was terribly frighted at first though I did not know why neither but missus Mayoress comes up to me Well miss says she and what are you at work upon The word miss was a language that had hardly been heard of in our school and I wondered what sad name it was she called me However I stood up made a curtsy and she took my work out of my hand looked on it and said it was very well then she took up one of the hands Nay says she the child may come to be a gentlewoman for aught anybody knows she has a gentlewoman s hand says she This pleased me mightily you may be sure but missus Mayoress did not stop there but giving me my work again she put her hand in her pocket gave me a shilling and bid me mind my work and learn to work well and I might be a gentlewoman for aught she knew Now all this while my good old nurse missus Mayoress and all the rest of them did not understand me at all for they meant one sort of thing by the word gentlewoman and I meant quite another for alas all I understood by being a gentlewoman was to be able to work for myself and get enough to keep me without that terrible bugbear going to service whereas they meant to live great rich and high and I know not what Well after missus Mayoress was gone her two daughters came in and they called for the gentlewoman too and they talked a long while to me and I answered them in my innocent way but always if they asked me whether I resolved to be a gentlewoman I answered Yes At last one of them asked me what a gentlewoman was That puzzled me much but however I explained myself negatively that it was one that did not go to service to do housework They were pleased to be familiar with me and like my little prattle to them which it seems was agreeable enough to them and they gave me money too As for my money I gave it all to my mistress nurse as I called her and told her she should have all I got for myself when I was a gentlewoman as well as now By this and some other of my talk my old tutoress began to understand me about what I meant by being a gentlewoman and that I understood by it no more than to be able to get my bread by my own work and at last she asked me whether it was not so I told her yes and insisted on it that to do so was to be a gentlewoman for says I there is such a one naming a woman that mended lace and washed the ladies laced heads she says I is a gentlewoman and they call her madam Poor child says my good old nurse you may soon be such a gentlewoman as that for she is a person of ill fame and has had two or three bastards I did not understand anything of that but I answered I am sure they call her madam and she does not go to service nor do housework and therefore I insisted that she was a gentlewoman and I would be such a gentlewoman as that The ladies were told all this again to be sure and they made themselves merry with it and every now and then the young ladies mister Mayor s daughters would come and see me and ask where the little gentlewoman was which made me not a little proud of myself This held a great while and I was often visited by these young ladies and sometimes they brought others with them so that I was known by it almost all over the town I was now about ten years old and began to look a little womanish for I was mighty grave and humble very mannerly and as I had often heard the ladies say I was pretty and would be a very handsome woman so you may be sure that hearing them say so made me not a little proud However that pride had no ill effect upon me yet only as they often gave me money and I gave it to my old nurse she honest woman was so just to me as to lay it all out again for me and gave me head dresses and linen and gloves and ribbons and I went very neat and always clean for that I would do and if I had rags on I would always be clean or else I would dabble them in water myself but I say my good nurse when I had money given me very honestly laid it out for me and would always tell the ladies this or that was bought with their money and this made them oftentimes give me more till at last I was indeed called upon by the magistrates as I understood it to go out to service but then I was come to be so good a workwoman myself and the ladies were so kind to me that it was plain I could maintain myself that is to say I could earn as much for my nurse as she was able by it to keep me so she told them that if they would give her leave she would keep the gentlewoman as she called me to be her assistant and teach the children which I was very well able to do for I was very nimble at my work and had a good hand with my needle though I was yet very young But the kindness of the ladies of the town did not end here for when they came to understand that I was no more maintained by the public allowance as before they gave me money oftener than formerly and as I grew up they brought me work to do for them such as linen to make and laces to mend and heads to dress up and not only paid me for doing them but even taught me how to do them so that now I was a gentlewoman indeed as I understood that word I not only found myself clothes and paid my nurse for my keeping but got money in my pocket too beforehand The ladies also gave me clothes frequently of their own or their children s some stockings some petticoats some gowns some one thing some another and these my old woman managed for me like a mere mother and kept them for me obliged me to mend them and turn them and twist them to the best advantage for she was a rare housewife At last one of the ladies took so much fancy to me that she would have me home to her house for a month she said to be among her daughters Now though this was exceeding kind in her yet as my old good woman said to her unless she resolved to keep me for good and all she would do the little gentlewoman more harm than good Well says the lady that s true and therefore I ll only take her home for a week then that I may see how my daughters and she agree together and how I like her temper and then I ll tell you more and in the meantime if anybody comes to see her as they used to do you may only tell them you have sent her out to my house This was prudently managed enough and I went to the lady s house but I was so pleased there with the young ladies and they so pleased with me that I had enough to do to come away and they were as unwilling to part with me However I did come away and lived almost a year more with my honest old woman and began now to be very helpful to her for I was almost fourteen years old was tall of my age and looked a little womanish but I had such a taste of genteel living at the lady s house that I was not so easy in my old quarters as I used to be and I thought it was fine to be a gentlewoman indeed for I had quite other notions of a gentlewoman now than I had before and as I thought I say that it was fine to be a gentlewoman so I loved to be among gentlewomen and therefore I longed to be there again About the time that I was fourteen years and a quarter old my good nurse mother I rather to call her fell sick and died I was then in a sad condition indeed for as there is no great bustle in putting an end to a poor body s family when once they are carried to the grave so the poor good woman being buried the parish children she kept were immediately removed by the church wardens the school was at an end and the children of it had no more to do but just stay at home till they were sent somewhere else and as for what she left her daughter a married woman with six or seven children came and swept it all away at once and removing the goods they had no more to say to me than to jest with me and tell me that the little gentlewoman might set up for herself if she pleased I was frighted out of my wits almost and knew not what to do for I was as it were turned out of doors to the wide world and that which was still worse the old honest woman had two and twenty shillings of mine in her hand which was all the estate the little gentlewoman had in the world and when I asked the daughter for it she huffed me and laughed at me and told me she had nothing to do with it It was true the good poor woman had told her daughter of it and that it lay in such a place that it was the child s money and had called once or twice for me to give it me but I was unhappily out of the way somewhere or other and when I came back she was past being in a condition to speak of it However the daughter was so honest afterwards as to give it me though at first she used me cruelly about it Now was I a poor gentlewoman indeed and I was just that very night to be turned into the wide world for the daughter removed all the goods and I had not so much as a lodging to go to or a bit of bread to eat But it seems some of the neighbours who had known my circumstances took so much compassion of me as to acquaint the lady in whose family I had been a week as I mentioned above and immediately she sent her maid to fetch me away and two of her daughters came with the maid though unsent So I went with them bag and baggage and with a glad heart you may be sure The fright of my condition had made such an impression upon me that I did not want now to be a gentlewoman but was very willing to be a servant and that any kind of servant they thought fit to have me be But my new generous mistress for she exceeded the good woman I was with before in everything as well as in the matter of estate I say in everything except honesty and for that though this was a lady most exactly just yet I must not forget to say on all occasions that the first though poor was as uprightly honest as it was possible for any one to be I was no sooner carried away as I have said by this good gentlewoman but the first lady that is to say the Mayoress that was sent her two daughters to take care of me and another family which had taken notice of me when I was the little gentlewoman and had given me work to do sent for me after her so that I was mightily made of as we say nay and they were not a little angry especially madam the Mayoress that her friend had taken me away from her as she called it for as she said I was hers by right she having been the first that took any notice of me But they that had me would not part with me and as for me though I should have been very well treated with any of the others yet I could not be better than where I was Here I continued till I was between seventeen and eighteen years old and here I had all the advantages for my education that could be imagined the lady had masters home to the house to teach her daughters to dance and to speak French and to write and other to teach them music and I was always with them I learned as fast as they and though the masters were not appointed to teach me yet I learned by imitation and inquiry all that they learned by instruction and direction so that in short I learned to dance and speak French as well as any of them and to sing much better for I had a better voice than any of them I could not so readily come at playing on the harpsichord or spinet because I had no instrument of my own to practice on and could only come at theirs in the intervals when they left it which was uncertain but yet I learned tolerably well too and the young ladies at length got two instruments that is to say a harpsichord and a spinet too and then they taught me themselves But as to dancing they could hardly help my learning country dances because they always wanted me to make up even number and on the other hand they were as heartily willing to learn me everything that they had been taught themselves as I could be to take the learning By this means I had as I have said above all the advantages of education that I could have had if I had been as much a gentlewoman as they were with whom I lived and in some things I had the advantage of my ladies though they were my superiors but they were all the gifts of nature and which all their fortunes could not furnish First I was apparently handsomer than any of them secondly I was better shaped and thirdly I sang better by which I mean I had a better voice in all which you will I hope allow me to say I do not speak my own conceit of myself but the opinion of all that knew the family I had with all these the common vanity of my sex viz that being really taken for very handsome or if you please for a great beauty I very well knew it and had as good an opinion of myself as anybody else could have of me and particularly I loved to hear anybody speak of it which could not but happen to me sometimes and was a great satisfaction to me Thus far I have had a smooth story to tell of myself and in all this part of my life I not only had the reputation of living in a very good family and a family noted and respected everywhere for virtue and sobriety and for every valuable thing but I had the character too of a very sober modest and virtuous young woman and such I had always been neither had I yet any occasion to think of anything else or to know what a temptation to wickedness meant But that which I was too vain of was my ruin or rather my vanity was the cause of it The lady in the house where I was had two sons young gentlemen of very promising parts and of extraordinary behaviour and it was my misfortune to be very well with them both but they managed themselves with me in a quite different manner The eldest a gay gentleman that knew the town as well as the country and though he had levity enough to do an ill natured thing yet had too much judgment of things to pay too dear for his pleasures he began with the unhappy snare to all women viz taking notice upon all occasions how pretty I was as he called it how agreeable how well carriaged and the like and this he contrived so subtly as if he had known as well how to catch a woman in his net as a partridge when he went a setting for he would contrive to be talking this to his sisters when though I was not by yet when he knew I was not far off but that I should be sure to hear him His sisters would return softly to him Hush brother she will hear you she is but in the next room Then he would put it off and talk softlier as if he had not know it and begin to acknowledge he was wrong and then as if he had forgot himself he would speak aloud again and I that was so well pleased to hear it was sure to listen for it upon all occasions After he had thus baited his hook and found easily enough the method how to lay it in my way he played an opener game and one day going by his sister s chamber when I was there doing something about dressing her he comes in with an air of gaiety Oh missus Betty said he to me how do you do missus Betty Don t your cheeks burn missus Betty I made a curtsy and blushed but said nothing What makes you talk so brother says the lady Why says he we have been talking of her below stairs this half hour Well says his sister you can say no harm of her that I am sure so tis no matter what you have been talking about Nay says he tis so far from talking harm of her that we have been talking a great deal of good and a great many fine things have been said of missus Betty I assure you and particularly that she is the handsomest young woman in Colchester and in short they begin to toast her health in the town I wonder at you brother says the sister Betty wants but one thing but she had as good want everything for the market is against our sex just now and if a young woman have beauty birth breeding wit sense manners modesty and all these to an extreme yet if she have not money she s nobody she had as good want them all for nothing but money now recommends a woman the men play the game all into their own hands Her younger brother who was by cried Hold sister you run too fast I am an exception to your rule I assure you if I find a woman so accomplished as you talk of I say I assure you I would not trouble myself about the money Oh says the sister but you will take care not to fancy one then without the money You don t know that neither says the brother But why sister says the elder brother why do you exclaim so at the men for aiming so much at the fortune You are none of them that want a fortune whatever else you want I understand you brother replies the lady very smartly you suppose I have the money and want the beauty but as times go now the first will do without the last so I have the better of my neighbours Well says the younger brother but your neighbours as you call them may be even with you for beauty will steal a husband sometimes in spite of money and when the maid chances to be handsomer than the mistress she oftentimes makes as good a market and rides in a coach before her I thought it was time for me to withdraw and leave them and I did so but not so far but that I heard all their discourse in which I heard abundance of the fine things said of myself which served to prompt my vanity but as I soon found was not the way to increase my interest in the family for the sister and the younger brother fell grievously out about it and as he said some very disobliging things to her upon my account so I could easily see that she resented them by her future conduct to me which indeed was very unjust to me for I had never had the least thought of what she suspected as to her younger brother indeed the elder brother in his distant remote way had said a great many things as in jest which I had the folly to believe were in earnest or to flatter myself with the hopes of what I ought to have supposed he never intended and perhaps never thought of It happened one day that he came running upstairs towards the room where his sisters used to sit and work as he often used to do and calling to them before he came in as was his way too I being there alone stepped to the door and said Sir the ladies are not here they are walked down the garden As I stepped forward to say this towards the door he was just got to the door and clasping me in his arms as if it had been by chance Oh missus Betty says he are you here That s better still I want to speak with you more than I do with them and then having me in his arms he kissed me three or four times I struggled to get away and yet did it but faintly neither and he held me fast and still kissed me till he was almost out of breath and then sitting down says Dear Betty I am in love with you His words I must confess fired my blood all my spirits flew about my heart and put me into disorder enough which he might easily have seen in my face He repeated it afterwards several times that he was in love with me and my heart spoke as plain as a voice that I liked it nay whenever he said I am in love with you my blushes plainly replied Would you were sir However nothing else passed at that time it was but a surprise and when he was gone I soon recovered myself again He had stayed longer with me but he happened to look out at the window and see his sisters coming up the garden so he took his leave kissed me again told me he was very serious and I should hear more of him very quickly and away he went leaving me infinitely pleased though surprised and had there not been one misfortune in it I had been in the right but the mistake lay here that missus Betty was in earnest and the gentleman was not From this time my head ran upon strange things and I may truly say I was not myself to have such a gentleman talk to me of being in love with me and of my being such a charming creature as he told me I was these were things I knew not how to bear my vanity was elevated to the last degree It is true I had my head full of pride but knowing nothing of the wickedness of the times I had not one thought of my own safety or of my virtue about me and had my young master offered it at first sight he might have taken any liberty he thought fit with me but he did not see his advantage which was my happiness for that time After this attack it was not long but he found an opportunity to catch me again and almost in the same posture indeed it had more of design in it on his part though not on my part It was thus the young ladies were all gone a visiting with their mother his brother was out of town and as for his father he had been in London for a week before He had so well watched me that he knew where I was though I did not so much as know that he was in the house and he briskly comes up the stairs and seeing me at work comes into the room to me directly and began just as he did before with taking me in his arms and kissing me for almost a quarter of an hour together It was his younger sister s chamber that I was in and as there was nobody in the house but the maids below stairs he was it may be the ruder in short he began to be in earnest with me indeed Perhaps he found me a little too easy for God knows I made no resistance to him while he only held me in his arms and kissed me indeed I was too well pleased with it to resist him much However as it were tired with that kind of work we sat down and there he talked with me a great while he said he was charmed with me and that he could not rest night or day till he had told me how he was in love with me and if I was able to love him again and would make him happy I should be the saving of his life and many such fine things I said little to him again but easily discovered that I was a fool and that I did not in the least perceive what he meant Then he walked about the room and taking me by the hand I walked with him and by and by taking his advantage he threw me down upon the bed and kissed me there most violently but to give him his due offered no manner of rudeness to me only kissed a great while After this he thought he had heard somebody come upstairs so got off from the bed lifted me up professing a great deal of love for me but told me it was all an honest affection and that he meant no ill to me and with that he put five guineas into my hand and went away downstairs I was more confounded with the money than I was before with the love and began to be so elevated that I scarce knew the ground I stood on I am the more particular in this part that if my story comes to be read by any innocent young body they may learn from it to guard themselves against the mischiefs which attend an early knowledge of their own beauty If a young woman once thinks herself handsome she never doubts the truth of any man that tells her he is in love with her for if she believes herself charming enough to captivate him tis natural to expect the effects of it This young gentleman had fired his inclination as much as he had my vanity and as if he had found that he had an opportunity and was sorry he did not take hold of it he comes up again in half an hour or thereabouts and falls to work with me again as before only with a little less introduction And first when he entered the room he turned about and shut the door missus Betty said he I fancied before somebody was coming upstairs but it was not so however adds he if they find me in the room with you they shan t catch me a kissing of you I told him I did not know who should be coming upstairs for I believed there was nobody in the house but the cook and the other maid and they never came up those stairs Well my dear says he tis good to be sure however and so he sits down and we began to talk And now though I was still all on fire with his first visit and said little he did as it were put words in my mouth telling me how passionately he loved me and that though he could not mention such a thing till he came to this estate yet he was resolved to make me happy then and himself too that is to say to marry me and abundance of such fine things which I poor fool did not understand the drift of but acted as if there was no such thing as any kind of love but that which tended to matrimony and if he had spoke of that I had no room as well as no power to have said no but we were not come that length yet We had not sat long but he got up and stopping my very breath with kisses threw me upon the bed again but then being both well warmed he went farther with me than decency permits me to mention nor had it been in my power to have denied him at that moment had he offered much more than he did However though he took these freedoms with me it did not go to that which they call the last favour which to do him justice he did not attempt and he made that self denial of his a plea for all his freedoms with me upon other occasions after this When this was over he stayed but a little while but he put almost a handful of gold in my hand and left me making a thousand protestations of his passion for me and of his loving me above all the women in the world It will not be strange if I now began to think but alas it was but with very little solid reflection I had a most unbounded stock of vanity and pride and but a very little stock of virtue I did indeed case sometimes with myself what young master aimed at but thought of nothing but the fine words and the gold whether he intended to marry me or not to marry me seemed a matter of no great consequence to me nor did my thoughts so much as suggest to me the necessity of making any capitulation for myself till he came to make a kind of formal proposal to me as you shall hear presently Thus I gave up myself to a readiness of being ruined without the least concern and am a fair memento to all young women whose vanity prevails over their virtue Nothing was ever so stupid on both sides Had I acted as became me and resisted as virtue and honour require this gentleman had either desisted his attacks finding no room to expect the accomplishment of his design or had made fair and honourable proposals of marriage in which case whoever had blamed him nobody could have blamed me In short if he had known me and how easy the trifle he aimed at was to be had he would have troubled his head no farther but have given me four or five guineas and have lain with me the next time he had come at me And if I had known his thoughts and how hard he thought I would be to be gained I might have made my own terms with him and if I had not capitulated for an immediate marriage I might for a maintenance till marriage and might have had what I would for he was already rich to excess besides what he had in expectation but I seemed wholly to have abandoned all such thoughts as these and was taken up only with the pride of my beauty and of being beloved by such a gentleman As for the gold I spent whole hours in looking upon it I told the guineas over and over a thousand times a day Never poor vain creature was so wrapt up with every part of the story as I was not considering what was before me and how near my ruin was at the door indeed I think I rather wished for that ruin than studied to avoid it In the meantime however I was cunning enough not to give the least room to any in the family to suspect me or to imagine that I had the least correspondence with this young gentleman I scarce ever looked towards him in public or answered if he spoke to me when anybody was near us but for all that we had every now and then a little encounter where we had room for a word or two an now and then a kiss but no fair opportunity for the mischief intended and especially considering that he made more circumlocution than if he had known by thoughts he had occasion for and the work appearing difficult to him he really made it so But as the devil is an unwearied tempter so he never fails to find opportunity for that wickedness he invites to It was one evening that I was in the garden with his two younger sisters and himself and all very innocently merry when he found means to convey a note into my hand by which he directed me to understand that he would to morrow desire me publicly to go of an errand for him into the town and that I should see him somewhere by the way Accordingly after dinner he very gravely says to me his sisters being all by missus Betty I must ask a favour of you What s that says his second sister Nay sister says he very gravely if you can t spare missus Betty to day any other time will do Yes they said they could spare her well enough and the sister begged pardon for asking which they did but of mere course without any meaning Well but brother says the eldest sister you must tell missus Betty what it is if it be any private business that we must not hear you may call her out There she is Why sister says the gentleman very gravely what do you mean I only desire her to go into the High Street and then he pulls out a turnover to such a shop and then he tells them a long story of two fine neckcloths he had bid money for and he wanted to have me go and make an errand to buy a neck to the turnover that he showed to see if they would take my money for the neckcloths to bid a shilling more and haggle with them and then he made more errands and so continued to have such petty business to do that I should be sure to stay a good while When he had given me my errands he told them a long story of a visit he was going to make to a family they all knew and where was to be such and such gentlemen and how merry they were to be and very formally asks his sisters to go with him and they as formally excused themselves because of company that they had notice was to come and visit them that afternoon which by the way he had contrived on purpose He had scarce done speaking to them and giving me my errand but his man came up to tell him that Sir W H s coach stopped at the door so he runs down and comes up again immediately Alas says he aloud there s all my mirth spoiled at once sir W has sent his coach for me and desires to speak with me upon some earnest business It seems this Sir W was a gentleman who lived about three miles out of town to whom he had spoken on purpose the day before to lend him his chariot for a particular occasion and had appointed it to call for him as it did about three o clock Immediately he calls for his best wig hat and sword and ordering his man to go to the other place to make his excuse that was to say he made an excuse to send his man away he prepares to go into the coach As he was going he stopped a while and speaks mighty earnestly to me about his business and finds an opportunity to say very softly to me Come away my dear as soon as ever you can I said nothing but made a curtsy as if I had done so to what he said in public In about a quarter of an hour I went out too I had no dress other than before except that I had a hood a mask a fan and a pair of gloves in my pocket so that there was not the least suspicion in the house He waited for me in the coach in a back lane which he knew I must pass by and had directed the coachman whither to go which was to a certain place called Mile End where lived a confidant of his where we went in and where was all the convenience in the world to be as wicked as we pleased When we were together he began to talk very gravely to me and to tell me he did not bring me there to betray me that his passion for me would not suffer him to abuse me that he resolved to marry me as soon as he came to his estate that in the meantime if I would grant his request he would maintain me very honourably and made me a thousand protestations of his sincerity and of his affection to me and that he would never abandon me and as I may say made a thousand more preambles than he need to have done However as he pressed me to speak I told him I had no reason to question the sincerity of his love to me after so many protestations but and there I stopped as if I left him to guess the rest But what my dear says he I guess what you mean what if you should be with child Is not that it Why then says he I ll take care of you and provide for you and the child too and that you may see I am not in jest says he here s an earnest for you and with that he pulls out a silk purse with an hundred guineas in it and gave it me And I ll give you such another says he every year till I marry you My colour came and went at the sight of the purse and with the fire of his proposal together so that I could not say a word and he easily perceived it so putting the purse into my bosom I made no more resistance to him but let him do just what he pleased and as often as he pleased and thus I finished my own destruction at once for from this day being forsaken of my virtue and my modesty I had nothing of value left to recommend me either to God s blessing or man s assistance But things did not end here I went back to the town did the business he publicly directed me to and was at home before anybody thought me long As for my gentleman he stayed out as he told me he would till late at night and there was not the least suspicion in the family either on his account or on mine We had after this frequent opportunities to repeat our crime chiefly by his contrivance especially at home when his mother and the young ladies went abroad a visiting which he watched so narrowly as never to miss knowing always beforehand when they went out and then failed not to catch me all alone and securely enough so that we took our fill of our wicked pleasure for near half a year and yet which was the most to my satisfaction I was not with child But before this half year was expired his younger brother of whom I have made some mention in the beginning of the story falls to work with me and he finding me alone in the garden one evening begins a story of the same kind to me made good honest professions of being in love with me and in short proposes fairly and honourably to marry me and that before he made any other offer to me at all I was now confounded and driven to such an extremity as the like was never known at least not to me I resisted the proposal with obstinacy and now I began to arm myself with arguments I laid before him the inequality of the match the treatment I should meet with in the family the ingratitude it would be to his good father and mother who had taken me into their house upon such generous principles and when I was in such a low condition and in short I said everything to dissuade him from his design that I could imagine except telling him the truth which would indeed have put an end to it all but that I durst not think of mentioning But here happened a circumstance that I did not expect indeed which put me to my shifts for this young gentleman as he was plain and honest so he pretended to nothing with me but what was so too and knowing his own innocence he was not so careful to make his having a kindness for missus Betty a secret I the house as his brother was And though he did not let them know that he had talked to me about it yet he said enough to let his sisters perceive he loved me and his mother saw it too which though they took no notice of it to me yet they did to him an immediately I found their carriage to me altered more than ever before I saw the cloud though I did not foresee the storm It was easy I say to see that their carriage to me was altered and that it grew worse and worse every day till at last I got information among the servants that I should in a very little while be desired to remove I was not alarmed at the news having a full satisfaction that I should be otherwise provided for and especially considering that I had reason every day to expect I should be with child and that then I should be obliged to remove without any pretences for it After some time the younger gentleman took an opportunity to tell me that the kindness he had for me had got vent in the family He did not charge me with it he said for he know well enough which way it came out He told me his plain way of talking had been the occasion of it for that he did not make his respect for me so much a secret as he might have done and the reason was that he was at a point that if I would consent to have him he would tell them all openly that he loved me and that he intended to marry me that it was true his father and mother might resent it and be unkind but that he was now in a way to live being bred to the law and he did not fear maintaining me agreeable to what I should expect and that in short as he believed I would not be ashamed of him so he was resolved not to be ashamed of me and that he scorned to be afraid to own me now whom he resolved to own after I was his wife and therefore I had nothing to do but to give him my hand and he would answer for all the rest I was now in a dreadful condition indeed and now I repented heartily my easiness with the eldest brother not from any reflection of conscience but from a view of the happiness I might have enjoyed and had now made impossible for though I had no great scruples of conscience as I have said to struggle with yet I could not think of being a whore to one brother and a wife to the other But then it came into my thoughts that the first brother had promised to made me his wife when he came to his estate but I presently remembered what I had often thought of that he had never spoken a word of having me for a wife after he had conquered me for a mistress and indeed till now though I said I thought of it often yet it gave me no disturbance at all for as he did not seem in the least to lessen his affection to me so neither did he lessen his bounty though he had the discretion himself to desire me not to lay out a penny of what he gave me in clothes or to make the least show extraordinary because it would necessarily give jealousy in the family since everybody know I could come at such things no manner of ordinary way but by some private friendship which they would presently have suspected But I was now in a great strait and knew not what to do The main difficulty was this the younger brother not only laid close siege to me but suffered it to be seen He would come into his sister s room and his mother s room and sit down and talk a thousand kind things of me and to me even before their faces and when they were all there This grew so public that the whole house talked of it and his mother reproved him for it and their carriage to me appeared quite altered In short his mother had let fall some speeches as if she intended to put me out of the family that is in English to turn me out of doors Now I was sure this could not be a secret to his brother only that he might not think as indeed nobody else yet did that the youngest brother had made any proposal to me about it but as I easily could see that it would go farther so I saw likewise there was an absolute necessity to speak of it to him or that he would speak of it to me and which to do first I knew not that is whether I should break it to him or let it alone till he should break it to me Upon serious consideration for indeed now I began to consider things very seriously and never till now I say upon serious consideration I resolved to tell him of it first and it was not long before I had an opportunity for the very next day his brother went to London upon some business and the family being out a visiting just as it had happened before and as indeed was often the case he came according to his custom to spend an hour or two with missus Betty When he came had had sat down a while he easily perceived there was an alteration in my countenance that I was not so free and pleasant with him as I used to be and particularly that I had been a crying he was not long before he took notice of it and asked me in very kind terms what was the matter and if anything troubled me I would have put it off if I could but it was not to be concealed so after suffering many importunities to draw that out of me which I longed as much as possible to disclose I told him that it was true something did trouble me and something of such a nature that I could not conceal from him and yet that I could not tell how to tell him of it neither that it was a thing that not only surprised me but greatly perplexed me and that I knew not what course to take unless he would direct me He told me with great tenderness that let it be what it would I should not let it trouble me for he would protect me from all the world I then began at a distance and told him I was afraid the ladies had got some secret information of our correspondence for that it was easy to see that their conduct was very much changed towards me for a great while and that now it was come to that pass that they frequently found fault with me and sometimes fell quite out with me though I never gave them the least occasion that whereas I used always to lie with the eldest sister I was lately put to lie by myself or with one of the maids and that I had overheard them several times talking very unkindly about me but that which confirmed it all was that one of the servants had told me that she had heard I was to be turned out and that it was not safe for the family that I should be any longer in the house He smiled when he herd all this and I asked him how he could make so light of it when he must needs know that if there was any discovery I was undone for ever and that even it would hurt him though not ruin him as it would me I upbraided him that he was like all the rest of the sex that when they had the character and honour of a woman at their mercy oftentimes made it their jest and at least looked upon it as a trifle and counted the ruin of those they had had their will of as a thing of no value He saw me warm and serious and he changed his style immediately he told me he was sorry I should have such a thought of him that he had never given me the least occasion for it but had been as tender of my reputation as he could be of his own that he was sure our correspondence had been managed with so much address that not one creature in the family had so much as a suspicion of it that if he smiled when I told him my thoughts it was at the assurance he lately received that our understanding one another was not so much as known or guessed at and that when he had told me how much reason he had to be easy I should smile as he did for he was very certain it would give me a full satisfaction This is a mystery I cannot understand says I or how it should be to my satisfaction that I am to be turned out of doors for if our correspondence is not discovered I know not what else I have done to change the countenances of the whole family to me or to have them treat me as they do now who formerly used me with so much tenderness as if I had been one of their own children Why look you child says he that they are uneasy about you that is true but that they have the least suspicion of the case as it is and as it respects you and I is so far from being true that they suspect my brother Robin and in short they are fully persuaded he makes love to you nay the fool has put it into their heads too himself for he is continually bantering them about it and making a jest of himself I confess I think he is wrong to do so because he cannot but see it vexes them and makes them unkind to you but tis a satisfaction to me because of the assurance it gives me that they do not suspect me in the least and I hope this will be to your satisfaction too So it is says I one way but this does not reach my case at all nor is this the chief thing that troubles me though I have been concerned about that too What is it then says he With which I fell to tears and could say nothing to him at all He strove to pacify me all he could but began at last to be very pressing upon me to tell what it was At last I answered that I thought I ought to tell him too and that he had some right to know it besides that I wanted his direction in the case for I was in such perplexity that I knew not what course to take and then I related the whole affair to him I told him how imprudently his brother had managed himself in making himself so public for that if he had kept it a secret as such a thing out to have been I could but have denied him positively without giving any reason for it and he would in time have ceased his solicitations but that he had the vanity first to depend upon it that I would not deny him and then had taken the freedom to tell his resolution of having me to the whole house I told him how far I had resisted him and told him how sincere and honourable his offers were But says I my case will be doubly hard for as they carry it ill to me now because he desires to have me they ll carry it worse when they shall find I have denied him and they will presently say there s something else in it and then out it comes that I am married already to somebody else or that I would never refuse a match so much above me as this was This discourse surprised him indeed very much He told me that it was a critical point indeed for me to manage and he did not see which way I should get out of it but he would consider it and let me know next time we met what resolution he was come to about it and in the meantime desired I would not give my consent to his brother nor yet give him a flat denial but that I would hold him in suspense a while I seemed to start at his saying I should not give him my consent I told him he knew very well I had no consent to give that he had engaged himself to marry me and that my consent was the same time engaged to him that he had all along told me I was his wife and I looked upon myself as effectually so as if the ceremony had passed and that it was from his own mouth that I did so he having all along persuaded me to call myself his wife Well my dear says he don t be concerned at that now if I am not your husband I ll be as good as a husband to you and do not let those things trouble you now but let me look a little farther into this affair and I shall be able to say more next time we meet He pacified me as well as he could with this but I found he was very thoughtful and that though he was very kind to me and kissed me a thousand times and more I believe and gave me money too yet he offered no more all the while we were together which was above two hours and which I much wondered at indeed at that time considering how it used to be and what opportunity we had His brother did not come from London for five or six days and it was two days more before he got an opportunity to talk with him but then getting him by himself he began to talk very close to him about it and the same evening got an opportunity for we had a long conference together to repeat all their discourse to me which as near as I can remember was to the purpose following He told him he heard strange news of him since he went viz that he made love to missus Betty Well says his brother a little angrily and so I do And what then What has anybody to do with that Nay says his brother don t be angry Robin I don t pretend to have anything to do with it nor do I pretend to be angry with you about it But I find they do concern themselves about it and that they have used the poor girl ill about it which I should take as done to myself Whom do you mean by THEY says Robin I mean my mother and the girls says the elder brother But hark ye says his brother are you in earnest Do you really love this girl You may be free with me you know Why then says Robin I will be free with you I do love her above all the women in the world and I will have her let them say and do what they will I believe the girl will not deny me It struck me to the heart when he told me this for though it was most rational to think I would not deny him yet I knew in my own conscience I must deny him and I saw my ruin in my being obliged to do so but I knew it was my business to talk otherwise then so I interrupted him in his story thus Ay said I does he think I cannot deny him But he shall find I can deny him for all that Well my dear says he but let me give you the whole story as it went on between us and then say what you will Then he went on and told me that he replied thus But brother you know she has nothing and you may have several ladies with good fortunes Tis no matter for that said Robin I love the girl and I will never please my pocket in marrying and not please my fancy And so my dear adds he there is no opposing him Yes yes says I you shall see I can oppose him I have learnt to say No now though I had not learnt it before if the best lord in the land offered me marriage now I could very cheerfully say No to him Well but my dear says he what can you say to him You know as you said when we talked of it before he well ask you many questions about it and all the house will wonder what the meaning of it should be Why says I smiling I can stop all their mouths at one clap by telling him and them too that I am married already to his elder brother He smiled a little too at the word but I could see it startled him and he could not hide the disorder it put him into However he returned Why though that may be true in some sense yet I suppose you are but in jest when you talk of giving such an answer as that it may not be convenient on many accounts No no says I pleasantly I am not so fond of letting the secret come out without your consent But what then can you say to him or to them says he when they find you positive against a match which would be apparently so much to your advantage Why says I should I be at a loss First of all I am not obliged to give me any reason at all on the other hand I may tell them I am married already and stop there and that will be a full stop too to him for he can have no reason to ask one question after it Ay says he but the whole house will tease you about that even to father and mother and if you deny them positively they will be disobliged at you and suspicious besides Why says I what can I do What would have me do I was in straight enough before and as I told you I was in perplexity before and acquainted you with the circumstances that I might have your advice My dear says he I have been considering very much upon it you may be sure and though it is a piece of advice that has a great many mortifications in it to me and may at first seem strange to you yet all things considered I see no better way for you than to let him go on and if you find him hearty and in earnest marry him I gave him a look full of horror at those words and turning pale as death was at the very point of sinking down out of the chair I sat in when giving a start My dear says he aloud what s the matter with you Where are you a going and a great many such things and with jogging and called to me fetched me a little to myself though it was a good while before I fully recovered my senses and was not able to speak for several minutes more When I was fully recovered he began again My dear says he what made you so surprised at what I said I would have you consider seriously of it You may see plainly how the family stand in this case and they would be stark mad if it was my case as it is my brother s and for aught I see it would be my ruin and yours too Ay says I still speaking angrily are all your protestations and vows to be shaken by the dislike of the family Did I not always object that to you and you made light thing of it as what you were above and would value and is it come to this now said I Is this your faith and honour your love and the solidity of your promises He continued perfectly calm notwithstanding all my reproaches and I was not sparing of them at all but he replied at last My dear I have not broken one promise with you yet I did tell you I would marry you when I was come to my estate but you see my father is a hale healthy man and may live these thirty years still and not be older than several are round us in town and you never proposed my marrying you sooner because you knew it might be my ruin and as to all the rest I have not failed you in anything you have wanted for nothing I could not deny a word of this and had nothing to say to it in general But why then says I can you persuade me to such a horrid step as leaving you since you have not left me Will you allow no affection no love on my side where there has been so much on your side Have I made you no returns Have I given no testimony of my sincerity and of my passion Are the sacrifices I have made of honour and modesty to you no proof of my being tied to you in bonds too strong to be broken But here my dear says he you may come into a safe station and appear with honour and with splendour at once and the remembrance of what we have done may be wrapt up in an eternal silence as if it had never happened you shall always have my respect and my sincere affection only then it shall be honest and perfectly just to my brother you shall be my dear sister as now you are my dear and there he stopped Your dear whore says I you would have said if you had gone on and you might as well have said it but I understand you However I desire you to remember the long discourses you have had with me and the many hours pains you have taken to persuade me to believe myself an honest woman that I was your wife intentionally though not in the eyes of the world and that it was as effectual a marriage that had passed between us as is we had been publicly wedded by the parson of the parish You know and cannot but remember that these have been your own words to me I found this was a little too close upon him but I made it up in what follows He stood stock still for a while and said nothing and I went on thus You cannot says I without the highest injustice believe that I yielded upon all these persuasions without a love not to be questioned not to be shaken again by anything that could happen afterward If you have such dishonourable thoughts of me I must ask you what foundation in any of my behaviour have I given for such a suggestion If then I have yielded to the importunities of my affection and if I have been persuaded to believe that I am really and in the essence of the thing your wife shall I now give the lie to all those arguments and call myself your whore or mistress which is the same thing And will you transfer me to your brother Can you transfer my affection Can you bid me cease loving you and bid me love him It is in my power think you to make such a change at demand No sir said I depend upon it tis impossible and whatever the change of your side may be I will ever be true and I had much rather since it is come that unhappy length be your whore than your brother s wife He appeared pleased and touched with the impression of this last discourse and told me that he stood where he did before that he had not been unfaithful to me in any one promise he had ever made yet but that there were so many terrible things presented themselves to his view in the affair before me and that on my account in particular that he had thought of the other as a remedy so effectual as nothing could come up to it That he thought this would not be entire parting us but we might love as friends all our days and perhaps with more satisfaction than we should in the station we were now in as things might happen that he durst say I could not apprehend anything from him as to betraying a secret which could not but be the destruction of us both if it came out that he had but one question to ask of me that could lie in the way of it and if that question was answered in the negative he could not but think still it was the only step I could take I guessed at his question presently namely whether I was sure I was not with child As to that I told him he need not be concerned about it for I was not with child Why then my dear says he we have no time to talk further now Consider of it and think closely about it I cannot but be of the opinion still that it will be the best course you can take And with this he took his leave and the more hastily too his mother and sisters ringing at the gate just at the moment that he had risen up to go He left me in the utmost confusion of thought and he easily perceived it the next day and all the rest of the week for it was but Tuesday evening when we talked but he had no opportunity to come at me all that week till the Sunday after when I being indisposed did not go to church and he making some excuse for the like stayed at home And now he had me an hour and a half again by myself and we fell into the same arguments all over again or at least so near the same as it would be to no purpose to repeat them At last I asked him warmly what opinion he must have of my modesty that he could suppose I should so much as entertain a thought of lying with two brothers and assured him it could never be I added if he was to tell me that he would never see me more than which nothing but death could be more terrible yet I could never entertain a thought so dishonourable to myself and so base to him and therefore I entreated him if he had one grain of respect or affection left for me that he would speak no more of it to me or that he would pull his sword out and kill me He appeared surprised at my obstinacy as he called it told me I was unkind to myself and unkind to him in it that it was a crisis unlooked for upon us both and impossible for either of us to foresee but that he did not see any other way to save us both from ruin and therefore he thought it the more unkind but that if he must say no more of it to me he added with an unusual coldness that he did not know anything else we had to talk of and so he rose up to take his leave I rose up too as if with the same indifference but when he came to give me as it were a parting kiss I burst out into such a passion of crying that though I would have spoke I could not and only pressing his hand seemed to give him the adieu but cried vehemently He was sensibly moved with this so he sat down again and said a great many kind things to me to abate the excess of my passion but still urged the necessity of what he had proposed all the while insisting that if I did refuse he would notwithstanding provide for me but letting me plainly see that he would decline me in the main point nay even as a mistress making it a point of honour not to lie with the woman that for aught he knew might come to be his brother s wife The bare loss of him as a gallant was not so much my affliction as the loss of his person whom indeed I loved to distraction and the loss of all the expectations I had and which I always had built my hopes upon of having him one day for my husband These things oppressed my mind so much that in short I fell very ill the agonies of my mind in a word threw me into a high fever and long it was that none in the family expected my life I was reduced very low indeed and was often delirious and light headed but nothing lay so near me as the fear that when I was light headed I should say something or other to his prejudice I was distressed in my mind also to see him and so he was to see me for he really loved me most passionately but it could not be there was not the least room to desire it on one side or other or so much as to make it decent It was near five weeks that I kept my bed and though the violence of my fever abated in three weeks yet it several times returned and the physicians said two or three times they could do no more for me but that they must leave nature and the distemper to fight it out only strengthening the first with cordials to maintain the struggle After the end of five weeks I grew better but was so weak so altered so melancholy and recovered so slowly that they physicians apprehended I should go into a consumption and which vexed me most they gave it as their opinion that my mind was oppressed that something troubled me and in short that I was in love Upon this the whole house was set upon me to examine me and to press me to tell whether I was in love or not and with whom but as I well might I denied my being in love at all They had on this occasion a squabble one day about me at table that had like to have put the whole family in an uproar and for some time did so They happened to be all at table but the father as for me I was ill and in my chamber At the beginning of the talk which was just as they had finished their dinner the old gentlewoman who had sent me somewhat to eat called her maid to go up and ask me if I would have any more but the maid brought down word I had not eaten half what she had sent me already Alas says the old lady that poor girl I am afraid she will never be well Well says the elder brother how should missus Betty be well They say she is in love I believe nothing of it says the old gentlewoman I don t know says the eldest sister what to say to it they have made such a rout about her being so handsome and so charming and I know not what and that in her hearing too that has turned the creature s head I believe and who knows what possessions may follow such doings For my part I don t know what to make of it Why sister you must acknowledge she is very handsome says the elder brother Ay and a great deal handsomer than you sister says Robin and that s your mortification Well well that is not the question says his sister that girl is well enough and she knows it well enough she need not be told of it to make her vain We are not talking of her being vain says the elder brother but of her being in love it may be she is in love with herself it seems my sisters think so I would she was in love with me says Robin I d quickly put her out of her pain What d ye mean by that son says the old lady how can you talk so Why madam says Robin again very honestly do you think I d let the poor girl die for love and of one that is near at hand to be had too Fie brother says the second sister how can you talk so Would you take a creature that has not a groat in the world Prithee child says Robin beauty s a portion and good humour with it is a double portion I wish thou hadst half her stock of both for thy portion So there was her mouth stopped I find says the eldest sister if Betty is not in love my brother is I wonder he has not broke his mind to Betty I warrant she won t say No They that yield when they re asked says Robin are one step before them that were never asked to yield sister and two steps before them that yield before they are asked and that s an answer to you sister This fired the sister and she flew into a passion and said things were come to that pass that it was time the wench meaning me was out of the family and but that she was not fit to be turned out she hoped her father and mother would consider of it as soon as she could be removed Robin replied that was business for the master and mistress of the family who where not to be taught by one that had so little judgment as his eldest sister It ran up a great deal farther the sister scolded Robin rallied and bantered but poor Betty lost ground by it extremely in the family I heard of it and I cried heartily and the old lady came up to me somebody having told her that I was so much concerned about it I complained to her that it was very hard the doctors should pass such a censure upon me for which they had no ground and that it was still harder considering the circumstances I was under in the family that I hoped I had done nothing to lessen her esteem for me or given any occasion for the bickering between her sons and daughters and I had more need to think of a coffin than of being in love and begged she would not let me suffer in her opinion for anybody s mistakes but my own She was sensible of the justice of what I said but told me since there had been such a clamour among them and that her younger son talked after such a rattling way as he did she desired I would be so faithful to her as to answer her but one question sincerely I told her I would with all my heart and with the utmost plainness and sincerity Why then the question was whether there way anything between her son Robert and me I told her with all the protestations of sincerity that I was able to make and as I might well do that there was not nor every had been I told her that mister Robert had rattled and jested as she knew it was his way and that I took it always as I supposed he meant it to be a wild airy way of discourse that had no signification in it and again assured her that there was not the least tittle of what she understood by it between us and that those who had suggested it had done me a great deal of wrong and mister Robert no service at all The old lady was fully satisfied and kissed me spoke cheerfully to me and bid me take care of my health and want for nothing and so took her leave But when she came down she found the brother and all his sisters together by the ears they were angry even to passion at his upbraiding them with their being homely and having never had any sweethearts never having been asked the question and their being so forward as almost to ask first He rallied them upon the subject of missus Betty how pretty how good humoured how she sung better then they did and danced better and how much handsomer she was and in doing this he omitted no ill natured thing that could vex them and indeed pushed too hard upon them The old lady came down in the height of it and to put a stop it to told them all the discourse she had had with me and how I answered that there was nothing between mister Robert and I She s wrong there says Robin for if there was not a great deal between us we should be closer together than we are I told her I loved her hugely says he but I could never make the jade believe I was in earnest I do not know how you should says his mother nobody in their senses could believe you were in earnest to talk so to a poor girl whose circumstances you know so well But prithee son adds she since you tell me that you could not make her believe you were in earnest what must we believe about it For you ramble so in your discourse that nobody knows whether you are in earnest or in jest but as I find the girl by your own confession has answered truly I wish you would do so too and tell me seriously so that I may depend upon it Is there anything in it or no Are you in earnest or no Are you distracted indeed or are you not Tis a weighty question and I wish you would make us easy about it By my faith madam says Robin tis in vain to mince the matter or tell any more lies about it I am in earnest as much as a man is that s going to be hanged If missus Betty would say she loved me and that she would marry me I d have her tomorrow morning fasting and say To have and to hold instead of eating my breakfast Well says the mother then there s one son lost and she said it in a very mournful tone as one greatly concerned at it I hope not madam says Robin no man is lost when a good wife has found him Why but child says the old lady she is a beggar Why then madam she has the more need of charity says Robin I ll take her off the hands of the parish and she and I ll beg together It s bad jesting with such things says the mother I don t jest madam says Robin We ll come and beg your pardon madam and your blessing madam and my father s This is all out of the way son says the mother If you are in earnest you are undone I am afraid not says he for I am really afraid she won t have me after all my sister s huffing and blustering I believe I shall never be able to persuade her to it That s a fine tale indeed she is not so far out of her senses neither missus Betty is no fool says the younger sister Do you think she has learnt to say No any more than other people No missus Mirth wit says Robin missus Betty s no fool but missus Betty may be engaged some other way and what then Nay says the eldest sister we can say nothing to that Who must it be to then She is never out of the doors it must be between you I have nothing to say to that says Robin I have been examined enough there s my brother If it must be between us go to work with him This stung the elder brother to the quick and he concluded that Robin had discovered something However he kept himself from appearing disturbed Prithee says he don t go to shame your stories off upon me I tell you I deal in no such ware I have nothing to say to missus Betty nor to any of the missus Bettys in the parish and with that he rose up and brushed off No says the eldest sister I dare answer for my brother he knows the world better Thus the discourse ended but it left the elder brother quite confounded He concluded his brother had made a full discovery and he began to doubt whether I had been concerned in it or not but with all his management he could not bring it about to get at me At last he was so perplexed that he was quite desperate and resolved he would come into my chamber and see me whatever came of it In order to do this he contrived it so that one day after dinner watching his eldest sister till he could see her go upstairs he runs after her Hark ye sister says he where is this sick woman May not a body see her Yes says the sister I believe you may but let me go first a little and I ll tell you So she ran up to the door and gave me notice and presently called to him again Brother says she you may come if you please So in he came just in the same kind of rant Well says he at the door as he came in where is this sick body that s in love How do ye do missus Betty I would have got up out of my chair but was so weak I could not for a good while and he saw it and his sister to and she said Come do not strive to stand up my brother desires no ceremony especially now you are so weak No no missus Betty pray sit still says he and so sits himself down in a chair over against me and appeared as if he was mighty merry He talked a lot of rambling stuff to his sister and to me sometimes of one thing sometimes of another on purpose to amuse his sister and every now and then would turn it upon the old story directing it to me Poor missus Betty says he it is a sad thing to be in love why it has reduced you sadly At last I spoke a little I am glad to see you so merry sir says I but I think the doctor might have found something better to do than to make his game at his patients If I had been ill of no other distemper I know the proverb too well to have let him come to me What proverb says he Oh I remember it now What Where love is the case The doctor s an ass Is not that it missus Betty I smiled and said nothing Nay says he I think the effect has proved it to be love for it seems the doctor has been able to do you but little service you mend very slowly they say I doubt there s somewhat in it missus Betty I doubt you are sick of the incurables and that is love I smiled and said No indeed sir that s none of my distemper We had a deal of such discourse and sometimes others that signified as little By and by he asked me to sing them a song at which I smiled and said my singing days were over At last he asked me if he should play upon his flute to me his sister said she believe it would hurt me and that my head could not bear it I bowed and said No it would not hurt me And pray madam said I do not hinder it I love the music of the flute very much Then his sister said Well do then brother With that he pulled out the key of his closet Dear sister says he I am very lazy do step to my closet and fetch my flute it lies in such a drawer naming a place where he was sure it was not that she might be a little while a looking for it As soon as she was gone he related the whole story to me of the discourse his brother had about me and of his pushing it at him and his concern about it which was the reason of his contriving this visit to me I assured him I had never opened my mouth either to his brother or to anybody else I told him the dreadful exigence I was in that my love to him and his offering to have me forget that affection and remove it to another had thrown me down and that I had a thousand times wished I might die rather than recover and to have the same circumstances to struggle with as I had before and that his backwardness to life had been the great reason of the slowness of my recovering I added that I foresaw that as soon as I was well I must quit the family and that as for marrying his brother I abhorred the thoughts of it after what had been my case with him and that he might depend upon it I would never see his brother again upon that subject that if he would break all his vows and oaths and engagements with me be that between his conscience and his honour and himself but he should never be able to say that I whom he had persuaded to call myself his wife and who had given him the liberty to use me as a wife was not as faithful to him as a wife ought to be whatever he might be to me He was going to reply and had said that he was sorry I could not be persuaded and was a going to say more but he heard his sister a coming and so did I and yet I forced out these few words as a reply that I could never be persuaded to love one brother and marry another He shook his head and said Then I am ruined meaning himself and that moment his sister entered the room and told him she could not find the flute Well says he merrily this laziness won t do so he gets up and goes himself to go to look for it but comes back without it too not but that he could have found it but because his mind was a little disturbed and he had no mind to play and besides the errand he sent his sister on was answered another way for he only wanted an opportunity to speak to me which he gained though not much to his satisfaction I had however a great deal of satisfaction in having spoken my mind to him with freedom and with such an honest plainness as I have related and though it did not at all work the way I desired that is to say to oblige the person to me the more yet it took from him all possibility of quitting me but by a downright breach of honour and giving up all the faith of a gentleman to me which he had so often engaged by never to abandon me but to make me his wife as soon as he came to his estate It was not many weeks after this before I was about the house again and began to grow well but I continued melancholy silent dull and retired which amazed the whole family except he that knew the reason of it yet it was a great while before he took any notice of it and I as backward to speak as he carried respectfully to him but never offered to speak a word to him that was particular of any kind whatsoever and this continued for sixteen or seventeen weeks so that as I expected every day to be dismissed the family on account of what distaste they had taken another way in which I had no guilt so I expected to hear no more of this gentleman after all his solemn vows and protestations but to be ruined and abandoned At last I broke the way myself in the family for my removing for being talking seriously with the old lady one day about my own circumstances in the world and how my distemper had left a heaviness upon my spirits that I was not the same thing I was before the old lady said I am afraid Betty what I have said to you about my son has had some influence upon you and that you are melancholy on his account pray will you let me know how the matter stands with you both if it may not be improper For as for Robin he does nothing but rally and banter when I speak of it to him Why truly madam said I that matter stands as I wish it did not and I shall be very sincere with you in it whatever befalls me for it mister Robert has several times proposed marriage to me which is what I had no reason to expect my poor circumstances considered but I have always resisted him and that perhaps in terms more positive than became me considering the regard that I ought to have for every branch of your family but said I madam I could never so far forget my obligation to you and all your house to offer to consent to a thing which I know must needs be disobliging to you and this I have made my argument to him and have positively told him that I would never entertain a thought of that kind unless I had your consent and his father s also to whom I was bound by so many invincible obligations And is this possible missus Betty says the old lady Then you have been much juster to us than we have been to you for we have all looked upon you as a kind of snare to my son and I had a proposal to make to you for your removing for fear of it but I had not yet mentioned it to you because I thought you were not thorough well and I was afraid of grieving you too much lest it should throw you down again for we have all a respect for you still though not so much as to have it be the ruin of my son but if it be as you say we have all wronged you very much As to the truth of what I say madam said I refer you to your son himself if he will do me any justice he must tell you the story just as I have told it Away goes the old lady to her daughters and tells them the whole story just as I had told it her and they were surprised at it you may be sure as I believed they would be One said she could never have thought it another said Robin was a fool a third said she would not believe a word of it and she would warrant that Robin would tell the story another way But the old gentlewoman who was resolved to go to the bottom of it before I could have the least opportunity of acquainting her son with what had passed resolved too that she would talk with her son immediately and to that purpose sent for him for he was gone but to a lawyer s house in the town upon some petty business of his own and upon her sending he returned immediately Upon his coming up to them for they were all still together Sit down Robin says the old lady I must have some talk with you With all my heart madam says Robin looking very merry I hope it is about a good wife for I am at a great loss in that affair How can that be says his mother did not you say you resolved to have missus Betty Ay madam says Robin but there is one has forbid the banns Forbid the banns says his mother who can that be Even missus Betty herself says Robin How so says his mother Have you asked her the question then Yes indeed madam says Robin I have attacked her in form five times since she was sick and am beaten off the jade is so stout she won t capitulate nor yield upon any terms except such as I cannot effectually grant Explain yourself says the mother for I am surprised I do not understand you I hope you are not in earnest Why madam says he the case is plain enough upon me it explains itself she won t have me she says is not that plain enough I think tis plain and pretty rough too Well but says the mother you talk of conditions that you cannot grant what does she want a settlement Her jointure ought to be according to her portion but what fortune does she bring you Nay as to fortune says Robin she is rich enough I am satisfied in that point but tis I that am not able to come up to her terms and she is positive she will not have me without Here the sisters put in Madam says the second sister tis impossible to be serious with him he will never give a direct answer to anything you had better let him alone and talk no more of it to him you know how to dispose of her out of his way if you thought there was anything in it Robin was a little warmed with his sister s rudeness but he was even with her and yet with good manners too There are two sorts of people madam says he turning to his mother that there is no contending with that is a wise body and a fool tis a little hard I should engage with both of them together The younger sister then put in We must be fools indeed says she in my brother s opinion that he should think we can believe he has seriously asked missus Betty to marry him and that she has refused him Answer and answer not say Solomon replied her brother When your brother had said to your mother that he had asked her no less than five times and that it was so that she positively denied him methinks a younger sister need not question the truth of it when her mother did not My mother you see did not understand it says the second sister There s some difference says Robin between desiring me to explain it and telling me she did not believe it Well but son says the old lady if you are disposed to let us into the mystery of it what were these hard conditions Yes madam says Robin I had done it before now if the teasers here had not worried my by way of interruption The conditions are that I bring my father and you to consent to it and without that she protests she will never see me more upon that head and to these conditions as I said I suppose I shall never be able to grant I hope my warm sisters will be answered now and blush a little if not I have no more to say till I hear further This answer was surprising to them all though less to the mother because of what I had said to her As to the daughters they stood mute a great while but the mother said with some passion Well I had heard this before but I could not believe it but if it is so they we have all done Betty wrong and she has behaved better than I ever expected Nay says the eldest sister if it be so she has acted handsomely indeed I confess says the mother it was none of her fault if he was fool enough to take a fancy to her but to give such an answer to him shows more respect to your father and me than I can tell how to express I shall value the girl the better for it as long as I know her But I shall not says Robin unless you will give your consent I ll consider of that a while says the mother I assure you if there were not some other objections in the way this conduct of hers would go a great way to bring me to consent I wish it would go quite through it says Robin if you had a much thought about making me easy as you have about making me rich you would soon consent to it Why Robin says the mother again are you really in earnest Would you so fain have her as you pretend Really madam says Robin I think tis hard you should question me upon that head after all I have said I won t say that I will have her how can I resolve that point when you see I cannot have her without your consent Besides I am not bound to marry at all But this I will say I am in earnest in that I will never have anybody else if I can help it so you may determine for me Betty or nobody is the word and the question which of the two shall be in your breast to decide madam provided only that my good humoured sisters here may have no vote in it All this was dreadful to me for the mother began to yield and Robin pressed her home on it On the other hand she advised with the eldest son and he used all the arguments in the world to persuade her to consent alleging his brother s passionate love for me and my generous regard to the family in refusing my own advantages upon such a nice point of honour and a thousand such things And as to the father he was a man in a hurry of public affairs and getting money seldom at home thoughtful of the main chance but left all those things to his wife You may easily believe that when the plot was thus as they thought broke out and that every one thought they knew how things were carried it was not so difficult or so dangerous for the elder brother whom nobody suspected of anything to have a freer access to me than before nay the mother which was just as he wished proposed it to him to talk with missus Betty For it may be son said she you may see farther into the thing than I and see if you think she has been so positive as Robin says she has been or no This was as well as he could wish and he as it were yielding to talk with me at his mother s request she brought me to him into her own chamber told me her son had some business with me at her request and desired me to be very sincere with him and then she left us together and he went and shut the door after her He came back to me and took me in his arms and kissed me very tenderly but told me he had a long discourse to hold with me and it was not come to that crisis that I should make myself happy or miserable as long as I lived that the thing was now gone so far that if I could not comply with his desire we would both be ruined Then he told the whole story between Robin as he called him and his mother and sisters and himself as it is above And now dear child says he consider what it will be to marry a gentleman of a good family in good circumstances and with the consent of the whole house and to enjoy all that he world can give you and what on the other hand to be sunk into the dark circumstances of a woman that has lost her reputation and that though I shall be a private friend to you while I live yet as I shall be suspected always so you will be afraid to see me and I shall be afraid to own you He gave me no time to reply but went on with me thus What has happened between us child so long as we both agree to do so may be buried and forgotten I shall always be your sincere friend without any inclination to nearer intimacy when you become my sister and we shall have all the honest part of conversation without any reproaches between us of having done amiss I beg of you to consider it and to not stand in the way of your own safety and prosperity and to satisfy you that I am sincere added he I here offer you five hundred in money to make you some amends for the freedoms I have taken with you which we shall look upon as some of the follies of our lives which tis hoped we may repent of He spoke this in so much more moving terms than it is possible for me to express and with so much greater force of argument than I can repeat that I only recommend it to those who read the story to suppose that as he held me above an hour and a half in that discourse so he answered all my objections and fortified his discourse with all the arguments that human wit and art could devise I cannot say however that anything he said made impression enough upon me so as to give me any thought of the matter till he told me at last very plainly that if I refused he was sorry to add that he could never go on with me in that station as we stood before that though he loved me as well as ever and that I was as agreeable to him as ever yet sense of virtue had not so far forsaken him as to suffer him to lie with a woman that his brother courted to make his wife and if he took his leave of me with a denial in this affair whatever he might do for me in the point of support grounded on his first engagement of maintaining me yet he would not have me be surprised that he was obliged to tell me he could not allow himself to see me any more and that indeed I could not expect it of him I received this last part with some token of surprise and disorder and had much ado to avoid sinking down for indeed I loved him to an extravagance not easy to imagine but he perceived my disorder He entreated me to consider seriously of it assured me that it was the only way to preserve our mutual affection that in this station we might love as friends with the utmost passion and with a love of relation untainted free from our just reproaches and free from other people s suspicions that he should ever acknowledge his happiness owing to me that he would be debtor to me as long as he lived and would be paying that debt as long as he had breath Thus he wrought me up in short to a kind of hesitation in the matter having the dangers on one side represented in lively figures and indeed heightened by my imagination of being turned out to the wide world a mere cast off whore for it was no less and perhaps exposed as such with little to provide for myself with no friend no acquaintance in the whole world out of that town and there I could not pretend to stay All this terrified me to the last degree and he took care upon all occasions to lay it home to me in the worst colours that it could be possible to be drawn in On the other hand he failed not to set forth the easy prosperous life which I was going to live He answered all that I could object from affection and from former engagements with telling me the necessity that was before us of taking other measures now and as to his promises of marriage the nature of things he said had put an end to that by the probability of my being his brother s wife before the time to which his promises all referred Thus in a word I may say he reasoned me out of my reason he conquered all my arguments and I began to see a danger that I was in which I had not considered of before and that was of being dropped by both of them and left alone in the world to shift for myself This and his persuasion at length prevailed with me to consent though with so much reluctance that it was easy to see I should go to church like a bear to the stake I had some little apprehensions about me too lest my new spouse who by the way I had not the least affection for should be skillful enough to challenge me on another account upon our first coming to bed together But whether he did it with design or not I know not but his elder brother took care to make him very much fuddled before he went to bed so that I had the satisfaction of a drunken bedfellow the first night How he did it I know not but I concluded that he certainly contrived it that his brother might be able to make no judgment of the difference between a maid and a married woman nor did he ever entertain any notions of it or disturb his thoughts about it I should go back a little here to where I left off The elder brother having thus managed me his next business was to manage his mother and he never left till he had brought her to acquiesce and be passive in the thing even without acquainting the father other than by post letters so that she consented to our marrying privately and leaving her to mange the father afterwards Then he cajoled with his brother and persuaded him what service he had done him and how he had brought his mother to consent which though true was not indeed done to serve him but to serve himself but thus diligently did he cheat him and had the thanks of a faithful friend for shifting off his whore into his brother s arms for a wife So certainly does interest banish all manner of affection and so naturally do men give up honour and justice humanity and even Christianity to secure themselves I must now come back to brother Robin as we always called him who having got his mother s consent as above came big with the news to me and told me the whole story of it with a sincerity so visible that I must confess it grieved me that I must be the instrument to abuse so honest a gentleman But there was no remedy he would have me and I was not obliged to tell him that I was his brother s whore though I had no other way to put him off so I came gradually into it to his satisfaction and behold we were married Modesty forbids me to reveal the secrets of the marriage bed but nothing could have happened more suitable to my circumstances than that as above my husband was so fuddled when he came to bed that he could not remember in the morning whether he had had any conversation with me or no and I was obliged to tell him he had though in reality he had not that I might be sure he could make to inquiry about anything else It concerns the story in hand very little to enter into the further particulars of the family or of myself for the five years that I lived with this husband only to observe that I had two children by him and that at the end of five years he died He had been really a very good husband to me and we lived very agreeably together but as he had not received much from them and had in the little time he lived acquired no great matters so my circumstances were not great nor was I much mended by the match Indeed I had preserved the elder brother s bonds to me to pay five hundred which he offered me for my consent to marry his brother and this with what I had saved of the money he formerly gave me about as much more by my husband left me a widow with about twelve hundred in my pocket My two children were indeed taken happily off my hands by my husband s father and mother and that by the way was all they got by missus Betty I confess I was not suitably affected with the loss of my husband nor indeed can I say that I ever loved him as I ought to have done or as was proportionable to the good usage I had from him for he was a tender kind good humoured man as any woman could desire but his brother being so always in my sight at least while we were in the country was a continual snare to me and I never was in bed with my husband but I wished myself in the arms of his brother and though his brother never offered me the least kindness that way after our marriage but carried it just as a brother out to do yet it was impossible for me to do so to him in short I committed adultery and incest with him every day in my desires which without doubt was as effectually criminal in the nature of the guilt as if I had actually done it Before my husband died his elder brother was married and we being then removed to London were written to by the old lady to come and be at the wedding My husband went but I pretended indisposition and that I could not possibly travel so I stayed behind for in short I could not bear the sight of his being given to another woman though I knew I was never to have him myself I was now as above left loose to the world and being still young and handsome as everybody said of me and I assure you I thought myself so and with a tolerable fortune in my pocket I put no small value upon myself I was courted by several very considerable tradesmen and particularly very warmly by one a linen draper at whose house after my husband s death I took a lodging his sister being my acquaintance Here I had all the liberty and all the opportunity to be gay and appear in company that I could desire my landlord s sister being one of the maddest gayest things alive and not so much mistress of her virtue as I thought as first she had been She brought me into a world of wild company and even brought home several persons such as she liked well enough to gratify to see her pretty widow so she was pleased to call me and that name I got in a little time in public Now as fame and fools make an assembly I was here wonderfully caressed had abundance of admirers and such as called themselves lovers but I found not one fair proposal among them all As for their common design that I understood too well to be drawn into any more snares of that kind The case was altered with me I had money in my pocket and had nothing to say to them I had been tricked once by that cheat called love but the game was over I was resolved now to be married or nothing and to be well married or not at all I loved the company indeed of men of mirth and wit men of gallantry and figure and was often entertained with such as I was also with others but I found by just observation that the brightest men came upon the dullest errand that is to say the dullest as to what I aimed at On the other hand those who came with the best proposals were the dullest and most disagreeable part of the world I was not averse to a tradesman but then I would have a tradesman forsooth that was something of a gentleman too that when my husband had a mind to carry me to the court or to the play he might become a sword and look as like a gentleman as another man and not be one that had the mark of his apron strings upon his coat or the mark of his hat upon his periwig that should look as if he was set on to his sword when his sword was put on to him and that carried his trade in his countenance Well at last I found this amphibious creature this land water thing called a gentleman tradesman and as a just plague upon my folly I was catched in the very snare which as I might say I laid for myself I said for myself for I was not trepanned I confess but I betrayed myself This was a draper too for though my comrade would have brought me to a bargain with her brother yet when it came to the point it was it seems for a mistress not a wife and I kept true to this notion that a woman should never be kept for a mistress that had money to keep herself Thus my pride not my principle my money not my virtue kept me honest though as it proved I found I had much better have been sold by my she comrade to her brother than have sold myself as I did to a tradesman that was rake gentleman shopkeeper and beggar all together But I was hurried on by my fancy to a gentleman to ruin myself in the grossest manner that every woman did for my new husband coming to a lump of money at once fell into such a profusion of expense that all I had and all he had before if he had anything worth mentioning would not have held it out above one year He was very fond of me for about a quarter of a year and what I got by that was that I had the pleasure of seeing a great deal of my money spent upon myself and as I may say had some of the spending it too Come my dear says he to me one day shall we go and take a turn into the country for about a week Ay my dear says I whither would you go I care not whither says he but I have a mind to look like quality for a week We ll go to Oxford says he How says I shall we go I am no horsewoman and tis too far for a coach Too far says he no place is too far for a coach and six If I carry you out you shall travel like a duchess Hum says I my dear tis a frolic but if you have a mind to it I don t care Well the time was appointed we had a rich coach very good horses a coachman postillion and two footmen in very good liveries a gentleman on horseback and a page with a feather in his hat upon another horse The servants all called him my lord and the inn keepers you may be sure did the like and I was her honour the Countess and thus we traveled to Oxford and a very pleasant journey we had for give him his due not a beggar alive knew better how to be a lord than my husband We saw all the rarities at Oxford talked with two or three Fellows of colleges about putting out a young nephew that was left to his lordship s care to the University and of their being his tutors We diverted ourselves with bantering several other poor scholars with hopes of being at least his lordship s chaplains and putting on a scarf and thus having lived like quality indeed as to expense we went away for Northampton and in a word in about twelve days ramble came home again to the tune of about ninety three expense Vanity is the perfection of a fop My husband had this excellence that he valued nothing of expense and as his history you may be sure has very little weight in it tis enough to tell you that in about two years and a quarter he broke and was not so happy to get over into the Mint but got into a sponging house being arrested in an action too heavy from him to give bail to so he sent for me to come to him It was no surprise to me for I had foreseen some time that all was going to wreck and had been taking care to reserve something if I could though it was not much for myself But when he sent for me he behaved much better than I expected and told me plainly he had played the fool and suffered himself to be surprised which he might have prevented that now he foresaw he could not stand it and therefore he would have me go home and in the night take away everything I had in the house of any value and secure it and after that he told me that if I could get away one hundred or two hundred pounds in goods out of the shop I should do it only says he let me know nothing of it neither what you take nor whither you carry it for as for me says he I am resolved to get out of this house and be gone and if you never hear of me more my dear says he I wish you well I am only sorry for the injury I have done you He said some very handsome things to me indeed at parting for I told you he was a gentleman and that was all the benefit I had of his being so that he used me very handsomely and with good manners upon all occasions even to the last only spent all I had and left me to rob the creditors for something to subsist on However I did as he bade me that you may be sure and having thus taken my leave of him I never saw him more for he found means to break out of the bailiff s house that night or the next and go over into France and for the rest of the creditors scrambled for it as well as they could How I knew not for I could come at no knowledge of anything more than this that he came home about three o clock in the morning caused the rest of his goods to be removed into the Mint and the shop to be shut up and having raised what money he could get together he got over as I said to France from whence I had one or two letters from him and no more I did not see him when he came home for he having given me such instructions as above and I having made the best of my time I had no more business back again at the house not knowing but I might have been stopped there by the creditors for a commission of bankrupt being soon after issued they might have stopped me by orders from the commissioners But my husband having so dexterously got out of the bailiff s house by letting himself down in a most desperate manner from almost the top of the house to the top of another building and leaping from thence which was almost two storeys and which was enough indeed to have broken his neck he came home and got away his goods before the creditors could come to seize that is to say before they could get out the commission and be ready to send their officers to take possession My husband was so civil to me for still I say he was much of a gentleman that in the first letter he wrote me from France he let me know where he had pawned twenty pieces of fine holland for thirty which were really worth ninety and enclosed me the token and an order for the taking them up paying the money which I did and made in time above one hundred of them having leisure to cut them and sell them some and some to private families as opportunity offered However with all this and all that I had secured before I found upon casting things up my case was very much altered any my fortune much lessened for including the hollands and a parcel of fine muslins which I carried off before and some plate and other things I found I could hardly muster up five hundred and my condition was very odd for though I had no child I had had one by my gentleman draper but it was buried yet I was a widow bewitched I had a husband and no husband and I could not pretend to marry again though I knew well enough my husband would never see England any more if he lived fifty years Thus I say I was limited from marriage what offer might soever be made me and I had not one friend to advise with in the condition I was in least not one I durst trust the secret of my circumstances to for if the commissioners were to have been informed where I was I should have been fetched up and examined upon oath and all I have saved be taken away from me Upon these apprehensions the first thing I did was to go quite out of my knowledge and go by another name This I did effectually for I went into the Mint too took lodgings in a very private place dressed up in the habit of a widow and called myself missus Flanders Here however I concealed myself and though my new acquaintances knew nothing of me yet I soon got a great deal of company about me and whether it be that women are scarce among the sorts of people that generally are to be found there or that some consolations in the miseries of the place are more requisite than on other occasions I soon found an agreeable woman was exceedingly valuable among the sons of affliction there and that those that wanted money to pay half a crown on the pound to their creditors and that run in debt at the sign of the Bull for their dinners would yet find money for a supper if they liked the woman However I kept myself safe yet though I began like my Lord Rochester s mistress that loved his company but would not admit him farther to have the scandal of a whore without the joy and upon this score tired with the place and indeed with the company too I began to think of removing It was indeed a subject of strange reflection to me to see men who were overwhelmed in perplexed circumstances who were reduced some degrees below being ruined whose families were objects of their own terror and other people s charity yet while a penny lasted nay even beyond it endeavouring to drown themselves labouring to forget former things which now it was the proper time to remember making more work for repentance and sinning on as a remedy for sin past But it is none of my talent to preach these men were too wicked even for me There was something horrid and absurd in their way of sinning for it was all a force even upon themselves they did not only act against conscience but against nature they put a rape upon their temper to drown the reflections which their circumstances continually gave them and nothing was more easy than to see how sighs would interrupt their songs and paleness and anguish sit upon their brows in spite of the forced smiles they put on nay sometimes it would break out at their very mouths when they had parted with their money for a lewd treat or a wicked embrace I have heard them turning about fetch a deep sigh and cry What a dog am I Well Betty my dear I ll drink thy health though meaning the honest wife that perhaps had not a half crown for herself and three or four children The next morning they are at their penitentials again and perhaps the poor weeping wife comes over to him either brings him some account of what his creditors are doing and how she and the children are turned out of doors or some other dreadful news and this adds to his self reproaches but when he has thought and pored on it till he is almost mad having no principles to support him nothing within him or above him to comfort him but finding it all darkness on every side he flies to the same relief again viz to drink it away debauch it away and falling into company of men in just the same condition with himself he repeats the crime and thus he goes every day one step onward of his way to destruction I was not wicked enough for such fellows as these yet On the contrary I began to consider here very seriously what I had to do how things stood with me and what course I ought to take I knew I had no friends no not one friend or relation in the world and that little I had left apparently wasted which when it was gone I saw nothing but misery and starving was before me Upon these considerations I say and filled with horror at the place I was in and the dreadful objects which I had always before me I resolved to be gone I had made an acquaintance with a very sober good sort of a woman who was a widow too like me but in better circumstances Her husband had been a captain of a merchant ship and having had the misfortune to be cast away coming home on a voyage from the West Indies which would have been very profitable if he had come safe was so reduced by the loss that though he had saved his life then it broke his heart and killed him afterwards and his widow being pursued by the creditors was forced to take shelter in the Mint She soon made things up with the help of friends and was at liberty again and finding that I rather was there to be concealed than by any particular prosecutions and finding also that I agreed with her or rather she with me in a just abhorrence of the place and of the company she invited to go home with her till I could put myself in some posture of settling in the world to my mind withal telling me that it was ten to one but some good captain of a ship might take a fancy to me and court me in that part of the town where she lived I accepted her offer and was with her half a year and should have been longer but in that interval what she proposed to me happened to herself and she married very much to her advantage But whose fortune soever was upon the increase mine seemed to be upon the wane and I found nothing present except two or three boatswains or such fellows but as for the commanders they were generally of two sorts one Such as having good business that is to say a good ship resolved not to marry but with advantage that is with a good fortune two Such as being out of employ wanted a wife to help them to a ship I mean one a wife who having some money could enable them to hold as they call it a good part of a ship themselves so to encourage owners to come in or two a wife who if she had not money had friends who were concerned in shipping and so could help to put the young man into a good ship which to them is as good as a portion and neither of these was my case so I looked like one that was to lie on hand This knowledge I soon learned by experience viz that the state of things was altered as to matrimony and that I was not to expect at London what I had found in the country that marriages were here the consequences of politic schemes for forming interests and carrying on business and that Love had no share or but very little in the matter That as my sister in law at Colchester had said beauty wit manners sense good humour good behaviour education virtue piety or any other qualification whether of body or mind had no power to recommend that money only made a woman agreeable that men chose mistresses indeed by the gust of their affection and it was requisite to a whore to be handsome well shaped have a good mien and a graceful behaviour but that for a wife no deformity would shock the fancy no ill qualities the judgment the money was the thing the portion was neither crooked nor monstrous but the money was always agreeable whatever the wife was On the other hand as the market ran very unhappily on the men s side I found the women had lost the privilege of saying No that it was a favour now for a woman to have the Question asked and if any young lady had so much arrogance as to counterfeit a negative she never had the opportunity given her of denying twice much less of recovering that false step and accepting what she had but seemed to decline The men had such choice everywhere that the case of the women was very unhappy for they seemed to ply at every door and if the man was by great chance refused at one house he was sure to be received at the next Besides this I observed that the men made no scruple to set themselves out and to go a fortunehunting as they call it when they had really no fortune themselves to demand it or merit to deserve it and that they carried it so high that a woman was scarce allowed to inquire after the character or estate of the person that pretended to her This I had an example of in a young lady in the next house to me and with whom I had contracted an intimacy she was courted by a young captain and though she had near two thousand to her fortune she did but inquire of some of his neighbours about his character his morals or substance and he took occasion at the next visit to let her know truly that he took it very ill and that he should not give her the trouble of his visits any more I heard of it and I had begun my acquaintance with her I went to see her upon it She entered into a close conversation with me about it and unbosomed herself very freely I perceived presently that though she thought herself very ill used yet she had no power to resent it and was exceedingly piqued that she had lost him and particularly that another of less fortune had gained him I fortified her mind against such a meanness as I called it I told her that as low as I was in the world I would have despised a man that should think I ought to take him upon his own recommendation only without having the liberty to inform myself of his fortune and of his character also I told her that as she had a good fortune she had no need to stoop to the disaster of the time that it was enough that the men could insult us that had but little money to recommend us but if she suffered such an affront to pass upon her without resenting it she would be rendered low prized upon all occasions and would be the contempt of all the women in that part of the town that a woman can never want an opportunity to be revenged of a man that has used her ill and that there were ways enough to humble such a fellow as that or else certainly women were the most unhappy creatures in the world I found she was very well pleased with the discourse and she told me seriously that she would be very glad to make him sensible of her just resentment and either to bring him on again or have the satisfaction of her revenge being as public as possible I told her that if she would take my advice I would tell her how she should obtain her wishes in both those things and that I would engage I would bring the man to her door again and make him beg to be let in She smiled at that and soon let me see that if he came to her door her resentment was not so great as to give her leave to let him stand long there However she listened very willingly to my offer of advice so I told her that the first thing she ought to do was a piece of justice to herself namely that whereas she had been told by several people that he had reported among the ladies that he had left her and pretended to give the advantage of the negative to himself she should take care to have it well spread among the women which she could not fail of an opportunity to do in a neighbourhood so addicted to family news as that she live in was that she had inquired into his circumstances and found he was not the man as to estate he pretended to be Let them be told madam said I that you had been well informed that he was not the man that you expected and that you thought it was not safe to meddle with him that you heard he was of an ill temper and that he boasted how he had used the women ill upon many occasions and that particularly he was debauched in his morals et cetera The last of which indeed had some truth in it but at the same time I did not find that she seemed to like him much the worse for that part As I had put this into her head she came most readily into it Immediately she went to work to find instruments and she had very little difficulty in the search for telling her story in general to a couple of gossips in the neighbourhood it was the chat of the tea table all over that part of the town and I met with it wherever I visited also as it was known that I was acquainted with the young lady herself my opinion was asked very often and I confirmed it with all the necessary aggravations and set out his character in the blackest colours but then as a piece of secret intelligence I added as what the other gossips knew nothing of viz that I had heard he was in very bad circumstances that he was under a necessity of a fortune to support his interest with the owners of the ship he commanded that his own part was not paid for and if it was not paid quickly his owners would put him out of the ship and his chief mate was likely to command it who offered to buy that part which the captain had promised to take I added for I confess I was heartily piqued at the rogue as I called him that I had heard a rumour too that he had a wife alive at Plymouth and another in the West Indies a thing which they all knew was not very uncommon for such kind of gentlemen This worked as we both desire it for presently the young lady next door who had a father and mother that governed both her and her fortune was shut up and her father forbid him the house Also in one place more where he went the woman had the courage however strange it was to say No and he could try nowhere but he was reproached with his pride and that he pretended not to give the women leave to inquire into his character and the like Well by this time he began to be sensible of his mistake and having alarmed all the women on that side of the water he went over to Ratcliff and got access to some of the ladies there but though the young women there too were according to the fate of the day pretty willing to be asked yet such was his ill luck that his character followed him over the water and his good name was much the same there as it was on our side so that though he might have had wives enough yet it did not happen among the women that had good fortunes which was what he wanted But this was not all she very ingeniously managed another thing herself for she got a young gentleman who as a relation and was indeed a married man to come and visit her two or three times a week in a very fine chariot and good liveries and her two agents and I also presently spread a report all over that this gentleman came to court her that he was a gentleman of a one thousand a year and that he was fallen in love with her and that she was going to her aunt s in the city because it was inconvenient for the gentleman to come to her with his coach in Redriff the streets being so narrow and difficult This took immediately The captain was laughed at in all companies and was ready to hang himself He tried all the ways possible to come at her again and wrote the most passionate letters to her in the world excusing his former rashness and in short by great application obtained leave to wait on her again as he said to clear his reputation At this meeting she had her full revenge of him for she told him she wondered what he took her to be that she should admit any man to a treaty of so much consequence as that to marriage without inquiring very well into his circumstances that if he thought she was to be huffed into wedlock and that she was in the same circumstances which her neighbours might be in viz to take up with the first good Christian that came he was mistaken that in a word his character was really bad or he was very ill beholden to his neighbours and that unless he could clear up some points in which she had justly been prejudiced she had no more to say to him but to do herself justice and give him the satisfaction of knowing that she was not afraid to say No either to him or any man else With that she told him what she had heard or rather raised herself by my means of his character his not having paid for the part he pretended to own of the ship he commanded of the resolution of his owners to put him out of the command and to put his mate in his stead and of the scandal raised on his morals his having been reproached with such and such women and having a wife at Plymouth and in the West Indies and the like and she asked him whether he could deny that she had good reason if these things were not cleared up to refuse him and in the meantime to insist upon having satisfaction in points to significant as they were He was so confounded at her discourse that he could not answer a word and she almost began to believe that all was true by his disorder though at the same time she knew that she had been the raiser of all those reports herself After some time he recovered himself a little and from that time became the most humble the most modest and most importunate man alive in his courtship She carried her jest on a great way She asked him if he thought she was so at her last shift that she could or ought to bear such treatment and if he did not see that she did not want those who thought it worth their while to come farther to her than he did meaning the gentleman whom she had brought to visit her by way of sham She brought him by these tricks to submit to all possible measures to satisfy her as well of his circumstances as of his behaviour He brought her undeniable evidence of his having paid for his part of the ship he brought her certificates from his owners that the report of their intending to remove him from the command of the ship and put his chief mate in was false and groundless in short he was quite the reverse of what he was before Thus I convinced her that if the men made their advantage of our sex in the affair of marriage upon the supposition of there being such choice to be had and of the women being so easy it was only owing to this that the women wanted courage to maintain their ground and to play their part and that according to my Lord Rochester A woman s ne er so ruined but she can Revenge herself on her undoer Man After these things this young lady played her part so well that though she resolved to have him and that indeed having him was the main bent of her design yet she made his obtaining her be to him the most difficult thing in the world and this she did not by a haughty reserved carriage but by a just policy turning the tables upon him and playing back upon him his own game for as he pretended by a kind of lofty carriage to place himself above the occasion of a character and to make inquiring into his character a kind of an affront to him she broke with him upon that subject and at the same time that she make him submit to all possible inquiry after his affairs she apparently shut the door against his looking into her own It was enough to him to obtain her for a wife As to what she had she told him plainly that as he knew her circumstances it was but just she should know his and though at the same time he had only known her circumstances by common fame yet he had made so many protestations of his passion for her that he could ask no more but her hand to his grand request and the like ramble according to the custom of lovers In short he left himself no room to ask any more questions about her estate and she took the advantage of it like a prudent woman for she placed part of her fortune so in trustees without letting him know anything of it that it was quite out of his reach and made him be very well content with the rest It is true she was pretty well besides that is to say she had about fourteen hundred in money which she gave him and the other after some time she brought to light as a perquisite to herself which he was to accept as a mighty favour seeing though it was not to be his it might ease him in the article of her particular expenses and I must add that by this conduct the gentleman himself became not only the more humble in his applications to her to obtain her but also was much the more an obliging husband to her when he had her I cannot but remind the ladies here how much they place themselves below the common station of a wife which if I may be allowed not to be partial is low enough already I say they place themselves below their common station and prepare their own mortifications by their submitting so to be insulted by the men beforehand which I confess I see no necessity of This relation may serve therefore to let the ladies see that the advantage is not so much on the other side as the men think it is and though it may be true that the men have but too much choice among us and that some women may be found who will dishonour themselves be cheap and easy to come at and will scarce wait to be asked yet if they will have women as I may say worth having they may find them as uncomeatable as ever and that those that are otherwise are a sort of people that have such deficiencies when had as rather recommend the ladies that are difficult than encourage the men to go on with their easy courtship and expect wives equally valuable that will come at first call Nothing is more certain than that the ladies always gain of the men by keeping their ground and letting their pretended lovers see they can resent being slighted and that they are not afraid of saying No They I observe insult us mightily with telling us of the number of women that the wars and the sea and trade and other incidents have carried the men so much away that there is no proportion between the numbers of the sexes and therefore the women have the disadvantage but I am far from granting that the number of women is so great or the number of men so small but if they will have me tell the truth the disadvantage of the women is a terrible scandal upon the men and it lies here and here only namely that the age is so wicked and the sex so debauched that in short the number of such men as an honest woman ought to meddle with is small indeed and it is but here and there that a man is to be found who is fit for a woman to venture upon But the consequence even of that too amounts to no more than this that women ought to be the more nice for how do we know the just character of the man that makes the offer To say that the woman should be the more easy on this occasion is to say we should be the forwarder to venture because of the greatness of the danger which in my way of reasoning is very absurd On the contrary the women have ten thousand times the more reason to be wary and backward by how much the hazard of being betrayed is the greater and would the ladies consider this and act the wary part they would discover every cheat that offered for in short the lives of very few men nowadays will bear a character and if the ladies do but make a little inquiry they will soon be able to distinguish the men and deliver themselves As for women that do not think their own safety worth their thought that impatient of their perfect state resolve as they call it to take the first good Christian that comes that run into matrimony as a horse rushes into the battle I can say nothing to them but this that they are a sort of ladies that are to be prayed for among the rest of distempered people and to me they look like people that venture their whole estates in a lottery where there is a hundred thousand blanks to one prize No man of common sense will value a woman the less for not giving up herself at the first attack or for accepting his proposal without inquiring into his person or character on the contrary he must think her the weakest of all creatures in the world as the rate of men now goes In short he must have a very contemptible opinion of her capacities nay every of her understanding that having but one case of her life shall call that life away at once and make matrimony like death be a leap in the dark I would fain have the conduct of my sex a little regulated in this particular which is the thing in which of all the parts of life I think at this time we suffer most in tis nothing but lack of courage the fear of not being married at all and of that frightful state of life called an old maid of which I have a story to tell by itself This I say is the woman s snare but would the ladies once but get above that fear and manage rightly they would more certainly avoid it by standing their ground in a case so absolutely necessary to their felicity that by exposing themselves as they do and if they did not marry so soon as they may do otherwise they would make themselves amends by marrying safer She is always married too soon who gets a bad husband and she is never married too late who gets a good one in a word there is no woman deformity or lost reputation excepted but if she manages well may be married safely one time or other but if she precipitates herself it is ten thousand to one but she is undone But I come now to my own case in which there was at this time no little nicety The circumstances I was in made the offer of a good husband the most necessary thing in the world to me but I found soon that to be made cheap and easy was not the way It soon began to be found that the widow had no fortune and to say this was to say all that was ill of me for I began to be dropped in all the discourses of matrimony Being well bred handsome witty modest and agreeable all which I had allowed to my character whether justly or no is not the purpose I say all these would not do without the dross which way now become more valuable than virtue itself In short the widow they said had no money I resolved therefore as to the state of my present circumstances that it was absolutely necessary to change my station and make a new appearance in some other place where I was not known and even to pass by another name if I found occasion I communicated my thoughts to my intimate friend the captain s lady whom I had so faithfully served in her case with the captain and who was as ready to serve me in the same kind as I could desire I made no scruple to lay my circumstances open to her my stock was but low for I had made but about five hundred forty at the close of my last affair and I had wasted some of that however I had about four hundred sixty left a great many very rich clothes a gold watch and some jewels though of no extraordinary value and about thirty or forty left in linen not disposed of My dear and faithful friend the captain s wife was so sensible of the service I had done her in the affair above that she was not only a steady friend to me but knowing my circumstances she frequently made me presents as money came into her hands such as fully amounted to a maintenance so that I spent none of my own and at last she made this unhappy proposal to me viz that as we had observed as above how the men made no scruple to set themselves out as persons meriting a woman of fortune when they had really no fortune of their own it was but just to deal with them in their own way and if it was possible to deceive the deceiver The captain s lady in short put this project into my head and told me if I would be ruled by her I should certainly get a husband of fortune without leaving him any room to reproach me with want of my own I told her as I had reason to do that I would give up myself wholly to her directions and that I would have neither tongue to speak nor feet to step in that affair but as she should direct me depending that she would extricate me out of every difficulty she brought me into which she said she would answer for The first step she put me upon was to call her cousin and to to a relation s house of hers in the country where she directed me and where she brought her husband to visit me and calling me cousin she worked matters so about that her husband and she together invited me most passionately to come to town and be with them for they now live in a quite different place from where they were before In the next place she tells her husband that I had at least fifteen hundred fortune and that after some of my relations I was like to have a great deal more It was enough to tell her husband this there needed nothing on my side I was but to sit still and wait the event for it presently went all over the neighbourhood that the young widow at Captain s was a fortune that she had at least fifteen hundred and perhaps a great deal more and that the captain said so and if the captain was asked at any time about me he made no scruple to affirm it though he knew not one word of the matter other than that his wife had told him so and in this he thought no harm for he really believed it to be so because he had it from his wife so slender a foundation will those fellows build upon if they do but think there is a fortune in the game With the reputation of this fortune I presently found myself blessed with admirers enough and that I had my choice of men as scarce as they said they were which by the way confirms what I was saying before This being my case I who had a subtle game to play had nothing now to do but to single out from them all the properest man that might be for my purpose that is to say the man who was most likely to depend upon the hearsay of a fortune and not inquire too far into the particulars and unless I did this I did nothing for my case would not bear much inquiry I picked out my man without much difficulty by the judgment I made of his way of courting me I had let him run on with his protestations and oaths that he loved me above all the world that if I would make him happy that was enough all which I knew was upon supposition nay it was upon a full satisfaction that I was very rich though I never told him a word of it myself This was my man but I was to try him to the bottom and indeed in that consisted my safety for if he baulked I knew I was undone as surely as he was undone if he took me and if I did not make some scruple about his fortune it was the way to lead him to raise some about mine and first therefore I pretended on all occasions to doubt his sincerity and told him perhaps he only courted me for my fortune He stopped my mouth in that part with the thunder of his protestations as above but still I pretended to doubt One morning he pulls off his diamond ring and writes upon the glass of the sash in my chamber this line You I love and you alone I read it and asked him to lend me his ring with which I wrote under it thus And so in love says every one He takes his ring again and writes another line thus Virtue alone is an estate I borrowed it again and I wrote under it But money s virtue gold is fate He coloured as red as fire to see me turn so quick upon him and in a kind of a rage told me he would conquer me and writes again thus I scorn your gold and yet I love I ventured all upon the last cast of poetry as you ll see for I wrote boldly under his last I m poor let s see how kind you ll prove This was a sad truth to me whether he believed me or no I could not tell I supposed then that he did not However he flew to me took me in his arms and kissing me very eagerly and with the greatest passion imaginable he held me fast till he called for a pen and ink and then told me he could not wait the tedious writing on the glass but pulling out a piece of paper he began and wrote again Be mine with all your poverty I took his pen and followed him immediately thus Yet secretly you hope I lie He told me that was unkind because it was not just and that I put him upon contradicting me which did not consist with good manners any more than with his affection and therefore since I had insensibly drawn him into this poetical scribble he begged I would not oblige him to break it off so he writes again Let love alone be our debate I wrote again She loves enough that does not hate This he took for a favour and so laid down the cudgels that is to say the pen I say he took if for a favour and a mighty one it was if he had known all However he took it as I meant it that is to let him think I was inclined to go on with him as indeed I had all the reason in the world to do for he was the best humoured merry sort of a fellow that I ever met with and I often reflected on myself how doubly criminal it was to deceive such a man but that necessity which pressed me to a settlement suitable to my condition was my authority for it and certainly his affection to me and the goodness of his temper however they might argue against using him ill yet they strongly argued to me that he would better take the disappointment than some fiery tempered wretch who might have nothing to recommend him but those passions which would serve only to make a woman miserable all her days Besides though I jested with him as he supposed it so often about my poverty yet when he found it to be true he had foreclosed all manner of objection seeing whether he was in jest or in earnest he had declared he took me without any regard to my portion and whether I was in jest or in earnest I had declared myself to be very poor so that in a word I had him fast both ways and though he might say afterwards he was cheated yet he could never say that I had cheated him He pursued me close after this and as I saw there was no need to fear losing him I played the indifferent part with him longer than prudence might otherwise have dictated to me But I considered how much this caution and indifference would give me the advantage over him when I should come to be under the necessity of owning my own circumstances to him and I managed it the more warily because I found he inferred from thence as indeed he ought to do that I either had the more money or the more judgment and would not venture at all I took the freedom one day after we had talked pretty close to the subject to tell him that it was true I had received the compliment of a lover from him namely that he would take me without inquiring into my fortune and I would make him a suitable return in this viz that I would make as little inquiry into his as consisted with reason but I hoped he would allow me to ask a few questions which he would answer or not as he thought fit and that I would not be offended if he did not answer me at all one of these questions related to our manner of living and the place where because I had heard he had a great plantation in Virginia and that he had talked of going to live there and I told him I did not care to be transported He began from this discourse to let me voluntarily into all his affairs and to tell me in a frank open way all his circumstances by which I found he was very well to pass in the world but that great part of his estate consisted of three plantations which he had in Virginia which brought him in a very good income generally speaking to the tune of three hundred a year but that if he was to live upon them would bring him in four times as much Very well thought I you shall carry me thither as soon as you please though I won t tell you so beforehand I jested with him extremely about the figure he would make in Virginia but I found he would do anything I desired though he did not seem glad to have me undervalue his plantations so I turned my tale I told him I had good reason not to go there to live because if his plantations were worth so much there I had not a fortune suitable to a gentleman of twelve hundred a year as he said his estate would be He replied generously he did not ask what my fortune was he had told me from the beginning he would not and he would be as good as his word but whatever it was he assured me he would never desire me to go to Virginia with him or go thither himself without me unless I was perfectly willing and made it my choice All this you may be sure was as I wished and indeed nothing could have happened more perfectly agreeable I carried it on as far as this with a sort of indifferency that he often wondered at more than at first but which was the only support of his courtship and I mention it the rather to intimate again to the ladies that nothing but want of courage for such an indifferency makes our sex so cheap and prepares them to be ill used as they are would they venture the loss of a pretending fop now and then who carries it high upon the point of his own merit they would certainly be less slighted and courted more Had I discovered really and truly what my great fortune was and that in all I had not full five hundred when he expected fifteen hundred yet I had hooked him so fast and played him so long that I was satisfied he would have had me in my worst circumstances and indeed it was less a surprise to him when he learned the truth than it would have been because having not the least blame to lay on me who had carried it with an air of indifference to the last he would not say one word except that indeed he thought it had been more but that if it had been less he did not repent his bargain only that he should not be able to maintain me so well as he intended In short we were married and very happily married on my side I assure you as to the man for he was the best humoured man that every woman had but his circumstances were not so good as I imagined as on the other hand he had not bettered himself by marrying so much as he expected When we were married I was shrewdly put to it to bring him that little stock I had and to let him see it was no more but there was a necessity for it so I took my opportunity one day when we were alone to enter into a short dialogue with him about it My dear said I we have been married a fortnight is it not time to let you know whether you have got a wife with something or with nothing Your own time for that my dear says he I am satisfied that I have got the wife I love I have not troubled you much says he with my inquiry after it That s true says I but I have a great difficulty upon me about it which I scarce know how to manage What s that m dear says he Why says I tis a little hard upon me and tis harder upon you I am told that Captain meaning my friend s husband has told you I had a great deal more money than I ever pretended to have and I am sure I never employed him to do so Well says he Captain may have told me so but what then If you have not so much that may lie at his door but you never told me what you had so I have no reason to blame you if you have nothing at all That s is so just said I and so generous that it makes my having but a little a double affliction to me The less you have my dear says he the worse for us both but I hope your affliction you speak of is not caused for fear I should be unkind to you for want of a portion No no if you have nothing tell me plainly and at once I may perhaps tell the captain he has cheated me but I can never say you have cheated me for did you not give it under your hand that you were poor and so I ought to expect you to be Well said I my dear I am glad I have not been concerned in deceiving you before marriage If I deceive you since tis ne er the worse that I am poor is too true but not so poor as to have nothing neither so I pulled out some bank bills and gave him about one hundred sixty There s something my dear said I and not quite all neither I had brought him so near to expecting nothing by what I had said before that the money though the sum was small in itself was doubly welcome to him he owned it was more than he looked for and that he did not question by my discourse to him but that my fine clothes gold watch and a diamond ring or two had been all my fortune I let him please himself with that one hundred sixty two or three days and then having been abroad that day and as if I had been to fetch it I brought him one hundred more home in gold and told him there was a little more portion for him and in short in about a week more I brought him one hundred eighty more and about sixty in linen which I made him believe I had been obliged to take with the one hundred which I gave him in gold as a composition for a debt of six hundred being little more than five shillings in the pound and overvalued too And now my dear says I to him I am very sorry to tell you that there is all and that I have given you my whole fortune I added that if the person who had my six hundred had not abused me I had been worth one thousand to him but that as it was I had been faithful to him and reserved nothing to myself but if it had been more he should have had it He was so obliged by the manner and so pleased with the sum for he had been in a terrible fright lest it had been nothing at all that he accepted it very thankfully And thus I got over the fraud of passing for a fortune without money and cheating a man into marrying me on pretence of a fortune which by the way I take to be one of the most dangerous steps a woman can take and in which she runs the most hazard of being ill used afterwards My husband to give him his due was a man of infinite good nature but he was no fool and finding his income not suited to the manner of living which he had intended if I had brought him what he expected and being under a disappointment in his return of his plantations in Virginia he discovered many times his inclination of going over to Virginia to live upon his own and often would be magnifying the way of living there how cheap how plentiful how pleasant and the like I began presently to understand this meaning and I took him up very plainly one morning and told him that I did so that I found his estate turned to no account at this distance compared to what it would do if he lived upon the spot and that I found he had a mind to go and live there and I added that I was sensible he had been disappointed in a wife and that finding his expectations not answered that way I could do no less to make him amends than tell him that I was very willing to go over to Virginia with him and live there He said a thousand kind things to me upon the subject of my making such a proposal to him He told me that however he was disappointed in his expectations of a fortune he was not disappointed in a wife and that I was all to him that a wife could be and he was more than satisfied on the whole when the particulars were put together but that this offer was so kind that it was more than he could express To bring the story short we agreed to go He told me that he had a very good house there that it was well furnished that his mother was alive and lived in it and one sister which was all the relations he had that as soon as he came there his mother would remove to another house which was her own for life and his after her decease so that I should have all the house to myself and I found all this to be exactly as he had said To make this part of the story short we put on board the ship which we went in a large quantity of good furniture for our house with stores of linen and other necessaries and a good cargo for sale and away we went To give an account of the manner of our voyage which was long and full of dangers is out of my way I kept no journal neither did my husband All that I can say is that after a terrible passage frighted twice with dreadful storms and once with what was still more terrible I mean a pirate who came on board and took away almost all our provisions and which would have been beyond all to me they had once taken my husband to go along with them but by entreaties were prevailed with to leave him I say after all these terrible things we arrived in York River in Virginia and coming to our plantation we were received with all the demonstrations of tenderness and affection by my husband s mother that were possible to be expressed We lived here all together my mother in law at my entreaty continuing in the house for she was too kind a mother to be parted with my husband likewise continued the same as at first and I thought myself the happiest creature alive when an odd and surprising event put an end to all that felicity in a moment and rendered my condition the most uncomfortable if not the most miserable in the world My mother was a mighty cheerful good humoured old woman I may call her old woman for her son was above thirty I say she was very pleasant good company and used to entertain me in particular with abundance of stories to divert me as well of the country we were in as of the people Among the rest she often told me how the greatest part of the inhabitants of the colony came thither in very indifferent circumstances from England that generally speaking they were of two sorts either first such as were brought over by masters of ships to be sold as servants Such as we call them my dear says she but they are more properly called slaves Or secondly such as are transported from Newgate and other prisons after having been found guilty of felony and other crimes punishable with death When they come here says she we make no difference the planters buy them and they work together in the field till their time is out When tis expired said she they have encouragement given them to plant for themselves for they have a certain number of acres of land allotted them by the country and they go to work to clear and cure the land and then to plant it with tobacco and corn for their own use and as the tradesmen and merchants will trust them with tools and clothes and other necessaries upon the credit of their crop before it is grown so they again plant every year a little more than the year before and so buy whatever they want with the crop that is before them Hence child says she man a Newgate bird becomes a great man and we have continued she several justices of the peace officers of the trained bands and magistrates of the towns they live in that have been burnt in the hand She was going on with that part of the story when her own part in it interrupted her and with a great deal of good humoured confidence she told me she was one of the second sort of inhabitants herself that she came away openly having ventured too far in a particular case so that she was become a criminal And here s the mark of it child says she and pulling off her glove look ye here says she turning up the palm of her hand and showed me a very fine white arm and hand but branded in the inside of the hand as in such cases it must be This story was very moving to me but my mother smiling said You need not think a thing strange daughter for as I told you some of the best men in this country are burnt in the hand and they are not ashamed to own it There s Major says she he was an eminent pickpocket there s Justice Ba r was a shoplifter and both of them were burnt in the hand and I could name you several such as they are We had frequent discourses of this kind and abundance of instances she gave me of the like After some time as she was telling some stories of one that was transported but a few weeks ago I began in an intimate kind of way to ask her to tell me something of her own story which she did with the utmost plainness and sincerity how she had fallen into very ill company in London in her young days occasioned by her mother sending her frequently to carry victuals and other relief to a kinswoman of hers who was a prisoner in Newgate and who lay in a miserable starving condition was afterwards condemned to be hanged but having got respite by pleading her belly dies afterwards in the prison Here my mother in law ran out in a long account of the wicked practices in that dreadful place and how it ruined more young people that all the town besides And child says my mother perhaps you may know little of it or it may be have heard nothing about it but depend upon it says she we all know here that there are more thieves and rogues made by that one prison of Newgate than by all the clubs and societies of villains in the nation tis that cursed place says my mother that half peopled this colony Here she went on with her own story so long and in so particular a manner that I began to be very uneasy but coming to one particular that required telling her name I thought I should have sunk down in the place She perceived I was out of order and asked me if I was not well and what ailed me I told her I was so affected with the melancholy story she had told and the terrible things she had gone through that it had overcome me and I begged of her to talk no more of it Why my dear says she very kindly what need these things trouble you These passages were long before your time and they give me no trouble at all now nay I look back on them with a particular satisfaction as they have been a means to bring me to this place Then she went on to tell me how she very luckily fell into a good family where behaving herself well and her mistress dying her master married her by whom she had my husband and his sister and that by her diligence and good management after her husband s death she had improved the plantations to such a degree as they then were so that most of the estate was of her getting not her husband s for she had been a widow upwards of sixteen years I heard this part of they story with very little attention because I wanted much to retire and give vent to my passions which I did soon after and let any one judge what must be the anguish of my mind when I came to reflect that this was certainly no more or less than my own mother and I had now had two children and was big with another by my own brother and lay with him still every night I was now the most unhappy of all women in the world Oh had the story never been told me all had been well it had been no crime to have lain with my husband since as to his being my relation I had known nothing of it I had now such a load on my mind that it kept me perpetually waking to reveal it which would have been some ease to me I could not find would be to any purpose and yet to conceal it would be next to impossible nay I did not doubt but I should talk of it in my sleep and tell my husband of it whether I would or no If I discovered it the least thing I could expect was to lose my husband for he was too nice and too honest a man to have continued my husband after he had known I had been his sister so that I was perplexed to the last degree I leave it to any man to judge what difficulties presented to my view I was away from my native country at a distance prodigious and the return to me unpassable I lived very well but in a circumstance insufferable in itself If I had discovered myself to my mother it might be difficult to convince her of the particulars and I had no way to prove them On the other hand if she had questioned or doubted me I had been undone for the bare suggestion would have immediately separated me from my husband without gaining my mother or him who would have been neither a husband nor a brother so that between the surprise on one hand and the uncertainty on the other I had been sure to be undone In the meantime as I was but too sure of the fact I lived therefore in open avowed incest and whoredom and all under the appearance of an honest wife and though I was not much touched with the crime of it yet the action had something in it shocking to nature and made my husband as he thought himself even nauseous to me However upon the most sedate consideration I resolved that it was absolutely necessary to conceal it all and not make the least discovery of it either to mother or husband and thus I lived with the greatest pressure imaginable for three years more but had no more children During this time my mother used to be frequently telling me old stories of her former adventures which however were no ways pleasant to me for by it though she did not tell it me in plain terms yet I could easily understand joined with what I had heard myself of my first tutors that in her younger days she had been both whore and thief but I verily believed she had lived to repent sincerely of both and that she was then a very pious sober and religious woman Well let her life have been what it would then it was certain that my life was very uneasy to me for I lived as I have said but in the worst sort of whoredom and as I could expect no good of it so really no good issue came of it and all my seeming prosperity wore off and ended in misery and destruction It was some time indeed before it came to this for but I know not by what ill fate guided everything went wrong with us afterwards and that which was worse my husband grew strangely altered forward jealous and unkind and I was as impatient of bearing his carriage as the carriage was unreasonable and unjust These things proceeded so far that we came at last to be in such ill terms with one another that I claimed a promise of him which he entered willingly into with me when I consented to come from England with him viz that if I found the country not to agree with me or that I did not like to live there I should come away to England again when I pleased giving him a year s warning to settle his affairs I say I now claimed this promise of him and I must confess I did it not in the most obliging terms that could be in the world neither but I insisted that he treated me ill that I was remote from my friends and could do myself no justice and that he was jealous without cause my conversation having been unblamable and he having no pretense for it and that to remove to England would take away all occasion from him I insisted so peremptorily upon it that he could not avoid coming to a point either to keep his word with me or to break it and this notwithstanding he used all the skill he was master of and employed his mother and other agents to prevail with me to alter my resolutions indeed the bottom of the thing lay at my heart and that made all his endeavours fruitless for my heart was alienated from him as a husband I loathed the thoughts of bedding with him and used a thousand pretenses of illness and humour to prevent his touching me fearing nothing more than to be with child by him which to be sure would have prevented or at least delayed my going over to England However at last I put him so out of humour that he took up a rash and fatal resolution in short I should not go to England and though he had promised me yet it was an unreasonable thing for me to desire it that it would be ruinous to his affairs would unhinge his whole family and be next to an undoing him in the world that therefore I ought not to desire it of him and that no wife in the world that valued her family and her husband s prosperity would insist upon such a thing This plunged me again for when I considered the thing calmly and took my husband as he really was a diligent careful man in the main work of laying up an estate for his children and that he knew nothing of the dreadful circumstances that he was in I could not but confess to myself that my proposal was very unreasonable and what no wife that had the good of her family at heart would have desired But my discontents were of another nature I looked upon him no longer as a husband but as a near relation the son of my own mother and I resolved somehow or other to be clear of him but which way I did not know nor did it seem possible It is said by the ill natured world of our sex that if we are set on a thing it is impossible to turn us from our resolutions in short I never ceased poring upon the means to bring to pass my voyage and came that length with my husband at last as to propose going without him This provoked him to the last degree and he called me not only an unkind wife but an unnatural mother and asked me how I could entertain such a thought without horror as that of leaving my two children for one was dead without a mother and to be brought up by strangers and never to see them more It was true had things been right I should not have done it but now it was my real desire never to see them or him either any more and as to the charge of unnatural I could easily answer it to myself while I knew that the whole relation was unnatural in the highest degree in the world However it was plain there was no bringing my husband to anything he would neither go with me nor let me go without him and it was quite out of my power to stir without his consent as any one that knows the constitution of the country I was in knows very well We had many family quarrels about it and they began in time to grow up to a dangerous height for as I was quite estranged form my husband as he was called in affection so I took no heed to my words but sometimes gave him language that was provoking and in short strove all I could to bring him to a parting with me which was what above all things in the world I desired most He took my carriage very ill and indeed he might well do so for at last I refused to bed with him and carrying on the breach upon all occasions to extremity he told me once he thought I was mad and if I did not alter my conduct he would put me under cure that is to say into a madhouse I told him he should find I was far enough from mad and that it was not in his power or any other villain s to murder me I confess at the same time I was heartily frighted at his thoughts of putting me into a madhouse which would at once have destroyed all the possibility of breaking the truth out whatever the occasion might be for that then no one would have given credit to a word of it This therefore brought me to a resolution whatever came of it to lay open my whole case but which way to do it or to whom was an inextricable difficulty and took me many months to resolve In the meantime another quarrel with my husband happened which came up to such a mad extreme as almost pushed me on to tell it him all to his face but though I kept it in so as not to come to the particulars I spoke so much as put him into the utmost confusion and in the end brought out the whole story He began with a calm expostulation upon my being so resolute to go to England I defended it and one hard word bringing on another as is usual in all family strife he told me I did not treat him as if he was my husband or talk of my children as if I was a mother and in short that I did not deserve to be used as a wife that he had used all the fair means possible with me that he had argued with all the kindness and calmness that a husband or a Christian ought to do and that I made him such a vile return that I treated him rather like a dog than a man and rather like the most contemptible stranger than a husband that he was very loth to use violence with me but that in short he saw a necessity of it now and that for the future he should be obliged to take such measures as should reduce me to my duty My blood was now fired to the utmost though I knew what he had said was very true and nothing could appear more provoked I told him for his fair means and his foul they were equally contemned by me that for my going to England I was resolved on it come what would and that as to treating him not like a husband and not showing myself a mother to my children there might be something more in it than he understood at present but for his further consideration I thought fit to tell him thus much that he neither was my lawful husband nor they lawful children and that I had reason to regard neither of them more than I did I confess I was moved to pity him when I spoke it for he turned pale as death and stood mute as one thunderstruck and once or twice I thought he would have fainted in short it put him in a fit something like an apoplex he trembled a sweat or dew ran off his face and yet he was cold as a clod so that I was forced to run and fetch something for him to keep life in him When he recovered of that he grew sick and vomited and in a little after was put to bed and the next morning was as he had been indeed all night in a violent fever However it went off again and he recovered though but slowly and when he came to be a little better he told me I had given him a mortal wound with my tongue and he had only one thing to ask before he desired an explanation I interrupted him and told him I was sorry I had gone so far since I saw what disorder it put him into but I desired him not to talk to me of explanations for that would but make things worse This heightened his impatience and indeed perplexed him beyond all bearing for now he began to suspect that there was some mystery yet unfolded but could not make the least guess at the real particulars of it all that ran in his brain was that I had another husband alive which I could not say in fact might not be true but I assured him however there was not the least of that in it and indeed as to my other husband he was effectually dead in law to me and had told me I should look on him as such so I had not the least uneasiness on that score But now I found the thing too far gone to conceal it much longer and my husband himself gave me an opportunity to ease myself of the secret much to my satisfaction He had laboured with me three or four weeks but to no purpose only to tell him whether I had spoken these words only as the effect of my passion to put him in a passion or whether there was anything of truth in the bottom of them But I continued inflexible and would explain nothing unless he would first consent to my going to England which he would never do he said while he lived on the other hand I said it was in my power to make him willing when I pleased nay to make him entreat me to go and this increased his curiosity and made him importunate to the highest degree but it was all to no purpose At length he tells all this story to his mother and sets her upon me to get the main secret out of me and she used her utmost skill with me indeed but I put her to a full stop at once by telling her that the reason and mystery of the whole matter lay in herself and that it was my respect to her that had made me conceal it and that in short I could go no farther and therefore conjured her not to insist upon it She was struck dumb at this suggestion and could not tell what to say or to think but laying aside the supposition as a policy of mine continued her importunity on account of her son and if possible to make up the breach between us two As to that I told her that it was indeed a good design in her but that it was impossible to be done and that if I should reveal to her the truth of what she desired she would grant it to be impossible and cease to desire it At last I seemed to be prevailed on by her importunity and told her I dared trust her with a secret of the greatest importance and she would soon see that this was so and that I would consent to lodge it in her breast if she would engage solemnly not to acquaint her son with it without my consent She was long in promising this part but rather than not come at the main secret she agreed to that too and after a great many other preliminaries I began and told her the whole story First I told her how much she was concerned in all the unhappy breach which had happened between her son and me by telling me her own story and her London name and that the surprise she saw I was in was upon that occasion The I told her my own story and my name and assured her by such other tokens as she could not deny that I was no other nor more or less than her own child her daughter born of her body in Newgate the same that had saved her from the gallows by being in her belly and the same that she left in such and such hands when she was transported It is impossible to express the astonishment she was in she was not inclined to believe the story or to remember the particulars for she immediately foresaw the confusion that must follow in the family upon it But everything concurred so exactly with the stories she had told me of herself and which if she had not told me she would perhaps have been content to have denied that she had stopped her own mouth and she had nothing to do but to take me about the neck and kiss me and cry most vehemently over me without speaking one word for a long time together At last she broke out Unhappy child says she what miserable chance could bring thee hither and in the arms of my own son too Dreadful girl says she why we are all undone Married to thy own brother Three children and two alive all of the same flesh and blood My son and my daughter lying together as husband and wife All confusion and distraction for ever Miserable family what will become of us What is to be said What is to be done And thus she ran on for a great while nor had I any power to speak or if I had did I know what to say for every word wounded me to the soul With this kind of amazement on our thoughts we parted for the first time though my mother was more surprised than I was because it was more news to her than to me However she promised again to me at parting that she would say nothing of it to her son till we had talked of it again It was not long you may be sure before we had a second conference upon the same subject when as if she had been willing to forget the story she had told me of herself or to suppose that I had forgot some of the particulars she began to tell them with alterations and omissions but I refreshed her memory and set her to rights in many things which I supposed she had forgot and then came in so opportunely with the whole history that it was impossible for her to go from it and then she fell into her rhapsodies again and exclamations at the severity of her misfortunes When these things were a little over with her we fell into a close debate about what should be first done before we gave an account of the matter to my husband But to what purpose could be all our consultations We could neither of us see our way through it nor see how it could be safe to open such a scene to him It was impossible to make any judgment or give any guess at what temper he would receive it in or what measures he would take upon it and if he should have so little government of himself as to make it public we easily foresaw that it would be the ruin of the whole family and expose my mother and me to the last degree and if at last he should take the advantage the law would give him he might put me away with disdain and leave me to sue for the little portion that I had and perhaps waste it all in the suit and then be a beggar the children would be ruined too having no legal claim to any of his effects and thus I should see him perhaps in the arms of another wife in a few months and be myself the most miserable creature alive My mother was as sensible of this as I and upon the whole we knew not what to do After some time we came to more sober resolutions but then it was with this misfortune too that my mother s opinion and mine were quite different from one another and indeed inconsistent with one another for my mother s opinion was that I should bury the whole thing entirely and continue to live with him as my husband till some other event should make the discovery of it more convenient and that in the meantime she would endeavour to reconcile us together again and restore our mutual comfort and family peace that we might lie as we used to do together and so let the whole matter remain a secret as close as death For child says she we are both undone if it comes out To encourage me to this she promised to make me easy in my circumstances as far as she was able and to leave me what she could at her death secured for me separately from my husband so that if it should come out afterwards I should not be left destitute but be able to stand on my own feet and procure justice from him This proposal did not agree at all with my judgment of the thing though it was very fair and kind in my mother but my thoughts ran quite another way As to keeping the thing in our own breasts and letting it all remain as it was I told her it was impossible and I asked her how she could think I could bear the thoughts of lying with my own brother In the next place I told her that her being alive was the only support of the discovery and that while she owned me for her child and saw reason to be satisfied that I was so nobody else would doubt it but that if she should die before the discovery I should be taken for an impudent creature that had forged such a thing to go away from my husband or should be counted crazed and distracted Then I told her how he had threatened already to put me into a madhouse and what concern I had been in about it and how that was the thing that drove me to the necessity of discovering it to her as I had done From all which I told her that I had on the most serious reflections I was able to make in the case come to this resolution which I hoped she would like as a medium between both viz that she should use her endeavours with her son to give me leave to go to England as I had desired and to furnish me with a sufficient sum of money either in goods along with me or in bills for my support there all along suggesting that he might one time or other think it proper to come over to me That when I was gone she should then in cold blood and after first obliging him in the solemnest manner possible to secrecy discover the case to him doing it gradually and as her own discretion should guide her so that he might not be surprised with it and fly out into any passions and excesses on my account or on hers and that she should concern herself to prevent his slighting the children or marrying again unless he had a certain account of my being dead This was my scheme and my reasons were good I was really alienated from him in the consequences of these things indeed I mortally hated him as a husband and it was impossible to remove that riveted aversion I had to him At the same time it being an unlawful incestuous living added to that aversion and though I had no great concern about it in point of conscience yet everything added to make cohabiting with him the most nauseous thing to me in the world and I think verily it was come to such a height that I could almost as willingly have embraced a dog as have let him offer anything of that kind to me for which reason I could not bear the thoughts of coming between the sheets with him I cannot say that I was right in point of policy in carrying it such a length while at the same time I did not resolve to discover the thing to him but I am giving an account of what was not of what ought or ought not to be In their directly opposite opinion to one another my mother and I continued a long time and it was impossible to reconcile our judgments many disputes we had about it but we could never either of us yield our own or bring over the other I insisted on my aversion to lying with my own brother and she insisted upon its being impossible to bring him to consent to my going from him to England and in this uncertainty we continued not differing so as to quarrel or anything like it but so as not to be able to resolve what we should do to make up that terrible breach that was before us At last I resolved on a desperate course and told my mother my resolution viz that in short I would tell him of it myself My mother was frighted to the last degree at the very thoughts of it but I bid her be easy told her I would do it gradually and softly and with all the art and good humour I was mistress of and time it also as well as I could taking him in good humour too I told her I did not question but if I could be hypocrite enough to feign more affection to him than I really had I should succeed in all my design and we might part by consent and with a good agreement for I might live him well enough for a brother though I could not for a husband All this while he lay at my mother to find out if possible what was the meaning of that dreadful expression of mine as he called it which I mentioned before namely that I was not his lawful wife nor my children his legal children My mother put him off told him she could bring me to no explanations but found there was something that disturbed me very much and she hoped she should get it out of me in time and in the meantime recommended to him earnestly to use me more tenderly and win me with his usual good carriage told him of his terrifying and affrighting me with his threats of sending me to a madhouse and the like and advised him not to make a woman desperate on any account whatever He promised her to soften his behaviour and bid her assure me that he loved me as well as ever and that he had so such design as that of sending me to a madhouse whatever he might say in his passion also he desired my mother to use the same persuasions to me too that our affections might be renewed and we might lie together in a good understanding as we used to do I found the effects of this treaty presently My husband s conduct was immediately altered and he was quite another man to me nothing could be kinder and more obliging than he was to me upon all occasions and I could do no less than make some return to it which I did as well as I could but it was but in an awkward manner at best for nothing was more frightful to me than his caresses and the apprehensions of being with child again by him was ready to throw me into fits and this made me see that there was an absolute necessity of breaking the case to him without any more delay which however I did with all the caution and reserve imaginable He had continued his altered carriage to me near a month and we began to live a new kind of life with one another and could I have satisfied myself to have gone on with it I believe it might have continued as long as we had continued alive together One evening as we were sitting and talking very friendly together under a little awning which served as an arbour at the entrance from our house into the garden he was in a very pleasant agreeable humour and said abundance of kind things to me relating to the pleasure of our present good agreement and the disorders of our past breach and what a satisfaction it was to him that we had room to hope we should never have any more of it I fetched a deep sigh and told him there was nobody in the world could be more delighted than I was in the good agreement we had always kept up or more afflicted with the breach of it and should be so still but I was sorry to tell him that there was an unhappy circumstance in our case which lay too close to my heart and which I knew not how to break to him that rendered my part of it very miserable and took from me all the comfort of the rest He importuned me to tell him what it was I told him I could not tell how to do it that while it was concealed from him I alone was unhappy but if he knew it also we should be both so and that therefore to keep him in the dark about it was the kindest thing that I could do and it was on that account alone that I kept a secret from him the very keeping of which I thought would first or last be my destruction It is impossible to express his surprise at this relation and the double importunity which he used with me to discover it to him He told me I could not be called kind to him nay I could not be faithful to him if I concealed it from him I told him I thought so too and yet I could not do it He went back to what I had said before to him and told me he hoped it did not relate to what I had said in my passion and that he had resolved to forget all that as the effect of a rash provoked spirit I told him I wished I could forget it all too but that it was not to be done the impression was too deep and I could not do it it was impossible He then told me he was resolved not to differ with me in anything and that therefore he would importune me no more about it resolving to acquiesce in whatever I did or said only begged I should then agree that whatever it was it should no more interrupt our quiet and our mutual kindness This was the most provoking thing he could have said to me for I really wanted his further importunities that I might be prevailed with to bring out that which indeed it was like death to me to conceal so I answered him plainly that I could not say I was glad not to be importuned thought I could not tell how to comply But come my dear said I what conditions will you make with me upon the opening this affair to you Any conditions in the world said he that you can in reason desire of me Well said I come give it me under your hand that if you do not find I am in any fault or that I am willingly concerned in the causes of the misfortune that is to follow you will not blame me use me the worse do my any injury or make me be the sufferer for that which is not my fault That says he is the most reasonable demand in the world not to blame you for that which is not your fault Give me a pen and ink says he so I ran in and fetched a pen ink and paper and he wrote the condition down in the very words I had proposed it and signed it with his name Well says he what is next my dear Why says I the next is that you will not blame me for not discovering the secret of it to you before I knew it Very just again says he with all my heart so he wrote down that also and signed it Well my dear says I then I have but one condition more to make with you and that is that as there is nobody concerned in it but you and I you shall not discover it to any person in the world except your own mother and that in all the measures you shall take upon the discovery as I am equally concerned in it with you though as innocent as yourself you shall do nothing in a passion nothing to my prejudice or to your mother s prejudice without my knowledge and consent This a little amazed him and he wrote down the words distinctly but read them over and over before he signed them hesitating at them several times and repeating them My mother s prejudice and your prejudice What mysterious thing can this be However at last he signed it Well says I my dear I ll ask you no more under your hand but as you are to hear the most unexpected and surprising thing that perhaps ever befell any family in the world I beg you to promise me you will receive it with composure and a presence of mind suitable to a man of sense I ll do my utmost says he upon condition you will keep me no longer in suspense for you terrify me with all these preliminaries Well then says I it is this as I told you before in a heat that I was not your lawful wife and that our children were not legal children so I must let you know now in calmness and in kindness but with affliction enough that I am your own sister and you my own brother and that we are both the children of our mother now alive and in the house who is convinced of the truth of it in a manner not to be denied or contradicted I saw him turn pale and look wild and I said Now remember your promise and receive it with presence of mind for who could have said more to prepare you for it than I have done However I called a servant and got him a little glass of rum which is the usual dram of that country for he was just fainting away When he was a little recovered I said to him This story you may be sure requires a long explanation and therefore have patience and compose your mind to hear it out and I ll make it as short as I can and with this I told him what I thought was needful of the fact and particularly how my mother came to discover it to me as above And now my dear says I you will see reason for my capitulations and that I neither have been the cause of this matter nor could be so and that I could know nothing of it before now I am fully satisfied of that says he but tis a dreadful surprise to me however I know a remedy for it all and a remedy that shall put an end to your difficulties without your going to England That would be strange said I as all the rest No no says he I ll make it easy there s nobody in the way of it but myself He looked a little disordered when he said this but I did not apprehend anything from it at that time believing as it used to be said that they who do those things never talk of them or that they who talk of such things never do them But things were not come to their height with him and I observed he became pensive and melancholy and in a word as I thought a little distempered in his head I endeavoured to talk him into temper and to reason him into a kind of scheme for our government in the affair and sometimes he would be well and talk with some courage about it but the weight of it lay too heavy upon his thoughts and in short it went so far that he made attempts upon himself and in one of them had actually strangled himself and had not his mother come into the room in the very moment he had died but with the help of a Negro servant she cut him down and recovered him Things were now come to a lamentable height in the family My pity for him now began to revive that affection which at first I really had for him and I endeavoured sincerely by all the kind carriage I could to make up the breach but in short it had gotten too great a head it preyed upon his spirits and it threw him into a long lingering consumption though it happened not to be mortal In this distress I did not know what to do as his life was apparently declining and I might perhaps have married again there very much to my advantage it had been certainly my business to have stayed in the country but my mind was restless too and uneasy I hankered after coming to England and nothing would satisfy me without it In short by an unwearied importunity my husband who was apparently decaying as I observed was at last prevailed with and so my own fate pushing me on the way was made clear for me and my mother concurring I obtained a very good cargo for my coming to England When I parted with my brother for such I am now to call him we agreed that after I arrived he should pretend to have an account that I was dead in England and so might marry again when he would He promised and engaged to me to correspond with me as a sister and to assist and support me as long as I lived and that if he died before me he would leave sufficient to his mother to take care of me still in the name of a sister and he was in some respects careful of me when he heard of me but it was so oddly managed that I felt the disappointments very sensibly afterwards as you shall hear in its time I came away for England in the month of August after I had been eight years in that country and now a new scene of misfortunes attended me which perhaps few women have gone through the life of We had an indifferent good voyage till we came just upon the coast of England and where we arrived in two and thirty days but were then ruffled with two or three storms one of which drove us away to the coast of Ireland and we put in at Kinsdale We remained there about thirteen days got some refreshment on shore and put to sea again though we met with very bad weather again in which the ship sprung her mainmast as they called it for I knew not what they meant But we got at last into Milford Haven in Wales where though it was remote from our port yet having my foot safe upon the firm ground of my native country the isle of Britain I resolved to venture it no more upon the waters which had been so terrible to me so getting my clothes and money on shore with my bills of loading and other papers I resolved to come for London and leave the ship to get to her port as she could the port whither she was bound was to Bristol where my brother s chief correspondent lived I got to London in about three weeks where I heard a little while after that the ship was arrived in Bristol but at the same time had the misfortune to know that by the violent weather she had been in and the breaking of her mainmast she had great damage on board and that a great part of her cargo was spoiled I had now a new scene of life upon my hands and a dreadful appearance it had I was come away with a kind of final farewell What I brought with me was indeed considerable had it come safe and by the help of it I might have married again tolerably well but as it was I was reduced to between two or three hundred pounds in the whole and this without any hope of recruit I was entirely without friends nay even so much as without acquaintance for I found it was absolutely necessary not to revive former acquaintances and as for my subtle friend that set me up formerly for a fortune she was dead and her husband also as I was informed upon sending a person unknown to inquire The looking after my cargo of goods soon after obliged me to take a journey to Bristol and during my attendance upon that affair I took the diversion of going to the Bath for as I was still far from being old so my humour which was always gay continued so to an extreme and being now as it were a woman of fortune though I was a woman without a fortune I expected something or other might happen in my way that might mend my circumstances as had been my case before The Bath is a place of gallantry enough expensive and full of snares I went thither indeed in the view of taking anything that might offer but I must do myself justice as to protest I knew nothing amiss I meant nothing but in an honest way nor had I any thoughts about me at first that looked the way which afterwards I suffered them to be guided Here I stayed the whole latter season as it is called there and contracted some unhappy acquaintances which rather prompted the follies I fell afterwards into than fortified me against them I lived pleasantly enough kept good company that is to say gay fine company but had the discouragement to find this way of living sunk me exceedingly and that as I had no settled income so spending upon the main stock was but a certain kind of bleeding to death and this gave me many sad reflections in the interval of my other thoughts However I shook them off and still flattered myself that something or other might offer for my advantage But I was in the wrong place for it I was not now at Redriff where if I had set myself tolerably up some honest sea captain or other might have talked with me upon the honourable terms of matrimony but I was at the Bath where men find a mistress sometimes but very rarely look for a wife and consequently all the particular acquaintances a woman can expect to make there must have some tendency that way I had spent the first season well enough for though I had contracted some acquaintance with a gentleman who came to the Bath for his diversion yet I had entered into no felonious treaty as it might be called I had resisted some casual offers of gallantry and had managed that way well enough I was not wicked enough to come into the crime for the mere vice of it and I had no extraordinary offers made me that tempted me with the main thing which I wanted However I went this length the first season viz I contracted an acquaintance with a woman in whose house I lodged who though she did not keep an ill house as we call it yet had none of the best principles in herself I had on all occasions behaved myself so well as not to get the least slur upon my reputation on any account whatever and all the men that I had conversed with were of so good reputation that I had not given the least reflection by conversing with them nor did any of them seem to think there was room for a wicked correspondence if they had any of them offered it yet there was one gentleman as above who always singled me out for the diversion of my company as he called it which as he was pleased to say was very agreeable to him but at that time there was no more in it I had many melancholy hours at the Bath after the company was gone for though I went to Bristol sometime for the disposing my effects and for recruits of money yet I chose to come back to Bath for my residence because being on good terms with the woman in whose house I lodged in the summer I found that during the winter I lived rather cheaper there than I could do anywhere else Here I say I passed the winter as heavily as I had passed the autumn cheerfully but having contracted a nearer intimacy with the said woman in whose house I lodged I could not avoid communicating to her something of what lay hardest upon my mind and particularly the narrowness of my circumstances and the loss of my fortune by the damage of my goods at sea I told her also that I had a mother and a brother in Virginia in good circumstances and as I had really written back to my mother in particular to represent my condition and the great loss I had received which indeed came to almost five hundred so I did not fail to let my new friend know that I expected a supply from thence and so indeed I did and as the ships went from Bristol to York River in Virginia and back again generally in less time from London and that my brother corresponded chiefly at Bristol I thought it was much better for me to wait here for my returns than to go to London where also I had not the least acquaintance My new friend appeared sensibly affected with my condition and indeed was so very kind as to reduce the rate of my living with her to so low a price during the winter that she convinced me she got nothing by me and as for lodging during the winter I paid nothing at all When the spring season came on she continued to be as kind to me as she could and I lodged with her for a time till it was found necessary to do otherwise She had some persons of character that frequently lodged in her house and in particular the gentleman who as I said singled me out for his companion the winter before and he came down again with another gentleman in his company and two servants and lodged in the same house I suspected that my landlady had invited him thither letting him know that I was still with her but she denied it and protested to me that she did not and he said the same In a word this gentleman came down and continued to single me out for his peculiar confidence as well as conversation He was a complete gentleman that must be confessed and his company was very agreeable to me as mine if I might believe him was to him He made no professions to be but of an extraordinary respect and he had such an opinion of my virtue that as he often professed he believed if he should offer anything else I should reject him with contempt He soon understood from me that I was a widow that I had arrived at Bristol from Virginia by the last ships and that I waited at Bath till the next Virginia fleet should arrive by which I expected considerable effects I understood by him and by others of him that he had a wife but that the lady was distempered in her head and was under the conduct of her own relations which he consented to to avoid any reflections that might as was not unusual in such cases be cast on him for mismanaging her cure and in the meantime he came to the Bath to divert his thoughts from the disturbance of such a melancholy circumstance as that was My landlady who of her own accord encouraged the correspondence on all occasions gave me an advantageous character of him as a man of honour and of virtue as well as of great estate And indeed I had a great deal of reason to say so of him too for though we lodged both on a floor and he had frequently come into my chamber even when I was in bed and I also into his when he was in bed yet he never offered anything to me further than a kiss or so much as solicited me to anything till long after as you shall hear I frequently took notice to my landlady of his exceeding modesty and she again used to tell me she believed it was so from the beginning however she used to tell me that she thought I ought to expect some gratification from him for my company for indeed he did as it were engross me and I was seldom from him I told her I had not given him the least occasion to think I wanted it or that I would accept of it from him She told me she would take that part upon her and she did so and managed it so dexterously that the first time we were together alone after she had talked with him he began to inquire a little into my circumstances as how I had subsisted myself since I came on shore and whether I did not want money I stood off very boldly I told him that though my cargo of tobacco was damaged yet that it was not quite lost that the merchant I had been consigned to had so honestly managed for me that I had not wanted and that I hoped with frugal management I should make it hold out till more would come which I expected by the next fleet that in the meantime I had retrenched my expenses and whereas I kept a maid last season now I lived without and whereas I had a chamber and a dining room then on the first floor as he knew I now had but one room two pair of stairs and the like But I live said I as well satisfied now as I did then adding that his company had been a means to make me live much more cheerfully than otherwise I should have done for which I was much obliged to him and so I put off all room for any offer for the present However it was not long before he attacked me again and told me he found that I was backward to trust him with the secret of my circumstances which he was sorry for assuring me that he inquired into it with no design to satisfy his own curiosity but merely to assist me if there was any occasion but since I would not own myself to stand in need of any assistance he had but one thing more to desire of me and that was that I would promise him that when I was any way straitened or like to be so I would frankly tell him of it and that I would make use of him with the same freedom that he made the offer adding that I should always find I had a true friend though perhaps I was afraid to trust him I omitted nothing that was fit to be said by one infinitely obliged to let him know that I had a due sense of his kindness and indeed from that time I did not appear so much reserved to him as I had done before though still within the bounds of the strictest virtue on both sides but how free soever our conversation was I could not arrive to that sort of freedom which he desired viz to tell him I wanted money though I was secretly very glad of his offer Some weeks passed after this and still I never asked him for money when my landlady a cunning creature who had often pressed me to it but found that I could not do it makes a story of her own inventing and comes in bluntly to me when we were together Oh widow says she I have bad news to tell you this morning What is that said I are the Virginia ships taken by the French for that was my fear No no says she but the man you sent to Bristol yesterday for money is come back and says he has brought none Now I could by no means like her project I though it looked too much like prompting him which indeed he did not want and I clearly saw that I should lose nothing by being backward to ask so I took her up short I can t image why he should say so to you said I for I assure you he brought me all the money I sent him for and here it is said I pulling out my purse with about twelve guineas in it and added I intend you shall have most of it by and by He seemed distasted a little at her talking as she did at first as well as I taking it as I fancied he would as something forward of her but when he saw me give such an answer he came immediately to himself again The next morning we talked of it again when I found he was fully satisfied and smiling said he hoped I would not want money and not tell him of it and that I had promised him otherwise I told him I had been very much dissatisfied at my landlady s talking so publicly the day before of what she had nothing to do with but I supposed she wanted what I owed her which was about eight guineas which I had resolved to give her and had accordingly given it her the same night she talked so foolishly He was in a might good humour when he heard me say I had paid her and it went off into some other discourse at that time But the next morning he having heard me up about my room before him he called to me and I answering he asked me to come into his chamber He was in bed when I came in and he made me come and sit down on his bedside for he said he had something to say to me which was of some moment After some very kind expressions he asked me if I would be very honest to him and give a sincere answer to one thing he would desire of me After some little cavil at the word sincere and asking him if I had ever given him any answers which were not sincere I promised him I would Why then his request was he said to let him see my purse I immediately put my hand into my pocket and laughing to him pulled it out and there was in it three guineas and a half Then he asked me if there was all the money I had I told him No laughing again not by a great deal Well then he said he would have me promise to go and fetch him all the money I had every farthing I told him I would and I went into my chamber and fetched him a little private drawer where I had about six guineas more and some silver and threw it all down upon the bed and told him there was all my wealth honestly to a shilling He looked a little at it but did not tell it and huddled it all into the drawer again and then reaching his pocket pulled out a key and bade me open a little walnut tree box he had upon the table and bring him such a drawer which I did In which drawer there was a great deal of money in gold I believe near two hundred guineas but I knew not how much He took the drawer and taking my hand made me put it in and take a whole handful I was backward at that but he held my hand hard in his hand and put it into the drawer and made me take out as many guineas almost as I could well take up at once When I had done so he made me put them into my lap and took my little drawer and poured out all my money among his and bade me get me gone and carry it all home into my own chamber I relate this story the more particularly because of the good humour there was in it and to show the temper with which we conversed It was not long after this but he began every day to find fault with my clothes with my laces and headdresses and in a word pressed me to buy better which by the way I was willing enough to do though I did not seem to be so for I loved nothing in the world better than fine clothes I told him I must housewife the money he had lent me or else I should not be able to pay him again He then told me in a few words that as he had a sincere respect for me and knew my circumstances he had not lent me that money but given it me and that he thought I had merited it from him by giving him my company so entirely as I had done After this he made me take a maid and keep house and his friend that come with him to Bath being gone he obliged me to diet him which I did very willingly believing as it appeared that I should lose nothing by it nor did the woman of the house fail to find her account in it too We had lived thus near three months when the company beginning to wear away at the Bath he talked of going away and fain he would have me to go to London with him I was not very easy in that proposal not knowing what posture I was to live in there or how he might use me But while this was in debate he fell very sick he had gone out to a place in Somersetshire called Shepton where he had some business and was there taken very ill and so ill that he could not travel so he sent his man back to Bath to beg me that I would hire a coach and come over to him Before he went he had left all his money and other things of value with me and what to do with them I did not know but I secured them as well as I could and locked up the lodgings and went to him where I found him very ill indeed however I persuaded him to be carried in a litter to the Bath where there was more help and better advice to be had He consented and I brought him to the Bath which was about fifteen miles as I remember Here he continued very ill of a fever and kept his bed five weeks all which time I nursed him and tended him myself as much and as carefully as if I had been his wife indeed if I had been his wife I could not have done more I sat up with him so much and so often that at last indeed he would not let me sit up any longer and then I got a pallet bed into his room and lay in it just at his bed s feet I was indeed sensibly affected with his condition and with the apprehension of losing such a friend as he was and was like to be to me and I used to sit and cry by him many hours together However at last he grew better and gave hopes that he would recover as indeed he did though very slowly Were it otherwise than what I am going to say I should not be backward to disclose it as it is apparent I have done in other cases in this account but I affirm that through all this conversation abating the freedom of coming into the chamber when I or he was in bed and abating the necessary offices of attending him night and day when he was sick there had not passed the least immodest word or action between us Oh that it had been so to the last After some time he gathered strength and grew well apace and I would have removed my pallet bed but he would not let me till he was able to venture himself without anybody to sit up with him and then I removed to my own chamber He took many occasions to express his sense of my tenderness and concern for him and when he grew quite well he made me a present of fifty guineas for my care and as he called it for hazarding my life to save his And now he made deep protestations of a sincere inviolable affection for me but all along attested it to be with the utmost reserve for my virtue and his own I told him I was fully satisfied of it He carried it that length that he protested to me that if he was naked in bed with me he would as sacredly preserve my virtue as he would defend it if I was assaulted by a ravisher I believed him and told him I did so but this did not satisfy him he would he said wait for some opportunity to give me an undoubted testimony of it It was a great while after this that I had occasion on my own business to go to Bristol upon which he hired me a coach and would go with me and did so and now indeed our intimacy increased From Bristol he carried me to Gloucester which was merely a journey of pleasure to take the air and here it was our hap to have no lodging in the inn but in one large chamber with two beds in it The master of the house going up with us to show his rooms and coming into that room said very frankly to him Sir it is none of my business to inquire whether the lady be your spouse or no but if not you may lie as honestly in these two beds as if you were in two chambers and with that he pulls a great curtain which drew quite across the room and effectually divided the beds Well says my friend very readily these beds will do and as for the rest we are too near akin to lie together though we may lodge near one another and this put an honest face on the thing too When we came to go to bed he decently went out of the room till I was in bed and then went to bed in the bed on his own side of the room but lay there talking to me a great while At last repeating his usual saying that he could lie naked in the bed with me and not offer me the least injury he starts out of his bed And now my dear says he you shall see how just I will be to you and that I can keep my word and away he comes to my bed I resisted a little but I must confess I should not have resisted him much if he had not made those promises at all so after a little struggle as I said I lay still and let him come to bed When he was there he took me in his arms and so I lay all night with him but he had no more to do with me or offered anything to me other than embracing me as I say in his arms no not the whole night but rose up and dressed him in the morning and left me as innocent for him as I was the day I was born This was a surprising thing to me and perhaps may be so to others who know how the laws of nature work for he was a strong vigorous brisk person nor did he act thus on a principle of religion at all but of mere affection insisting on it that though I was to him to most agreeable woman in the world yet because he loved me he could not injure me I own it was a noble principle but as it was what I never understood before so it was to me perfectly amazing We traveled the rest of the journey as we did before and came back to the Bath where as he had opportunity to come to me when he would he often repeated the moderation and I frequently lay with him and he with me and although all the familiarities between man and wife were common to us yet he never once offered to go any farther and he valued himself much upon it I do not say that I was so wholly pleased with it as he thought I was for I own much wickeder than he as you shall hear presently We lived thus near two years only with this exception that he went three times to London in that time and once he continued there four months but to do him justice he always supplied me with money to subsist me very handsomely Had we continued thus I confess we had had much to boast of but as wise men say it is ill venturing too near the brink of a command so we found it and here again I must do him the justice to own that the first breach was not on his part It was one night that we were in bed together warm and merry and having drunk I think a little more wine that night both of us than usual although not in the least to disorder either of us when after some other follies which I cannot name and being clasped close in his arms I told him I repeat it with shame and horror of soul that I could find in my heart to discharge him of his engagement for one night and no more He took me at my word immediately and after that there was no resisting him neither indeed had I any mind to resist him any more let what would come of it Thus the government of our virtue was broken and I exchanged the place of friend for that unmusical harsh sounding title of whore In the morning we were both at our penitentials I cried very heartily he expressed himself very sorry but that was all either of us could do at that time and the way being thus cleared and the bars of virtue and conscience thus removed we had the less difficult afterwards to struggle with It was but a dull kind of conversation that we had together for all the rest of that week I looked on him with blushes and every now and then started that melancholy objection What if I should be with child now What will become of me then He encouraged me by telling me that as long as I was true to him he would be so to me and since it was gone such a length which indeed he never intended yet if I was with child he would take care of that and of me too This hardened us both I assured him if I was with child I would die for want of a midwife rather than name him as the father of it and he assured me I should never want if I should be with child These mutual assurances hardened us in the thing and after this we repeated the crime as often as we pleased till at length as I had feared so it came to pass and I was indeed with child After I was sure it was so and I had satisfied him of it too we began to think of taking measures for the managing it and I proposed trusting the secret to my landlady and asking her advice which he agreed to My landlady a woman as I found used to such things made light of it she said she knew it would come to that at last and made us very merry about it As I said above we found her an experienced old lady at such work she undertook everything engaged to procure a midwife and a nurse to satisfy all inquiries and bring us off with reputation and she did so very dexterously indeed When I grew near my time she desired my gentleman to go away to London or make as if he did so When he was gone she acquainted the parish officers that there was a lady ready to lie in at her house but that she knew her husband very well and gave them as she pretended an account of his name which she called Sir Walter Cleve telling them he was a very worthy gentleman and that she would answer for all inquiries and the like This satisfied the parish officers presently and I lay in with as much credit as I could have done if I had really been my Lady Cleve and was assisted in my travail by three or four of the best citizens wives of Bath who lived in the neighbourhood which however made me a little the more expensive to him I often expressed my concern to him about it but he bid me not be concerned at it As he had furnished me very sufficiently with money for the extraordinary expenses of my lying in I had everything very handsome about me but did not affect to be gay or extravagant neither besides knowing my own circumstances and knowing the world as I had done and that such kind of things do not often last long I took care to lay up as much money as I could for a wet day as I called it making him believe it was all spent upon the extraordinary appearance of things in my lying in By this means and including what he had given me as above I had at the end of my lying in about two hundred guineas by me including also what was left of my own I was brought to bed of a fine boy indeed and a charming child it was and when he heard of it he wrote me a very kind obliging letter about it and then told me he thought it would look better for me to come away for London as soon as I was up and well that he had provided apartments for me at Hammersmith as if I came thither only from London and that after a little while I should go back to the Bath and he would go with me I liked this offer very well and accordingly hired a coach on purpose and taking my child and a wet nurse to tend and suckle it and a maid servant with me away I went for London He met me at Reading in his own chariot and taking me into that left the servant and the child in the hired coach and so he brought me to my new lodgings at Hammersmith with which I had abundance of reason to be very well pleased for they were very handsome rooms and I was very well accommodated And now I was indeed in the height of what I might call my prosperity and I wanted nothing but to be a wife which however could not be in this case there was no room for it and therefore on all occasions I studied to save what I could as I have said above against a time of scarcity knowing well enough that such things as these do not always continue that men that keep mistresses often change them grow weary of them or jealous of them or something or other happens to make them withdraw their bounty and sometimes the ladies that are thus well used are not careful by a prudent conduct to preserve the esteem of their persons or the nice article of their fidelity and then they are justly cast off with contempt But I was secured in this point for as I had no inclination to change so I had no manner of acquaintance in the whole house and so no temptation to look any farther I kept no company but in the family when I lodged and with the clergyman s lady at next door so that when he was absent I visited nobody nor did he ever find me out of my chamber or parlour whenever he came down if I went anywhere to take the air it was always with him The living in this manner with him and his with me was certainly the most undesigned thing in the world he often protested to me that when he became first acquainted with me and even to the very night when we first broke in upon our rules he never had the least design of lying with me that he always had a sincere affection for me but not the least real inclination to do what he had done I assured him I never suspected him that if I had I should not so easily have yielded to the freedom which brought it on but that it was all a surprise and was owing to the accident of our having yielded too far to our mutual inclinations that night and indeed I have often observed since and leave it as a caution to the readers of this story that we ought to be cautious of gratifying our inclinations in loose and lewd freedoms lest we find our resolutions of virtue fail us in the junction when their assistance should be most necessary It is true and I have confessed it before that from the first hour I began to converse with him I resolved to let him lie with me if he offered it but it was because I wanted his help and assistance and I knew no other way of securing him than that But when were that night together and as I have said had gone such a length I found my weakness the inclination was not to be resisted but I was obliged to yield up all even before he asked it However he was so just to me that he never upbraided me with that nor did he ever express the least dislike of my conduct on any other occasion but always protested he was as much delighted with my company as he was the first hour we came together I mean came together as bedfellows It is true that he had no wife that is to say she was as no wife to him and so I was in no danger that way but the just reflections of conscience oftentimes snatch a man especially a man of sense from the arms of a mistress as it did him at last though on another occasion On the other hand though I was not without secret reproaches of my own conscience for the life I led and that even in the greatest height of the satisfaction I ever took yet I had the terrible prospect of poverty and starving which lay on me as a frightful spectre so that there was no looking behind me But as poverty brought me into it so fear of poverty kept me in it and I frequently resolved to leave it quite off if I could but come to lay up money enough to maintain me But these were thoughts of no weight and whenever he came to me they vanished for his company was so delightful that there was no being melancholy when he was there the reflections were all the subject of those hours when I was alone I lived six years in this happy but unhappy condition in which time I brought him three children but only the first of them lived and though I removed twice in those six years yet I came back the sixth year to my first lodgings at Hammersmith Here it was that I was one morning surprised with a kind but melancholy letter from my gentleman intimating that he was very ill and was afraid he should have another fit of sickness but that his wife s relations being in the house with him it would not be practicable to have me with him which however he expressed his great dissatisfaction in and that he wished I could be allowed to tend and nurse him as I did before I was very much concerned at this account and was very impatient to know how it was with him I waited a fortnight or thereabouts and heard nothing which surprised me and I began to be very uneasy indeed I think I may say that for the next fortnight I was near to distracted It was my particular difficulty that I did not know directly where he was for I understood at first he was in the lodgings of his wife s mother but having removed myself to London I soon found by the help of the direction I had for writing my letters to him how to inquire after him and there I found that he was at a house in Bloomsbury whither he had a little before he fell sick removed his whole family and that his wife and wife s mother were in the same house though the wife was not suffered to know that she was in the same house with her husband Here I also soon understood that he was at the last extremity which made me almost at the last extremity too to have a true account One night I had the curiosity to disguise myself like a servant maid in a round cap and straw hat and went to the door as sent by a lady of his neighbourhood where he lived before and giving master and mistress s service I said I was sent to know how mister did and how he had rested that night In delivering this message I got the opportunity I desired for speaking with one of the maids I held a long gossip s tale with her and had all the particulars of his illness which I found was a pleurisy attended with a cough and a fever She told me also who was in the house and how his wife was who by her relation they were in some hopes might recover her understanding but as to the gentleman himself in short she told me the doctors said there was very little hopes of him that in the morning they thought he had been dying and that he was but little better then for they did not expect that he could live over the next night This was heavy news for me and I began now to see an end of my prosperity and to see also that it was very well I had played to good housewife and secured or saved something while he was alive for that now I had no view of my own living before me It lay very heavy upon my mind too that I had a son a fine lovely boy about five years old and no provision made for it at least that I knew of With these considerations and a sad heart I went home that evening and began to cast with myself how I should live and in what manner to bestow myself for the residue of my life You may be sure I could not rest without inquiring again very quickly what was become of him and not venturing to go myself I sent several sham messengers till after a fortnight s waiting longer I found that there was hopes of his life though he was still very ill then I abated my sending any more to the house and in some time after I learned in the neighbourhood that he was about house and then that he was abroad again I made no doubt then but that I should soon hear of him and began to comfort myself with my circumstances being as I thought recovered I waited a week and two weeks and with much surprise and amazement I waited near two months and heard nothing but that being recovered he was gone into the country for the air and for the better recovery after his distemper After this it was yet two months more and then I understood he was come to his city house again but still I heard nothing from him I had written several letters for him and directed them as usual and found two or three of them had been called for but not the rest I wrote again in a more pressing manner than ever and in one of them let him know that I must be forced to wait on him myself representing my circumstances the rent of lodgings to pay and the provision for the child wanting and my own deplorable condition destitute of subsistence for his most solemn engagement to take care of and provide for me I took a copy of this letter and finding it lay at the house near a month and was not called for I found means to have the copy of it put into his own hands at a coffee house where I had by inquiry found he used to go This letter forced an answer from him by which though I found I was to be abandoned yet I found he had sent a letter to me some time before desiring me to go down to the Bath again Its contents I shall come to presently It is true that sick beds are the time when such correspondences as this are looked on with different countenances and seen with other eyes than we saw them with or than they appeared with before My lover had been at the gates of death and at the very brink of eternity and it seems had been struck with a due remorse and with sad reflections upon his past life of gallantry and levity and among the rest criminal correspondence with me which was neither more nor less than a long continued life of adultery and represented itself as it really was not as it had been formerly thought by him to be and he looked upon it now with a just and religious abhorrence I cannot but observe also and leave it for the direction of my sex in such cases of pleasure that whenever sincere repentance succeeds such a crime as this there never fails to attend a hatred of the object and the more the affection might seem to be before the hatred will be the more in proportion It will always be so indeed it can be no otherwise for there cannot be a true and sincere abhorrence of the offence and the love to the cause of it remain there will with an abhorrence of the sin be found a detestation of the fellow sinner you can expect no other I found it so here though good manners and justice in this gentleman kept him from carrying it on to any extreme but the short history of his part in this affair was thus he perceived by my last letter and by all the rest which he went for after that I was not gone to Bath that his first letter had not come to my hand upon which he write me this following MADAM I am surprised that my letter dated the eighth of last month did not come to your hand I give you my word it was delivered at your lodgings and to the hands of your maid I need not acquaint you with what has been my condition for some time past and how having been at the edge of the grave I am by the unexpected and undeserved mercy of Heaven restored again In the condition I have been in it cannot be strange to you that our unhappy correspondence had not been the least of the burthens which lay upon my conscience I need say no more those things that must be repented of must be also reformed I wish you would think of going back to the Bath I enclose you here a bill for fifty for clearing yourself at your lodgings and carrying you down and hope it will be no surprise to you to add that on this account only and not for any offence given me on your side I can see you no more I will take due care of the child leave him where he is or take him with you as you please I wish you the like reflections and that they may be to your advantage I am et cetera I was struck with this letter as with a thousand wounds such as I cannot describe the reproaches of my own conscience were such as I cannot express for I was not blind to my own crime and I reflected that I might with less offence have continued with my brother and lived with him as a wife since there was no crime in our marriage on that score neither of us knowing it But I never once reflected that I was all this while a married woman a wife to mister the linen draper who though he had left me by the necessity of his circumstances had no power to discharge me from the marriage contract which was between us or to give me a legal liberty to marry again so that I had been no less than a whore and an adulteress all this while I then reproached myself with the liberties I had taken and how I had been a snare to this gentleman and that indeed I was principal in the crime that now he was mercifully snatched out of the gulf by a convincing work upon his mind but that I was left as if I was forsaken of God s grace and abandoned by Heaven to a continuing in my wickedness Under these reflections I continued very pensive and sad for near month and did not go down to the Bath having no inclination to be with the woman whom I was with before lest as I thought she should prompt me to some wicked course of life again as she had done and besides I was very loth she should know I was cast off as above And now I was greatly perplexed about my little boy It was death to me to part with the child and yet when I considered the danger of being one time or other left with him to keep without a maintenance to support him I then resolved to leave him where he was but then I concluded also to be near him myself too that I then might have the satisfaction of seeing him without the care of providing for him I sent my gentleman a short letter therefore that I had obeyed his orders in all things but that of going back to the Bath which I could not think of for many reasons that however parting from him was a wound to me that I could never recover yet that I was fully satisfied his reflections were just and would be very far from desiring to obstruct his reformation or repentance Then I represented my own circumstances to him in the most moving terms that I was able I told him that those unhappy distresses which first moved him to a generous and an honest friendship for me would I hope move him to a little concern for me now though the criminal part of our correspondence which I believed neither of us intended to fall into at the time was broken off that I desired to repent as sincerely as he had done but entreated him to put me in some condition that I might not be exposed to the temptations which the devil never fails to excite us to from the frightful prospect of poverty and distress and if he had the least apprehensions of my being troublesome to him I begged he would put me in a posture to go back to my mother in Virginia from when he knew I came and that would put an end to all his fears on that account I concluded that if he would send me fifty more to facilitate my going away I would send him back a general release and would promise never to disturb him more with any importunities unless it was to hear of the well doing of the child whom if I found my mother living and my circumstances able I would send for to come over to me and take him also effectually off his hands This was indeed all a cheat thus far viz that I had no intention to go to Virginia as the account of my former affairs there may convince anybody of but the business was to get this last fifty of him if possible knowing well enough it would be the last penny I was ever to expect However the argument I used namely of giving him a general release and never troubling him any more prevailed effectually with him and he sent me a bill for the money by a person who brought with him a general release for me to sign and which I frankly signed and received the money and thus though full sore against my will a final end was put to this affair And here I cannot but reflect upon the unhappy consequence of too great freedoms between persons stated as we were upon the pretence of innocent intentions love of friendship and the like for the flesh has generally so great a share in those friendships that is great odds but inclination prevails at last over the most solemn resolutions and that vice breaks in at the breaches of decency which really innocent friendship ought to preserve with the greatest strictness But I leave the readers of these things to their own just reflections which they will be more able to make effectual than I who so soon forgot myself and am therefore but a very indifferent monitor I was now a single person again as I may call myself I was loosed from all the obligations either of wedlock or mistress ship in the world except my husband the linen draper whom I having not now heard from in almost fifteen years nobody could blame me for thinking myself entirely freed from seeing also he had at his going away told me that if I did not hear frequently from him I should conclude he was dead and I might freely marry again to whom I pleased I now began to cast up my accounts I had by many letters and much importunity and with the intercession of my mother too had a second return of some goods from my brother as I now call him in Virginia to make up the damage of the cargo I brought away with me and this too was upon the condition of my sealing a general release to him and to send it him by his correspondent at Bristol which though I thought hard of yet I was obliged to promise to do However I managed so well in this case that I got my goods away before the release was signed and then I always found something or other to say to evade the thing and to put off the signing it at all till at length I pretended I must write to my brother and have his answer before I could do it Including this recruit and before I got the last fifty I found my strength to amount put all together to about four hundred so that with that I had about four hundred fifty I had saved above one hundred more but I met with a disaster with that which was this that a goldsmith in whose hands I had trusted it broke so I lost seventy of my money the man s composition not making above thirty out of his one hundred I had a little plate but not much and was well enough stocked with clothes and linen With this stock I had the world to begin again but you are to consider that I was not now the same woman as when I lived at Redriff for first of all I was near twenty years older and did not look the better for my age nor for my rambles to Virginia and back again and though I omitted nothing that might set me out to advantage except painting for that I never stooped to and had pride enough to think I did not want it yet there would always be some difference seen between five and twenty and two and forty I cast about innumerable ways for my future state of life and began to consider very seriously what I should do but nothing offered I took care to make the world take me for something more than I was and had it given out that I was a fortune and that my estate was in my own hands the last of which was very true the first of it was as above I had no acquaintance which was one of my worst misfortunes and the consequence of that was I had no adviser at least who could assist and advise together and above all I had nobody to whom I could in confidence commit the secret of my circumstances to and could depend upon for their secrecy and fidelity and I found by experience that to be friendless is the worst condition next to being in want that a woman can be reduced to I say a woman because tis evident men can be their own advisers and their own directors and know how to work themselves out of difficulties and into business better than women but if a woman has no friend to communicate her affairs to and to advise and assist her tis ten to one but she is undone nay and the more money she has the more danger she is in of being wronged and deceived and this was my case in the affair of the one hundred which I left in the hands of the goldsmith as above whose credit it seems was upon the ebb before but I that had no knowledge of things and nobody to consult with knew nothing of it and so lost my money In the next place when a woman is thus left desolate and void of counsel she is just like a bag of money or a jewel dropped on the highway which is a prey to the next comer if a man of virtue and upright principles happens to find it he will have it cried and the owner may come to hear of it again but how many times shall such a thing fall into hands that will make no scruple of seizing it for their own to once that it shall come into good hands This was evidently my case for I was now a loose unguided creature and had no help no assistance no guide for my conduct I knew what I aimed at and what I wanted but knew nothing how to pursue the end by direct means I wanted to be placed in a settle state of living and had I happened to meet with a sober good husband I should have been as faithful and true a wife to him as virtue itself could have formed If I had been otherwise the vice came in always at the door of necessity not at the door of inclination and I understood too well by the want of it what the value of a settled life was to do anything to forfeit the felicity of it nay I should have made the better wife for all the difficulties I had passed through by a great deal nor did I in any of the time that I had been a wife give my husbands the least uneasiness on account of my behaviour But all this was nothing I found no encouraging prospect I waited I lived regularly and with as much frugality as became my circumstances but nothing offered nothing presented and the main stock wasted apace What to do I knew not the terror of approaching poverty lay hard upon my spirits I had some money but where to place it I knew not nor would the interest of it maintain me at least not in London At length a new scene opened There was in the house where I lodged a north country woman that went for a gentlewoman and nothing was more frequent in her discourse than her account of the cheapness of provisions and the easy way of living in her country how plentiful and how cheap everything was what good company they kept and the like till at last I told her she almost tempted me to go and live in her country for I that was a widow though I had sufficient to live on yet had no way of increasing it and that I found I could not live here under one hundred a year unless I kept no company no servant made no appearance and buried myself in privacy as if I was obliged to it by necessity I should have observed that she was always made to believe as everybody else was that I was a great fortune or at least that I had three or four thousand pounds if not more and all in my own hands and she was mighty sweet upon me when she thought me inclined in the least to go into her country She said she had a sister lived near Liverpool that her brother was a considerable gentleman there and had a great estate also in Ireland that she would go down there in about two months and if I would give her my company thither I should be as welcome as herself for a month or more as I pleased till I should see how I liked the country and if I thought fit to live there she would undertake they would take care though they did not entertain lodgers themselves they would recommend me to some agreeable family where I should be placed to my content If this woman had known my real circumstances she would never have laid so many snares and taken so many weary steps to catch a poor desolate creature that was good for little when it was caught and indeed I whose case was almost desperate and thought I could not be much worse was not very anxious about what might befall me provided they did me no personal injury so I suffered myself though not without a great deal of invitation and great professions of sincere friendship and real kindness I say I suffered myself to be prevailed upon to go with her and accordingly I packed up my baggage and put myself in a posture for a journey though I did not absolutely know whither I was to go And now I found myself in great distress what little I had in the world was all in money except as before a little plate some linen and my clothes as for my household stuff I had little or none for I had lived always in lodgings but I had not one friend in the world with whom to trust that little I had or to direct me how to dispose of it and this perplexed me night and day I thought of the bank and of the other companies in London but I had no friend to commit the management of it to and keep and carry about with me bank bills tallies orders and such things I looked upon at as unsafe that if they were lost my money was lost and then I was undone and on the other hand I might be robbed and perhaps murdered in a strange place for them This perplexed me strangely and what to do I knew not It came in my thoughts one morning that I would go to the bank myself where I had often been to receive the interest of some bills I had which had interest payable on them and where I had found a clerk to whom I applied myself very honest and just to me and particularly so fair one time that when I had mistold my money and taken less than my due and was coming away he set me to rights and gave me the rest which he might have put into his own pocket I went to him and represented my case very plainly and asked if he would trouble himself to be my adviser who was a poor friendless widow and knew not what to do He told me if I desired his opinion of anything within the reach of his business he would do his endeavour that I should not be wronged but that he would also help me to a good sober person who was a grave man of his acquaintance who was a clerk in such business too though not in their house whose judgment was good and whose honesty I might depend upon For added he I will answer for him and for every step he takes if he wrongs you madam of one farthing it shall lie at my door I will make it good and he delights to assist people in such cases he does it as an act of charity I was a little at a stand in this discourse but after some pause I told him I had rather have depended upon him because I had found him honest but if that could not be I would take his recommendation sooner than any one s else I dare say madam says he that you will be as well satisfied with my friend as with me and he is thoroughly able to assist you which I am not It seems he had his hands full of the business of the bank and had engaged to meddle with no other business that that of his office which I heard afterwards but did not understand then He added that his friend should take nothing of me for his advice or assistance and this indeed encouraged me very much He appointed the same evening after the bank was shut and business over for me to meet him and his friend And indeed as soon as I saw his friend and he began but to talk of the affair I was fully satisfied that I had a very honest man to deal with his countenance spoke it and his character as I heard afterwards was everywhere so good that I had no room for any more doubts upon me After the first meeting in which I only said what I had said before we parted and he appointed me to come the next day to him telling me I might in the meantime satisfy myself of him by inquiry which however I knew not how well to do having no acquaintance myself Accordingly I met him the next day when I entered more freely with him into my case I told him my circumstances at large that I was a widow come over from America perfectly desolate and friendless that I had a little money and but a little and was almost distracted for fear of losing it having no friend in the world to trust with the management of it that I was going into the north of England to live cheap that my stock might not waste that I would willingly lodge my money in the bank but that I durst not carry the bills about me and the like as above and how to correspond about it or with whom I knew not He told me I might lodge the money in the bank as an account and its being entered into the books would entitle me to the money at any time and if I was in the north I might draw bills on the cashier and receive it when I would but that then it would be esteemed as running cash and the bank would give no interest for it that I might buy stock with it and so it would lie in store for me but that then if I wanted to dispose if it I must come up to town on purpose to transfer it and even it would be with some difficulty I should receive the half yearly dividend unless I was here in person or had some friend I could trust with having the stock in his name to do it for me and that would have the same difficulty in it as before and with that he looked hard at me and smiled a little At last says he Why do you not get a head steward madam that may take you and your money together into keeping and then you would have the trouble taken off your hands Ay sir and the money too it may be said I for truly I find the hazard that way is as much as tis t other way but I remember I said secretly to myself I wish you would ask me the question fairly I would consider very seriously on it before I said No He went on a good way with me and I thought once or twice he was in earnest but to my real affliction I found at last he had a wife but when he owned he had a wife he shook his head and said with some concern that indeed he had a wife and no wife I began to think he had been in the condition of my late lover and that his wife had been distempered or lunatic or some such thing However we had not much more discourse at that time but he told me he was in too much hurry of business then but that if I would come home to his house after their business was over he would by that time consider what might be done for me to put my affairs in a posture of security I told him I would come and desired to know where he lived He gave me a direction in writing and when he gave it me he read it to me and said There tis madam if you dare trust yourself with me Yes sir said I I believe I may venture to trust you with myself for you have a wife you say and I don t want a husband besides I dare trust you with my money which is all I have in the world and if that were gone I may trust myself anywhere He said some things in jest that were very handsome and mannerly and would have pleased me very well if they had been in earnest but that passed over I took the directions and appointed to attend him at his house at seven o clock the same evening When I came he made several proposals for my placing my money in the bank in order to my having interest for it but still some difficulty or other came in the way which he objected as not safe and I found such a sincere disinterested honesty in him that I began to muse with myself that I had certainly found the honest man I wanted and that I could never put myself into better hands so I told him with a great deal of frankness that I had never met with a man or woman yet that I could trust or in whom I could think myself safe but that I saw he was so disinterestedly concerned for my safety that I said I would freely trust him with the management of that little I had if he would accept to be steward for a poor widow that could give him no salary He smiled and standing up with great respect saluted me He told me he could not but take it very kindly that I had so good an opinion of him that he would not deceive me that he would do anything in his power to serve me and expect no salary but that he could not by any means accept of a trust that it might bring him to be suspected of self interest and that if I should die he might have disputes with my executors which he should be very loth to encumber himself with I told him if those were all his objections I would soon remove them and convince him that there was not the least room for any difficulty for that first as for suspecting him if ever I should do it now is the time to suspect him and not put the trust into his hands and whenever I did suspect him he could but throw it up then and refuse to go any further Then as to executors I assured him I had no heirs nor any relations in England and I should alter my condition before I died and then his trust and trouble should cease together which however I had no prospect of yet but I told him if I died as I was it should be all his own and he would deserve it by being so faithful to me as I was satisfied he would be He changed his countenance at this discourse and asked me how I came to have so much good will for him and looking very much pleased said he might very lawfully wish he was a single man for my sake I smiled and told him as he was not my offer could have no design upon him in it and to wish as he did was not to be allowed twas criminal to his wife He told me I was wrong For says he madam as I said before I have a wife and no wife and twould be no sin to me to wish her hanged if that were all I know nothing of your circumstances that way sir said I but it cannot be innocent to wish your wife dead I tell you says he again she is a wife and no wife you don t know what I am or what she is That s true said I sir I do not know what you are but I believe you to be an honest man and that s the cause of all my confidence in you Well well says he and so I am I hope too But I am something else too madam for says he to be plain with you I am a cuckold and she is a whore He spoke it in a kind of jest but it was with such an awkward smile that I perceived it was what struck very close to him and he looked dismally when he said it That alters the case indeed sir said I as to that part you were speaking of but a cuckold you know may be an honest man it does not alter that case at all Besides I think said I since your wife is so dishonest to you you are too honest to her to own her for your wife but that said I is what I have nothing to do with Nay says he I do not think to clear my hands of her for to be plain with you madam added he I am no contended cuckold neither on the other hand I assure you it provokes me the highest degree but I can t help myself she that will be a whore will be a whore I waived the discourse and began to talk of my business but I found he could not have done with it so I let him alone and he went on to tell me all the circumstances of his case too long to relate here particularly that having been out of England some time before he came to the post he was in she had had two children in the meantime by an officer of the army and that when he came to England and upon her submission took her again and maintained her very well yet she ran away from him with a linen draper s apprentice robbed him of what she could come at and continued to live from him still So that madam says he she is a whore not by necessity which is the common bait of your sex but by inclination and for the sake of the vice Well I pitied him and wished him well rid of her and still would have talked of my business but it would not do At last he looks steadily at me Look you madam says he you came to ask advice of me and I will serve you as faithfully as if you were my own sister but I must turn the tables since you oblige me to do it and are so friendly to me and I think I must ask advice of you Tell me what must a poor abused fellow do with a whore What can I do to do myself justice upon her Alas sir says I tis a case too nice for me to advise in but it seems she has run away from you so you are rid of her fairly what can you desire more Ay she is gone indeed said he but I am not clear of her for all that That s true says I she may indeed run you into debt but the law has furnished you with methods to prevent that also you may cry her down as they call it No no says he that is not the case neither I have taken care of all that tis not that part that I speak of but I would be rid of her so that I might marry again Well sir says I then you must divorce her If you can prove what you say you may certainly get that done and then I suppose you are free That s very tedious and expensive says he Why says I if you can get any woman you like to take your word I suppose your wife would not dispute the liberty with you that she takes herself Ay says he but twould be hard to bring an honest woman to do that and for the other sort says he I have had enough of her to meddle with any more whores It occurred to me presently I would have taken your word with all my heart if you had but asked me the question but that was to myself To him I replied Why you shut the door against any honest woman accepting you for you condemn all that should venture upon you at once and conclude that really a woman that takes you now can t be honest Why says he I wish you would satisfy me that an honest woman would take me I d venture it and then turns short upon me Will you take me madam That s not a fair question says I after what you have said however lest you should think I wait only for a recantation of it I shall answer you plainly No not I my business is of another kind with you and I did not expect you would have turned my serious application to you in my own distracted case into a comedy Why madam says he my case is as distracted as yours can be and I stand in as much need of advice as you do for I think if I have not relief somewhere I shall be made myself and I know not what course to take I protest to you Why sir says I tis easy to give advice in your case much easier than it is in mine Speak then says he I beg of you for now you encourage me Why says I if your case is so plain as you say it is you may be legally divorced and then you may find honest women enough to ask the question of fairly the sex is not so scarce that you can want a wife Well then said he I am in earnest I ll take your advice but shall I ask you one question seriously beforehand Any question said I but that you did before No that answer will not do said he for in short that is the question I shall ask You may ask what questions you please but you have my answer to that already said I Besides sir said I can you think so ill of me as that I would give any answer to such a question beforehand Can any woman alive believe you in earnest or think you design anything but to banter her Well well says he I do not banter you I am in earnest consider of it But sir says I a little gravely I came to you about my own business I beg of you to let me know what you will advise me to do I will be prepared says he against you come again Nay says I you have forbid my coming any more Why so said he and looked a little surprised Because said I you can t expect I should visit you on the account you talk of Well says he you shall promise me to come again however and I will not say any more of it till I have gotten the divorce but I desire you will prepare to be better conditioned when that s done for you shall be the woman or I will not be divorced at all why I owe it to your unlooked for kindness if it were to nothing else but I have other reasons too He could not have said anything in the world that pleased me better however I knew that the way to secure him was to stand off while the thing was so remote as it appeared to be and that it was time enough to accept of it when he was able to perform it so I said very respectfully to him it was time enough to consider of these things when he was in a condition to talk of them in the meantime I told him I was going a great way from him and he would find objects enough to please him better We broke off here for the present and he made me promise him to come again the next day for his resolutions upon my own business which after some pressing I did though had he seen farther into me I wanted no pressing on that account I came the next evening accordingly and brought my maid with me to let him see that I kept a maid but I sent her away as soon as I was gone in He would have had me let the maid have stayed but I would not but ordered her aloud to come for me again about nine o clock But he forbade that and told me he would see me safe home which by the way I was not very well please with supposing he might do that to know where I lived and inquire into my character and circumstances However I ventured that for all that the people there or thereabout knew of me was to my advantage and all the character he had of me after he had inquired was that I was a woman of fortune and that I was a very modest sober body which whether true or not in the main yet you may see how necessary it is for all women who expect anything in the world to preserve the character of their virtue even when perhaps they may have sacrificed the thing itself I found and was not a little please with it that he had provided a supper for me I found also he lived very handsomely and had a house very handsomely furnished all of which I was rejoiced at indeed for I looked upon it as all my own We had now a second conference upon the subject matter of the last conference He laid his business very home indeed he protested his affection to me and indeed I had no room to doubt it he declared that it began from the first moment I talked with him and long before I had mentioned leaving my effects with him Tis no matter when it began thought I if it will but hold twill be well enough He then told me how much the offer I had made of trusting him with my effects and leaving them to him had engaged him So I intended it should thought I but then I thought you had been a single man too After we had supped I observed he pressed me very hard to drink two or three glasses of wine which however I declined but drank one glass or two He then told me he had a proposal to make to me which I should promise him I would not take ill if I should not grant it I told him I hoped he would make no dishonourable proposal to me especially in his own house and that if it was such I desired he would not propose it that I might not be obliged to offer any resentment to him that did not become the respect I professed for him and the trust I had placed in him in coming to his house and begged of him he would give me leave to go away and accordingly began to put on my gloves and prepare to be gone though at the same time I no more intended it than he intended to let me Well he importuned me not to talk of going he assured me he had no dishonourable thing in his thoughts about me and was very far from offering anything to me that was dishonourable and if I thought so he would choose to say no more of it That part I did not relish at all I told him I was ready to hear anything that he had to say depending that he would say nothing unworthy of himself or unfit for me to hear Upon this he told me his proposal was this that I would marry him though he had not yet obtained the divorce from the whore his wife and to satisfy me that he meant honourably he would promise not to desire me to live with him or go to bed with him till the divorce was obtained My heart said yes to this offer at first word but it was necessary to play the hypocrite a little more with him so I seemed to decline the motion with some warmth and besides a little condemning the thing as unfair told him that such a proposal could be of no signification but to entangle us both in great difficulties for if he should not at last obtain the divorce yet we could not dissolve the marriage neither could we proceed in it so that if he was disappointed in the divorce I left him to consider what a condition we should both be in In short I carried on the argument against this so far that I convinced him it was not a proposal that had any sense in it Well then he went from it to another and that was that I would sign and seal a contract with him conditioning to marry him as soon as the divorce was obtained and to be void if he could not obtain it I told him such a thing was more rational than the other but as this was the first time that ever I could imagine him weak enough to be in earnest in this affair I did not use to say Yes at first asking I would consider of it I played with this lover as an angler does with a trout I found I had him fast on the hook so I jested with his new proposal and put him off I told him he knew little of me and bade him inquire about me I let him also go home with me to my lodging though I would not ask him to go in for I told him it was not decent In short I ventured to avoid signing a contract of marriage and the reason why I did it was because the lady that had invited me so earnestly to go with her into Lancashire insisted so positively upon it and promised me such great fortunes and such fine things there that I was tempted to go and try Perhaps said I I may mend myself very much and then I made no scruple in my thoughts of quitting my honest citizen whom I was not so much in love with as not to leave him for a richer In a word I avoided a contract but told him I would go into the north that he should know where to write to me by the consequence of the business I had entrusted with him that I would give him a sufficient pledge of my respect for him for I would leave almost all I had in the world in his hands and I would thus far give him my word that as soon as he had sued out a divorce from his first wife he would send me an account of it I would come up to London and that then we would talk seriously of the matter It was a base design I went with that I must confess though I was invited thither with a design much worse than mine was as the sequel will discover Well I went with my friend as I called her into Lancashire All the way we went she caressed me with the utmost appearance of a sincere undissembled affection treated me except my coach hire all the way and her brother brought a gentleman s coach to Warrington to receive us and we were carried from thence to Liverpool with as much ceremony as I could desire We were also entertained at a merchant s house in Liverpool three or four days very handsomely I forbear to tell his name because of what followed Then she told me she would carry me to an uncle s house of hers where we should be nobly entertained She did so her uncle as she called him sent a coach and four horses for us and we were carried near forty miles I know not whither We came however to a gentleman s seat where was a numerous family a large park extraordinary company indeed and where she was called cousin I told her if she had resolved to bring me into such company as this she should have let me have prepared myself and have furnished myself with better clothes The ladies took notice of that and told me very genteelly they did not value people in their country so much by their clothes as they did in London that their cousin had fully informed them of my quality and that I did not want clothes to set me off in short they entertained me not like what I was but like what they thought I had been namely a widow lady of a great fortune The first discovery I made here was that the family were all Roman Catholics and the cousin too whom I called my friend however I must say that nobody in the world could behave better to me and I had all the civility shown me that I could have had if I had been of their opinion The truth is I had not so much principle of any kind as to be nice in point of religion and I presently learned to speak favourably of the Romish Church particularly I told them I saw little but the prejudice of education in all the difference that were among Christians about religion and if it had so happened that my father had been a Roman Catholic I doubted not but I should have been as well pleased with their religion as my own This obliged them in the highest degree and as I was besieged day and night with good company and pleasant discourse so I had two or three old ladies that lay at me upon the subject of religion too I was so complaisant that though I would not completely engage yet I made no scruple to be present at their mass and to conform to all their gestures as they showed me the pattern but I would not come too cheap so that I only in the main encouraged them to expect that I would turn Roman Catholic if I was instructed in the Catholic doctrine as they called it and so the matter rested I stayed here about six weeks and then my conductor led me back to a country village about six miles from Liverpool where her brother as she called him came to visit me in his own chariot and in a very good figure with two footmen in a good livery and the next thing was to make love to me As it had happened to me one would think I could not have been cheated and indeed I thought so myself having a safe card at home which I resolved not to quit unless I could mend myself very much However in all appearance this brother was a match worth my listening to and the least his estate was valued at was one thousand a year but the sister said it was worth fifteen hundred a year and lay most of it in Ireland I that was a great fortune and passed for such was above being asked how much my estate was and my false friend taking it upon a foolish hearsay had raised it from five hundred to five thousand and by the time she came into the country she called it fifteen thousand The Irishman for such I understood him to be was stark mad at this bait in short he courted me made me presents and ran in debt like a madman for the expenses of his equipage and of his courtship He had to give him his due the appearance of an extraordinary fine gentleman he was tall well shaped and had an extraordinary address talked as naturally of his park and his stables of his horses his gamekeepers his woods his tenants and his servants as if we had been in the mansion house and I had seen them all about me He never so much as asked me about my fortune or estate but assured me that when we came to Dublin he would jointure me in six hundred a year good land and that we could enter into a deed of settlement or contract here for the performance of it This was such language indeed as I had not been used to and I was here beaten out of all my measures I had a she devil in my bosom every hour telling me how great her brother lived One time she would come for my orders how I would have my coaches painted and how lined and another time what clothes my page should wear in short my eyes were dazzled I had now lost my power of saying No and to cut the story short I consented to be married but to be the more private we were carried farther into the country and married by a Romish clergyman who I was assured would marry us as effectually as a Church of England parson I cannot say but I had some reflections in this affair upon the dishonourable forsaking my faithful citizen who loved me sincerely and who was endeavouring to quit himself of a scandalous whore by whom he had been indeed barbarously used and promised himself infinite happiness in his new choice which choice was now giving up herself to another in a manner almost as scandalous as hers could be But the glittering shoe of a great estate and of fine things which the deceived creature that was now my deceiver represented every hour to my imagination hurried me away and gave me no time to think of London or of anything there much less of the obligation I had to a person of infinitely more real merit than what was now before me But the thing was done I was now in the arms of my new spouse who appeared still the same as before great even to magnificence and nothing less than one thousand a year could support the ordinary equipage he appeared in After we had been married about a month he began to talk of my going to West Chester in order to embark for Ireland However he did not hurry me for we stayed near three weeks longer and then he sent to Chester for a coach to meet us at the Black Rock as they call it over against Liverpool Thither we went in a fine boat they call a pinnace with six oars his servants and horses and baggage going in the ferry boat He made his excuse to me that he had no acquaintance in Chester but he would go before and get some handsome apartment for me at a private house I asked him how long we should stay at Chester He said not at all any longer than one night or two but he would immediately hire a coach to go to Holyhead Then I told him he should by no means give himself the trouble to get private lodgings for one night or two for that Chester being a great place I made no doubt but there would be very good inns and accommodation enough so we lodged at an inn in the West Street not far from the Cathedral I forget what sign it was at Here my spouse talking of my going to Ireland asked me if I had no affairs to settle at London before we went off I told him No not of any great consequence but what might be done as well by letter from Dublin Madam says he very respectfully I suppose the greatest part of your estate which my sister tells me is most of it in money in the Bank of England lies secure enough but in case it required transferring or any way altering its property it might be necessary to go up to London and settle those things before we went over I seemed to look strange at it and told him I knew not what he meant that I had no effects in the Bank of England that I knew of and I hoped he could not say that I had ever told him I had No he said I had not told him so but his sister had said the greatest part of my estate lay there And I only mentioned it me dear said he that if there was any occasion to settle it or order anything about it we might not be obliged to the hazard and trouble of another voyage back again for he added that he did not care to venture me too much upon the sea I was surprised at this talk and began to consider very seriously what the meaning of it must be and it presently occurred to me that my friend who called him brother had represented me in colours which were not my due and I thought since it was come to that pitch that I would know the bottom of it before I went out of England and before I should put myself into I knew not whose hands in a strange country Upon this I called his sister into my chamber the next morning and letting her know the discourse her brother and I had been upon the evening before I conjured her to tell me what she had said to him and upon what foot it was that she had made this marriage She owned that she had told him that I was a great fortune and said that she was told so at London Told so says I warmly did I ever tell you so No she said it was true I did not tell her so but I had said several times that what I had was in my own disposal I did so returned I very quickly and hastily but I never told you I had anything called a fortune no not that I had one hundred or the value of one hundred in the world Any how did it consist with my being a fortune said I that I should come here into the north of England with you only upon the account of living cheap At these words which I spoke warm and high my husband her brother as she called him came into the room and I desired him to come and sit down for I had something of moment to say before them both which it was absolutely necessary he should hear He looked a little disturbed at the assurance with which I seemed to speak it and came and sat down by me having first shut the door upon which I began for I was very much provoked and turning myself to him I am afraid says I my dear for I spoke with kindness on his side that you have a very great abuse put upon you and an injury done you never to be repaired in your marrying me which however as I have had no hand in it I desire I may be fairly acquitted of it and that the blame may lie where it ought to lie and nowhere else for I wash my hands of every part of it What injury can be done me my dear says he in marrying you I hope it is to my honour and advantage every way I will soon explain it to you says I and I fear you will have no reason to think yourself well used but I will convince you my dear says I again that I have had no hand in it and there I stopped a while He looked now scared and wild and began I believe to suspect what followed however looking towards me and saying only Go on he sat silent as if to hear what I had more to say so I went on I asked you last night said I speaking to him if ever I made any boast to you of my estate or ever told you I had any estate in the Bank of England or anywhere else and you owned I had not as is most true and I desire you will tell me here before your sister if ever I gave you any reason from me to think so or that ever we had any discourse about it and he owned again I had not but said I had appeared always as a woman of fortune and he depended on it that I was so and hoped he was not deceived I am not inquiring yet whether you have been deceived or not said I I fear you have and I too but I am clearing myself from the unjust charge of being concerned in deceiving you I have been now asking your sister if ever I told her of any fortune or estate I had or gave her any particulars of it and she owns I never did Any pray madam said I turning myself to her be so just to me before your brother to charge me if you can if ever I pretended to you that I had an estate and why if I had should I come down into this country with you on purpose to spare that little I had and live cheap She could not deny one word but said she had been told in London that I had a very great fortune and that it lay in the Bank of England And now dear sir said I turning myself to my new spouse again be so just to me as to tell me who has abused both you and me so much as to make you believe I was a fortune and prompt you to court me to this marriage He could not speak a word but pointed to her and after some more pause flew out in the most furious passion that ever I saw a man in my life cursing her and calling her all the whores and hard names he could think of and that she had ruined him declaring that she had told him I had fifteen thousand and that she was to have five hundred of him for procuring this match for him He then added directing his speech to me that she was none of his sister but had been his whore for two years before that she had had one hundred of him in part of this bargain and that he was utterly undone if things were as I said and in his raving he swore he would let her heart s blood out immediately which frightened her and me too She cried said she had been told so in the house where I lodged But this aggravated him more than before that she should put so far upon him and run things such a length upon no other authority than a hearsay and then turning to me again said very honestly he was afraid we were both undone For to be plain my dear I have no estate says he what little I had this devil has made me run out in waiting on you and putting me into this equipage She took the opportunity of his being earnest in talking with me and got out of the room and I never saw her more I was confounded now as much as he and knew not what to say I thought many ways that I had the worst of it but his saying he was undone and that he had no estate neither put me into a mere distraction Why says I to him this has been a hellish juggle for we are married here upon the foot of a double fraud you are undone by the disappointment it seems and if I had had a fortune I had been cheated too for you say you have nothing You would indeed have been cheated my dear says he but you would not have been undone for fifteen thousand would have maintained us both very handsomely in this country and I assure you added he I had resolved to have dedicated every groat of it to you I would not have wronged you of a shilling and the rest I would have made up in my affection to you and tenderness of you as long as I lived This was very honest indeed and I really believe he spoke as he intended and that he was a man that was as well qualified to make me happy as to his temper and behaviour as any man ever was but his having no estate and being run into debt on this ridiculous account in the country made all the prospect dismal and dreadful and I knew not what to say or what to think of myself I told him it was very unhappy that so much love and so much good nature as I discovered in him should be thus precipitated into misery that I saw nothing before us but ruin for as to me it was my unhappiness that what little I had was not able to relieve us week and with that I pulled out a bank bill of twenty and eleven guineas which I told him I had saved out of my little income and that by the account that creature had given me of the way of living in that country I expected it would maintain me three or four years that if it was taken from me I was left destitute and he knew what the condition of a woman among strangers must be if she had no money in her pocket however I told him if he would take it there it was He told me with a great concern and I thought I saw tears stand in his eyes that he would not touch it that he abhorred the thoughts of stripping me and make me miserable that on the contrary he had fifty guineas left which was all he had in the world and he pulled it out and threw it down on the table bidding me take it though he were to starve for want of it I returned with the same concern for him that I could not bear to hear him talk so that on the contrary if he could propose any probable method of living I would do anything that became me on my part and that I would live as close and as narrow as he could desire He begged of me to talk no more at that rate for it would make him distracted he said he was bred a gentleman though he was reduced to a low fortune and that there was but one way left which he could think of and that would not do unless I could answer him one question which however he said he would not press me to I told him I would answer it honestly whether it would be to his satisfaction or not that I could not tell Why then my dear tell me plainly says he will the little you have keep us together in any figure or in any station or place or will it not It was my happiness hitherto that I had not discovered myself or my circumstances at all no not so much as my name and seeing these was nothing to be expected from him however good humoured and however honest he seemed to be but to live on what I knew would soon be wasted I resolved to conceal everything but the bank bill and the eleven guineas which I had owned and I would have been very glad to have lost that and have been set down where he took me up I had indeed another bank bill about me of thirty which was the whole of what I brought with me as well to subsist on in the country as not knowing what might offer because this creature the go between that had thus betrayed us both had made me believe strange things of my marrying to my advantage in the country and I was not willing to be without money whatever might happen This bill I concealed and that made me the freer of the rest in consideration of his circumstances for I really pitied him heartily But to return to his question I told him I never willingly deceived him and I never would I was very sorry to tell him that the little I had would not subsist us that it was not sufficient to subsist me alone in the south country and that this was the reason that made me put myself into the hands of that woman who called him brother she having assured me that I might board very handsomely at a town called Manchester where I had not yet been for about six a year and my whole income not being about fifteen a year I thought I might live easy upon it and wait for better things He shook his head and remained silent and a very melancholy evening we had however we supped together and lay together that night and when we had almost supped he looked a little better and more cheerful and called for a bottle of wine Come my dear says he though the case is bad it is to no purpose to be dejected Come be as easy as you can I will endeavour to find out some way or other to live if you can but subsist yourself that is better than nothing I must try the world again a man ought to think like a man to be discouraged is to yield to the misfortune With this he filled a glass and drank to me holding my hand and pressing it hard in his hand all the while the wine went down and protesting afterwards his main concern was for me It was really a true gallant spirit he was of and it was the more grievous to me Tis something of relief even to be undone by a man of honour rather than by a scoundrel but here the greatest disappointment was on his side for he had really spent a great deal of money deluded by this madam the procuress and it was very remarkable on what poor terms he proceeded First the baseness of the creature herself is to be observed who for the getting one hundred herself could be content to let him spend three or four more though perhaps it was all he had in the world and more than all when she had not the least ground more than a little tea table chat to say that I had any estate or was a fortune or the like It is true the design of deluding a woman of fortune if I had been so was base enough the putting the face of great things upon poor circumstances was a fraud and bad enough but the case a little differed too and that in his favour for he was not a rake that made a trade to delude women and as some have done get six or seven fortunes after one another and then rifle and run away from them but he was really a gentleman unfortunate and low but had lived well and though if I had had a fortune I should have been enraged at the slut for betraying me yet really for the man a fortune would not have been ill bestowed on him for he was a lovely person indeed of generous principles good sense and of abundance of good humour We had a great deal of close conversation that night for we neither of us slept much he was as penitent for having put all those cheats upon me as if it had been felony and that he was going to execution he offered me again every shilling of the money he had about him and said he would go into the army and seek the world for more I asked him why he would be so unkind to carry me into Ireland when I might suppose he could not have subsisted me there He took me in his arms My dear said he depend upon it I never designed to go to Ireland at all much less to have carried you thither but came hither to be out of the observation of the people who had heard what I pretended to and withal that nobody might ask me for money before I was furnished to supply them But where then said I were we to have gone next Why my dear said he I ll confess the whole scheme to you as I had laid it I purposed here to ask you something about your estate as you see I did and when you as I expected you would had entered into some account with me of the particulars I would have made an excuse to you to have put off our voyage to Ireland for some time and to have gone first towards London Then my dear said he I resolved to have confessed all the circumstances of my own affairs to you and let you know I had indeed made use of these artifices to obtain your consent to marry me but had now nothing to do but ask to your pardon and to tell you how abundantly as I have said above I would endeavour to make you forget what was past by the felicity of the days to come Truly said I to him I find you would soon have conquered me and it is my affliction now that I am not in a condition to let you see how easily I should have been reconciled to you and have passed by all the tricks you had put upon me in recompense of so much good humour But my dear said I what can we do now We are both undone and what better are we for our being reconciled together seeing we have nothing to live on We proposed a great many things but nothing could offer where there was nothing to begin with He begged me at last to talk no more of it for he said I would break his heart so we talked of other things a little till at last he took a husband s leave of me and so we went to sleep He rose before me in the morning and indeed having lain awake almost all night I was very sleepy and lay till near eleven o clock In this time he took his horses and three servants and all his linen and baggage and away he went leaving a short but moving letter for me on the table as follows MY DEAR I am a dog I have abused you but I have been drawn into do it by a base creature contrary to my principle and the general practice of my life Forgive me my dear I ask your pardon with the greatest sincerity I am the most miserable of men in having deluded you I have been so happy to possess you and now am so wretched as to be forced to fly from you Forgive me my dear once more I say forgive me I am not able to see you ruined by me and myself unable to support you Our marriage is nothing I shall never be able to see you again I here discharge you from it if you can marry to your advantage do not decline it on my account I here swear to you on my faith and on the word of a man of honour I will never disturb your repose if I should know of it which however is not likely On the other hand if you should not marry and if good fortune should befall me it shall be all yours wherever you are I have put some of the stock of money I have left into your pocket take places for yourself and your maid in the stage coach and go for London I hope it will bear your charges thither without breaking into your own Again I sincerely ask your pardon and will do so as often as I shall ever think of you Adieu my dear for ever I am your most affectionately J E Nothing that ever befell me in my life sank so deep into my heart as this farewell I reproached him a thousand times in my thoughts for leaving me for I would have gone with him through the world if I had begged my bread I felt in my pocket and there found ten guineas his gold watch and two little rings one a small diamond ring worth only about six and the other a plain gold ring I sat me down and looked upon these things two hours together and scarce spoke a word till my maid interrupted me by telling me my dinner was ready I ate but little and after dinner I fell into a vehement fit of crying every now and then calling him by his name which was James O Jemmy said I come back come back I ll give you all I have I ll beg I ll starve with you And thus I ran raving about the room several times and then sat down between whiles and then walking about again called upon him to come back and then cried again and thus I passed the afternoon till about seven o clock when it was near dusk in the evening being August when to my unspeakable surprise he comes back into the inn but without a servant and comes directly up into my chamber I was in the greatest confusion imaginable and so was he too I could not imagine what should be the occasion of it and began to be at odds with myself whether to be glad or sorry but my affection biassed all the rest and it was impossible to conceal my joy which was too great for smiles for it burst out into tears He was no sooner entered the room but he ran to me and took me in his arms holding me fast and almost stopping my breath with his kisses but spoke not a word At length I began My dear said I how could you go away from me to which he gave no answer for it was impossible for him to speak When our ecstasies were a little over he told me he was gone about fifteen miles but it was not in his power to go any farther without coming back to see me again and to take his leave of me once more I told him how I had passed my time and how loud I had called him to come back again He told me he heard me very plain upon Delamere Forest at a place about twelve miles off I smiled Nay says he do not think I am in jest for if ever I heard your voice in my life I heard you call me aloud and sometimes I thought I saw you running after me Why said I what did I say for I had not named the words to him You called aloud says he and said O Jemmy O Jemmy come back come back I laughed at him My dear says he do not laugh for depend upon it I heard your voice as plain as you hear mine now if you please I ll go before a magistrate and make oath of it I then began to be amazed and surprised and indeed frightened and told him what I had really done and how I had called after him as above When we had amused ourselves a while about this I said to him Well you shall go away from me no more I ll go all over the world with you rather He told me it would be a very difficult thing for him to leave me but since it must be he hoped I would make it as easy to me as I could but as for him it would be his destruction that he foresaw However he told me that he considered he had left me to travel to London alone which was too long a journey and that as he might as well go that way as any way else he was resolved to see me safe thither or near it and if he did go away then without taking his leave I should not take it ill of him and this he made me promise He told me how he had dismissed his three servants sold their horses and sent the fellows away to seek their fortunes and all in a little time at a town on the road I know not where And says he it cost me some tears all alone by myself to think how much happier they were than their master for they could go to the next gentleman s house to see for a service whereas said he I knew not wither to go or what to do with myself I told him I was so completely miserable in parting with him that I could not be worse and that now he was come again I would not go from him if he would take me with him let him go whither he would or do what he would And in the meantime I agreed that we would go together to London but I could not be brought to consent he should go away at last and not take his leave of me as he proposed to do but told him jesting that if he did I would call him back again as loud as I did before Then I pulled out his watch and gave it him back and his two rings and his ten guineas but he would not take them which made me very much suspect that he resolved to go off upon the road and leave me The truth is the circumstances he was in the passionate expressions of his letter the kind gentlemanly treatment I had from him in all the affair with the concern he showed for me in it his manner of parting with that large share which he gave me of his little stock left all these had joined to make such impressions on me that I really loved him most tenderly and could not bear the thoughts of parting with him Two days after this we quitted Chester I in the stage coach and he on horseback I dismissed my maid at Chester He was very much against my being without a maid but she being a servant hired in the country and I resolving to keep no servant at London I told him it would have been barbarous to have taken the poor wench and have turned her away as soon as I came to town and it would also have been a needless charge on the road so I satisfied him and he was easy enough on the score He came with me as far as Dunstable within thirty miles of London and then he told me fate and his own misfortunes obliged him to leave me and that it was not convenient for him to go to London for reasons which it was of no value to me to know and I saw him preparing to go The stage coach we were in did not usually stop at Dunstable but I desiring it but for a quart of an hour they were content to stand at an inndoor a while and we went into the house Being in the inn I told him I had but one favour more to ask of him and that was that since he could not go any farther he would give me leave to stay a week or two in the town with him that we might in that time think of something to prevent such a ruinous thing to us both as a final separation would be and that I had something of moment to offer him that I had never said yet and which perhaps he might find practicable to our mutual advantage This was too reasonable a proposal to be denied so he called the landlady of the house and told her his wife was taken ill and so ill that she could not think of going any farther in the stage coach which had tired her almost to death and asked if she could not get us a lodging for two or three days in a private house where I might rest me a little for the journey had been too much for me The landlady a good sort of woman well bred and very obliging came immediately to see me told me she had two or three very good rooms in a part of the house quite out of the noise and if I saw them she did not doubt but I would like them and I should have one of her maids that should do nothing else but be appointed to wait on me This was so very kind that I could not but accept of it and thank her so I went to look on the rooms and liked them very well and indeed they were extraordinarily furnished and very pleasant lodgings so we paid the stage coach took out our baggage and resolved to stay here a while Here I told him I would live with him now till all my money was spent but would not let him spend a shilling of his own We had some kind squabble about that but I told him it was the last time I was like to enjoy his company and I desired he would let me be master in that thing only and he should govern in everything else so he acquiesced Here one evening taking a walk into the fields I told him I would now make the proposal to him I had told him of accordingly I related to him how I had lived in Virginia that I had a mother I believed was alive there still though my husband was dead some years I told him that had not my effects miscarried which by the way I magnified pretty much I might have been fortune good enough to him to have kept us from being parted in this manner Then I entered into the manner of peoples going over to those countries to settle how they had a quantity of land given them by the Constitution of the place and if not that it might be purchased at so easy a rate this it was not worth naming I then gave him a full and distinct account of the nature of planting how with carrying over but two or three hundred pounds value in English goods with some servants and tools a man of application would presently lay a foundation for a family and in a very few years be certain to raise an estate I let him into the nature of the product of the earth how the ground was cured and prepared and what the usual increase of it was and demonstrated to him that in a very few years with such a beginning we should be as certain of being rich as we were now certain of being poor He was surprised at my discourse for we made it the whole subject of our conversation for near a week together in which time I laid it down in black and white as we say that it was morally impossible with a supposition of any reasonable good conduct but that we must thrive there and do very well Then I told him what measures I would take to raise such a sum of three hundred or thereabouts and I argued with him how good a method it would be to put an end to our misfortunes and restore our circumstances in the world to what we had both expected and I added that after seven years if we lived we might be in a posture to leave our plantations in good hands and come over again and receive the income of it and live here and enjoy it and I gave him examples of some that had done so and lived now in very good circumstances in London In short I pressed him so to it that he almost agreed to it but still something or other broke it off again till at last he turned the tables and he began to talk almost to the same purpose of Ireland He told me that a man that could confine himself to country life and that could find but stock to enter upon any land should have farms there for fifty a year as good as were here let for two hundred a year that the produce was such and so rich the land that if much was not laid up we were sure to live as handsomely upon it as a gentleman of three thousand a year could do in England and that he had laid a scheme to leave me in London and go over and try and if he found he could lay a handsome foundation of living suitable to the respect he had for me as he doubted not he should do he would come over and fetch me I was dreadfully afraid that upon such a proposal he would have taken me at my word viz to sell my little income as I called it and turn it into money and let him carry it over into Ireland and try his experiment with it but he was too just to desire it or to have accepted it if I had offered it and he anticipated me in that for he added that he would go and try his fortune that way and if he found he could do anything at it to live then by adding mine to it when I went over we should live like ourselves but that he would not hazard a shilling of mine till he had made the experiment with a little and he assured me that if he found nothing to be done in Ireland he would then come to me and join in my project for Virginia He was so earnest upon his project being to be tried first that I could not withstand him however he promised to let me hear from him in a very little time after his arriving there to let me know whether his prospect answered his design that if there was not a possibility of success I might take the occasion to prepare for our other voyage and then he assured me he would go with me to America with all his heart I could bring him to nothing further than this However those consultations entertained us near a month during which I enjoyed his company which indeed was the most entertaining that ever I met in my life before In this time he let me into the whole story of his own life which was indeed surprising and full of an infinite variety sufficient to fill up a much brighter history for its adventures and incidents than any I ever say in print but I shall have occasion to say more of him hereafter We parted at last though with the utmost reluctance on my side and indeed he took his leave very unwillingly too but necessity obliged him for his reasons were very good why he would not come to London as I understood more fully some time afterwards I gave him a direction how to write to me though still I reserved the grand secret and never broke my resolution which was not to let him ever know my true name who I was or where to be found he likewise let me know how to write a letter to him so that he said he would be sure to receive it I came to London the next day after we parted but did not go directly to my old lodgings but for another nameless reason took a private lodging in saint John s Street or as it is vulgarly called saint Jones s near Clerkenwell and here being perfectly alone I had leisure to sit down and reflect seriously upon the last seven months ramble I had made for I had been abroad no less The pleasant hours I had with my last husband I looked back on with an infinite deal of pleasure but that pleasure was very much lessened when I found some time after that I was really with child This was a perplexing thing because of the difficulty which was before me where I should get leave to lie in it being one of the nicest things in the world at that time of day for a woman that was a stranger and had no friends to be entertained in that circumstance without security which by the way I had not neither could I procure any I had taken care all this while to preserve a correspondence with my honest friend at the bank or rather he took care to correspond with me for he wrote to me once a week and though I had not spent my money so fast as to want any from him yet I often wrote also to let him know I was alive I had left directions in Lancashire so that I had these letters which he sent conveyed to me and during my recess at saint Jones s received a very obliging letter from him assuring me that his process for a divorce from his wife went on with success though he met with some difficulties in it that he did not expect I was not displeased with the news that his process was more tedious than he expected for though I was in no condition to have him yet not being so foolish to marry him when I knew myself to be with child by another man as some I know have ventured to do yet I was not willing to lose him and in a word resolved to have him if he continued in the same mind as soon as I was up again for I saw apparently I should hear no more from my husband and as he had all along pressed to marry and had assured me he would not be at all disgusted at it or ever offer to claim me again so I made no scruple to resolve to do it if I could and if my other friend stood to his bargain and I had a great deal of reason to be assured that he would stand to it by the letters he wrote to me which were the kindest and most obliging that could be I now grew big and the people where I lodged perceived it and began to take notice of it to me and as far as civility would allow intimated that I must think of removing This put me to extreme perplexity and I grew very melancholy for indeed I knew not what course to take I had money but no friends and was like to have a child upon my hands to keep which was a difficulty I had never had upon me yet as the particulars of my story hitherto make appear In the course of this affair I fell very ill and my melancholy really increased my distemper my illness proved at length to be only an ague but my apprehensions were really that I should miscarry I should not say apprehensions for indeed I would have been glad to miscarry but I could never be brought to entertain so much as a thought of endeavouring to miscarry or of taking any thing to make me miscarry I abhorred I say so much as the thought of it However speaking of it in the house the gentlewoman who kept the house proposed to me to send for a midwife I scrupled it at first but after some time consented to it but told her I had no particular acquaintance with any midwife and so left it to her It seems the mistress of the house was not so great a stranger to such cases as mine was as I thought at first she had been as will appear presently and she sent for a midwife of the right sort that is to say the right sort for me The woman appeared to be an experienced woman in her business I mean as a midwife but she had another calling too in which she was as expert as most women if not more My landlady had told her I was very melancholy and that she believed that had done me harm and once before me said to her missus B meaning the midwife I believe this lady s trouble is of a kind that is pretty much in your way and therefore if you can do anything for her pray do for she is a very civil gentlewoman and so she went out of the room I really did not understand her but my Mother Midnight began very seriously to explain what she mean as soon as she was gone Madam says she you seem not to understand what your landlady means and when you do understand it you need not let her know at all that you do so She means that you are under some circumstances that may render your lying in difficult to you and that you are not willing to be exposed I need say no more but to tell you that if you think fit to communicate so much of your case to me if it be so as is necessary for I do not desire to pry into those things I perhaps may be in a position to help you and to make you perfectly easy and remove all your dull thoughts upon that subject Every word this creature said was a cordial to me and put new life and new spirit into my heart my blood began to circulate immediately and I was quite another body I ate my victuals again and grew better presently after it She said a great deal more to the same purpose and then having pressed me to be free with her and promised in the solemnest manner to be secret she stopped a little as if waiting to see what impression it made on me and what I would say I was too sensible to the want I was in of such a woman not to accept her offer I told her my case was partly as she guessed and partly not for I was really married and had a husband though he was in such fine circumstances and so remote at that time as that he could not appear publicly She took me short and told me that was none of her business all the ladies that came under her care were married women to her Every woman she says that is with child has a father for it and whether that father was a husband or no husband was no business of hers her business was to assist me in my present circumstances whether I had a husband or no For madam says she to have a husband that cannot appear is to have no husband in the sense of the case and therefore whether you are a wife or a mistress is all one to me I found presently that whether I was a whore or a wife I was to pass for a whore here so I let that go I told her it was true as she said but that however if I must tell her my case I must tell it her as it was so I related it to her as short as I could and I concluded it to her thus I trouble you with all this madam said I not that as you said before it is much to the purpose in your affair but this is to the purpose namely that I am not in any pain about being seen or being public or concealed for tis perfectly indifferent to me but my difficulty is that I have no acquaintance in this part of the nation I understand you madam says she you have no security to bring to prevent the parish impertinences usual in such cases and perhaps says she do not know very well how to dispose of the child when it comes The last says I is not so much my concern as the first Well madam answered the midwife dare you put yourself into my hands I live in such a place though I do not inquire after you you may inquire after me My name is B I live in such a street naming the street at the sign of the Cradle My profession is a midwife and I have many ladies that come to my house to lie in I have given security to the parish in general terms to secure them from any charge from whatsoever shall come into the world under my roof I have but one question to ask in the whole affair madam says she and if that be answered you shall be entirely easy for all the rest I presently understood what she meant and told her Madam I believe I understand you I thank God though I want friends in this part of the world I do not want money so far as may be necessary though I do not abound in that neither this I added because I would not make her expect great things Well madam says she that is the thing indeed without which nothing can be done in these cases and yet says she you shall see that I will not impose upon you or offer anything that is unkind to you and if you desire it you shall know everything beforehand that you may suit yourself to the occasion and be neither costly or sparing as you see fit I told her she seemed to be so perfectly sensible of my condition that I had nothing to ask of her but this that as I had told her that I had money sufficient but not a great quantity she would order it so that I might be at as little superfluous charge as possible She replied that she would bring in an account of the expenses of it in two or three shapes and like a bill of fare I should choose as I pleased and I desired her to do so The next day she brought it and the copy of her three bills was a follows one For three months lodging in her house including my diet at tens a week six zeros zerod two For a nurse for the month and use of childbed linen one tens zerod three For a minister to christen the child and to the godfathers and clerk one tens zerod four For a supper at the christening if I had five friends at it one zeros zerod For her fees as a midwife and the taking off the trouble of the parish three threes zerod To her maid servant attending zero tens zerod thirteen thirteens zerod This was the first bill the second was the same terms one For three months lodging and diet et cetera at twentys per week thirteen zeros zerod two For a nurse for the month and the use of linen and lace two tens zerod three For the minister to christen the child et cetera as above two zeros zerod four For supper and for sweetmeats three threes zerod For her fees as above five fives zerod For a servant maid one zeros zerod twenty six eighteens zerod This was the second rate bill the third she said was for a degree higher and when the father or friends appeared one For three months lodging and diet having two rooms and a garret for a servant thirty zeros zerod two For a nurse for the month and the finest suit of childbed linen four fours zerod three For the minister to christen the child et cetera two tens zerod four For a supper the gentlemen to send in the wine six zeros zerod For my fees et cetera ten tens zerod The maid besides their own maid only zero tens zerod fifty three fourteens zerod I looked upon all three bills and smiled and told her I did not see but that she was very reasonable in her demands all things considered and for that I did not doubt but her accommodations were good She told me I should be judge of that when I saw them I told her I was sorry to tell her that I feared I must be her lowest rated customer And perhaps madam said I you will make me the less welcome upon that account No not at all said she for where I have one of the third sort I have two of the second and four to one of the first and I get as much by them in proportion as by any but if you doubt my care of you I will allow any friend you have to overlook and see if you are well waited on or no Then she explained the particulars of her bill In the first place madam said she I would have you observe that here is three months keeping you are but ten shillings a week I undertake to say you will not complain of my table I suppose says she you do not live cheaper where you are now No indeed said I not so cheap for I give six shillings per week for my chamber and find my own diet as well as I can which costs me a great deal more Then madam says she if the child should not live or should be dead born as you know sometimes happens then there is the minister s article saved and if you have no friends to come to you you may save the expense of a supper so that take those articles out madam says she your lying in will not cost you above five threes in all more than your ordinary charge of living This was the most reasonable thing that I ever heard of so I smiled and told her I would come and be her customer but I told her also that as I had two months and more to do I might perhaps be obliged to stay longer with her than three months and desired to know if she would not be obliged to remove me before it was proper No she said her house was large and besides she never put anybody to remove that had lain in till they were willing to go and if she had more ladies offered she was not so ill beloved among her neighbours but she could provide accommodations for twenty if there was occasion I found she was an eminent lady in her way and in short I agreed to put myself into her hands and promised her She then talked of other things looked about into my accommodations where I was found fault with my wanting attendance and conveniences and that I should not be used so at her house I told her I was shy of speaking for the woman of the house looked stranger or at least I thought so since I had been ill because I was with child and I was afraid she would put some affront or other upon me supposing that I had been able to give but a slight account of myself Oh dear said she her ladyship is no stranger to these things she has tried to entertain ladies in your condition several times but she could not secure the parish and besides she is not such a nice lady as you take her to be however since you are a going you shall not meddle with her but I ll see you are a little better looked after while you are here than I think you are and it shall not cost you the more neither I did not understand her at all however I thanked her and so we parted The next morning she sent me a chicken roasted and hot and a pint bottle of sherry and ordered the maid to tell me that she was to wait on me every day as long as I stayed there This was surprisingly good and kind and I accepted it very willingly At night she sent to me again to know if I wanted anything and how I did and to order the maid to come to her in the morning with my dinner The maid had orders to make me some chocolate in the morning before she came away and did so and at noon she brought me the sweetbread of a breast of veal whole and a dish of soup for my dinner and after this manner she nursed me up at a distance so that I was mightily well pleased and quickly well for indeed my dejections before were the principal part of my illness I expected as is usually the case among such people that the servant she sent me would have been some imprudent brazen wench of Drury Lane breeding and I was very uneasy at having her with me upon that account so I would not let her lie in that house the first night by any means but had my eyes about me as narrowly as if she had been a public thief My gentlewoman guessed presently what was the matter and sent her back with a short note that I might depend upon the honesty of her maid that she would be answerable for her upon all accounts and that she took no servants into her house without very good security for their fidelity I was then perfectly easy and indeed the maid s behaviour spoke for itself for a modester quieter soberer girl never came into anybody s family and I found her so afterwards As soon as I was well enough to go abroad I went with the maid to see the house and to see the apartment I was to have and everything was so handsome and so clean and well that in short I had nothing to say but was wonderfully pleased and satisfied with what I had met with which considering the melancholy circumstances I was in was far beyond what I looked for It might be expected that I should give some account of the nature of the wicked practices of this woman in whose hands I was now fallen but it would be too much encouragement to the vice to let the world see what easy measures were here taken to rid the women s unwelcome burthen of a child clandestinely gotten This grave matron had several sorts of practice and this was one particular that if a child was born though not in her house for she had occasion to be called to many private labours she had people at hand who for a piece of money would take the child off their hands and off from the hands of the parish too and those children as she said were honestly provided for and taken care of What should become of them all considering so many as by her account she was concerned with I cannot conceive I had many times discourses upon that subject with her but she was full of this argument that she save the life of many an innocent lamb as she called them which would otherwise perhaps have been murdered and of many women who made desperate by the misfortune would otherwise be tempted to destroy their children and bring themselves to the gallows I granted her that this was true and a very commendable thing provided the poor children fell into good hands afterwards and were not abused starved and neglected by the nurses that bred them up She answered that she always took care of that and had no nurses in her business but what were very good honest people and such as might be depended upon I could say nothing to the contrary and so was obliged to say Madam I do not question you do your part honestly but what those people do afterwards is the main question and she stopped my mouth again with saying that she took the utmost care about it The only thing I found in all her conversation on these subjects that gave me any distaste was that one time in discouraging about my being far gone with child and the time I expected to come she said something that looked as if she could help me off with my burthen sooner if I was willing or in English that she could give me something to make me miscarry if I had a desire to put an end to my troubles that way but I soon let her see that I abhorred the thoughts of it and to do her justice she put it off so cleverly that I could not say she really intended it or whether she only mentioned the practice as a horrible thing for she couched her words so well and took my meaning so quickly that she gave her negative before I could explain myself To bring this part into as narrow a compass as possible I quitted my lodging at saint Jones s and went to my new governess for so they called her in the house and there I was indeed treated with so much courtesy so carefully looked to so handsomely provided and everything so well that I was surprised at it and could not at first see what advantage my governess made of it but I found afterwards that she professed to make no profit of lodgers diet nor indeed could she get much by it but that her profit lay in the other articles of her management and she made enough that way I assure you for tis scarce credible what practice she had as well abroad as at home and yet all upon the private account or in plain English the whoring account While I was in her house which was near four months she had no less than twelve ladies of pleasure brought to bed within the doors and I think she had two and thirty or thereabouts under her conduct without doors whereof one as nice as she was with me was lodged with my old landlady at saint Jones s This was a strange testimony of the growing vice of the age and such a one that as bad as I had been myself it shocked my very senses I began to nauseate the place I was in and about all the wicked practice and yet I must say that I never saw or do I believe there was to be seen the least indecency in the house the whole time I was there Not a man was ever seen to come upstairs except to visit the lying in ladies within their month nor then without the old lady with them who made it a piece of honour of her management that no man should touch a woman no not his own wife within the month nor would she permit any man to lie in the house upon any pretence whatever no not though she was sure it was with his own wife and her general saying for it was that she cared not how many children were born in her house but she would have none got there if she could help it It might perhaps be carried further than was needful but it was an error of the right hand if it was an error for by this she kept up the reputation such as it was of her business and obtained this character that though she did take care of the women when they were debauched yet she was not instrumental to their being debauched at all and yet it was a wicked trade she drove too While I was there and before I was brought to bed I received a letter from my trustee at the bank full of kind obliging things and earnestly pressing me to return to London It was near a fortnight old when it came to me because it had been first sent into Lancashire and then returned to me He concludes with telling me that he had obtained a decree I think he called it against his wife and that he would be ready to make good his engagement to me if I would accept of him adding a great many protestations of kindness and affection such as he would have been far from offering if he had known the circumstances I had been in and which as it was I had been very far from deserving I returned an answer to his letter and dated it at Liverpool but sent it by messenger alleging that it came in cover to a friend in town I gave him joy of his deliverance but raised some scruples at the lawfulness of his marrying again and told him I supposed he would consider very seriously upon that point before he resolved on it the consequence being too great for a man of his judgment to venture rashly upon a thing of that nature so concluded wishing him very well in whatever he resolved without letting him into anything of my own mind or giving any answer to his proposal of my coming to London to him but mentioned at a distance my intention to return the latter end of the year this being dated in April I was brought to bed about the middle of May and had another brave boy and myself in as good condition as usual on such occasions My governess did her part as a midwife with the greatest art and dexterity imaginable and far beyond all that ever I had had any experience of before Her care of me in my travail and after in my lying in was such that if she had been my own mother it could not have been better Let none be encouraged in their loose practices from this dexterous lady s management for she is gone to her place and I dare say has left nothing behind her that can or will come up on it I think I had been brought to bed about twenty two days when I received another letter from my friend at the bank with the surprising news that he had obtained a final sentence of divorce against his wife and had served her with it on such a day and that he had such an answer to give to all my scruples about his marrying again as I could not expect and as he had no desire of for that his wife who had been under some remorse before for her usage of him as soon as she had the account that he had gained his point had very unhappily destroyed herself that same evening He expressed himself very handsomely as to his being concerned at her disaster but cleared himself of having any hand in it and that he had only done himself justice in a case in which he was notoriously injured and abused However he said that he was extremely afflicted at it and had no view of any satisfaction left in his world but only in the hope that I would come and relieve him by my company and then he pressed me violently indeed to give him some hopes that I would at least come up to town and let him see me when he would further enter into discourse about it I was exceedingly surprised at the news and began now seriously to reflect on my present circumstances and the inexpressible misfortune it was to me to have a child upon my hands and what to do in it I knew not At last I opened my case at a distance to my governess I appeared melancholy and uneasy for several days and she lay at me continually to know what trouble me I could not for my life tell her that I had an offer of marriage after I had so often told her that I had a husband so that I really knew not what to say to her I owned I had something which very much troubled me but at the same time told her I could not speak of it to any one alive She continued importuning me several days but it was impossible I told her for me to commit the secret to anybody This instead of being an answer to her increased her importunities she urged her having been trusted with the greatest secrets of this nature that it was her business to conceal everything and that to discover things of that nature would be her ruin She asked me if ever I had found her tattling to me of other people s affairs and how could I suspect her She told me to unfold myself to her was telling it to nobody that she was silent as death that it must be a very strange case indeed that she could not help me out of but to conceal it was to deprive myself of all possible help or means of help and to deprive her of the opportunity of serving me In short she had such a bewitching eloquence and so great a power of persuasion that there was no concealing anything from her So I resolved to unbosom myself to her I told her the history of my Lancashire marriage and how both of us had been disappointed how we came together and how we parted how he absolutely discharged me as far as lay in him free liberty to marry again protesting that if he knew it he would never claim me or disturb or expose me that I thought I was free but was dreadfully afraid to venture for fear of the consequences that might follow in case of a discovery Then I told her what a good offer I had showed her my friend s two last letters inviting me to come to London and let her see with what affection and earnestness they were written but blotted out the name and also the story about the disaster of his wife only that she was dead She fell a laughing at my scruples about marrying and told me the other was no marriage but a cheat on both sides and that as we were parted by mutual consent the nature of the contract was destroyed and the obligation was mutually discharged She had arguments for this at the tip of her tongue and in short reasoned me out of my reason not but that it was too by the help of my own inclination But then came the great and main difficulty and that was the child this she told me in so many words must be removed and that so as that it should never be possible for any one to discover it I knew there was no marrying without entirely concealing that I had had a child for he would soon have discovered by the age of it that it was born nay and gotten too since my parley with him and that would have destroyed all the affair But it touched my heart so forcibly to think of parting entirely with the child and for aught I knew of having it murdered or starved by neglect and ill usage which was much the same that I could not think of it without horror I wish all those women who consent to the disposing their children out of the way as it is called for decency sake would consider that tis only a contrived method for murder that is to say a killing their children with safety It is manifest to all that understand anything of children that we are born into the world helpless and incapable either to supply our own wants or so much as make them known and that without help we must perish and this help requires not only an assisting hand whether of the mother or somebody else but there are two things necessary in that assisting hand that is care and skill without both which half the children that are born would die nay though they were not to be denied food and one half more of those that remained would be cripples or fools lose their limbs and perhaps their sense I question not but that these are partly the reasons why affection was placed by nature in the hearts of mothers to their children without which they would never be able to give themselves up as tis necessary they should to the care and waking pains needful to the support of their children Since this care is needful to the life of children to neglect them is to murder them again to give them up to be managed by those people who have none of that needful affection placed by nature in them is to neglect them in the highest degree nay in some it goes farther and is a neglect in order to their being lost so that tis even an intentional murder whether the child lives or dies All those things represented themselves to my view and that is the blackest and most frightful form and as I was very free with my governess whom I had now learned to call mother I represented to her all the dark thoughts which I had upon me about it and told her what distress I was in She seemed graver by much at this part than at the other but as she was hardened in these things beyond all possibility of being touched with the religious part and the scruples about the murder so she was equally impenetrable in that part which related to affection She asked me if she had not been careful and tender to me in my lying in as if I had been her own child I told her I owned she had Well my dear says she and when you are gone what are you to me And what would it be to me if you were to be hanged Do you think there are not women who as it is their trade and they get their bread by it value themselves upon their being as careful of children as their own mothers can be and understand it rather better Yes yes child says she fear it not how were we nursed ourselves Are you sure you was nursed up by your own mother and yet you look fat and fair child says the old beldam and with that she stroked me over the face Never be concerned child says she going on in her drolling way I have no murderers about me I employ the best and the honestest nurses that can be had and have as few children miscarry under their hands as there would if they were all nursed by mothers we want neither care nor skill She touched me to the quick when she asked if I was sure that I was nursed by my own mother on the contrary I was sure I was not and I trembled and looked pale at the very expression Sure said I to myself this creature cannot be a witch or have any conversation with a spirit that can inform her what was done with me before I was able to know it myself and I looked at her as if I had been frightened but reflecting that it could not be possible for her to know anything about me that disorder went off and I began to be easy but it was not presently She perceived the disorder I was in but did not know the meaning of it so she ran on in her wild talk upon the weakness of my supposing that children were murdered because they were not all nursed by the mother and to persuade me that the children she disposed of were as well used as if the mothers had the nursing of them themselves It may be true mother says I for aught I know but my doubts are very strongly grounded indeed Come then says she let s hear some of them Why first says I you give a piece of money to these people to take the child off the parent s hands and to take care of it as long as it lives Now we know mother said I that those are poor people and their gain consists in being quit of the charge as soon as they can how can I doubt but that as it is best for them to have the child die they are not over solicitous about life This is all vapours and fancy says the old woman I tell you their credit depends upon the child s life and they are as careful as any mother of you all O mother says I if I was but sure my little baby would be carefully looked to and have justice done it I should be happy indeed but it is impossible I can be satisfied in that point unless I saw it and to see it would be ruin and destruction to me as now my case stands so what to do I know not A fine story says the governess You would see the child and you would not see the child you would be concealed and discovered both together These are things impossible my dear so you must e en do as other conscientious mothers have done before you and be contented with things as they must be though they are not as you wish them to be I understood what she meant by conscientious mothers she would have said conscientious whores but she was not willing to disoblige me for really in this case I was not a whore because legally married the force of former marriage excepted However let me be what I would I was not come up to that pitch of hardness common to the profession I mean to be unnatural and regardless of the safety of my child and I preserved this honest affection so long that I was upon the point of giving up my friend at the bank who lay so hard at me to come to him and marry him that in short there was hardly any room to deny him At last my old governess came to me with her usual assurance Come my dear says she I have found out a way how you shall be at a certainty that your child shall be used well and yet the people that take care of it shall never know you or who the mother of the child is Oh mother says I if you can do so you will engage me to you for ever Well says she are you willing to be a some small annual expense more than what we usually give to the people we contract with Ay says I with all my heart provided I may be concealed As to that says the governess you shall be secure for the nurse shall never so much as dare to inquire about you and you shall once or twice a year go with me and see your child and see how tis used and be satisfied that it is in good hands nobody knowing who you are Why said I do you think mother that when I come to see my child I shall be able to conceal my being the mother of it Do you think that possible Well well says my governess if you discover it the nurse shall be never the wiser for she shall be forbid to ask any questions about you or to take any notice If she offers it she shall lose the money which you are suppose to give her and the child shall be taken from her too I was very well pleased with this So the next week a countrywoman was brought from Hertford or thereabouts who was to take the child off our hands entirely for ten in money But if I would allow five a year more of her she would be obliged to bring the child to my governess s house as often as we desired or we should come down and look at it and see how well she used it The woman was very wholesome looking a likely woman a cottager s wife but she had very good clothes and linen and everything well about her and with a heavy heart and many a tear I let her have my child I had been down at Hertford and looked at her and at her dwelling which I liked well enough and I promised her great things if she would be kind to the child so she knew at first word that I was the child s mother But she seemed to be so much out of the way and to have no room to inquire after me that I thought I was safe enough So in short I consented to let her have the child and I gave her ten that is to say I gave it to my governess who gave it the poor woman before my face she agreeing never to return the child back to me or to claim anything more for its keeping or bringing up only that I promised if she took a great deal of care of it I would give her something more as often as I came to see it so that I was not bound to pay the five only that I promised my governess I would do it And thus my great care was over after a manner which though it did not at all satisfy my mind yet was the most convenient for me as my affairs then stood of any that could be thought of at that time I then began to write to my friend at the bank in a more kindly style and particularly about the beginning of July I sent him a letter that I proposed to be in town some time in August He returned me an answer in the most passionate terms imaginable and desired me to let him have timely notice and he would come and meet me two day s journey This puzzled me scurvily and I did not know what answer to make of it Once I resolved to take the stage coach to West Chester on purpose only to have the satisfaction of coming back that he might see me really come in the same coach for I had a jealous thought though I had no ground for it at all lest he should think I was not really in the country And it was no ill grounded thought as you shall hear presently I endeavoured to reason myself out of it but it was in vain the impression lay so strong on my mind that it was not to be resisted At last it came as an addition to my new design of going into the country that it would be an excellent blind to my old governess and would cover entirely all my other affairs for she did not know in the least whether my new lover lived in London or in Lancashire and when I told her my resolution she was fully persuaded it was in Lancashire Having taken my measure for this journey I let her know it and sent the maid that tended me from the beginning to take a place for me in the coach She would have had me let the maid have waited on me down to the last stage and come up again in the waggon but I convinced her it would not be convenient When I went away she told me she would enter into no measures for correspondence for she saw evidently that my affection to my child would cause me to write to her and to visit her too when I came to town again I assured her it would and so took my leave well satisfied to have been freed from such a house however good my accommodations there had been as I have related above I took the place in the coach not to its full extent but to a place called Stone in Cheshire I think it is where I not only had no manner of business but not so much as the least acquaintance with any person in the town or near it But I knew that with money in the pocket one is at home anywhere so I lodged there two or three days till watching my opportunity I found room in another stage coach and took passage back again for London sending a letter to my gentleman that I should be such a certain day at Stony Stratford where the coachman told me he was to lodge It happened to be a chance coach that I had taken up which having been hired on purpose to carry some gentlemen to West Chester who were going for Ireland was now returning and did not tie itself to exact times or places as the stages did so that having been obliged to lie still on Sunday he had time to get himself ready to come out which otherwise he could not have done However his warning was so short that he could not reach to Stony Stratford time enough to be with me at night but he met me at a place called Brickhill the next morning as we were just coming in to tow I confess I was very glad to see him for I had thought myself a little disappointed over night seeing I had gone so far to contrive my coming on purpose He pleased me doubly too by the figure he came in for he brought a very handsome gentleman s coach and four horses with a servant to attend him He took me out of the stage coach immediately which stopped at an inn in Brickhill and putting into the same inn he set up his own coach and bespoke his dinner I asked him what he meant by that for I was for going forward with the journey He said No I had need of a little rest upon the road and that was a very good sort of a house though it was but a little town so we would go no farther that night whatever came of it I did not press him much for since he had come so to meet me and put himself to so much expense it was but reasonable I should oblige him a little too so I was easy as to that point After dinner we walked to see the town to see the church and to view the fields and the country as is usual for strangers to do and our landlord was our guide in going to see the church I observed my gentleman inquired pretty much about the parson and I took the hint immediately that he certainly would propose to be married and though it was a sudden thought it followed presently that in short I would not refuse him for to be plain with my circumstances I was in no condition now to say No I had no reason now to run any more such hazards But while these thoughts ran round in my head which was the work but of a few moments I observed my landlord took him aside and whispered to him though not very softly neither for so much I overheard Sir if you shall have occasion the rest I could not hear but it seems it was to this purpose Sir if you shall have occasion for a minister I have a friend a little way off that will serve you and be as private as you please My gentleman answered loud enough for me to hear Very well I believe I shall I was no sooner come back to the inn but he fell upon me with irresistible words that since he had had the good fortune to meet me and everything concurred it would be hastening his felicity if I would put an end to the matter just there What do you mean says I colouring a little What in an inn and upon the road Bless us all said I as if I had been surprised how can you talk so Oh I can talk so very well says he I came a purpose to talk so and I ll show you that I did and with that he pulls out a great bundle of papers You fright me said I what are all these Don t be frighted my dear said he and kissed me This was the first time that he had been so free to call me my dear then he repeated it Don t be frighted you shall see what it is all then he laid them all abroad There was first the deed or sentence of divorce from his wife and the full evidence of her playing the whore then there were the certificates of the minister and churchwardens of the parish where she lived proving that she was buried and intimating the manner of her death the copy of the coroner s warrant for a jury to sit upon her and the verdict of the jury who brought it in Non compos mentis All this was indeed to the purpose and to give me satisfaction though by the way I was not so scrupulous had he known all but that I might have taken him without it However I looked them all over as well as I could and told him that this was all very clear indeed but that he need not have given himself the trouble to have brought them out with him for it was time enough Well he said it might be time enough for me but no time but the present time was time enough for him There were other papers rolled up and I asked him what they were Why ay says he that s the question I wanted to have you ask me so he unrolls them and takes out a little shagreen case and gives me out of it a very fine diamond ring I could not refuse it if I had a mind to do so for he put it upon my finger so I made him a curtsy and accepted it Then he takes out another ring And this says he is for another occasion so he puts that in his pocket Well but let me see it though says I and smiled I guess what it is I think you are mad I should have been mad if I had done less says he and still he did not show me and I had a great mind to see it so I says Well but let me see it Hold says he first look here then he took up the roll again and read it and behold it was a licence for us to be married Why says I are you distracted Why you were fully satisfied that I would comply and yield at first word or resolved to take no denial The last is certainly the case said he But you may be mistaken said I No no says he how can you think so I must not be denied I can t be denied and with that he fell to kissing me so violently I could not get rid of him There was a bed in the room and we were walking to and again eager in the discourse at last he takes me by surprise in his arms and threw me on the bed and himself with me and holding me fast in his arms but without the least offer of any indecency courted me to consent with such repeated entreaties and arguments protesting his affection and vowing he would not let me go till I had promised him that at last I said Why you resolve not to be denied indeed I can t be denied Well well said I and giving him a slight kiss then you shan t be denied said I let me get up He was so transported with my consent and the kind manner of it that I began to think once he took it for a marriage and would not stay for the form but I wronged him for he gave over kissing me and then giving me two or three kisses again thanked me for my kind yielding to him and was so overcome with the satisfaction and joy of it that I saw tears stand in his eyes I turned from him for it filled my eyes with tears too and I asked him leave to retire a little to my chamber If ever I had a grain of true repentance for a vicious and abominable life for twenty four years past it was then On what a felicity is it to mankind said I to myself that they cannot see into the hearts of one another How happy had it been for me if I had been wife to a man of so much honesty and so much affection from the beginning Then it occurred to me What an abominable creature am I and how is this innocent gentleman going to be abused by me How little does he think that having divorced a whore he is throwing himself into the arms of another that he is going to marry one that has lain with two brothers and has had three children by her own brother one that was born in Newgate whose mother was a whore and is now a transported thief one that has lain with thirteen men and has had a child since he saw me Poor gentleman said I what is he going to do After this reproaching myself was over it following thus Well if I must be his wife if it please God to give me grace I ll be a true wife to him and love him suitably to the strange excess of his passion for me I will make him amends if possible by what he shall see for the cheats and abuses I put upon him which he does not see He was impatient for my coming out of my chamber but finding me long he went downstairs and talked with my landlord about the parson My landlord an officious though well meaning fellow had sent away for the neighbouring clergyman and when my gentleman began to speak of it to him and talk of sending for him Sir says he to him my friend is in the house so without any more words he brought them together When he came to the minister he asked him if he would venture to marry a couple of strangers that were both willing The parson said that mister had said something to him of it that he hoped it was no clandestine business that he seemed to be a grave gentleman and he supposed madam was not a girl so that the consent of friends should be wanted To put you out of doubt of that says my gentleman read this paper and out he pulls the license I am satisfied says the minister where is the lady You shall see her presently says my gentleman When he had said thus he comes upstairs and I was by that time come out of my room so he tells me the minister was below and that he had talked with him and that upon showing him the license he was free to marry us with all his heart but he asks to see you so he asked if I would let him come up Tis time enough said I in the morning is it not Why said he my dear he seemed to scruple whether it was not some young girl stolen from her parents and I assured him we were both of age to command our own consent and that made him ask to see you Well said I do as you please so up they brings the parson and a merry good sort of gentleman he was He had been told it seems that we had met there by accident that I came in the Chester coach and my gentleman in his own coach to meet me that we were to have met last night at Stony Stratford but that he could not reach so far Well sir says the parson every ill turn has some good in it The disappointment sir says he to my gentleman was yours and the good turn is mine for if you had met at Stony Stratford I had not had the honour to marry you Landlord have you a Common Prayer Book I started as if I had been frightened Lord sir says I what do you mean What to marry in an inn and at night too Madam says the minister if you will have it be in the church you shall but I assure you your marriage will be as firm here as in the church we are not tied by the canons to marry nowhere but in the church and if you will have it in the church it will be a public as a county fair and as for the time of day it does not at all weigh in this case our princes are married in their chambers and at eight or ten o clock at night I was a great while before I could be persuaded and pretended not to be willing at all to be married but in the church But it was all grimace so I seemed at last to be prevailed on and my landlord and his wife and daughter were called up My landlord was father and clerk and all together and we were married and very merry we were though I confess the self reproaches which I had upon me before lay close to me and extorted every now and then a deep sigh from me which my bridegroom took notice of and endeavoured to encourage me thinking poor man that I had some little hesitations at the step I had taken so hastily We enjoyed ourselves that evening completely and yet all was kept so private in the inn that not a servant in the house knew of it for my landlady and her daughter waited on me and would not let any of the maids come upstairs except while we were at supper My landlady s daughter I called my bridesmaid and sending for a shopkeeper the next morning I gave the young woman a good suit of knots as good as the town would afford and finding it was a lace making town I gave her mother a piece of bone lace for a head One reason that my landlord was so close was that he was unwilling the minister of the parish should hear of it but for all that somebody heard of it so at that we had the bells set a ringing the next morning early and the music such as the town would afford under our window but my landlord brazened it out that we were married before we came thither only that being his former guests we would have our wedding supper at his house We could not find in our hearts to stir the next day for in short having been disturbed by the bells in the morning and having perhaps not slept overmuch before we were so sleepy afterwards that we lay in bed till almost twelve o clock I begged my landlady that we might not have any more music in the town nor ringing of bells and she managed it so well that we were very quiet but an odd passage interrupted all my mirth for a good while The great room of the house looked into the street and my new spouse being belowstairs I had walked to the end of the room and it being a pleasant warm day I had opened the window and was standing at it for some air when I saw three gentlemen come by on horseback and go into an inn just against us It was not to be concealed nor was it so doubtful as to leave me any room to question it but the second of the three was my Lancashire husband I was frightened to death I never was in such a consternation in my life I though I should have sunk into the ground my blood ran chill in my veins and I trembled as if I had been in a cold fit of ague I say there was no room to question the truth of it I knew his clothes I knew his horse and I knew his face The first sensible reflect I made was that my husband was not by to see my disorder and that I was very glad of it The gentlemen had not been long in the house but they came to the window of their room as is usual but my window was shut you may be sure However I could not keep from peeping at them and there I saw him again heard him call out to one of the servants of the house for something he wanted and received all the terrifying confirmations of its being the same person that were possible to be had My next concern was to know if possible what was his business there but that was impossible Sometimes my imagination formed an idea of one frightful thing sometimes of another sometime I thought he had discovered me and was come to upbraid me with ingratitude and breach of honour and every moment I fancied he was coming up the stairs to insult me and innumerable fancies came into my head of what was never in his head nor ever could be unless the devil had revealed it to him I remained in this fright nearly two hours and scarce ever kept my eye from the window or door of the inn where they were At last hearing a great clatter in the passage of their inn I ran to the window and to my great satisfaction saw them all three go out again and travel on westward Had they gone towards London I should have been still in a fright lest I should meet him on the road again and that he should know me but he went the contrary way and so I was eased of that disorder We resolved to be going the next day but about six o clock at night we were alarmed with a great uproar in the street and people riding as if they had been out of their wits and what was it but a hue and cry after three highwaymen that had robbed two coaches and some other travellers near Dunstable Hill and notice had it seems been given that they had been seen at Brickhill at such a house meaning the house where those gentlemen had been The house was immediately beset and searched but there were witnesses enough that the gentlemen had been gone over three hours The crowd having gathered about we had the news presently and I was heartily concerned now another way I presently told the people of the house that I durst to say those were not the persons for that I knew one of the gentlemen to be a very honest person and of a good estate in Lancashire The constable who came with the hue and cry was immediately informed of this and came over to me to be satisfied from my own mouth and I assured him that I saw the three gentlemen as I was at the window that I saw them afterwards at the windows of the room they dined in that I saw them afterwards take horse and I could assure him I knew one of them to be such a man that he was a gentleman of a very good estate and an undoubted character in Lancashire from whence I was just now upon my journey The assurance with which I delivered this gave the mob gentry a check and gave the constable such satisfaction that he immediately sounded a retreat told his people these were not the men but that he had an account they were very honest gentlemen and so they went all back again What the truth of the matter was I knew not but certain it was that the coaches were robbed at Dunstable Hill and five hundred sixty in money taken besides some of the lace merchants that always travel that way had been visited too As to the three gentlemen that remains to be explained hereafter Well this alarm stopped us another day though my spouse was for travelling and told me that it was always safest travelling after a robbery for that the thieves were sure to be gone far enough off when they had alarmed the country but I was afraid and uneasy and indeed principally lest my old acquaintance should be upon the road still and should chance to see me I never lived four pleasanter days together in my life I was a mere bride all this while and my new spouse strove to make me entirely easy in everything Oh could this state of life have continued how had all my past troubles been forgot and my future sorrows avoided But I had a past life of a most wretched kind to account for some if it in this world as well as in another We came away the fifth day and my landlord because he saw me uneasy mounted himself his son and three honest country fellows with good firearms and without telling us of it followed the coach and would see us safe into Dunstable We could do no less than treat them very handsomely at Dunstable which cost my spouse about ten or twelve shillings and something he gave the men for their time too but my landlord would take nothing for himself This was the most happy contrivance for me that could have fallen out for had I come to London unmarried I must either have come to him for the first night s entertainment or have discovered to him that I had not one acquaintance in the whole city of London that could receive a poor bride for the first night s lodging with her spouse But now being an old married woman I made no scruple of going directly home with him and there I took possession at once of a house well furnished and a husband in very good circumstances so that I had a prospect of a very happy life if I knew how to manage it and I had leisure to consider of the real value of the life I was likely to live How different it was to be from the loose ungoverned part I had acted before and how much happier a life of virtue and sobriety is than that which we call a life of pleasure Oh had this particular scene of life lasted or had I learned from that time I enjoyed it to have tasted the true sweetness of it and had I not fallen into that poverty which is the sure bane of virtue how happy had I been not only here but perhaps for ever for while I lived thus I was really a penitent for all my life past I looked back on it with abhorrence and might truly be said to hate myself for it I often reflected how my lover at the Bath struck at the hand of God repented and abandoned me and refused to see me any more though he loved me to an extreme but I prompted by that worst of devils poverty returned to the vile practice and made the advantage of what they call a handsome face to be the relief to my necessities and beauty be a pimp to vice Now I seemed landed in a safe harbour after the stormy voyage of life past was at an end and I began to be thankful for my deliverance I sat many an hour by myself and wept over the remembrance of past follies and the dreadful extravagances of a wicked life and sometimes I flattered myself that I had sincerely repented But there are temptations which it is not in the power of human nature to resist and few know what would be their case if driven to the same exigencies As covetousness is the root of all evil so poverty is I believe the worst of all snares But I waive that discourse till I come to an experiment I lived with this husband with the utmost tranquillity he was a quiet sensible sober man virtuous modest sincere and in his business diligent and just His business was in a narrow compass and his income sufficient to a plentiful way of living in the ordinary way I do not say to keep an equipage and make a figure as the world calls it nor did I expect it or desire it for as I abhorred the levity and extravagance of my former life so I chose now to live retired frugal and within ourselves I kept no company made no visits minded my family and obliged my husband and this kind of life became a pleasure to me We lived in an uninterrupted course of ease and content for five years when a sudden blow from an almost invisible hand blasted all my happiness and turned me out into the world in a condition the reverse of all that had been before it My husband having trusted one of his fellow clerks with a sum of money too much for our fortunes to bear the loss of the clerk failed and the loss fell very heavy on my husband yet it was not so great neither but that if he had had spirit and courage to have looked his misfortunes in the face his credit was so good that as I told him he would easily recover it for to sink under trouble is to double the weight and he that will die in it shall die in it It was in vain to speak comfortably to him the wound had sunk too deep it was a stab that touched the vitals he grew melancholy and disconsolate and from thence lethargic and died I foresaw the blow and was extremely oppressed in my mind for I saw evidently that if he died I was undone I had had two children by him and no more for to tell the truth it began to be time for me to leave bearing children for I was now eight and forty and I suppose if he had lived I should have had no more I was now left in a dismal and disconsolate case indeed and in several things worse than ever First it was past the flourishing time with me when I might expect to be courted for a mistress that agreeable part had declined some time and the ruins only appeared of what had been and that which was worse than all this that I was the most dejected disconsolate creature alive I that had encouraged my husband and endeavoured to support his spirits under his trouble could not support my own I wanted that spirit in trouble which I told him was so necessary to him for bearing the burthen But my case was indeed deplorable for I was left perfectly friendless and helpless and the loss my husband had sustained had reduced his circumstances so low that though indeed I was not in debt yet I could easily foresee that what was left would not support me long that while it wasted daily for subsistence I had not way to increase it one shilling so that it would be soon all spent and then I saw nothing before me but the utmost distress and this represented itself so lively to my thoughts that it seemed as if it was come before it was really very near also my very apprehensions doubled the misery for I fancied every sixpence that I paid for a loaf of bread was the last that I had in the world and that to morrow I was to fast and be starved to death In this distress I had no assistant no friend to comfort or advise me I sat and cried and tormented myself night and day wringing my hands and sometimes raving like a distracted woman and indeed I have often wondered it had not affected my reason for I had the vapours to such a degree that my understanding was sometimes quite lost in fancies and imaginations I lived two years in this dismal condition wasting that little I had weeping continually over my dismal circumstances and as it were only bleeding to death without the least hope or prospect of help from God or man and now I had cried too long and so often that tears were as I might say exhausted and I began to be desperate for I grew poor apace For a little relief I had put off my house and took lodgings and as I was reducing my living so I sold off most of my goods which put a little money in my pocket and I lived near a year upon that spending very sparingly and eking things out to the utmost but still when I looked before me my very heart would sink within me at the inevitable approach of misery and want Oh let none read this part without seriously reflecting on the circumstances of a desolate state and how they would grapple with mere want of friends and want of bread it will certainly make them think not of sparing what they have only but of looking up to heaven for support and of the wise man s prayer Give me not poverty lest I steal Let them remember that a time of distress is a time of dreadful temptation and all the strength to resist is taken away poverty presses the soul is made desperate by distress and what can be done It was one evening when being brought as I may say to the last gasp I think I may truly say I was distracted and raving when prompted by I know not what spirit and as it were doing I did not know what or why I dressed me for I had still pretty good clothes and went out I am very sure I had no manner of design in my head when I went out I neither knew nor considered where to go or on what business but as the devil carried me out and laid his bait for me so he brought me to be sure to the place for I knew not whither I was going or what I did Wandering thus about I knew not whither I passed by an apothecary s shop in Leadenhall Street when I saw lie on a stool just before the counter a little bundle wrapped in a white cloth beyond it stood a maid servant with her back to it looking towards the top of the shop where the apothecary s apprentice as I suppose was standing upon the counter with his back also to the door and a candle in his hand looking and reaching up to the upper shelf for something he wanted so that both were engaged mighty earnestly and nobody else in the shop This was the bait and the devil who I said laid the snare as readily prompted me as if he had spoke for I remember and shall never forget it twas like a voice spoken to me over my shoulder Take the bundle be quick do it this moment It was no sooner said but I stepped into the shop and with my back to the wench as if I had stood up for a cart that was going by I put my hand behind me and took the bundle and went off with it the maid or the fellow not perceiving me or any one else It is impossible to express the horror of my soul all the while I did it When I went away I had no heart to run or scarce to mend my pace I crossed the street indeed and went down the first turning I came to and I think it was a street that went through into Fenchurch Street From thence I crossed and turned through so many ways and turnings that I could never tell which way it was not where I went for I felt not the ground I stepped on and the farther I was out of danger the faster I went till tired and out of breath I was forced to sit down on a little bench at a door and then I began to recover and found I was got into Thames Street near Billingsgate I rested me a little and went on my blood was all in a fire my heart beat as if I was in a sudden fright In short I was under such a surprise that I still knew not wither I was going or what to do After I had tired myself thus with walking a long way about and so eagerly I began to consider and make home to my lodging where I came about nine o clock at night When the bundle was made up for or on what occasion laid where I found it I knew not but when I came to open it I found there was a suit of childbed linen in it very good and almost new the lace very fine there was a silver porringer of a pint a small silver mug and six spoons with some other linen a good smock and three silk handkerchiefs and in the mug wrapped up in a paper eighteens sixd in money All the while I was opening these things I was under such dreadful impressions of fear and I such terror of mind though I was perfectly safe that I cannot express the manner of it I sat me down and cried most vehemently Lord said I what am I now a thief Why I shall be taken next time and be carried to Newgate and be tried for my life And with that I cried again a long time and I am sure as poor as I was if I had durst for fear I would certainly have carried the things back again but that went off after a while Well I went to bed for that night but slept little the horror of the fact was upon my mind and I knew not what I said or did all night and all the next day Then I was impatient to hear some news of the loss and would fain know how it was whether they were a poor body s goods or a rich Perhaps said I it may be some poor widow like me that had packed up these goods to go and sell them for a little bread for herself and a poor child and are now starving and breaking their hearts for want of that little they would have fetched And this thought tormented me worse than all the rest for three or four days time But my own distresses silenced all these reflections and the prospect of my own starving which grew every day more frightful to me hardened my heart by degrees It was then particularly heavy upon my mind that I had been reformed and had as I hoped repented of all my past wickedness that I had lived a sober grave retired life for several years but now I should be driven by the dreadful necessity of my circumstances to the gates of destruction soul and body and two or three times I fell upon my knees praying to God as well as I could for deliverance but I cannot but say my prayers had no hope in them I knew not what to do it was all fear without and dark within and I reflected on my past life as not sincerely repented of that Heaven was now beginning to punish me on this side the grave and would make me as miserable as I had been wicked Had I gone on here I had perhaps been a true penitent but I had an evil counsellor within and he was continually prompting me to relieve myself by the worst means so one evening he tempted me again by the same wicked impulse that had said Take that bundle to go out again and seek for what might happen I went out now by daylight and wandered about I knew not whither and in search of I knew not what when the devil put a snare in my way of a dreadful nature indeed and such a one as I have never had before or since Going through Aldersgate Street there was a pretty little child who had been at a dancing school and was going home all alone and my prompter like a true devil set me upon this innocent creature I talked to it and it prattled to me again and I took it by the hand and led it along till I came to a paved alley that goes into Bartholomew Close and I led it in there The child said that was not its way home I said Yes my dear it is I ll show you the way home The child had a little necklace on of gold beads and I had my eye upon that and in the dark of the alley I stooped pretending to mend the child s clog that was loose and took off her necklace and the child never felt it and so led the child on again Here I say the devil put me upon killing the child in the dark alley that it might not cry but the very thought frighted me so that I was ready to drop down but I turned the child about and bade it go back again for that was not its way home The child said so she would and I went through into Bartholomew Close and then turned round to another passage that goes into saint John Street then crossing into Smithfield went down Chick Lane and into Field Lane to Holborn Bridge when mixing with the crowd of people usually passing there it was not possible to have been found out and thus I enterprised my second sally into the world The thoughts of this booty put out all the thoughts of the first and the reflections I had made wore quickly off poverty as I have said hardened my heart and my own necessities made me regardless of anything The last affair left no great concern upon me for as I did the poor child no harm I only said to myself I had given the parents a just reproof for their negligence in leaving the poor little lamb to come home by itself and it would teach them to take more care of it another time This string of beads was worth about twelve or fourteen pounds I suppose it might have been formerly the mother s for it was too big for the child s wear but that perhaps the vanity of the mother to have her child look fine at the dancing school had made her let the child wear it and no doubt the child had a maid sent to take care of it but she careless jade was taken up perhaps with some fellow that had met her by the way and so the poor baby wandered till it fell into my hands However I did the child no harm I did not so much as fright it for I had a great many tender thoughts about me yet and did nothing but what as I may say mere necessity drove me to I had a great many adventures after this but I was young in the business and did not know how to manage otherwise than as the devil put things into my head and indeed he was seldom backward to me One adventure I had which was very lucky to me I was going through Lombard Street in the dusk of the evening just by the end of Three King court when on a sudden comes a fellow running by me as swift as lightning and throws a bundle that was in his hand just behind me as I stood up against the corner of the house at the turning into the alley Just as he threw it in he said God bless you mistress let it lie there a little and away he runs swift as the wind After him comes two more and immediately a young fellow without his hat crying Stop thief and after him two or three more They pursued the two last fellows so close that they were forced to drop what they had got and one of them was taken into the bargain and other got off free I stood stock still all this while till they came back dragging the poor fellow they had taken and lugging the things they had found extremely well satisfied that they had recovered the booty and taken the thief and thus they passed by me for I looked only like one who stood up while the crowd was gone Once or twice I asked what was the matter but the people neglected answering me and I was not very importunate but after the crowd was wholly past I took my opportunity to turn about and take up what was behind me and walk away This indeed I did with less disturbance than I had done formerly for these things I did not steal but they were stolen to my hand I got safe to my lodgings with this cargo which was a piece of fine black lustring silk and a piece of velvet the latter was but part of a piece of about eleven yards the former was a whole piece of near fifty yards It seems it was a mercer s shop that they had rifled I say rifled because the goods were so considerable that they had lost for the goods that they recovered were pretty many and I believe came to about six or seven several pieces of silk How they came to get so many I could not tell but as I had only robbed the thief I made no scruple at taking these goods and being very glad of them too I had pretty good luck thus far and I made several adventures more though with but small purchase yet with good success but I went in daily dread that some mischief would befall me and that I should certainly come to be hanged at last The impression this made on me was too strong to be slighted and it kept me from making attempts that for ought I knew might have been very safely performed but one thing I cannot omit which was a bait to me many a day I walked frequently out into the villages round the town to see if nothing would fall in my way there and going by a house near Stepney I saw on the window board two rings one a small diamond ring and the other a gold ring to be sure laid there by some thoughtless lady that had more money then forecast perhaps only till she washed her hands I walked several times by the window to observe if I could see whether there was anybody in the room or no and I could see nobody but still I was not sure It came presently into my thoughts to rap at the glass as if I wanted to speak with somebody and if anybody was there they would be sure to come to the window and then I would tell them to remove those rings for that I had seen two suspicious fellows take notice of them This was a ready thought I rapped once or twice and nobody came when seeing the coast clear I thrust hard against the square of the glass and broke it with very little noise and took out the two rings and walked away with them very safe The diamond ring was worth about three and the other about nines I was now at a loss for a market for my goods and especially for my two pieces of silk I was very loth to dispose of them for a trifle as the poor unhappy thieves in general do who after they have ventured their lives for perhaps a thing of value are fain to sell it for a song when they have done but I was resolved I would not do thus whatever shift I made unless I was driven to the last extremity However I did not well know what course to take At last I resolved to go to my old governess and acquaint myself with her again I had punctually supplied the five a year to her for my little boy as long as I was able but at last was obliged to put a stop to it However I had written a letter to her wherein I had told her that my circumstances were reduced very low that I had lost my husband and that I was not able to do it any longer and so begged that the poor child might not suffer too much for its mother s misfortunes I now made her a visit and I found that she drove something of the old trade still but that she was not in such flourishing circumstances as before for she had been sued by a certain gentleman who had had his daughter stolen from him and who it seems she had helped to convey away and it was very narrowly that she escaped the gallows The expense also had ravaged her and she was become very poor her house was but meanly furnished and she was not in such repute for her practice as before however she stood upon her legs as they say and a she was a stirring bustling woman and had some stock left she was turned pawnbroker and lived pretty well She received me very civilly and with her usual obliging manner told me she would not have the less respect for me for my being reduced that she had taken care my boy was very well looked after though I could not pay for him and that the woman that had him was easy so that I needed not to trouble myself about him till I might be better able to do it effectually I told her that I had not much money left but that I had some things that were money s worth if she could tell me how I might turn them into money She asked me what it was I had I pulled out the string of gold beads and told her it was one of my husband s presents to me then I showed her the two parcels of silk which I told her I had from Ireland and brought up to town with me and the little diamond ring As to the small parcel of plate and spoons I had found means to dispose of them myself before and as for the childbed linen I had she offered me to take it herself believing it to have been my own She told me that she was turned pawnbroker and that she would sell those things for me as pawn to her and so she sent presently for proper agents that bought them being in her hands without any scruple and gave good prices too I now began to think this necessary woman might help me a little in my low condition to some business for I would gladly have turned my hand to any honest employment if I could have got it But here she was deficient honest business did not come within her reach If I had been younger perhaps she might have helped me to a spark but my thoughts were off that kind of livelihood as being quite out of the way after fifty which was my case and so I told her She invited me at last to come and be at her house till I could find something to do and it should cost me very little and this I gladly accepted of And now living a little easier I entered into some measures to have my little son by my last husband taken off and this she made easy too reserving a payment only of five a year if I could pay it This was such a help to me that for a good while I left off the wicked trade that I had so newly taken up and gladly I would have got my bread by the help of my needle if I could have got work but that was very hard to do for one that had no manner of acquaintance in the world However at last I got some quilting work for ladies beds petticoats and the like and this I liked very well and worked very hard and with this I began to live but the diligent devil who resolved I should continue in his service continually prompted me to go out and take a walk that is to say to see if anything would offer in the old way One evening I blindly obeyed his summons and fetched a long circuit through the streets but met with no purchase and came home very weary and empty but not content with that I went out the next evening too when going by an alehouse I saw the door of a little room open next the very street and on the table a silver tankard things much in use in public houses at that time It seems some company had been drinking there and the careless boys had forgot to take it away I went into the box frankly and setting the silver tankard on the corner of the bench I sat down before it and knocked with my foot a boy came presently and I bade him fetch me a pint of warm ale for it was cold weather the boy ran and I heard him go down the cellar to draw the ale While the boy was gone another boy came into the room and cried D ye call I spoke with a melancholy air and said No child the boy is gone for a pint of ale for me While I sat here I heard the woman in the bar say Are they all gone in the five which was the box I sat in and the boy said Yes Who fetched the tankard away says the woman I did says another boy that s it pointing it seems to another tankard which he had fetched from another box by mistake or else it must be that the rogue forgot that he had not brought it in which certainly he had not I heard all this much to my satisfaction for I found plainly that the tankard was not missed and yet they concluded it was fetched away so I drank my ale called to pay and as I went away I said Take care of your plate child meaning a silver pint mug which he brought me drink in The boy said Yes madam very welcome and away I came I came home to my governess and now I thought it was a time to try her that if I might be put to the necessity of being exposed she might offer me some assistance When I had been at home some time and had an opportunity of talking to her I told her I had a secret of the greatest consequence in the world to commit to her if she had respect enough for me to keep it a secret She told me she had kept one of my secrets faithfully why should I doubt her keeping another I told her the strangest thing in the world had befallen me and that it had made a thief of me even without any design and so told her the whole story of the tankard And have you brought it away with you my dear says she To be sure I have says I and showed it her But what shall I do now says I must not carry it again Carry it again says she Ay if you are minded to be sent to Newgate for stealing it Why says I they can t be so base to stop me when I carry it to them again You don t know those sort of people child says she they ll not only carry you to Newgate but hang you too without any regard to the honesty of returning it or bring in an account of all the other tankards they have lost for you to pay for What must I do then says I Nay says she as you have played the cunning part and stole it you must e en keep it there s no going back now Besides child says she don t you want it more than they do I wish you could light of such a bargain once a week This gave me a new notion of my governess and that since she was turned pawnbroker she had a sort of people about her that were none of the honest ones that I had met with there before I had not been long there but I discovered it more plainly than before for every now and then I saw hilts of swords spoons forks tankards and all such kind of ware brought in not to be pawned but to be sold downright and she bought everything that came without asking any questions but had very good bargains as I found by her discourse I found also that in following this trade she always melted down the plate she bought that it might not be challenged and she came to me and told me one morning that she was going to melt and if I would she would put my tankard in that it might not be seen by anybody I told her with all my heart so she weighed it and allowed me the full value in silver again but I found she did not do the same to the rest of her customers Some time after this as I was at work and very melancholy she begins to ask me what the matter was as she was used to do I told her my heart was heavy I had little work and nothing to live on and knew not what course to take She laughed and told me I must go out again and try my fortune it might be that I might meet with another piece of plate O mother says I that is a trade I have no skill in and if I should be taken I am undone at once Says she I could help you to a schoolmistress that shall make you as dexterous as herself I trembled at that proposal for hitherto I had had no confederates nor any acquaintance among that tribe But she conquered all my modesty and all my fears and in a little time by the help of this confederate I grew as impudent a thief and as dexterous as ever Moll Cutpurse was though if fame does not belie her not half so handsome The comrade she helped me to dealt in three sorts of craft viz shoplifting stealing of shop books and pocket books and taking off gold watches from the ladies sides and this last she did so dexterously that no woman ever arrived to the performance of that art so as to do it like her I liked the first and the last of these things very well and I attended her some time in the practice just as a deputy attends a midwife without any pay At length she put me to practice She had shown me her art and I had several times unhooked a watch from her own side with great dexterity At last she showed me a prize and this was a young lady big with child who had a charming watch The thing was to be done as she came out of church She goes on one side of the lady and pretends just as she came to the steps to fall and fell against the lady with so much violence as put her into a great fright and both cried out terribly In the very moment that she jostled the lady I had hold of the watch and holding it the right way the start she gave drew the hook out and she never felt it I made off immediately and left my schoolmistress to come out of her pretended fright gradually and the lady too and presently the watch was missed Ay says my comrade then it was those rogues that thrust me down I warrant ye I wonder the gentlewoman did not miss her watch before then we might have taken them She humoured the thing so well that nobody suspected her and I was got home a full hour before her This was my first adventure in company The watch was indeed a very fine one and had a great many trinkets about it and my governess allowed us twenty for it of which I had half And thus I was entered a complete thief hardened to the pitch above all the reflections of conscience or modesty and to a degree which I must acknowledge I never thought possible in me Thus the devil who began by the help of an irresistible poverty to push me into this wickedness brought me on to a height beyond the common rate even when my necessities were not so great or the prospect of my misery so terrifying for I had now got into a little vein of work and as I was not at a loss to handle my needle it was very probable as acquaintance came in I might have got my bread honestly enough I must say that if such a prospect of work had presented itself at first when I began to feel the approach of my miserable circumstances I say had such a prospect of getting my bread by working presented itself then I had never fallen into this wicked trade or into such a wicked gang as I was now embarked with but practice had hardened me and I grew audacious to the last degree and the more so because I had carried it on so long and had never been taken for in a word my new partner in wickedness and I went on together so long without being ever detected that we not only grew bold but we grew rich and we had at one time one and twenty gold watches in our hands I remember that one day being a little more serious than ordinary and finding I had so good a stock beforehand as I had for I had near two hundred in money for my share it came strongly into my mind no doubt from some kind spirit if such there be that at first poverty excited me and my distresses drove me to these dreadful shifts so seeing those distresses were now relieved and I could also get something towards a maintenance by working and had so good a bank to support me why should I now not leave off as they say while I was well that I could not expect to go always free and if I was once surprised and miscarried I was undone This was doubtless the happy minute when if I had hearkened to the blessed hint from whatsoever had it came I had still a cast for an easy life But my fate was otherwise determined the busy devil that so industriously drew me in had too fast hold of me to let me go back but as poverty brought me into the mire so avarice kept me in till there was no going back As to the arguments which my reason dictated for persuading me to lay down avarice stepped in and said Go on go on you have had very good luck go on till you have gotten four or five hundred pounds and then you shall leave off and then you may live easy without working at all Thus I that was once in the devil s clutches was held fast there as with a charm and had no power to go without the circle till I was engulfed in labyrinths of trouble too great to get out at all However these thoughts left some impression upon me and made me act with some more caution than before and more than my directors used for themselves My comrade as I called her but rather she should have been called my teacher with another of her scholars was the first in the misfortune for happening to be upon the hunt for purchase they made an attempt upon a linen draper in Cheapside but were snapped by a hawk s eyed journeyman and seized with two pieces of cambric which were taken also upon them This was enough to lodge them both in Newgate where they had the misfortune to have some of their former sins brought to remembrance Two other indictments being brought against them and the facts being proved upon them they were both condemned to die They both pleaded their bellies and were both voted quick with child though my tutoress was no more with child than I was I went frequently to see them and condole with them expecting that it would be my turn next but the place gave me so much horror reflecting that it was the place of my unhappy birth and of my mother s misfortunes and that I could not bear it so I was forced to leave off going to see them And oh could I have but taken warning by their disasters I had been happy still for I was yet free and had nothing brought against me but it could not be my measure was not yet filled up My comrade having the brand of an old offender was executed the young offender was spared having obtained a reprieve but lay starving a long while in prison till at last she got her name into what they call a circuit pardon and so came off This terrible example of my comrade frighted me heartily and for a good while I made no excursions but one night in the neighbourhood of my governess s house they cried Fire My governess looked out for we were all up and cried immediately that such a gentlewoman s house was all of a light fire atop and so indeed it was Here she gives me a job Now child says she there is a rare opportunity for the fire being so near that you may go to it before the street is blocked up with the crowd She presently gave me my cue Go child says she to the house and run in and tell the lady or anybody you see that you come to help them and that you came from such a gentlewoman that is one of her acquaintance farther up the street She gave me the like cue to the next house naming another name that was also an acquaintance of the gentlewoman of the house Away I went and coming to the house I found them all in confusion you may be sure I ran in and finding one of the maids Lord sweetheart says I how came this dismal accident Where is your mistress Any how does she do Is she safe And where are the children I come from Madam to help you Away runs the maid Madam madam says she screaming as loud as she could yell here is a gentlewoman come from Madam to help us The poor woman half out of her wits with a bundle under her arm an two little children comes toward me Lord madam says I let me carry the poor children to Madam she desires you to send them she ll take care of the poor lambs and immediately I takes one of them out of her hand and she lifts the other up into my arms Ay do for God s sake says she carry them to her Oh thank her for her kindness Have you anything else to secure madam says I she will take care of it Oh dear ay says she God bless her and thank her Take this bundle of plate and carry it to her too Oh she is a good woman Oh Lord we are utterly ruined utterly undone And away she runs from me out of her wits and the maids after her and away comes I with the two children and the bundle I was no sooner got into the street but I saw another woman come to me Oh says she mistress in a piteous tone you will let fall the child Come this is a sad time let me help you and immediately lays hold of my bundle to carry it for me No says I if you will help me take the child by the hand and lead it for me but to the upper end of the street I ll go with you and satisfy you for your pains She could not avoid going after what I said but the creature in short was one of the same business with me and wanted nothing but the bundle however she went with me to the door for she could not help it When we were come there I whispered her Go child said I I understand your trade you may meet with purchase enough She understood me and walked off I thundered at the door with the children and as the people were raised before by the noise of the fire I was soon let in and I said Is madam awake Pray tell her missus desires the favour of her to take the two children in poor lady she will be undone their house is all of a flame They took the children in very civilly pitied the family in distress and away came I with my bundle One of the maids asked me if I was not to leave the bundle too I said No sweetheart tis to go to another place it does not belong to them I was a great way out of the hurry now and so I went on clear of anybody s inquiry and brought the bundle of plate which was very considerable straight home and gave it to my old governess She told me she would not look into it but bade me go out again to look for more She gave me the like cue to the gentlewoman of the next house to that which was on fire and I did my endeavour to go but by this time the alarm of fire was so great and so many engines playing and the street so thronged with people that I could not get near the house whatever I would do so I came back again to my governess s and taking the bundle up into my chamber I began to examine it It is with horror that I tell what a treasure I found there tis enough to say that besides most of the family plate which was considerable I found a gold chain an old fashioned thing the locket of which was broken so that I suppose it had not been used some years but the gold was not the worse for that also a little box of burying rings the lady s wedding ring and some broken bits of old lockets of gold a gold watch and a purse with about twenty four value in old pieces of gold coin and several other things of value This was the greatest and the worst prize that ever I was concerned in for indeed though as I have said above I was hardened now beyond the power of all reflection in other cases yet it really touched me to the very soul when I looked into this treasure to think of the poor disconsolate gentlewoman who had lost so much by the fire besides and who would think to be sure that she had saved her plate and best things how she would be surprised and afflicted when she should find that she had been deceived and should find that the person that took her children and her goods had not come as was pretended from the gentlewoman in the next street but that the children had been put upon her without her own knowledge I say I confess the inhumanity of this action moved me very much and made me relent exceedingly and tears stood in my eyes upon that subject but with all my sense of its being cruel and inhuman I could never find in my heart to make any restitution The reflection wore off and I began quickly to forget the circumstances that attended the taking them Nor was this all for though by this job I was become considerably richer than before yet the resolution I had formerly taken of leaving off this horrid trade when I had gotten a little more did not return but I must still get farther and more and the avarice joined so with the success that I had no more thought of coming to a timely alteration of life though without it I could expect no safety no tranquillity in the possession of what I had so wickedly gained but a little more and a little more was the case still At length yielding to the importunities of my crime I cast off all remorse and repentance and all the reflections on that head turned to no more than this that I might perhaps come to have one booty more that might complete my desires but though I certainly had that one booty yet every hit looked towards another and was so encouraging to me to go on with the trade that I had no gust to the thought of laying it down In this condition hardened by success and resolving to go on I fell into the snare in which I was appointed to meet with my last reward for this kind of life But even this was not yet for I met with several successful adventures more in this way of being undone I remained still with my governess who was for a while really concerned for the misfortune of my comrade that had been hanged and who it seems knew enough of my governess to have sent her the same way and which made her very uneasy indeed she was in a very great fright It is true that when she was gone and had not opened mouth to tell what she knew my governess was easy as to that point and perhaps glad she was hanged for it was in her power to have obtained a pardon at the expense of her friends but on the other hand the loss of her and the sense of her kindness in not making her market of what she knew moved my governess to mourn very sincerely for her I comforted her as well as I could and she in return hardened me to merit more completely the same fate However as I have said it made me the more wary and particularly I was very shy of shoplifting especially among the mercers and drapers who are a set of fellows that have their eyes very much about them I made a venture or two among the lace folks and the milliners and particularly at one shop where I got notice of two young women who were newly set up and had not been bred to the trade There I think I carried off a piece of bone lace worth six or seven pounds and a paper of thread But this was but once it was a trick that would not serve again It was always reckoned a safe job when we heard of a new shop and especially when the people were such as were not bred to shops Such may depend upon it that they will be visited once or twice at their beginning and they must be very sharp indeed if they can prevent it I made another adventure or two but they were but trifles too though sufficient to live on After this nothing considerable offering for a good while I began to think that I must give over the trade in earnest but my governess who was not willing to lose me and expected great things of me brought me one day into company with a young woman and a fellow that went for her husband though as it appeared afterwards she was not his wife but they were partners it seems in the trade they carried on and partners in something else In short they robbed together lay together were taken together and at last were hanged together I came into a kind of league with these two by the help of my governess and they carried me out into three or four adventures where I rather saw them commit some coarse and unhandy robberies in which nothing but a great stock of impudence on their side and gross negligence on the people s side who were robbed could have made them successful So I resolved from that time forward to be very cautious how I adventured upon anything with them and indeed when two or three unlucky projects were proposed by them I declined the offer and persuaded them against it One time they particularly proposed robbing a watchmaker of three gold watches which they had eyed in the daytime and found the place where he laid them One of them had so many keys of all kinds that he made no question to open the place where the watchmaker had laid them and so we made a kind of an appointment but when I came to look narrowly into the thing I found they proposed breaking open the house and this as a thing out of my way I would not embark in so they went without me They did get into the house by main force and broke up the locked place where the watches were but found but one of the gold watches and a silver one which they took and got out of the house again very clear But the family being alarmed cried out Thieves and the man was pursued and taken the young woman had got off too but unhappily was stopped at a distance and the watches found upon her And thus I had a second escape for they were convicted and both hanged being old offenders though but young people As I said before that they robbed together and lay together so now they hanged together and there ended my new partnership I began now to be very wary having so narrowly escaped a scouring and having such an example before me but I had a new tempter who prompted me every day I mean my governess and now a prize presented which as it came by her management so she expected a good share of the booty There was a good quantity of Flanders lace lodged in a private house where she had gotten intelligence of it and Flanders lace being prohibited it was a good booty to any custom house officer that could come at it I had a full account from my governess as well of the quantity as of the very place where it was concealed and I went to a custom house officer and told him I had such a discovery to make to him of such a quantity of lace if he would assure me that I should have my due share of the reward This was so just an offer that nothing could be fairer so he agreed and taking a constable and me with him we beset the house As I told him I could go directly to the place he left it to me and the hole being very dark I squeezed myself into it with a candle in my hand and so reached the pieces out to him taking care as I gave him some so to secure as much about myself as I could conveniently dispose of There was near three hundred worth of lace in the hole and I secured about fifty worth of it to myself The people of the house were not owners of the lace but a merchant who had entrusted them with it so that they were not so surprised as I thought they would be I left the officer overjoyed with his prize and fully satisfied with what he had got and appointed to meet him at a house of his own directing where I came after I had disposed of the cargo I had about me of which he had not the least suspicion When I came to him he began to capitulate with me believing I did not understand the right I had to a share in the prize and would fain have put me off with twenty but I let him know that I was not so ignorant as he supposed I was and yet I was glad too that he offered to bring me to a certainty I asked one hundred and he rose up to thirty I fell to eighty and he rose again to forty in a word he offered fifty and I consented only demanding a piece of lace which I though came to about eight or nine as if it had been for my own wear and he agreed to it So I got fifty in money paid me that same night and made an end of the bargain nor did he ever know who I was or where to inquire for me so that if it had been discovered that part of the goods were embezzled he could have made no challenge upon me for it I very punctually divided this spoil with my governess and I passed with her from this time for a very dexterous manager in the nicest cases I found that this last was the best and easiest sort of work that was in my way and I made it my business to inquire out prohibited goods and after buying some usually betrayed them but none of these discoveries amounted to anything considerable not like that I related just now but I was willing to act safe and was still cautious of running the great risks which I found others did and in which they miscarried every day The next thing of moment was an attempt at a gentlewoman s good watch It happened in a crowd at a meeting house where I was in very great danger of being taken I had full hold of her watch but giving a great jostle as if somebody had thrust me against her and in the juncture giving the watch a fair pull I found it would not come so I let it go that moment and cried out as if I had been killed that somebody had trod upon my foot and that there were certainly pickpockets there for somebody or other had given a pull at my watch for you are to observe that on these adventures we always went very well dressed and I had very good clothes on and a gold watch by my side as like a lady as other fold I had no sooner said so but the other gentlewoman cried out A pickpocket too for somebody she said had tried to pull her watch away When I touched her watch I was close to her but when I cried out I stopped as it were short and the crowd bearing her forward a little she made a noise too but it was at some distance from me so that she did not in the least suspect me but when she cried out A pickpocket somebody cried Ay and here has been another this gentlewoman has been attempted too At that very instance a little farther in the crowd and very luckily too they cried out A pickpocket again and really seized a young fellow in the very act This though unhappy for the wretch was very opportunely for my case though I had carried it off handsomely enough before but now it was out of doubt and all the loose part of the crowd ran that way and the poor boy was delivered up to the rage of the street which is a cruelty I need not describe and which however they are always glad of rather than to be sent to Newgate where they lie often a long time till they are almost perished and sometimes they are hanged and the best they can look for if they are convicted is to be transported This was a narrow escape to me and I was so frighted that I ventured no more at gold watches a great while There was indeed a great many concurring circumstances in this adventure which assisted to my escape but the chief was that the woman whose watch I had pulled at was a fool that is to say she was ignorant of the nature of the attempt which one would have thought she should not have been seeing she was wise enough to fasten her watch so that it could not be slipped up But she was in such a fright that she had no thought about her proper for the discovery for she when she felt the pull screamed out and pushed herself forward and put all the people about her into disorder but said not a word of her watch or of a pickpocket for a least two minutes time which was time enough for me and to spare For as I had cried out behind her as I have said and bore myself back in the crowd as she bore forward there were several people at least seven or eight the throng being still moving on that were got between me and her in that time and then I crying out A pickpocket rather sooner than she or at least as soon she might as well be the person suspected as I and the people were confused in their inquiry whereas had she with a presence of mind needful on such an occasion as soon as she felt the pull not screamed out as she did but turned immediately round and seized the next body that was behind her she had infallibly taken me This is a direction not of the kindest sort to the fraternity but tis certainly a key to the clue of a pickpocket s motions and whoever can follow it will as certainly catch the thief as he will be sure to miss if he does not I had another adventure which puts this matter out of doubt and which may be an instruction for posterity in the case of a pickpocket My good old governess to give a short touch at her history though she had left off the trade was as I may say born a pickpocket and as I understood afterwards had run through all the several degrees of that art and yet had never been taken but once when she was so grossly detected that she was convicted and ordered to be transported but being a woman of a rare tongue and withal having money in her pocket she found means the ship putting into Ireland for provisions to get on shore there where she lived and practised her old trade for some years when falling into another sort of bad company she turned midwife and procuress and played a hundred pranks there which she gave me a little history of in confidence between us as we grew more intimate and it was to this wicked creature that I owed all the art and dexterity I arrived to in which there were few that ever went beyond me or that practised so long without any misfortune It was after those adventures in Ireland and when she was pretty well known in that country that she left Dublin and came over to England where the time of her transportation being not expired she left her former trade for fear of falling into bad hands again for then she was sure to have gone to wreck Here she set up the same trade she had followed in Ireland in which she soon by her admirable management and good tongue arrived to the height which I have already described and indeed began to be rich though her trade fell off again afterwards as I have hinted before I mentioned thus much of the history of this woman here the better to account for the concern she had in the wicked life I was now leading into all the particulars of which she led me as it were by the hand and gave me such directions and I so well followed them that I grew the greatest artist of my time and worked myself out of every danger with such dexterity that when several more of my comrades ran themselves into Newgate presently and by that time they had been half a year at the trade I had now practised upwards of five years and the people at Newgate did not so much as know me they had heard much of me indeed and often expected me there but I always got off though many times in the extremest danger One of the greatest dangers I was now in was that I was too well known among the trade and some of them whose hatred was owing rather to envy than any injury I had done them began to be angry that I should always escape when they were always catched and hurried to Newgate These were they that gave me the name of Moll Flanders for it was no more of affinity with my real name or with any of the name I had ever gone by than black is of kin to white except that once as before I called myself missus Flanders when I sheltered myself in the Mint but that these rogues never knew nor could I ever learn how they came to give me the name or what the occasion of it was I was soon informed that some of these who were gotten fast into Newgate had vowed to impeach me and as I knew that two or three of them were but too able to do it I was under a great concern about it and kept within doors for a good while But my governess whom I always made partner in my success and who now played a sure game with me for that she had a share of the gain and no share in the hazard I say my governess was something impatient of my leading such a useless unprofitable life as she called it and she laid a new contrivance for my going abroad and this was to dress me up in men s clothes and so put me into a new kind of practice I was tall and personable but a little too smooth faced for a man however I seldom went abroad but in the night it did well enough but it was a long time before I could behave in my new clothes I mean as to my craft It was impossible to be so nimble so ready so dexterous at these things in a dress so contrary to nature and I did everything clumsily so I had neither the success nor the easiness of escape that I had before and I resolved to leave it off but that resolution was confirmed soon after by the following accident As my governess disguised me like a man so she joined me with a man a young fellow that was nimble enough at his business and for about three weeks we did very well together Our principal trade was watching shopkeepers counters and slipping off any kind of goods we could see carelessly laid anywhere and we made several good bargains as we called them at this work And as we kept always together so we grew very intimate yet he never knew that I was not a man nay though I several times went home with him to his lodgings according as our business directed and four or five times lay with him all night But our design lay another way and it was absolutely necessary to me to conceal my sex from him as appeared afterwards The circumstances of our living coming in late and having such and such business to do as required that nobody should be trusted with the coming into our lodgings were such as made it impossible to me to refuse lying with him unless I would have owned my sex and as it was I effectually concealed myself But his ill and my good fortune soon put an end to this life which I must own I was sick of too on several other accounts We had made several prizes in this new way of business but the last would be extraordinary There was a shop in a certain street which had a warehouse behind it that looked into another street the house making the corner of the turning Through the window of the warehouse we saw lying on the counter or showboard which was just before it five pieces of silks besides other stuffs and though it was almost dark yet the people being busy in the fore shop with customers had not had time to shut up those windows or else had forgot it This the young fellow was so overjoyed with that he could not restrain himself It lay all within his reach he said and he swore violently to me that he would have it if he broke down the house for it I dissuaded him a little but saw there was no remedy so he ran rashly upon it slipped out a square of the sash window dexterously enough and without noise and got out four pieces of the silks and came with them towards me but was immediately pursued with a terrible clutter and noise We were standing together indeed but I had not taken any of the goods out of his hand when I said to him hastily You are undone fly for God s sake He ran like lightning and I too but the pursuit was hotter after him because he had the goods than after me He dropped two of the pieces which stopped them a little but the crowd increased and pursued us both They took him soon after with the other two pieces upon him and then the rest followed me I ran for it and got into my governess s house whither some quick eyed people followed me to warmly as to fix me there They did not immediately knock at the door by which I got time to throw off my disguise and dress me in my own clothes besides when they came there my governess who had her tale ready kept her door shut and called out to them and told them there was no man come in there The people affirmed there did a man come in there and swore they would break open the door My governess not at all surprised spoke calmly to them told them they should very freely come and search her house if they should bring a constable and let in none but such as the constable would admit for it was unreasonable to let in a whole crowd This they could not refuse though they were a crowd So a constable was fetched immediately and she very freely opened the door the constable kept the door and the men he appointed searched the house my governess going with them from room to room When she came to my room she called to me and said aloud Cousin pray open the door here s some gentlemen that must come and look into your room I had a little girl with me which was my governess s grandchild as she called her and I bade her open the door and there sat I at work with a great litter of things about me as if I had been at work all day being myself quite undressed with only night clothes on my head and a loose morning gown wrapped about me My governess made a kind of excuse for their disturbing me telling me partly the occasion of it and that she had no remedy but to open the doors to them and let them satisfy themselves for all she could say to them would not satisfy them I sat still and bid them search the room if they pleased for if there was anybody in the house I was sure they were not in my room and as for the rest of the house I had nothing to say to that I did not understand what they looked for Everything looked so innocent and to honest about me that they treated me civiller than I expected but it was not till they had searched the room to a nicety even under the bed in the bed and everywhere else where it was possible anything could be hid When they had done this and could find nothing they asked my pardon for troubling me and went down When they had thus searched the house from bottom to top and then top to bottom and could find nothing they appeased the mob pretty well but they carried my governess before the justice Two men swore that they saw the man whom they pursued go into her house My governess rattled and made a great noise that her house should be insulted and that she should be used thus for nothing that if a man did come in he might go out again presently for aught she knew for she was ready to make oath that no man had been within her doors all that day as she knew of and that was very true indeed that is might be indeed that as she was abovestairs any fellow in a fright might find the door open and run in for shelter when he was pursued but that she knew nothing of it and if it had been so he certainly went out again perhaps at the other door for she had another door into an alley and so had made his escape and cheated them all This was indeed probable enough and the justice satisfied himself with giving her an oath that she had not received or admitted any man into her house to conceal him or protect or hide him from justice This oath she might justly take and did so and so she was dismissed It is easy to judge what a fright I was in upon this occasion and it was impossible for my governess ever to bring me to dress in that disguise again for as I told her I should certainly betray myself My poor partner in this mischief was now in a bad case for he was carried away before my Lord Mayor and by his worship committed to Newgate and the people that took him were so willing as well as able to prosecute him that they offered themselves to enter into recognisances to appear at the sessions and pursue the charge against him However he got his indictment deferred upon promise to discover his accomplices and particularly the man that was concerned with him in his robbery and he failed not to do his endeavour for he gave in my name whom he called Gabriel Spencer which was the name I went by to him and here appeared the wisdom of my concealing my name and sex from him which if he had ever known I had been undone He did all he could to discover this Gabriel Spencer he described me he discovered the place where he said I lodged and in a word all the particulars that he could of my dwelling but having concealed the main circumstances of my sex from him I had a vast advantage and he never could hear of me He brought two or three families into trouble by his endeavouring to find me out but they knew nothing of me any more than that I had a fellow with me that they had seen but knew nothing of And as for my governess though she was the means of his coming to me yet it was done at second hand and he knew nothing of her This turned to his disadvantage for having promised discoveries but not being able to make it good it was looked upon as trifling with the justice of the city and he was the more fiercely pursued by the shopkeepers who took him I was however terribly uneasy all this while and that I might be quite out of the way I went away from my governess s for a while but not knowing wither to wander I took a maid servant with me and took the stage coach to Dunstable to my old landlord and landlady where I had lived so handsomely with my Lancashire husband Here I told her a formal story that I expected my husband every day from Ireland and that I had sent a letter to him that I would meet him at Dunstable at her house and that he would certainly land if the wind was fair in a few days so that I was come to spend a few days with them till he should come for he was either come post or in the West Chester coach I knew not which but whichsoever it was he would be sure to come to that house to meet me My landlady was mighty glad to see me and my landlord made such a stir with me that if I had been a princess I could not have been better used and here I might have been welcome a month or two if I had thought fit But my business was of another nature I was very uneasy though so well disguised that it was scarce possible to detect me lest this fellow should somehow or other find me out and though he could not charge me with this robbery having persuaded him not to venture and having also done nothing in it myself but run away yet he might have charged me with other things and have bought his own life at the expense of mine This filled me with horrible apprehensions I had no recourse no friend no confidante but my old governess and I knew no remedy but to put my life in her hands and so I did for I let her know where to send to me and had several letters from her while I stayed here Some of them almost scared me out my wits but at last she sent me the joyful news that he was hanged which was the best news to me that I had heard a great while I had stayed here five weeks and lived very comfortably indeed the secret anxiety of my mind excepted but when I received this letter I looked pleasantly again and told my landlady that I had received a letter from my spouse in Ireland that I had the good news of his being very well but had the bad news that his business would not permit him to come away so soon as he expected and so I was like to go back again without him My landlady complimented me upon the good news however that I had heard he was well For I have observed madam says she you hadn t been so pleasant as you used to be you have been over head and ears in care for him I dare say says the good woman tis easy to be seen there s an alteration in you for the better says she Well I am sorry the esquire can t come yet says my landlord I should have been heartily glad to have seen him But I hope when you have certain news of his coming you ll take a step hither again madam says he you shall be very welcome whenever you please to come With all these fine compliments we parted and I came merry enough to London and found my governess as well pleased as I was And now she told me she would never recommend any partner to me again for she always found she said that I had the best luck when I ventured by myself And so indeed I had for I was seldom in any danger when I was by myself or if I was I got out of it with more dexterity than when I was entangled with the dull measures of other people who had perhaps less forecast and were more rash and impatient than I for though I had as much courage to venture as any of them yet I used more caution before I undertook a thing and had more presence of mind when I was to bring myself off I have often wondered even at my own hardiness another way that when all my companions were surprised and fell so suddenly into the hand of justice and that I so narrowly escaped yet I could not all this while enter into one serious resolution to leave off this trade and especially considering that I was now very far from being poor that the temptation of necessity which is generally the introduction of all such wickedness was now removed for I had near five hundred by me in ready money on which I might have lived very well if I had thought fit to have retired but I say I had not so much as the least inclination to leave off no not so much as I had before when I had but two hundred beforehand and when I had no such frightful examples before my eyes as these were From hence tis evident to me that when once we are hardened in crime no fear can affect us no example give us any warning I had indeed one comrade whose fate went very near me for a good while though I wore it off too in time That case was indeed very unhappy I had made a prize of a piece of very good damask in a mercer s shop and went clear off myself but had conveyed the piece to this companion of mine when we went out of the shop and she went one way and I went another We had not been long out of the shop but the mercer missed his piece of stuff and sent his messengers one one way and one another and they presently seized her that had the piece with the damask upon her As for me I had very luckily stepped into a house where there was a lace chamber up one pair of stairs and had the satisfaction or the terror indeed of looking out of the window upon the noise they made and seeing the poor creature dragged away in triumph to the justice who immediately committed her to Newgate I was careful to attempt nothing in the lace chamber but tumbled their goods pretty much to spend time then bought a few yards of edging and paid for it and came away very sad hearted indeed for the poor woman who was in tribulation for what I only had stolen Here again my old caution stood me in good stead namely that though I often robbed with these people yet I never let them know who I was or where I lodged nor could they ever find out my lodging though they often endeavoured to watch me to it They all knew me by the name of Moll Flanders though even some of them rather believed I was she than knew me to be so My name was public among them indeed but how to find me out they knew not nor so much as how to guess at my quarters whether they were at the east end of the town or the west and this wariness was my safety upon all these occasions I kept close a great while upon the occasion of this woman s disaster I knew that if I should do anything that should miscarry and should be carried to prison she would be there and ready to witness against me and perhaps save her life at my expense I considered that I began to be very well known by name at the Old Bailey though they did not know my face and that if I should fall into their hands I should be treated as an old offender and for this reason I was resolved to see what this poor creature s fate should be before I stirred abroad though several times in her distress I conveyed money to her for her relief At length she came to her trial She pleaded she did not steal the thing but that one missus Flanders as she heard her called for she did not know her gave the bundle to her after they came out of the shop and bade her carry it home to her lodging They asked her where this missus Flanders was but she could not produce her neither could she give the least account of me and the mercer s men swearing positively that she was in the shop when the goods were stolen that they immediately missed them and pursued her and found them upon her thereupon the jury brought her in guilty but the Court considering that she was really not the person that stole the goods an inferior assistant and that it was very possible she could not find out this missus Flanders meaning me though it would save her life which indeed was true I say considering all this they allowed her to be transported which was the utmost favour she could obtain only that the Court told her that if she could in the meantime produce the said missus Flanders they would intercede for her pardon that is to say if she could find me out and hand me she should not be transported This I took care to make impossible to her and so she was shipped off in pursuance of her sentence a little while after I must repeat it again that the fate of this poor woman troubled me exceedingly and I began to be very pensive knowing that I was really the instrument of her disaster but the preservation of my own life which was so evidently in danger took off all my tenderness and seeing that she was not put to death I was very easy at her transportation because she was then out of the way of doing me any mischief whatever should happen The disaster of this woman was some months before that of the last recited story and was indeed partly occasion of my governess proposing to dress me up in men s clothes that I might go about unobserved as indeed I did but I was soon tired of that disguise as I have said for indeed it exposed me to too many difficulties I was now easy as to all fear of witnesses against me for all those that had either been concerned with me or that knew me by the name of Moll Flanders were either hanged or transported and if I should have had the misfortune to be taken I might call myself anything else as well as Moll Flanders and no old sins could be placed into my account so I began to run a tick again with the more freedom and several successful adventures I made though not such as I had made before We had at that time another fire happened not a great way off from the place where my governess lived and I made an attempt there as before but as I was not soon enough before the crowd of people came in and could not get to the house I aimed at instead of a prize I got a mischief which had almost put a period to my life and all my wicked doings together for the fire being very furious and the people in a great fright in removing their goods and throwing them out of window a wench from out of a window threw a feather bed just upon me It is true the bed being soft it broke no bones but as the weight was great and made greater by the fall it beat me down and laid me dead for a while Nor did the people concern themselves much to deliver me from it or to recover me at all but I lay like one dead and neglected a good while till somebody going to remove the bed out of the way helped me up It was indeed a wonder the people in the house had not thrown other goods out after it and which might have fallen upon it and then I had been inevitably killed but I was reserved for further afflictions This accident however spoiled my market for that time and I came home to my governess very much hurt and bruised and frighted to the last degree and it was a good while before she could set me upon my feet again It was now a merry time of the year and Bartholomew Fair was begun I had never made any walks that way nor was the common part of the fair of much advantage to me but I took a turn this year into the cloisters and among the rest I fell into one of the raffling shops It was a thing of no great consequence to me nor did I expect to make much of it but there came a gentleman extremely well dressed and very rich and as tis frequent to talk to everybody in those shops he singled me out and was very particular with me First he told me he would put in for me to raffle and did so and some small matter coming to his lot he presented it to me I think it was a feather muff then he continued to keep talking to me with a more than common appearance of respect but still very civil and much like a gentleman He held me in talk so long till at last he drew me out of the raffling place to the shop door and then to a walk in the cloister still talking of a thousand things cursorily without anything to the purpose At last he told me that without compliment he was charmed with my company and asked me if I durst trust myself in a coach with him he told me he was a man of honour and would not offer anything to me unbecoming him as such I seemed to decline it a while but suffered myself to be importuned a little and then yielded I was at a loss in my thoughts to conclude at first what this gentleman designed but I found afterwards he had had some drink in his head and that he was not very unwilling to have some more He carried me in the coach to the Spring Garden at Knightsbridge where we walked in the gardens and he treated me very handsomely but I found he drank very freely He pressed me also to drink but I declined it Hitherto he kept his word with me and offered me nothing amiss We came away in the coach again and he brought me into the streets and by this time it was near ten o clock at night and he stopped the coach at a house where it seems he was acquainted and where they made no scruple to show us upstairs into a room with a bed in it At first I seemed to be unwilling to go up but after a few words I yielded to that too being willing to see the end of it and in hope to make something of it at last As for the bed et cetera I was not much concerned about that part Here he began to be a little freer with me than he had promised and I by little and little yielded to everything so that in a word he did what he pleased with me I need say no more All this while he drank freely too and about one in the morning we went into the coach again The air and the shaking of the coach made the drink he had get more up in his head than it was before and he grew uneasy in the coach and was for acting over again what he had been doing before but as I thought my game now secure I resisted him and brought him to be a little still which had not lasted five minutes but he fell fast asleep I took this opportunity to search him to a nicety I took a gold watch with a silk purse of gold his fine full bottom periwig and silver fringed gloves his sword and fine snuff box and gently opening the coach door stood ready to jump out while the coach was going on but the coach stopped in the narrow street beyond Temple Bar to let another coach pass I got softly out fastened the door again and gave my gentleman and the coach the slip both together and never heard more of them This was an adventure indeed unlooked for and perfectly undesigned by me though I was not so past the merry part of life as to forget how to behave when a fop so blinded by his appetite should not know an old woman from a young I did not indeed look so old as I was by ten or twelve years yet I was not a young wench of seventeen and it was easy enough to be distinguished There is nothing so absurd so surfeiting so ridiculous as a man heated by wine in his head and wicked gust in his inclination together he is in the possession of two devils at once and can no more govern himself by his reason than a mill can grind without water his vice tramples upon all that was in him that had any good in it if any such thing there was nay his very sense is blinded by its own rage and he acts absurdities even in his views such a drinking more when he is drunk already picking up a common woman without regard to what she is or who she is whether sound or rotten clean or unclean whether ugly or handsome whether old or young and so blinded as not really to distinguish Such a man is worse than a lunatic prompted by his vicious corrupted head he no more knows what he is doing than this wretch of mine knew when I picked his pocket of his watch and his purse of gold These are the men of whom Solomon says They go like an ox to the slaughter till a dart strikes through their liver an admirable description by the way of the foul disease which is a poisonous deadly contagion mingling with the blood whose centre or foundation is in the liver from whence by the swift circulation of the whole mass that dreadful nauseous plague strikes immediately through his liver and his spirits are infected his vitals stabbed through as with a dart It is true this poor unguarded wretch was in no danger from me though I was greatly apprehensive at first of what danger I might be in from him but he was really to be pitied in one respect that he seemed to be a good sort of man in himself a gentleman that had no harm in his design a man of sense and of a fine behaviour a comely handsome person a sober solid countenance a charming beautiful face and everything that could be agreeable only had unhappily had some drink the night before had not been in bed as he told me when we were together was hot and his blood fired with wine and in that condition his reason as it were asleep had given him up As for me my business was his money and what I could make of him and after that if I could have found out any way to have done it I would have sent him safe home to his house and to his family for twas ten to one but he had an honest virtuous wife and innocent children that were anxious for his safety and would have been glad to have gotten him home and have taken care of him till he was restored to himself And then with what shame and regret would he look back upon himself how would he reproach himself with associating himself with a whore picked up in the worst of all holes the cloister among the dirt and filth of all the town how would he be trembling for fear he had got the pox for fear a dart had struck through his liver and hate himself every time he looked back upon the madness and brutality of his debauch how would he if he had any principles of honour as I verily believe he had I say how would he abhor the thought of giving any ill distemper if he had it as for aught he knew he might to his modest and virtuous wife and thereby sowing the contagion in the life blood of his posterity Would such gentlemen but consider the contemptible thoughts which the very women they are concerned with in such cases as these have of them it would be a surfeit to them As I said above they value not the pleasure they are raised by no inclination to the man the passive jade thinks of no pleasure but the money and when he is as it were drunk in the ecstasies of his wicked pleasure her hands are in his pockets searching for what she can find there and of which he can no more be sensible in the moment of his folly that he can forethink of it when he goes about it I knew a woman that was so dexterous with a fellow who indeed deserved no better usage that while he was busy with her another way conveyed his purse with twenty guineas in it out of his fob pocket where he had put it for fear of her and put another purse with gilded counters in it into the room of it After he had done he says to her Now han t you picked my pocket She jested with him and told him she supposed he had not much to lose he put his hand to his fob and with his fingers felt that his purse was there which fully satisfied him and so she brought off his money And this was a trade with her she kept a sham gold watch that is a watch of silver gilt and a purse of counters in her pocket to be ready on all such occasions and I doubt not practiced it with success I came home with this last booty to my governess and really when I told her the story it so affected her that she was hardly able to forbear tears to know how such a gentleman ran a daily risk of being undone every time a glass of wine got into his head But as to the purchase I got and how entirely I stripped him she told me it pleased her wonderfully Nay child says she the usage may for aught I know do more to reform him than all the sermons that ever he will hear in his life And if the remainder of the story be true so it did I found the next day she was wonderful inquisitive about this gentleman the description I had given her of him his dress his person his face everything concurred to make her think of a gentleman whose character she knew and family too She mused a while and I going still on with the particulars she starts up says she I ll lay one hundred I know the gentleman I am sorry you do says I for I would not have him exposed on any account in the world he has had injury enough already by me and I would not be instrumental to do him any more No no says she I will do him no injury I assure you but you may let me satisfy my curiosity a little for if it is he I warrant you I find it out I was a little startled at that and told her with an apparent concern in my face that by the same rule he might find me out and then I was undone She returned warmly Why do you think I will betray you child No no says she not for all he is worth in the world I have kept your counsel in worse things than these sure you may trust me in this So I said no more at that time She laid her scheme another way and without acquainting me of it but she was resolved to find it out if possible So she goes to a certain friend of hers who was acquainted in the family that she guessed at and told her friend she had some extraordinary business with such a gentleman who by the way was no less than a baronet and of a very good family and that she knew not how to come at him without somebody to introduce her Her friend promised her very readily to do it and accordingly goes to the house to see if the gentleman was in town The next day she come to my governess and tells her that Sir was at home but that he had met with a disaster and was very ill and there was no speaking with him What disaster says my governess hastily as if she was surprised at it Why says her friend he had been at Hampstead to visit a gentleman of his acquaintance and as he came back again he was set upon and robbed and having got a little drink too as they suppose the rogues abused him and he is very ill Robbed says my governess and what did they take from him Why says her friend they took his gold watch and his gold snuff box his fine periwig and what money he had in his pocket which was considerable to be sure for Sir never goes without a purse of guineas about him Pshaw says my old governess jeering I warrant you he has got drunk now and got a whore and she has picked his pocket and so he comes home to his wife and tells her he has been robbed That s an old sham a thousand such tricks are put upon the poor women every day Fie says her friend I find you don t know Sir why he is as civil a gentleman there is not a finer man nor a soberer graver modester person in the whole city he abhors such things there s nobody that knows him will think such a thing of him Well well says my governess that s none of my business if it was I warrant I should find there was something of that kind in it your modest men in common opinion are sometimes no better than other people only they keep a better character or if you please are the better hypocrites No no says her friend I can assure you Sir is no hypocrite he is really an honest sober gentleman and he has certainly been robbed Nay says my governess it may be he has it is no business of mine I tell you I only want to speak with him my business is of another nature But says her friend let your business be of what nature it will you cannot see him yet for he is not fit to be seen for he is very ill and bruised very much Ay says my governess nay then he has fallen into bad hands to be sure And then she asked gravely Pray where is he bruised Why in the head says her friend and one of his hands and his face for they used him barbarously Poor gentleman says my governess I must wait then till he recovers and adds I hope it will not be long for I want very much to speak with him Away she comes to me and tells me this story I have found out your fine gentleman and a fine gentleman he was says she but mercy on him he is in a sad pickle now I wonder what the d l you have done to him why you have almost killed him I looked at her with disorder enough I killed him says I you must mistake the person I am sure I did nothing to him he was very well when I left him said I only drunk and fast asleep I know nothing of that says she but he is in a sad pickle now and so she told me all that her friend had said to her Well then says I he fell into bad hands after I left him for I am sure I left him safe enough About ten days after or a little more my governess goes again to her friend to introduce her to this gentleman she had inquired other ways in the meantime and found that he was about again if not abroad again so she got leave to speak with him She was a woman of a admirable address and wanted nobody to introduce her she told her tale much better than I shall be able to tell it for her for she was a mistress of her tongue as I have said already She told him that she came though a stranger with a single design of doing him a service and he should find she had no other end in it that as she came purely on so friendly an account she begged promise from him that if he did not accept what she should officiously propose he would not take it ill that she meddled with what was not her business She assured him that as what she had to say was a secret that belonged to him only so whether he accepted her offer or not it should remain a secret to all the world unless he exposed it himself nor should his refusing her service in it make her so little show her respect as to do him the least injury so that he should be entirely at liberty to act as he thought fit He looked very shy at first and said he knew nothing that related to him that required much secrecy that he had never done any man any wrong and cared not what anybody might say of him that it was no part of his character to be unjust to anybody nor could he imagine in what any man could render him any service but that if it was so disinterested a service as she said he could not take it ill from any one that they should endeavour to serve him and so as it were left her a liberty either to tell him or not to tell as she thought fit She found him so perfectly indifferent that she was almost afraid to enter into the point with him but however after some other circumlocutions she told him that by a strange and unaccountable accident she came to have a particular knowledge of the late unhappy adventure he had fallen into and that in such a manner that there was nobody in the world but herself and him that were acquainted with it no not the very person that was with him He looked a little angrily at first What adventure said he Why said she of your being robbed coming from Knightbr Hampstead sir I should say says she Be not surprised sir says she that I am able to tell you every step you took that day from the cloister in Smithfield to the Spring Garden at Knightsbridge and thence to the in the Strand and how you were left asleep in the coach afterwards I say let not this surprise you for sir I do not come to make a booty of you I ask nothing of you and I assure you the woman that was with you knows nothing who you are and never shall and yet perhaps I may serve you further still for I did not come barely to let you know that I was informed of these things as if I wanted a bribe to conceal them assure yourself sir said she that whatever you think fit to do or say to me it shall be all a secret as it is as much as if I were in my grave He was astonished at her discourse and said gravely to her Madam you are a stranger to me but it is very unfortunate that you should be let into the secret of the worst action of my life and a thing that I am so justly ashamed of that the only satisfaction of it to me was that I thought it was known only to God and my own conscience Pray sir says she do not reckon the discovery of it to me to be any part of your misfortune It was a thing I believe you were surprised into and perhaps the woman used some art to prompt you to it however you will never find any just cause said she to repent that I came to hear of it nor can your own mouth be more silent in it that I have been and ever shall be Well says he but let me do some justice to the woman too whoever she is I do assure you she prompted me to nothing she rather declined me It was my own folly and madness that brought me into it all ay and brought her into it too I must give her her due so far As to what she took from me I could expect no less from her in the condition I was in and to this hour I know not whether she robbed me or the coachman if she did it I forgive her and I think all gentlemen that do so should be used in the same manner but I am more concerned for some other things that I am for all that she took from me My governess now began to come into the whole matter and he opened himself freely to her First she said to him in answer to what he had said about me I am glad sir you are so just to the person that you were with I assure you she is a gentlewoman and no woman of the town and however you prevailed with her so far as you did I am sure tis not her practice You ran a great venture indeed sir but if that be any part of your care I am persuaded you may be perfectly easy for I dare assure you no man has touched her before you since her husband and he has been dead now almost eight years It appeared that this was his grievance and that he was in a very great fright about it however when my governess said this to him he appeared very well pleased and said Well madam to be plain with you if I was satisfied of that I should not so much value what I lost for as to that the temptation was great and perhaps she was poor and wanted it If she had not been poor sir says my governess I assure you she would never have yielded to you and as her poverty first prevailed with her to let you do as you did so the same poverty prevailed with her to pay herself at last when she saw you were in such a condition that if she had not done it perhaps the next coachman might have done it Well says he much good may it do her I say again all the gentlemen that do so ought to be used in the same manner and then they would be cautious of themselves I have no more concern about it but on the score which you hinted at before madam Here he entered into some freedoms with her on the subject of what passed between us which are not so proper for a woman to write and the great terror that was upon his mind with relation to his wife for fear he should have received any injury from me and should communicate if farther and asked her at last if she could not procure him an opportunity to speak with me My governess gave him further assurances of my being a woman clear from any such thing and that he was as entirely safe in that respect as he was with his own lady but as for seeing me she said it might be of dangerous consequence but however that she would talk with me and let him know my answer using at the same time some arguments to persuade him not to desire it and that it could be of no service to him seeing she hoped he had no desire to renew a correspondence with me and that on my account it was a kind of putting my life in his hands He told her he had a great desire to see me that he would give her any assurances that were in his power not to take any advantages of me and that in the first place he would give me a general release from all demands of any kind She insisted how it might tend to a further divulging the secret and might in the end be injurious to him entreating him not to press for it so at length he desisted They had some discourse upon the subject of the things he had lost and he seemed to be very desirous of his gold watch and told her if she could procure that for him he would willingly give as much for it as it was worth She told him she would endeavour to procure it for him and leave the valuing it to himself Accordingly the next day she carried the watch and he gave her thirty guineas for it which was more than I should have been able to make of it though it seems it cost much more He spoke something of his periwig which it seems cost him threescore guineas and his snuff box and in a few days more she carried them too which obliged him very much and he gave her thirty more The next day I sent him his fine sword and cane gratis and demanded nothing of him but I had no mind to see him unless it had been so that he might be satisfied I knew who he was which he was not willing to Then he entered into a long talk with her of the manner how she came to know all this matter She formed a long tale of that part how she had it from one that I had told the whole story to and that was to help me dispose of the goods and this confidante brought the things to her she being by profession a pawnbroker and she hearing of his worship s disaster guessed at the thing in general that having gotten the things into her hands she had resolved to come and try as she had done She then gave him repeated assurances that it should never go out of her mouth and though she knew the woman very well yet she had not let her know meaning me anything of it that is to say who the person was which by the way was false but however it was not to his damage for I never opened my mouth of it to anybody I had a great many thoughts in my head about my seeing him again and was often sorry that I had refused it I was persuaded that if I had seen him and let him know that I knew him I should have made some advantage of him and perhaps have had some maintenance from him and though it was a life wicked enough yet it was not so full of danger as this I was engaged in However those thoughts wore off and I declined seeing him again for that time but my governess saw him often and he was very kind to her giving her something almost every time he saw her One time in particular she found him very merry and as she thought he had some wine in his head and he pressed her again very earnestly to let him see that woman that as he said had bewitched him so that night my governess who was from the beginning for my seeing him told him he was so desirous of it that she could almost yield of it if she could prevail upon me adding that if he would please to come to her house in the evening she would endeavour it upon his repeated assurances of forgetting what was past Accordingly she came to me and told me all the discourse in short she soon biassed me to consent in a case which I had some regret in my mind for declining before so I prepared to see him I dressed me to all the advantage possible I assure you and for the first time used a little art I say for the first time for I had never yielded to the baseness of paint before having always had vanity enough to believe I had no need of it At the hour appointed he came and as she observed before so it was plain still that he had been drinking though very far from what we call being in drink He appeared exceeding pleased to see me and entered into a long discourse with me upon the old affair I begged his pardon very often for my share of it protested I had not any such design when first I met him that I had not gone out with him but that I took him for a very civil gentleman and that he made me so many promises of offering no uncivility to me He alleged the wine he drank and that he scarce knew what he did and that if it had not been so I should never have let him take the freedom with me that he had done He protested to me that he never touched any woman but me since he was married to his wife and it was a surprise upon him complimented me upon being so particularly agreeable to him and the like and talked so much of that kind till I found he had talked himself almost into a temper to do the same thing over again But I took him up short I protested I had never suffered any man to touch me since my husband died which was near eight years He said he believed it to be so truly and added that madam had intimated as much to him and that it was his opinion of that part which made his desire to see me again and that since he had once broke in upon his virtue with me and found no ill consequences he could be safe in venturing there again and so in short it went on to what I expected and to what will not bear relating My old governess had foreseen it as well as I and therefore led him into a room which had not a bed in it and yet had a chamber within it which had a bed whither we withdrew for the rest of the night and in short after some time being together he went to bed and lay there all night I withdrew but came again undressed in the morning before it was day and lay with him the rest of the time Thus you see having committed a crime once is a sad handle to the committing of it again whereas all the regret and reflections wear off when the temptation renews itself Had I not yielded to see him again the corrupt desire in him had worn off and tis very probable he had never fallen into it with anybody else as I really believe he had not done before When he went away I told him I hoped he was satisfied he had not been robbed again He told me he was satisfied in that point and could trust me again and putting his hand in his pocket gave me five guineas which was the first money I had gained that way for many years I had several visits of the like kind from him but he never came into a settled way of maintenance which was what I would have best pleased with Once indeed he asked me how I did to live I answered him pretty quick that I assured him I had never taken that course that I took with him but that indeed I worked at my needle and could just maintain myself that sometime it was as much as I was able to do and I shifted hard enough He seemed to reflect upon himself that he should be the first person to lead me into that which he assured me he never intended to do himself and it touched him a little he said that he should be the cause of his own sin and mine too He would often make just reflections also upon the crime itself and upon the particular circumstances of it with respect to himself how wine introduced the inclinations how the devil led him to the place and found out an object to tempt him and he made the moral always himself When these thoughts were upon him he would go away and perhaps not come again in a month s time or longer but then as the serious part wore off the lewd part would wear in and then he came prepared for the wicked part Thus we lived for some time thought he did not keep as they call it yet he never failed doing things that were handsome and sufficient to maintain me without working and which was better without following my old trade But this affair had its end too for after about a year I found that he did not come so often as usual and at last he left if off altogether without any dislike to bidding adieu and so there was an end of that short scene of life which added no great store to me only to make more work for repentance However during this interval I confined myself pretty much at home at least being thus provided for I made no adventures no not for a quarter of a year after he left me but then finding the fund fail and being loth to spend upon the main stock I began to think of my old trade and to look abroad into the street again and my first step was lucky enough I had dressed myself up in a very mean habit for as I had several shapes to appear in I was now in an ordinary stuff gown a blue apron and a straw hat and I placed myself at the door of the Three Cups Inn in saint John Street There were several carriers used the inn and the stage coaches for Barnet for Totteridge and other towns that way stood always in the street in the evening when they prepared to set out so that I was ready for anything that offered for either one or other The meaning was this people come frequently with bundles and small parcels to those inns and call for such carriers or coaches as they want to carry them into the country and there generally attend women porters wives or daughters ready to take in such things for their respective people that employ them It happened very oddly that I was standing at the inn gate and a woman that had stood there before and which was the porter s wife belonging to the Barnet stage coach having observed me asked if I waited for any of the coaches I told her Yes I waited for my mistress that was coming to go to Barnet She asked me who was my mistress and I told her any madam s name that came next me but as it seemed I happened upon a name a family of which name lived at Hadley just beyond Barnet I said no more to her or she to me a good while but by and by somebody calling her at a door a little way off she desired me that if anybody called for the Barnet coach I would step and call her at the house which it seems was an alehouse I said Yes very readily and away she went She was no sooner gone but comes a wench and a child puffing and sweating and asks for the Barnet coach I answered presently Here Do you belong to the Barnet coach says she Yes sweetheart said I what do ye want I want room for two passengers says she Where are they sweetheart said I Here s this girl pray let her go into the coach says she and I ll go and fetch my mistress Make haste then sweetheart says I for we may be full else The maid had a great bundle under her arm so she put the child into the coach and I said You had best put your bundle into the coach too No says she I am afraid somebody should slip it away from the child Give to me then said I and I ll take care of it Do then says she and be sure you take of it I ll answer for it said I if it were for twenty value There take it then says she and away she goes As soon as I had got the bundle and the maid was out of sight I goes on towards the alehouse where the porter s wife was so that if I had met her I had then only been going to give her the bundle and to call her to her business as if I was going away and could stay no longer but as I did not meet her I walked away and turning into Charterhouse Lane then crossed into Batholomew Close so into Little Britain and through the Bluecoat Hospital into Newgate Street To prevent my being known I pulled off my blue apron and wrapped the bundle in it which before was made up in a piece of painted calico and very remarkable I also wrapped up my straw hat in it and so put the bundle upon my head and it was very well that I did thus for coming through the Bluecoat Hospital who should I meet but the wench that had given me the bundle to hold It seems she was going with her mistress whom she had been gone to fetch to the Barnet coaches I saw she was in haste and I had no business to stop her so away she went and I brought my bundle safe home to my governess There was no money nor plate or jewels in the bundle but a very good suit of Indian damask a gown and a petticoat a laced head and ruffles of very good Flanders lace and some linen and other things such as I knew very well the value of This was not indeed my own invention but was given me by one that had practised it with success and my governess liked it extremely and indeed I tried it again several times though never twice near the same place for the next time I tried it in White Chapel just by the corner of Petticoat Lane where the coaches stand that go out to Stratford and Bow and that side of the country and another time at the Flying Horse without Bishopgate where the Cheston coaches then lay and I had always the good luck to come off with some booty Another time I placed myself at a warehouse by the waterside where the coasting vessels from the north come such as from Newcastle upon Tyne Sunderland and other places Here the warehouses being shut comes a young fellow with a letter and he wanted a box and a hamper that was come from Newcastle upon Tyne I asked him if he had the marks of it so he shows me the letter by virtue of which he was to ask for it and which gave an account of the contents the box being full of linen and the hamper full of glass ware I read the letter and took care to see the name and the marks the name of the person that sent the goods the name of the person that they were sent to then I bade the messenger come in the morning for that the warehouse keeper would not be there any more that night Away went I and getting materials in a public house I wrote a letter from mister John Richardson of Newcastle to his dear cousin Jemmy Cole in London with an account that he sent by such a vessel for I remembered all the particulars to a title so many pieces of huckaback linen so many ells of Dutch holland and the like in a box and a hamper of flint glasses from mister Henzill s glasshouse and that the box was marked I C No one and the hamper was directed by a label on the cording About an hour after I came to the warehouse found the warehouse keeper and had the goods delivered me without any scruple the value of the linen being about twenty two I could fill up this whole discourse with the variety of such adventures which daily invention directed to and which I managed with the utmost dexterity and always with success At length as when does the pitcher come safe home that goes so very often to the well I fell into some small broils which though they could not affect me fatally yet made me known which was the worst thing next to being found guilty that could befall me I had taken up the disguise of a widow s dress it was without any real design in view but only waiting for anything that might offer as I often did It happened that while I was going along the street in Covent Garden there was a great cry of Stop thief Stop thief some artists had it seems put a trick upon a shopkeeper and being pursued some of them fled one way and some another and one of them was they said dressed up in widow s weeds upon which the mob gathered about me and some said I was the person others said no Immediately came the mercer s journeyman and he swore aloud I was the person and so seized on me However when I was brought back by the mob to the mercer s shop the master of the house said freely that I was not the woman that was in his shop and would have let me go immediately but another fellow said gravely Pray stay till mister meaning the journeyman comes back for he knows her So they kept me by force near half an hour They had called a constable and he stood in the shop as my jailer and in talking with the constable I inquired where he lived and what trade he was the man not apprehending in the least what happened afterwards readily told me his name and trade and where he lived and told me as a jest that I might be sure to hear of his name when I came to the Old Bailey Some of the servants likewise used me saucily and had much ado to keep their hands off me the master indeed was civiller to me than they but he would not yet let me go though he owned he could not say I was in his shop before I began to be a little surly with him and told him I hoped he would not take it ill if I made myself amends upon him in a more legal way another time and desired I might send for friends to see me have right done me No he said he could give no such liberty I might ask it when I came before the justice of peace and seeing I threatened him he would take care of me in the meantime and would lodge me safe in Newgate I told him it was his time now but it would be mine by and by and governed my passion as well as I was able However I spoke to the constable to call me a porter which he did and then I called for pen ink and paper but they would let me have none I asked the porter his name and where he lived and the poor man told it me very willingly I bade him observe and remember how I was treated there that he saw I was detained there by force I told him I should want his evidence in another place and it should not be the worse for him to speak The porter said he would serve me with all his heart But madam says he let me hear them refuse to let you go then I may be able to speak the plainer With that I spoke aloud to the master of the shop and said Sir you know in your own conscience that I am not the person you look for and that I was not in your shop before therefore I demand that you detain me here no longer or tell me the reason of your stopping me The fellow grew surlier upon this than before and said he would do neither till he thought fit Very well said I to the constable and to the porter you will be pleased to remember this gentlemen another time The porter said Yes madam and the constable began not to like it and would have persuaded the mercer to dismiss him and let me go since as he said he owned I was not the person Good sir says the mercer to him tauntingly are you a justice of peace or a constable I charged you with her pray do you do your duty The constable told him a little moved but very handsomely I know my duty and what I am sir I doubt you hardly know what you are doing They had some other hard words and in the meantime the journeyman impudent and unmanly to the last degree used me barbarously and one of them the same that first seized upon me pretended he would search me and began to lay hands on me I spit in his face called out to the constable and bade him to take notice of my usage And pray mister Constable said I ask that villain s name pointing to the man The constable reproved him decently told him that he did not know what he did for he knew that his master acknowledged I was not the person that was in his shop and says the constable I am afraid your master is bringing himself and me too into trouble if this gentlewoman comes to prove who she is and where she was and it appears that she is not the woman you pretend to Damn her says the fellow again with a impudent hardened face she is the lady you may depend upon it I ll swear she is the same body that was in the shop and that I gave the pieces of satin that is lost into her own hand You shall hear more of it when mister William and mister Anthony those were other journeymen come back they will know her again as well as I Just as the insolent rogue was talking thus to the constable comes back mister William and mister Anthony as he called them and a great rabble with them bringing along with them the true widow that I was pretended to be and they came sweating and blowing into the shop and with a great deal of triumph dragging the poor creature in the most butcherly manner up towards their master who was in the back shop and cried out aloud Here s the widow sir we have catched her at last What do ye mean by that says the master Why we have her already there she sits says he and mister says he can swear this is she The other man whom they called mister Anthony replied mister may say what he will and swear what he will but this is the woman and there s the remnant of satin she stole I took it out of her clothes with my own hand I sat still now and began to take a better heart but smiled and said nothing the master looked pale the constable turned about and looked at me Let em alone mister Constable said I let em go on The case was plain and could not be denied so the constable was charged with the right thief and the mercer told me very civilly he was sorry for the mistake and hoped I would not take it ill that they had so many things of this nature put upon them every day that they could not be blamed for being very sharp in doing themselves justice Not take it ill sir said I how can I take it well If you had dismissed me when your insolent fellow seized on me it the street and brought me to you and when you yourself acknowledged I was not the person I would have put it by and not taken it ill because of the many ill things I believe you have put upon you daily but your treatment of me since has been insufferable and especially that of your servant I must and will have reparation for that Then he began to parley with me said he would make me any reasonable satisfaction and would fain have had me tell him what it was I expected I told him that I should not be my own judge the law should decide it for me and as I was to be carried before a magistrate I should let him hear there what I had to say He told me there was no occasion to go before the justice now I was at liberty to go where I pleased and so calling to the constable told him he might let me go for I was discharged The constable said calmly to him sir you asked me just now if I knew whether I was a constable or justice and bade me do my duty and charged me with this gentlewoman as a prisoner Now sir I find you do not understand what is my duty for you would make me a justice indeed but I must tell you it is not in my power I may keep a prisoner when I am charged with him but tis the law and the magistrate alone that can discharge that prisoner therefore tis a mistake sir I must carry her before a justice now whether you think well of it or not The mercer was very high with the constable at first but the constable happening to be not a hired officer but a good substantial kind of man I think he was a corn handler and a man of good sense stood to his business would not discharge me without going to a justice of the peace and I insisted upon it too When the mercer saw that Well says he to the constable you may carry her where you please I have nothing to say to her But sir says the constable you will go with us I hope for tis you that charged me with her No not I says the mercer I tell you I have nothing to say to her But pray sir do says the constable I desire it of you for your own sake for the justice can do nothing without you Prithee fellow says the mercer go about your business I tell you I have nothing to say to the gentlewoman I charge you in the king s name to dismiss her Sir says the constable I find you don t know what it is to be constable I beg of you don t oblige me to be rude to you I think I need not you are rude enough already says the mercer No sir says the constable I am not rude you have broken the peace in bringing an honest woman out of the street when she was about her lawful occasion confining her in your shop and ill using her here by your servants and now can you say I am rude to you I think I am civil to you in not commanding or charging you in the king s name to go with me and charging every man I see that passes your door to aid and assist me in carrying you by force this you cannot but know I have power to do and yet I forbear it and once more entreat you to go with me Well he would not for all this and gave the constable ill language However the constable kept his temper and would not be provoked and then I put in and said Come mister Constable let him alone I shall find ways enough to fetch him before a magistrate I don t fear that but there s the fellow says I he was the man that seized on me as I was innocently going along the street and you are a witness of the violence with me since give me leave to charge you with him and carry him before the justice Yes madam says the constable and turning to the fellow Come young gentleman says he to the journeyman you must go along with us I hope you are not above the constable s power though your master is The fellow looked like a condemned thief and hung back then looked at his master as if he could help him and he like a fool encourage the fellow to be rude and he truly resisted the constable and pushed him back with a good force when he went to lay hold on him at which the constable knocked him down and called out for help and immediately the shop was filled with people and the constable seized the master and man and all his servants This first ill consequence of this fray was that the woman they had taken who was really the thief made off and got clear away in the crowd and two other that they had stopped also whether they were really guilty or not that I can say nothing to By this time some of his neighbours having come in and upon inquiry seeing how things went had endeavoured to bring the hot brained mercer to his senses and he began to be convinced that he was in the wrong and so at length we went all very quietly before the justice with a mob of about five hundred people at our heels and all the way I went I could hear the people ask what was the matter and other reply and say a mercer had stopped a gentlewoman instead of a thief and had afterwards taken the thief and now the gentlewoman had taken the mercer and was carrying him before the justice This pleased the people strangely and made the crowd increase and they cried out as they went Which is the rogue which is the mercer and especially the women Then when they saw him they cried out That s he that s he and every now and then came a good dab of dirt at him and thus we marched a good while till the mercer thought fit to desire the constable to call a coach to protect himself from the rabble so we rode the rest of the way the constable and I and the mercer and his man When we came to the justice which was an ancient gentleman in Bloomsbury the constable giving first a summary account of the matter the justice bade me speak and tell what I had to say And first he asked my name which I was very loth to give but there was no remedy so I told him my name was Mary Flanders that I was a widow my husband being a sea captain died on a voyage to Virginia and some other circumstances I told which he could never contradict and that I lodged at present in town with such a person naming my governess but that I was preparing to go over to America where my husband s effects lay and that I was going that day to buy some clothes to put myself into second mourning but had not yet been in any shop when that fellow pointing to the mercer s journeyman came rushing upon me with such fury as very much frighted me and carried me back to his master s shop where though his master acknowledged I was not the person yet he would not dismiss me but charged a constable with me Then I proceeded to tell how the journeyman treated me how they would not suffer me to send for any of my friends how afterwards they found the real thief and took the very goods they had lost upon her and all the particulars as before Then the constable related his case his dialogue with the mercer about discharging me and at last his servant s refusing to go with him when he had charged him with him and his master encouraging him to do so and at last his striking the constable and the like all as I have told it already The justice then heard the mercer and his man The mercer indeed made a long harangue of the great loss they have daily by lifters and thieves that it was easy for them to mistake and that when he found it he would have dismissed me et cetera as above As to the journeyman he had very little to say but that he pretended other of the servants told him that I was really the person Upon the whole the justice first of all told me very courteously I was discharged that he was very sorry that the mercer s man should in his eager pursuit have so little discretion as to take up an innocent person for a guilty person that if he had not been so unjust as to detain me afterward he believed I would have forgiven the first affront that however it was not in his power to award me any reparation for anything other than by openly reproving them which he should do but he supposed I would apply to such methods as the law directed in the meantime he would bind him over But as to the breach of the peace committed by the journeyman he told me he should give me some satisfaction for that for he should commit him to Newgate for assaulting the constable and for assaulting me also Accordingly he sent the fellow to Newgate for that assault and his master gave bail and so we came away but I had the satisfaction of seeing the mob wait upon them both as they came out hallooing and throwing stones and dirt at the coaches they rode in and so I came home to my governess After this hustle coming home and telling my governess the story she falls a laughing at me Why are you merry says I the story has not so much laughing room in it as you imagine I am sure I have had a great deal of hurry and fright too with a pack of ugly rogues Laugh says my governess I laugh child to see what a lucky creature you are why this job will be the best bargain to you that ever you made in your life if you manage it well I warrant you says she you shall make the mercer pay you five hundred for damages besides what you shall get out of the journeyman I had other thoughts of the matter than she had and especially because I had given in my name to the justice of peace and I knew that my name was so well known among the people at Hick s Hall the Old Bailey and such places that if this cause came to be tried openly and my name came to be inquired into no court would give much damages for the reputation of a person of such a character However I was obliged to begin a prosecution in form and accordingly my governess found me out a very creditable sort of a man to manage it being an attorney of very good business and of a good reputation and she was certainly in the right of this for had she employed a pettifogging hedge solicitor or a man not known and not in good reputation I should have brought it to but little I met this attorney and gave him all the particulars at large as they are recited above and he assured me it was a case as he said that would very well support itself and that he did not question but that a jury would give very considerable damages on such an occasion so taking his full instructions he began the prosecution and the mercer being arrested gave bail A few days after his giving bail he comes with his attorney to my attorney to let him know that he desired to accommodate the matter that it was all carried on in the heat of an unhappy passion that his client meaning me had a sharp provoking tongue that I used them ill gibing at them and jeering them even while they believed me to be the very person and that I had provoked them and the like My attorney managed as well on my side made them believe I was a widow of fortune that I was able to do myself justice and had great friends to stand by me too who had all made me promise to sue to the utmost and that if it cost me a thousand pounds I would be sure to have satisfaction for that the affronts I had received were insufferable However they brought my attorney to this that he promised he would not blow the coals that if I inclined to accommodation he would not hinder me and that he would rather persuade me to peace than to war for which they told him he should be no loser all which he told me very honestly and told me that if they offered him any bribe I should certainly know it but upon the whole he told me very honestly that if I would take his opinion he would advise me to make it up with them for that as they were in a great fright and were desirous above all things to make it up and knew that let it be what it would they would be allotted to bear all the costs of the suit he believed they would give me freely more than any jury or court of justice would give upon a trial I asked him what he thought they would be brought to He told me he could not tell as to that but he would tell me more when I saw him again Some time after this they came again to know if he had talked with me He told them he had that he found me not so averse to an accommodation as some of my friends were who resented the disgrace offered me and set me on that they blowed the coals in secret prompting me to revenge or do myself justice as they called it so that he could not tell what to say to it he told them he would do his endeavour to persuade me but he ought to be able to tell me what proposal they made They pretended they could not make any proposal because it might be made use of against them and he told them that by the same rule he could not make any offers for that might be pleaded in abatement of what damages a jury might be inclined to give However after some discourse and mutual promises that no advantage should be taken on either side by what was transacted then or at any other of those meetings they came to a kind of a treaty but so remote and so wide from one another that nothing could be expected from it for my attorney demanded five hundred and charges and they offered fifty without charges so they broke off and the mercer proposed to have a meeting with me myself and my attorney agreed to that very readily My attorney gave me notice to come to this meeting in good clothes and with some state that the mercer might see I was something more than I seemed to be that time they had me Accordingly I came in a new suit of second mourning according to what I had said at the justice s I set myself out too as well as a widow s dress in second mourning would admit my governess also furnished me with a good pearl necklace that shut in behind with a locket of diamonds which she had in pawn and I had a very good figure and as I stayed till I was sure they were come I came in a coach to the door with my maid with me When I came into the room the mercer was surprised He stood up and made his bow which I took a little notice of and but a little and went and sat down where my own attorney had pointed to me to sit for it was his house After a little while the mercer said he did not know me again and began to make some compliments his way I told him I believed he did not know me at first and that if he had I believed he would not have treated me as he did He told me he was very sorry for what had happened and that it was to testify the willingness he had to make all possible reparation that he had appointed this meeting that he hoped I would not carry things to extremity which might be not only too great a loss to him but might be the ruin of his business and shop in which case I might have the satisfaction of repaying an injury with an injury ten times greater but that I would then get nothing whereas he was willing to do me any justice that was in his power without putting himself or me to the trouble or charge of a suit at law I told him I was glad to hear him talk so much more like a man of sense than he did before that it was true acknowledgment in most cases of affronts was counted reparation sufficient but this had gone too far to be made up so that I was not revengeful nor did I seek his ruin or any man s else but that all my friends were unanimous not to let me so far neglect my character as to adjust a thing of this kind without a sufficient reparation of honour that to be taken up for a thief was such an indignity as could not be put up that my character was above being treated so by any that knew me but because in my condition of a widow I had been for some time careless of myself and negligent of myself I might be taken for such a creature but that for the particular usage I had from him afterwards and then I repeated all as before it was so provoking I had scarce patience to repeat it Well he acknowledged all and was might humble indeed he made proposals very handsome he came up to one hundred and to pay all the law charges and added that he would make me a present of a very good suit of clothes I came down to three hundred and I demanded that I should publish an advertisement of the particulars in the common newspapers This was a clause he never could comply with However at last he came up by good management of my attorney to one hundred fifty and a suit of black silk clothes and there I agree and as it were at my attorney s request complied with it he paying my attorney s bill and charges and gave us a good supper into the bargain When I came to receive the money I brought my governess with me dressed like an old duchess and a gentleman very well dressed who we pretended courted me but I called him cousin and the lawyer was only to hint privately to him that his gentleman courted the widow He treated us handsomely indeed and paid the money cheerfully enough so that it cost him two hundred in all or rather more At our last meeting when all was agreed the case of the journeyman came up and the mercer begged very hard for him told me he was a man that had kept a shop of his own and been in good business had a wife and several children and was very poor that he had nothing to make satisfaction with but he should come to beg my pardon on his knees if I desired it as openly as I pleased I had no spleen at the saucy rogue nor were his submissions anything to me since there was nothing to be got by him so I thought it was as good to throw that in generously as not so I told him I did not desire the ruin of any man and therefore at his request I would forgive the wretch it was below me to seek any revenge When we were at supper he brought the poor fellow in to make acknowledgment which he would have done with as much mean humility as his offence was with insulting haughtiness and pride in which he was an instance of a complete baseness of spirit impious cruel and relentless when uppermost and in prosperity abject and low spirited when down in affliction However I abated his cringes told him I forgave him and desired he might withdraw as if I did not care for the sight of him though I had forgiven him I was now in good circumstances indeed if I could have known my time for leaving off and my governess often said I was the richest of the trade in England and so I believe I was for I had seven hundred by me in money besides clothes rings some plate and two gold watches and all of them stolen for I had innumerable jobs besides these I have mentioned Oh had I even now had the grace of repentance I had still leisure to have looked back upon my follies and have made some reparation but the satisfaction I was to make for the public mischiefs I had done was yet left behind and I could not forbear going abroad again as I called it now than any more I could when my extremity really drove me out for bread It was not long after the affair with the mercer was made up that I went out in an equipage quite different from any I had ever appeared in before I dressed myself like a beggar woman in the coarsest and most despicable rags I could get and I walked about peering and peeping into every door and window I came near and indeed I was in such a plight now that I knew as ill how to behave in as ever I did in any I naturally abhorred dirt and rags I had been bred up tight and cleanly and could be no other whatever condition I was in so that this was the most uneasy disguise to me that ever I put on I said presently to myself that this would not do for this was a dress that everybody was shy and afraid of and I thought everybody looked at me as if they were afraid I should come near them lest I should take something from them or afraid to come near me lest they should get something from me I wandered about all the evening the first time I went out and made nothing of it but came home again wet draggled and tired However I went out again the next night and then I met with a little adventure which had like to have cost me dear As I was standing near a tavern door there comes a gentleman on horseback and lights at the door and wanting to go into the tavern he calls one of the drawers to hold his horse He stayed pretty long in the tavern and the drawer heard his master call and thought he would be angry with him Seeing me stand by him he called to me Here woman says he hold this horse a while till I go in if the gentleman comes he ll give you something Yes says I and takes the horse and walks off with him very soberly and carried him to my governess This had been a booty to those that had understood it but never was poor thief more at a loss to know what to do with anything that was stolen for when I came home my governess was quite confounded and what to do with the creature we neither of us knew To send him to a stable was doing nothing for it was certain that public notice would be given in the Gazette and the horse described so that we durst not go to fetch it again All the remedy we had for this unlucky adventure was to go and set up the horse at an inn and send a note by a porter to the tavern that the gentleman s horse that was lost such a time was left at such an inn and that he might be had there that the poor woman that held him having led him about the street not being able to lead him back again had left him there We might have waited till the owner had published and offered a reward but we did not care to venture the receiving the reward So this was a robbery and no robbery for little was lost by it and nothing was got by it and I was quite sick of going out in a beggar s dress it did not answer at all and besides I thought it was ominous and threatening While I was in this disguise I fell in with a parcel of folks of a worse kind than any I ever sorted with and I saw a little into their ways too These were coiners of money and they made some very good offers to me as to profit but the part they would have had me have embarked in was the most dangerous part I mean that of the very working the die as they call it which had I been taken had been certain death and that at a stake I say to be burnt to death at a stake so that though I was to appearance but a beggar and they promised mountains of gold and silver to me to engage yet it would not do It is true if I had been really a beggar or had been desperate as when I began I might perhaps have closed with it for what care they to die that can t tell how to live But at present this was not my condition at least I was for no such terrible risks as those besides the very thoughts of being burnt at a stake struck terror into my very soul chilled my blood and gave me the vapours to such a degree as I could not think of it without trembling This put an end to my disguise too for as I did not like the proposal so I did not tell them so but seemed to relish it and promised to meet again But I durst see them no more for if I had seen them and not complied though I had declined it with the greatest assurance of secrecy in the world they would have gone near to have murdered me to make sure work and make themselves easy as they call it What kind of easiness that is they may best judge that understand how easy men are that can murder people to prevent danger This and horse stealing were things quite out of my way and I might easily resolve I would have to more to say to them my business seemed to lie another way and though it had hazard enough in it too yet it was more suitable to me and what had more of art in it and more room to escape and more chances for a coming off if a surprise should happen I had several proposals made also to me about that time to come into a gang of house breakers but that was a thing I had no mind to venture at neither any more than I had at the coining trade I offered to go along with two men and a woman that made it their business to get into houses by stratagem and with them I was willing enough to venture But there were three of them already and they did not care to part nor I to have too many in a gang so I did not close with them but declined them and they paid dear for their next attempt But at length I met with a woman that had often told me what adventures she had made and with success at the waterside and I closed with her and we drove on our business pretty well One day we came among some Dutch people at saint Catherine s where we went on pretence to buy goods that were privately got on shore I was two or three times in a house where we saw a good quantity of prohibited goods and my companion once brought away three pieces of Dutch black silk that turned to good account and I had my share of it but in all the journeys I made by myself I could not get an opportunity to do anything so I laid it aside for I had been so often that they began to suspect something and were so shy that I saw nothing was to be done This baulked me a little and I resolved to push at something or other for I was not used to come back so often without purchase so the next day I dressed myself up fine and took a walk to the other end of the town I passed through the Exchange in the Strand but had no notion of finding anything to do there when on a sudden I saw a great cluttering in the place and all the people shopkeepers as well as others standing up and staring and what should it be but some great duchess come into the Exchange and they said the queen was coming I set myself close up to a shop side with my back to the counter as if to let the crowd pass by when keeping my eye upon a parcel of lace which the shopkeeper was showing to some ladies that stood by me the shopkeeper and her maid were so taken up with looking to see who was coming and what shop they would go to that I found means to slip a paper of lace into my pocket and come clear off with it so the lady milliner paid dear enough for her gaping after the queen I went off from the shop as if driven along by the throng and mingling myself with the crowd went out at the other door of the Exchange and so got away before they missed their lace and because I would not be followed I called a coach and shut myself up in it I had scarce shut the coach doors up but I saw the milliner s maid and five or six more come running out into the street and crying out as if they were frightened They did not cry Stop thief because nobody ran away but I could hear the word robbed and lace two or three times and saw the wench wringing her hands and run staring to and again like one scared The coachman that had taken me up was getting up into the box but was not quite up so that the horse had not begun to move so that I was terrible uneasy and I took the packet of lace and laid it ready to have dropped it out at the flap of the coach which opens before just behind the coachman but to my great satisfaction in less than a minute the coach began to move that is to say as soon as the coachman had got up and spoken to his horses so he drove away without any interruption and I brought off my purchase which was work near twenty The next day I dressed up again but in quite different clothes and walked the same way again but nothing offered till I came into saint James s Park where I saw abundance of fine ladies in the Park walking in the Mall and among the rest there was a little miss a young lady of about twelve or thirteen years old and she had a sister as I suppose it was with her that might be about nine years old I observed the biggest had a fine gold watch on and a good necklace of pearl and they had a footman in livery with them but as it is not usual for the footman to go behind the ladies in the Mall so I observed the footman stopped at their going into the Mall and the biggest of the sisters spoke to him which I perceived was to bid him be just there when they came back When I heard her dismiss the footman I stepped up to him and asked him what little lady that was and held a little chat with him about what a pretty child it was with her and how genteel and well carriaged the lady the eldest would be how womanish and how grave and the fool of a fellow told me presently who she was that she was Sir Thomas s eldest daughter of Essex and that she was a great fortune that her mother was not come to town yet but she was with Sir William s lady of Suffolk at her lodging in Suffolk Street and a great deal more that they had a maid and a woman to wait on them besides Sir Thomas s coach the coachman and himself and that young lady was governess to the whole family as well here as at home too and in short told me abundance of things enough for my business I was very well dressed and had my gold watch as well as she so I left the footman and I puts myself in a rank with this young lady having stayed till she had taken one double turn in the Mall and was going forward again by and by I saluted her by her name with the title of Lady Betty I asked her when she heard from her father when my lady her mother would be in town and how she did I talked so familiarly to her of her whole family that she could not suspect but that I knew them all intimately I asked her why she would come abroad without missus Chime with her that was the name of her woman to take of missus Judith that was her sister Then I entered into a long chat with her about her sister what a fine little lady she was and asked her if she had learned French and a thousand such little things to entertain her when on a sudden we saw the guards come and the crowd ran to see the king go by to the Parliament House The ladies ran all to the side of the Mall and I helped my lady to stand upon the edge of the boards on the side of the Mall that she might be high enough to see and took the little one and lifted her quite up during which I took care to convey the gold watch so clean away from the Lady Betty that she never felt it nor missed it till all the crowd was gone and she was gotten into the middle of the Mall among the other ladies I took my leave of her in the very crowd and said to her as if in haste Dear Lady Betty take care of your little sister And so the crowd did as it were thrust me away from her and that I was obliged unwillingly to take my leave The hurry in such cases is immediately over and the place clear as soon as the king is gone by but as there is always a great running and clutter just as the king passes so having dropped the two little ladies and done my business with them without any miscarriage I kept hurrying on among the crowd as if I ran to see the king and so I got before the crowd and kept so till I came to the end of the Mall when the king going on towards the Horse Guards I went forward to the passage which went then through against the lower end of the Haymarket and there I bestowed a coach upon myself and made off and I confess I have not yet been so good as my word viz to go and visit my Lady Betty I was once of the mind to venture staying with Lady Betty till she missed the watch and so have made a great outcry about it with her and have got her into the coach and put myself in the coach with her and have gone home with her for she appeared so fond of me and so perfectly deceived by my so readily talking to her of all her relations and family that I thought it was very easy to push the thing farther and to have got at least the necklace of pearl but when I considered that though the child would not perhaps have suspected me other people might and that if I was searched I should be discovered I thought it was best to go off with what I had got and be satisfied I came accidentally afterwards to hear that when the young lady missed her watch she made a great outcry in the Park and sent her footman up and down to see if he could find me out she having described me so perfectly that he knew presently that it was the same person that had stood and talked so long with him and asked him so many questions about them but I gone far enough out of their reach before she could come at her footman to tell him the story I made another adventure after this of a nature different from all I had been concerned in yet and this was at a gaming house near Covent Garden I saw several people go in and out and I stood in the passage a good while with another woman with me and seeing a gentleman go up that seemed to be of more than ordinary fashion I said to him Sir pray don t they give women leave to go up Yes madam says he and to play too if they please I mean so sir said I And with that he said he would introduce me if I had a mind so I followed him to the door and he looking in There madam says he are the gamesters if you have a mind to venture I looked in and said to my comrade aloud Here s nothing but men I won t venture among them At which one of the gentlemen cried out You need not be afraid madam here s none but fair gamesters you are very welcome to come and set what you please so I went a little nearer and looked on and some of them brought me a chair and I sat down and saw the box and dice go round apace then I said to my comrade The gentlemen play too high for us come let us go The people were all very civil and one gentleman in particular encouraged me and said Come madam if you please to venture if you dare trust me I ll answer for it you shall have nothing put upon you here No sir said I smiling I hope the gentlemen would not cheat a woman But still I declined venturing though I pulled out a purse with money in it that they might see I did not want money After I had sat a while one gentleman said to me jeering Come madam I see you are afraid to venture for yourself I always had good luck with the ladies you shall set for me if you won t set for yourself I told him sir I should be very loth to lose your money though I added I am pretty lucky too but the gentlemen play so high that I dare not indeed venture my own Well well says he there s ten guineas madam set them for me so I took his money and set himself looking on I ran out nine of the guineas by one and two at a time and then the box coming to the next man to me my gentleman gave me ten guineas more and made me set five of them at once and the gentleman who had the box threw out so there was five guineas of his money again He was encouraged at this and made me take the box which was a bold venture However I held the box so long that I had gained him his whole money and had a good handful of guineas in my lap and which was the better luck when I threw out I threw but at one or two of those that had set me and so went off easy When I was come this length I offered the gentleman all the gold for it was his own and so would have had him play for himself pretending I did not understand the game well enough He laughed and said if I had but good luck it was no matter whether I understood the game or no but I should not leave off However he took out the fifteen guineas that he had put in at first and bade me play with the rest I would have told them to see how much I had got but he said No no don t tell them I believe you are very honest and tis bad luck to tell them so I played on I understood the game well enough though I pretended I did not and played cautiously It was to keep a good stock in my lap out of which I every now and then conveyed some into my pocket but in such a manner and at such convenient times as I was sure he could not see it I played a great while and had very good luck for him but the last time I held the box they set me high and I threw boldly at all I held the box till I gained near fourscore guineas but lost above half of it back in the last throw so I got up for I was afraid I should lose it all back again and said to him Pray come sir now and take it and play for yourself I think I have done pretty well for you He would have had me play on but it grew late and I desired to be excused When I gave it up to him I told him I hoped he would give me leave to tell it now that I might see what I had gained and how lucky I had been for him when I told them there were threescore and three guineas Ay says I if it had not been for that unlucky throw I had got you a hundred guineas So I gave him all the money but he would not take it till I had put my hand into it and taken some for myself and bid me please myself I refused it and was positive I would not take it myself if he had a mind to anything of that kind it should be all his own doings The rest of the gentlemen seeing us striving cried Give it her all but I absolutely refused that Then one of them said D n ye jack halve it with her don t you know you should be always upon even terms with the ladies So in short he divided it with me and I brought away thirty guineas besides about forty three which I had stole privately which I was sorry for afterward because he was so generous Thus I brought home seventy three guineas and let my old governess see what good luck I had at play However it was her advice that I should not venture again and I took her counsel for I never went there any more for I knew as well as she if the itch of play came in I might soon lose that and all the rest of what I had got Fortune had smiled upon me to that degree and I had thriven so much and my governess too for she always had a share with me that really the old gentlewoman began to talk of leaving off while we were well and being satisfied with what we had got but I know not what fate guided me I was as backward to it now as she was when I proposed it to her before and so in an ill hour we gave over the thoughts of it for the present and in a word I grew more hardened and audacious than ever and the success I had made my name as famous as any thief of my sort ever had been at Newgate and in the Old Bailey I had sometime taken the liberty to play the same game over again which is not according to practice which however succeeded not amiss but generally I took up new figures and contrived to appear in new shapes every time I went abroad It was not a rumbling time of the year and the gentlemen being most of them gone out of town Tunbridge and Epsom and such places were full of people But the city was thin and I thought our trade felt it a little as well as other so that at the latter end of the year I joined myself with a gang who usually go every year to Stourbridge Fair and from thence to Bury Fair in Suffolk We promised ourselves great things there but when I came to see how things were I was weary of it presently for except mere picking of pockets there was little worth meddling with neither if a booty had been made was it so easy carrying it off nor was there such a variety of occasion for business in our way as in London all that I made of the whole journey was a gold watch at Bury Fair and a small parcel of linen at Cambridge which gave me an occasion to take leave of the place It was on old bite and I thought might do with a country shopkeeper though in London it would not I bought at a linen draper s shop not in the fair but in the town of Cambridge as much fine holland and other things as came to about seven pounds when I had done I bade them be sent to such an inn where I had purposely taken up my being the same morning as if I was to lodge there that night I ordered the draper to send them home to me about such an hour to the inn where I lay and I would pay him his money At the time appointed the draper sends the goods and I placed one of our gang at the chamber door and when the innkeeper s maid brought the messenger to the door who was a young fellow an apprentice almost a man she tells him her mistress was asleep but if he would leave the things and call in about an hour I should be awake and he might have the money He left the parcel very readily and goes his way and in about half an hour my maid and I walked off and that very evening I hired a horse and a man to ride before me and went to Newmarket and from thence got my passage in a coach that was not quite full to saint Edmund s Bury where as I told you I could make but little of my trade only at a little country opera house made a shift to carry off a gold watch from a lady s side who was not only intolerably merry but as I thought a little fuddled which made my work much easier I made off with this little booty to Ipswich and from thence to Harwich where I went into an inn as if I had newly arrived from Holland not doubting but I should make some purchase among the foreigners that came on shore there but I found them generally empty of things of value except what was in their portmanteaux and Dutch hampers which were generally guarded by footmen however I fairly got one of their portmanteaux one evening out of the chamber where the gentleman lay the footman being fast asleep on the bed and I suppose very drunk The room in which I lodged lay next to the Dutchman s and having dragged the heavy thing with much ado out of the chamber into mine I went out into the street to see if I could find any possibility of carrying it off I walked about a great while but could see no probability either of getting out the thing or of conveying away the goods that were in it if I had opened it the town being so small and I a perfect stranger in it so I was returning with a resolution to carry it back again and leave it where I found it Just in that very moment I heard a man make a noise to some people to make haste for the boat was going to put off and the tide would be spent I called to the fellow What boat is it friend says I that you belong to The Ipswich wherry madam says he When do you go off says I This moment madam says he do you want to go thither Yes said I if you can stay till I fetch my things Where are your things madam says he At such an inn said I Well I ll go with you madam says he very civilly and bring them for you Come away then says I and takes him with me The people of the inn were in a great hurry the packet boat from Holland being just come in and two coaches just come also with passengers from London for another packet boat that was going off for Holland which coaches were to go back next day with the passengers that were just landed In this hurry it was not much minded that I came to the bar and paid my reckoning telling my landlady I had gotten my passage by sea in a wherry These wherries are large vessels with good accommodation for carrying passengers from Harwich to London and though they are called wherries which is a word used in the Thames for a small boat rowed with one or two men yet these are vessels able to carry twenty passengers and ten or fifteen tons of goods and fitted to bear the sea All this I had found out by inquiring the night before into the several ways of going to London My landlady was very courteous took my money for my reckoning but was called away all the house being in a hurry So I left her took the fellow up to my chamber gave him the trunk or portmanteau for it was like a trunk and wrapped it about with an old apron and he went directly to his boat with it and I after him nobody asking us the least question about it as for the drunken Dutch footman he was still asleep and his master with other foreign gentlemen at supper and very merry below so I went clean off with it to Ipswich and going in the night the people of the house knew nothing but that I was gone to London by the Harwich wherry as I had told my landlady I was plagued at Ipswich with the custom house officers who stopped my trunk as I called it and would open and search it I was willing I told them they should search it but husband had the key and he was not yet come from Harwich this I said that if upon searching it they should find all the things be such as properly belonged to a man rather than a woman it should not seem strange to them However they being positive to open the trunk I consented to have it be broken open that is to say to have the lock taken off which was not difficult They found nothing for their turn for the trunk had been searched before but they discovered several things very much to my satisfaction as particularly a parcel of money in French pistols and some Dutch ducatoons or rix dollars and the rest was chiefly two periwigs wearing linen and razors wash balls perfumes and other useful things necessary for a gentleman which all passed for my husband s and so I was quit to them It was now very early in the morning and not light and I knew not well what course to take for I made no doubt but I should be pursued in the morning and perhaps be taken with the things about me so I resolved upon taking new measures I went publicly to an inn in the town with my trunk as I called it and having taken the substance out I did not think the lumber of it worth my concern however I gave it the landlady of the house with a charge to take great care of it and lay it up safe till I should come again and away I walked in to the street When I was got into the town a great way from the inn I met with an ancient woman who had just opened her door and I fell into chat with her and asked her a great many wild questions of things all remote to my purpose and design but in my discourse I found by her how the town was situated that I was in a street that went out towards Hadley but that such a street went towards the water side such a street towards Colchester and so the London road lay there I had soon my ends of this old woman for I only wanted to know which was the London road and away I walked as fast as I could not that I intended to go on foot either to London or to Colchester but I wanted to get quietly away from Ipswich I walked about two or three miles and then I met a plain countryman who was busy about some husbandry work I did not know what and I asked him a great many questions first not much to the purpose but at last told him I was going for London and the coach was full and I could not get a passage and asked him if he could tell me where to hire a horse that would carry double and an honest man to ride before me to Colchester that so I might get a place there in the coaches The honest clown looked earnestly at me and said nothing for above half a minute when scratching his poll A horse say you and to Colchester to carry double why yes mistress alack a day you may have horses enough for money Well friend says I that I take for granted I don t expect it without money Why but mistress says he how much are you willing to give Nay says I again friend I don t know what your rates are in the country here for I am a stranger but if you can get one for me get it as cheap as you can and I ll give you somewhat for your pains Why that s honestly said too says the countryman Not so honest neither said I to myself if thou knewest all Why mistress says he I have a horse that will carry double and I don t much care if I go myself with you and the like Will you says I well I believe you are an honest man if you will I shall be glad of it I ll pay you in reason Why look ye mistress says he I won t be out of reason with you then if I carry you to Colchester it will be worth five shillings for myself and my horse for I shall hardly come back to night In short I hired the honest man and his horse but when we came to a town upon the road I do not remember the name of it but it stands upon a river I pretended myself very ill and I could go no farther that night but if he would stay there with me because I was a stranger I would pay him for himself and his horse with all my heart This I did because I knew the Dutch gentlemen and their servants would be upon the road that day either in the stagecoaches or riding post and I did not know but the drunken fellow or somebody else that might have seen me at Harwich might see me again and so I thought that in one day s stop they would be all gone by We lay all that night there and the next morning it was not very early when I set out so that it was near ten o clock by the time I got to Colchester It was no little pleasure that I saw the town where I had so many pleasant days and I made many inquiries after the good old friends I had once had there but could make little out they were all dead or removed The young ladies had been all married or gone to London the old gentleman and the old lady that had been my early benefactress all dead and which troubled me most the young gentleman my first lover and afterwards my brother in law was dead but two sons men grown were left of him but they too were transplanted to London I dismissed my old man here and stayed incognito for three or four days in Colchester and then took a passage in a waggon because I would not venture being seen in the Harwich coaches But I needed not have used so much caution for there was nobody in Harwich but the woman of the house could have known me nor was it rational to think that she considering the hurry she was in and that she never saw me but once and that by candlelight should have ever discovered me I was now returned to London and though by the accident of the last adventure I got something considerable yet I was not fond of any more country rambles nor should I have ventured abroad again if I had carried the trade on to the end of my days I gave my governess a history of my travels she liked the Harwich journey well enough and in discoursing of these things between ourselves she observed that a thief being a creature that watches the advantages of other people s mistakes tis impossible but that to one that is vigilant and industrious many opportunities must happen and therefore she thought that one so exquisitely keen in the trade as I was would scarce fail of something extraordinary wherever I went On the other hand every branch of my story if duly considered may be useful to honest people and afford a due caution to people of some sort or other to guard against the like surprises and to have their eyes about them when they have to do with strangers of any kind for tis very seldom that some snare or other is not in their way The moral indeed of all my history is left to be gathered by the senses and judgment of the reader I am not qualified to preach to them Let the experience of one creature completely wicked and completely miserable be a storehouse of useful warning to those that read I am drawing now towards a new variety of the scenes of life Upon my return being hardened by a long race of crime and success unparalleled at least in the reach of my own knowledge I had as I have said no thoughts of laying down a trade which if I was to judge by the example of other must however end at last in misery and sorrow It was on the Christmas day following in the evening that to finish a long train of wickedness I went abroad to see what might offer in my way when going by a working silversmith s in Foster Lane I saw a tempting bait indeed and not be resisted by one of my occupation for the shop had nobody in it as I could see and a great deal of loose plate lay in the window and at the seat of the man who usually as I suppose worked at one side of the shop I went boldly in and was just going to lay my hand upon a piece of plate and might have done it and carried it clear off for any care that the men who belonged to the shop had taken of it but an officious fellow in a house not a shop on the other side of the way seeing me go in and observing that there was nobody in the shop comes running over the street and into the shop and without asking me what I was or who seizes upon me an cries out for the people of the house I had not as I said above touched anything in the shop and seeing a glimpse of somebody running over to the shop I had so much presence of mind as to knock very hard with my foot on the floor of the house and was just calling out too when the fellow laid hands on me However as I had always most courage when I was in most danger so when the fellow laid hands on me I stood very high upon it that I came in to buy half a dozen of silver spoons and to my good fortune it was a silversmith s that sold plate as well as worked plate for other shops The fellow laughed at that part and put such a value upon the service that he had done his neighbour that he would have it be that I came not to buy but to steal and raising a great crowd I said to the master of the shop who by this time was fetched home from some neighbouring place that it was in vain to make noise and enter into talk there of the case the fellow had insisted that I came to steal and he must prove it and I desired we might go before a magistrate without any more words for I began to see I should be too hard for the man that had seized me The master and mistress of the shop were really not so violent as the man from t other side of the way and the man said Mistress you might come into the shop with a good design for aught I know but it seemed a dangerous thing for you to come into such a shop as mine is when you see nobody there and I cannot do justice to my neighbour who was so kind to me as not to acknowledge he had reason on his side though upon the whole I do not find you attempted to take anything and I really know not what to do in it I pressed him to go before a magistrate with me and if anything could be proved on me that was like a design of robbery I should willingly submit but if not I expected reparation Just while we were in this debate and a crowd of people gathered about the door came by Sir T B an alderman of the city and justice of the peace and the goldsmith hearing of it goes out and entreated his worship to come in and decide the case Give the goldsmith his due he told his story with a great deal of justice and moderation and the fellow that had come over and seized upon me told his with as much heat and foolish passion which did me good still rather than harm It came then to my turn to speak and I told his worship that I was a stranger in London being newly come out of the north that I lodged in such a place that I was passing this street and went into the goldsmith s shop to buy half a dozen of spoons By great luck I had an old silver spoon in my pocket which I pulled out and told him I had carried that spoon to match it with half a dozen of new ones that it might match some I had in the country That seeing nobody I the shop I knocked with my foot very hard to make the people hear and had also called aloud with my voice tis true there was loose plate in the shop but that nobody could say I had touched any of it or gone near it that a fellow came running into the shop out of the street and laid hands on me in a furious manner in the very moments while I was calling for the people of the house that if he had really had a mind to have done his neighbour any service he should have stood at a distance and silently watched to see whether I had touched anything or no and then have clapped in upon me and taken me in the fact That is very true says mister Alderman and turning to the fellow that stopped me he asked him if it was true that I knocked with my foot He said yes I had knocked but that might be because of his coming Nay says the alderman taking him short now you contradict yourself for just now you said she was in the shop with her back to you and did not see you till you came upon her Now it was true that my back was partly to the street but yet as my business was of a kind that required me to have my eyes every way so I really had a glance of him running over as I said before though he did not perceive it After a full hearing the alderman gave it as his opinion that his neighbour was under a mistake and that I was innocent and the goldsmith acquiesced in it too and his wife and so I was dismissed but as I was going to depart mister Alderman said But hold madam if you were designing to buy spoons I hope you will not let my friend here lose his customer by the mistake I readily answered No sir I ll buy the spoons still if he can match my odd spoon which I brought for a pattern and the goldsmith showed me some of the very same fashion So he weighed the spoons and they came to five and thirty shillings so I pulls out my purse to pay him in which I had near twenty guineas for I never went without such a sum about me whatever might happen and I found it of use at other times as well as now When mister Alderman saw my money he said Well madam now I am satisfied you were wronged and it was for this reason that I moved you should buy the spoons and stayed till you had bought them for if you had not had money to pay for them I should have suspected that you did not come into the shop with an intent to buy for indeed the sort of people who come upon these designs that you have been charged with are seldom troubled with much gold in their pockets as I see you are I smiled and told his worship that then I owed something of his favour to my money but I hoped he saw reason also in the justice he had done me before He said yes he had but this had confirmed his opinion and he was fully satisfied now of my having been injured So I came off with flying colours though from an affair in which I was at the very brink of destruction It was but three days after this that not at all made cautious by my former danger as I used to be and still pursuing the art which I had so long been employed in I ventured into a house where I saw the doors open and furnished myself as I though verily without being perceived with two pieces of flowered silks such as they call brocaded silk very rich It was not a mercer s shop nor a warehouse of a mercer but looked like a private dwelling house and was it seems inhabited by a man that sold goods for the weavers to the mercers like a broker or factor That I may make short of this black part of this story I was attacked by two wenches that came open mouthed at me just as I was going out at the door and one of them pulled me back into the room while the other shut the door upon me I would have given them good words but there was no room for it two fiery dragons could not have been more furious than they were they tore my clothes bullied and roared as if they would have murdered me the mistress of the house came next and then the master and all outrageous for a while especially I gave the master very good words told him the door was open and things were a temptation to me that I was poor and distressed and poverty was when many could not resist and begged him with tears to have pity on me The mistress of the house was moved with compassion and inclined to have let me go and had almost persuaded her husband to it also but the saucy wenches were run even before they were sent and had fetched a constable and then the master said he could not go back I must go before a justice and answered his wife that he might come into trouble himself if he should let me go The sight of the constable indeed struck me with terror and I thought I should have sunk into the ground I fell into faintings and indeed the people themselves thought I would have died when the woman argued again for me and entreated her husband seeing they had lost nothing to let me go I offered him to pay for the two pieces whatever the value was though I had not got them and argued that as he had his goods and had really lost nothing it would be cruel to pursue me to death and have my blood for the bare attempt of taking them I put the constable in mind that I had broke no doors nor carried anything away and when I came to the justice and pleaded there that I had neither broken anything to get in nor carried anything out the justice was inclined to have released me but the first saucy jade that stopped me affirming that I was going out with the goods but that she stopped me and pulled me back as I was upon the threshold the justice upon that point committed me and I was carried to Newgate That horrid place my very blood chills at the mention of its name the place where so many of my comrades had been locked up and from whence they went to the fatal tree the place where my mother suffered so deeply where I was brought into the world and from whence I expected no redemption but by an infamous death to conclude the place that had so long expected me and which with so much art and success I had so long avoided I was not fixed indeed tis impossible to describe the terror of my mind when I was first brought in and when I looked around upon all the horrors of that dismal place I looked on myself as lost and that I had nothing to think of but of going out of the world and that with the utmost infamy the hellish noise the roaring swearing and clamour the stench and nastiness and all the dreadful crowd of afflicting things that I saw there joined together to make the place seem an emblem of hell itself and a kind of an entrance into it Now I reproached myself with the many hints I had had as I have mentioned above from my own reason from the sense of my good circumstances and of the many dangers I had escaped to leave off while I was well and how I had withstood them all and hardened my thoughts against all fear It seemed to me that I was hurried on by an inevitable and unseen fate to this day of misery and that now I was to expiate all my offences at the gallows that I was now to give satisfaction to justice with my blood and that I was come to the last hour of my life and of my wickedness together These things poured themselves in upon my thoughts in a confused manner and left me overwhelmed with melancholy and despair Them I repented heartily of all my life past but that repentance yielded me no satisfaction no peace no not in the least because as I said to myself it was repenting after the power of further sinning was taken away I seemed not to mourn that I had committed such crimes and for the fact as it was an offence against God and my neighbour but I mourned that I was to be punished for it I was a penitent as I thought not that I had sinned but that I was to suffer and this took away all the comfort and even the hope of my repentance in my own thoughts I got no sleep for several nights or days after I came into that wretched place and glad I would have been for some time to have died there though I did not consider dying as it ought to be considered neither indeed nothing could be filled with more horror to my imagination than the very place nothing was more odious to me than the company that was there Oh if I had but been sent to any place in the world and not to Newgate I should have thought myself happy In the next place how did the hardened wretches that were there before me triumph over me What missus Flanders come to Newgate at last What missus Mary missus Molly and after that plain Moll Flanders They thought the devil had helped me they said that I had reigned so long they expected me there many years ago and was I come at last Then they flouted me with my dejections welcomed me to the place wished me joy bid me have a good heart not to be cast down things might not be so bad as I feared and the like then called for brandy and drank to me but put it all up to my score for they told me I was but just come to the college as they called it and sure I had money in my pocket though they had none I asked one of this crew how long she had been there She said four months I asked her how the place looked to her when she first came into it Just as it did now to you says she dreadful and frightful that she thought she was in hell and I believe so still adds she but it is natural to me now I don t disturb myself about it I suppose says I you are in no danger of what is to follow Nay says she for you are mistaken there I assure you for I am under sentence only I pleaded my belly but I am no more with child than the judge that tried me and I expect to be called down next sessions This calling down is calling down to their former judgment when a woman has been respited for her belly but proves not to be with child or if she has been with child and has been brought to bed Well says I are you thus easy Ay says she I can t help myself what signifies being sad If I am hanged there s an end of me says she and away she turns dancing and sings as she goes the following piece of Newgate wit If I swing by the string I shall hear the bell ring And then there s an end of poor Jenny I mention this because it would be worth the observation of any prisoner who shall hereafter fall into the same misfortune and come to that dreadful place of Newgate how time necessity and conversing with the wretches that are there familiarizes the place to them how at last they become reconciled to that which at first was the greatest dread upon their spirits in the world and are as impudently cheerful and merry in their misery as they were when out of it I cannot say as some do this devil is not so black as he is painted for indeed no colours can represent the place to the life not any soul conceive aright of it but those who have been sufferers there But how hell should become by degree so natural and not only tolerable but even agreeable is a thing unintelligible but by those who have experienced it as I have The same night that I was sent to Newgate I sent the news of it to my old governess who was surprised at it you may be sure and spent the night almost as ill out of Newgate as I did in it The next morning she came to see me she did what she could to comfort me but she saw that was to no purpose however as she said to sink under the weight was but to increase the weight she immediately applied herself to all the proper methods to prevent the effects of it which we feared and first she found out the two fiery jades that had surprised me She tampered with them offered them money and in a word tried all imaginable ways to prevent a prosecution she offered one of the wenches one hundred to go away from her mistress and not to appear against me but she was so resolute that though she was but a servant maid at three a year wages or thereabouts she refused it and would have refused it as my governess said she believed if she had offered her five hundred Then she attacked the other maid she was not so hard hearted in appearance as the other and sometimes seemed inclined to be merciful but the first wench kept her up and changed her mind and would not so much as let my governess talk with her but threatened to have her up for tampering with the evidence Then she applied to the master that is to say the man whose goods had been stolen and particularly to his wife who as I told you was inclined at first to have some compassion for me she found the woman the same still but the man alleged he was bound by the justice that committed me to prosecute and that he should forfeit his recognisance My governess offered to find friends that should get his recognisances off of the file as they call it and that he should not suffer but it was not possible to convince him that could be done or that he could be safe any way in the world but by appearing against me so I was to have three witnesses of fact against me the master and his two maids that is to say I was as certain to be cast for my life as I was certain that I was alive and I had nothing to do but to think of dying and prepare for it I had but a sad foundation to build upon as I said before for all my repentance appeared to me to be only the effect of my fear of death not a sincere regret for the wicked life that I had lived and which had brought this misery upon me for the offending my Creator who was now suddenly to be my judge I lived many days here under the utmost horror of soul I had death as it were in view and thought of nothing night and day but of gibbets and halters evil spirits and devils it is not to be expressed by words how I was harassed between the dreadful apprehensions of death and the terror of my conscience reproaching me with my past horrible life The ordinary of Newgate came to me and talked a little in his way but all his divinity ran upon confessing my crime as he called it though he knew not what I was in for making a full discovery and the like without which he told me God would never forgive me and he said so little to the purpose that I had no manner of consolation from him and then to observe the poor creature preaching confession and repentance to me in the morning and find him drunk with brandy and spirits by noon this had something in it so shocking that I began to nauseate the man more than his work and his work too by degrees for the sake of the man so that I desired him to trouble me no more I know not how it was but by the indefatigable application of my diligent governess I had no bill preferred against me the first sessions I mean to the grand jury at Guildhall so I had another month or five weeks before me and without doubt this ought to have been accepted by me as so much time given me for reflection upon what was past and preparation for what was to come or in a word I ought to have esteemed it as a space given me for repentance and have employed it as such but it was not in me I was sorry as before for being in Newgate but had very few signs of repentance about me On the contrary like the waters in the cavities and hollows of mountains which petrify and turn into stone whatever they are suffered to drop on so the continual conversing with such a crew of hell hounds as I was had the same common operation upon me as upon other people I degenerated into stone I turned first stupid and senseless then brutish and thoughtless and at last raving mad as any of them were and in short I became as naturally pleased and easy with the place as if indeed I had been born there It is scarce possible to imagine that our natures should be capable of so much degeneracy as to make that pleasant and agreeable that in itself is the most complete misery Here was a circumstance that I think it is scarce possible to mention a worse I was as exquisitely miserable as speaking of common cases it was possible for any one to be that had life and health and money to help them as I had I had weight of guilt upon me enough to sink any creature who had the least power of reflection left and had any sense upon them of the happiness of this life of the misery of another then I had at first remorse indeed but no repentance I had now neither remorse nor repentance I had a crime charged on me the punishment of which was death by our law the proof so evident that there was no room for me so much as to plead not guilty I had the name of an old offender so that I had nothing to expect but death in a few weeks time neither had I myself any thoughts of escaping and yet a certain strange lethargy of soul possessed me I had no trouble no apprehensions no sorrow about me the first surprise was gone I was I may well say I know not how my senses my reason nay my conscience were all asleep my course of life for forty years had been a horrid complication of wickedness whoredom adultery incest lying theft and in a word everything but murder and treason had been my practice from the age of eighteen or thereabouts to three score and now I was engulfed in the misery of punishment and had an infamous death just at the door and yet I had no sense of my condition no thought of heaven or hell at least that went any farther than a bare flying touch like the stitch or pain that gives a hint and goes off I neither had a heart to ask God s mercy nor indeed to think of it And in this I think I have given a brief description of the completest misery on earth All my terrifying thoughts were past the horrors of the place were become familiar and I felt no more uneasiness at the noise and clamours of the prison than they did who made that noise in a word I was become a mere Newgate bird as wicked and as outrageous as any of them nay I scarce retained the habit and custom of good breeding and manners which all along till now ran through my conversation so thorough a degeneracy had possessed me that I was no more the same thing that I had been than if I had never been otherwise than what I was now In the middle of this hardened part of my life I had another sudden surprise which called me back a little to that thing called sorrow which indeed I began to be past the sense of before They told me one night that there was brought into the prison late the night before three highwaymen who had committed robbery somewhere on the road to Windsor Hounslow Heath I think it was and were pursued to Uxbridge by the country and were taken there after a gallant resistance in which I know not how many of the country people were wounded and some killed It is not to be wondered that we prisoners were all desirous enough to see these brave topping gentlemen that were talked up to be such as their fellows had not been known and especially because it was said they would in the morning be removed into the press yard having given money to the head master of the prison to be allowed the liberty of that better part of the prison So we that were women placed ourselves in the way that we would be sure to see them but nothing could express the amazement and surprise I was in when the very first man that came out I knew to be my Lancashire husband the same who lived so well at Dunstable and the same who I afterwards saw at Brickhill when I was married to my last husband as has been related I was struck dumb at the sight and knew neither what to say nor what to do he did not know me and that was all the present relief I had I quitted my company and retired as much as that dreadful place suffers anybody to retire and I cried vehemently for a great while Dreadful creature that I am said I how many poor people have I made miserable How many desperate wretches have I sent to the devil He had told me at Chester he was ruined by that match and that his fortunes were made desperate on my account for that thinking I had been a fortune he was run into debt more than he was able to pay and that he knew not what course to take that he would go into the army and carry a musket or buy a horse and take a tour as he called it and though I never told him that I was a fortune and so did not actually deceive him myself yet I did encourage the having it thought that I was so and by that means I was the occasion originally of his mischief The surprise of the thing only struck deeper into my thoughts any gave me stronger reflections than all that had befallen me before I grieved day and night for him and the more for that they told me he was the captain of the gang and that he had committed so many robberies that Hind or Whitney or the Golden Farmer were fools to him that he would surely be hanged if there were no more men left in the country he was born in and that there would abundance of people come in against him I was overwhelmed with grief for him my own case gave me no disturbance compared to this and I loaded myself with reproaches on his account I bewailed his misfortunes and the ruin he was now come to at such a rate that I relished nothing now as I did before and the first reflections I made upon the horrid detestable life I had lived began to return upon me and as these things returned my abhorrence of the place I was in and of the way of living in it returned also in a word I was perfectly changed and become another body While I was under these influences of sorrow for him came notice to me that the next sessions approaching there would be a bill preferred to the grand jury against me and that I should be certainly tried for my life at the Old Bailey My temper was touched before the hardened wretched boldness of spirit which I had acquired abated and conscious in the prison guilt began to flow in upon my mind In short I began to think and to think is one real advance from hell to heaven All that hellish hardened state and temper of soul which I have said so much of before is but a deprivation of thought he that is restored to his power of thinking is restored to himself As soon as I began I say to think the first think that occurred to me broke out thus Lord what will become of me I shall certainly die I shall be cast to be sure and there is nothing beyond that but death I have no friends what shall I do I shall be certainly cast Lord have mercy upon me What will become of me This was a sad thought you will say to be the first after so long a time that had started into my soul of that kind and yet even this was nothing but fright at what was to come there was not a word of sincere repentance in it all However I was indeed dreadfully dejected and disconsolate to the last degree and as I had no friend in the world to communicate my distressed thoughts to it lay so heavy upon me that it threw me into fits and swoonings several times a day I sent for my old governess and she give her her due acted the part of a true friend She left no stone unturned to prevent the grand jury finding the bill She sought out one or two of the jurymen talked with them and endeavoured to possess them with favourable dispositions on account that nothing was taken away and no house broken et cetera but all would not do they were over ruled by the rest the two wenches swore home to the fact and the jury found the bill against me for robbery and house breaking that is for felony and burglary I sunk down when they brought me news of it and after I came to myself again I thought I should have died with the weight of it My governess acted a true mother to me she pitied me she cried with me and for me but she could not help me and to add to the terror of it twas the discourse all over the house that I should die for it I could hear them talk it among themselves very often and see them shake their heads and say they were sorry for it and the like as is usual in the place But still nobody came to tell me their thoughts till at last one of the keepers came to me privately and said with a sigh Well missus Flanders you will be tried on Friday this was but a Wednesday what do you intend to do I turned as white as a clout and said God knows what I shall do for my part I know not what to do Why says he I won t flatter you I would have you prepare for death for I doubt you will be cast and as they say you are an old offender I doubt you will find but little mercy They say added he your case is very plain and that the witnesses swear so home against you there will be no standing it This was a stab into the very vitals of one under such a burthen as I was oppressed with before and I could not speak to him a word good or bad for a great while but at last I burst out into tears and said to him Lord mister what must I do Do says he send for the ordinary send for a minister and talk with him for indeed missus Flanders unless you have very good friends you are no woman for this world This was plain dealing indeed but it was very harsh to me at least I thought it so He left me in the greatest confusion imaginable and all that night I lay awake And now I began to say my prayers which I had scarce done before since my last husband s death or from a little while after And truly I may well call it saying my prayers for I was in such a confusion and had such horror upon my mind that though I cried and repeated several times the ordinary expression of Lord have mercy upon me I never brought myself to any sense of my being a miserable sinner as indeed I was and of confessing my sins to God and begging pardon for the sake of Jesus Christ I was overwhelmed with the sense of my condition being tried for my life and being sure to be condemned and then I was as sure to be executed and on this account I cried out all night Lord what will become of me Lord what shall I do Lord I shall be hanged Lord have mercy upon me and the like My poor afflicted governess was now as much concerned as I and a great deal more truly penitent though she had no prospect of being brought to trial and sentence Not but that she deserved it as much as I and so she said herself but she had not done anything herself for many years other than receiving what I and others stole and encouraging us to steal it But she cried and took on like a distracted body wringing her hands and crying out that she was undone that she believed there was a curse from heaven upon her that she should be damned that she had been the destruction of all her friends that she had brought such a one and such a one and such a one to the gallows and there she reckoned up ten or eleven people some of which I have given account of that came to untimely ends and that now she was the occasion of my ruin for she had persuaded me to go on when I would have left off I interrupted her there No mother no said I don t speak of that for you would have had me left off when I got the mercer s money again and when I came home from Harwich and I would not hearken to you therefore you have not been to blame it is I only have ruined myself I have brought myself to this misery and thus we spent many hours together Well there was no remedy the prosecution went on and on the Thursday I was carried down to the sessions house where I was arraigned as they called it and the next day I was appointed to be tried At the arraignment I pleaded Not guilty and well I might for I was indicted for felony and burglary that is for feloniously stealing two pieces of brocaded silk value forty six the goods of Anthony Johnson and for breaking open his doors whereas I knew very well they could not pretend to prove I had broken up the doors or so much as lifted up a latch On the Friday I was brought to my trial I had exhausted my spirits with crying for two or three days before so that I slept better the Thursday night than I expected and had more courage for my trial than indeed I thought possible for me to have When the trial began the indictment was read I would have spoke but they told me the witnesses must be heard first and then I should have time to be heard The witnesses were the two wenches a couple of hard mouthed jades indeed for though the thing was truth in the main yet they aggravated it to the utmost extremity and swore I had the goods wholly in my possession that I had hid them among my clothes that I was going off with them that I had one foot over the threshold when they discovered themselves and then I put t other over so that I was quite out of the house in the street with the goods before they took hold of me and then they seized me and brought me back again and they took the goods upon me The fact in general was all true but I believe and insisted upon it that they stopped me before I had set my foot clear of the threshold of the house But that did not argue much for certain it was that I had taken the goods and I was bringing them away if I had not been taken But I pleaded that I had stole nothing they had lost nothing that the door was open and I went in seeing the goods lie there and with design to buy If seeing nobody in the house I had taken any of them up in my hand it could not be concluded that I intended to steal them for that I never carried them farther than the door to look on them with the better light The Court would not allow that by any means and made a kind of a jest of my intending to buy the goods that being no shop for the selling of anything and as to carrying them to the door to look at them the maids made their impudent mocks upon that and spent their wit upon it very much told the Court I had looked at them sufficiently and approved them very well for I had packed them up under my clothes and was a going with them In short I was found guilty of felony but acquitted of the burglary which was but small comfort to me the first bringing me to a sentence of death and the last would have done no more The next day I was carried down to receive the dreadful sentence and when they came to ask me what I had to say why sentence should not pass I stood mute a while but somebody that stood behind me prompted me aloud to speak to the judges for that they could represent things favourably for me This encouraged me to speak and I told them I had nothing to say to stop the sentence but that I had much to say to bespeak the mercy of the Court that I hoped they would allow something in such a case for the circumstances of it that I had broken no doors had carried nothing off that nobody had lost anything that the person whose goods they were was pleased to say he desired mercy might be shown which indeed he very honestly did that at the worst it was the first offence and that I had never been before any court of justice before and in a word I spoke with more courage that I thought I could have done and in such a moving tone and though with tears yet not so many tears as to obstruct my speech that I could see it moved others to tears that heard me The judges sat grave and mute gave me an easy hearing and time to say all that I would but saying neither Yes nor No to it pronounced the sentence of death upon me a sentence that was to me like death itself which after it was read confounded me I had no more spirit left in me I had no tongue to speak or eyes to look up either to God or man My poor governess was utterly disconsolate and she that was my comforter before wanted comfort now herself and sometimes mourning sometimes raging was as much out of herself as to all outward appearance as any mad woman in Bedlam Nor was she only disconsolate as to me but she was struck with horror at the sense of her own wicked life and began to look back upon it with a taste quite different from mine for she was penitent to the highest degree for her sins as well as sorrowful for the misfortune She sent for a minister too a serious pious good man and applied herself with such earnestness by his assistance to the work of a sincere repentance that I believe and so did the minister too that she was a true penitent and which is still more she was not only so for the occasion and at that juncture but she continued so as I was informed to the day of her death It is rather to be thought of than expressed what was now my condition I had nothing before me but present death and as I had no friends to assist me or to stir for me I expected nothing but to find my name in the dead warrant which was to come down for the execution the Friday afterwards of five more and myself In the meantime my poor distressed governess sent me a minister who at her request first and at my own afterwards came to visit me He exhorted me seriously to repent of all my sins and to dally no longer with my soul not flattering myself with hopes of life which he said he was informed there was no room to expect but unfeignedly to look up to God with my whole soul and to cry for pardon in the name of Jesus Christ He backed his discourses with proper quotations of Scripture encouraging the greatest sinner to repent and turn from their evil way and when he had done he kneeled down and prayed with me It was now that for the first time I felt any real signs of repentance I now began to look back upon my past life with abhorrence and having a kind of view into the other side of time and things of life as I believe they do with everybody at such a time began to look with a different aspect and quite another shape than they did before The greatest and best things the views of felicity the joy the griefs of life were quite other things and I had nothing in my thoughts but what was so infinitely superior to what I had known in life that it appeared to me to be the greatest stupidity in nature to lay any weight upon anything though the most valuable in this world The word eternity represented itself with all its incomprehensible additions and I had such extended notions of it that I know not how to express them Among the rest how vile how gross how absurd did every pleasant thing look I mean that we had counted pleasant before especially when I reflected that these sordid trifles were the things for which we forfeited eternal felicity With these reflections came of mere course severe reproaches of my own mind for my wretched behaviour in my past life that I had forfeited all hope of any happiness in the eternity that I was just going to enter into and on the contrary was entitled to all that was miserable or had been conceived of misery and all this with the frightful addition of its being also eternal I am not capable of reading lectures of instruction to anybody but I relate this in the very manner in which things then appeared to me as far as I am able but infinitely short of the lively impressions which they made on my soul at that time indeed those impressions are not to be explained by words or if they are I am not mistress of words enough to express them It must be the work of every sober reader to make just reflections on them as their own circumstances may direct and without question this is what every one at some time or other may feel something of I mean a clearer sight into things to come than they had here and a dark view of their own concern in them But I go back to my own case The minister pressed me to tell him as far as I though convenient in what state I found myself as to the sight I had of things beyond life He told me he did not come as ordinary of the place whose business it is to extort confessions from prisoners for private ends or for the further detecting of other offenders that his business was to move me to such freedom of discourse as might serve to disburthen my own mind and furnish him to administer comfort to me as far as was in his power and assured me that whatever I said to him should remain with him and be as much a secret as if it was known only to God and myself and that he desired to know nothing of me but as above to qualify him to apply proper advice and assistance to me and to pray to God for me This honest friendly way of treating me unlocked all the sluices of my passions He broke into my very soul by it and I unravelled all the wickedness of my life to him In a word I gave him an abridgment of this whole history I gave him a picture of my conduct for fifty years in miniature I hid nothing from him and he in return exhorted me to sincere repentance explained to me what he meant by repentance and then drew out such a scheme of infinite mercy proclaimed from heaven to sinners of the greatest magnitude that he left me nothing to say that looked like despair or doubting of being accepted and in this condition he left me the first night He visited me again the next morning and went on with his method of explaining the terms of divine mercy which according to him consisted of nothing more or more difficult than that of being sincerely desirous of it and willing to accept it only a sincere regret for and hatred of those things I had done which rendered me so just an object of divine vengeance I am not able to repeat the excellent discourses of this extraordinary man tis all that I am able to do to say that he revived my heart and brought me into such a condition that I never knew anything of in my life before I was covered with shame and tears for things past and yet had at the same time a secret surprising joy at the prospect of being a true penitent and obtaining the comfort of a penitent I mean the hope of being forgiven and so swift did thoughts circulate and so high did the impressions they had made upon me run that I thought I could freely have gone out that minute to execution without any uneasiness at all casting my soul entirely into the arms of infinite mercy as a penitent The good gentleman was so moved also in my behalf with a view of the influence which he saw these things had on me that he blessed God he had come to visit me and resolved not to leave me till the last moment that is not to leave visiting me It was no less than twelve days after our receiving sentence before any were ordered for execution and then upon a Wednesday the dead warrant as they call it came down and I found my name was among them A terrible blow this was to my new resolutions indeed my heart sank within me and I swooned away twice one after another but spoke not a word The good minister was sorely afflicted for me and did what he could to comfort me with the same arguments and the same moving eloquence that he did before and left me not that evening so long as the prisonkeepers would suffer him to stay in the prison unless he would be locked up with me all night which he was not willing to be I wondered much that I did not see him all the next day it being the day before the time appointed for execution and I was greatly discouraged and dejected in my mind and indeed almost sank for want of the comfort which he had so often and with such success yielded me on his former visits I waited with great impatience and under the greatest oppressions of spirits imaginable till about four o clock he came to my apartment for I had obtained the favour by the help of money nothing being to be done in that place without it not to be kept in the condemned hole as they call it among the rest of the prisoners who were to die but to have a little dirty chamber to myself My heart leaped within me for joy when I heard his voice at the door even before I saw him but let any one judge what kind of motion I found in my soul when after having made a short excuse for his not coming he showed me that his time had been employed on my account that he had obtained a favourable report from the Recorder to the Secretary of State in my particular case and in short that he had brought me a reprieve He used all the caution that he was able in letting me know a thing which it would have been a double cruelty to have concealed and yet it was too much for me for as grief had overset me before so did joy overset me now and I fell into a much more dangerous swooning than I did at first and it was not without a great difficulty that I was recovered at all The good man having made a very Christian exhortation to me not to let the joy of my reprieve put the remembrance of my past sorrow out of my mind and having told me that he must leave me to go and enter the reprieve in the books and show it to the sheriffs stood up just before his going away and in a very earnest manner prayed to God for me that my repentance might be made unfeigned and sincere and that my coming back as it were into life again might not be a returning to the follies of life which I had made such solemn resolutions to forsake and to repent of them I joined heartily in the petition and must needs say I had deeper impressions upon my mind all that night of the mercy of God in sparing my life and a greater detestation of my past sins from a sense of the goodness which I had tasted in this case than I had in all my sorrow before This may be thought inconsistent in itself and wide from the business of this book particularly I reflect that many of those who may be pleased and diverted with the relation of the wild and wicked part of my story may not relish this which is really the best part of my life the most advantageous to myself and the most instructive to others Such however will I hope allow me the liberty to make my story complete It would be a severe satire on such to say they do not relish the repentance as much as they do the crime and that they had rather the history were a complete tragedy as it was very likely to have been But I go on with my relation The next morning there was a sad scene indeed in the prison The first thing I was saluted with in the morning was the tolling of the great bell at saint Sepulchre s as they call it which ushered in the day As soon as it began to toll a dismal groaning and crying was heard from the condemned hole where there lay six poor souls who were to be executed that day some from one crime some for another and two of them for murder This was followed by a confused clamour in the house among the several sorts of prisoners expressing their awkward sorrows for the poor creatures that were to die but in a manner extremely differing one from another Some cried for them some huzzaed and wished them a good journey some damned and cursed those that had brought them to it that is meaning the evidence or prosecutors many pitying them and some few but very few praying for them There was hardly room for so much composure of mind as was required for me to bless the merciful Providence that had as it were snatched me out of the jaws of this destruction I remained as it were dumb and silent overcome with the sense of it and not able to express what I had in my heart for the passions on such occasions as these are certainly so agitated as not to be able presently to regulate their own motions All the while the poor condemned creatures were preparing to their death and the ordinary as they call him was busy with them disposing them to submit to their sentence I say all this while I was seized with a fit of trembling as much as I could have been if I had been in the same condition as to be sure the day before I expected to be I was so violently agitated by this surprising fit that I shook as if it had been in the cold fit of an ague so that I could not speak or look but like one distracted As soon as they were all put into carts and gone which however I had not courage enough to see I say as soon as they were gone I fell into a fit of crying involuntarily and without design but as a mere distemper and yet so violent and it held me so long that I knew not what course to take nor could I stop or put a check to it no not with all the strength and courage I had This fit of crying held me near two hours and as I believe held me till they were all out of the world and then a most humble penitent serious kind of joy succeeded a real transport it was or passion of joy and thankfulness but still unable to give vent to it by words and in this I continued most part of the day In the evening the good minister visited me again and then fell to his usual good discourses He congratulated my having a space yet allowed me for repentance whereas the state of those six poor creatures was determined and they were now past the offers of salvation he earnestly pressed me to retain the same sentiments of the things of life that I had when I had a view of eternity and at the end of all told me I should not conclude that all was over that a reprieve was not a pardon that he could not yet answer for the effects of it however I had this mercy that I had more time given me and that it was my business to improve that time This discourse though very seasonable left a kind of sadness on my heart as if I might expect the affair would have a tragical issue still which however he had no certainty of and I did not indeed at that time question him about it he having said that he would do his utmost to bring it to a good end and that he hoped he might but he would not have me be secure and the consequence proved that he had reason for what he said It was about a fortnight after this that I had some just apprehensions that I should be included in the next dead warrant at the ensuing sessions and it was not without great difficulty and at last a humble petition for transportation that I avoided it so ill was I beholding to fame and so prevailing was the fatal report of being an old offender though in that they did not do me strict justice for I was not in the sense of the law an old offender whatever I was in the eye of the judge for I had never been before them in a judicial way before so the judges could not charge me with being an old offender but the Recorder was pleased to represent my case as he thought fit I had now a certainty of life indeed but with the hard conditions of being ordered for transportation which indeed was hard condition in itself but not when comparatively considered and therefore I shall make no comments upon the sentence nor upon the choice I was put to We shall all choose anything rather than death especially when tis attended with an uncomfortable prospect beyond it which was my case The good minister whose interest though a stranger to me had obtained me the reprieve mourned sincerely for this part He was in hopes he said that I should have ended my days under the influence of good instruction that I should not have been turned loose again among such a wretched crew as they generally are who are thus sent abroad where as he said I must have more than ordinary secret assistance from the grace of God if I did not turn as wicked again as ever I have not for a good while mentioned my governess who had during most if not all of this part been dangerously sick and being in as near a view of death by her disease as I was by my sentence was a great penitent I say I have not mentioned her nor indeed did I see her in all this time but being now recovering and just able to come abroad she came to see me I told her my condition and what a different flux and reflux of tears and hopes I had been agitated with I told her what I had escaped and upon what terms and she was present when the minister expressed his fears of my relapsing into wickedness upon my falling into the wretched companies that are generally transported Indeed I had a melancholy reflection upon it in my own mind for I knew what a dreadful gang was always sent away together and I said to my governess that the good minister s fears were not without cause Well well says she but I hope you will not be tempted with such a horrid example as that And as soon as the minister was gone she told me she would not have me discouraged for perhaps ways and means might be found out to dispose of me in a particular way by myself of which she would talk further to me afterward I looked earnestly at her and I thought she looked more cheerful than she usually had done and I entertained immediately a thousand notions of being delivered but could not for my life image the methods or think of one that was in the least feasible but I was too much concerned in it to let her go from me without explaining herself which though she was very loth to do yet my importunity prevailed and while I was still pressing she answered me in a few words thus Why you have money have you not Did you ever know one in your life that was transported and had a hundred pounds in his pocket I ll warrant you child says she I understood her presently but told her I would leave all that to her but I saw no room to hope for anything but a strict execution of the order and as it was a severity that was esteemed a mercy there was no doubt but it would be strictly observed She said no more but this We will try what can be done and so we parted for that night I lay in the prison near fifteen weeks after this order for transportation was signed What the reason of it was I know not but at the end of this time I was put on board of a ship in the Thames and with me a gang of thirteen as hardened vile creatures as ever Newgate produced in my time and it would really well take up a history longer than mine to describe the degrees of impudence and audacious villainy that those thirteen were arrived to and the manner of their behaviour in the voyage of which I have a very diverting account by me which the captain of the ship who carried them over gave me the minutes of and which he caused his mate to write down at large It may perhaps be thought trifling to enter here into a relation of all the little incidents which attended me in this interval of my circumstances I mean between the final order of my transportation and the time of my going on board the ship and I am too near the end of my story to allow room for it but something relating to me and my Lancashire husband I must not omit He had as I have observed already been carried from the master s side of the ordinary prison into the press yard with three of his comrades for they found another to add to them after some time here for what reason I knew not they were kept in custody without being brought to trial almost three months It seems they found means to bribe or buy off some of those who were expected to come in against them and they wanted evidence for some time to convict them After some puzzle on this account at first they made a shift to get proof enough against two of them to carry them off but the other two of which my Lancashire husband was one lay still in suspense They had I think one positive evidence against each of them but the law strictly obliging them to have two witnesses they could make nothing of it Yet it seems they were resolved not to part with the men neither not doubting but a further evidence would at last come in and in order to this I think publication was made that such prisoners being taken any one that had been robbed by them might come to the prison and see them I took this opportunity to satisfy my curiosity pretending that I had been robbed in the Dunstable coach and that I would go to see the two highwaymen But when I came into the press yard I so disguised myself and muffled my face up so that he could see little of me and consequently knew nothing of who I was and when I came back I said publicly that I knew them very well Immediately it was rumoured all over the prison that Moll Flanders would turn evidence against one of the highwaymen and that I was to come off by it from the sentence of transportation They heard of it and immediately my husband desired to see this missus Flanders that knew him so well and was to be an evidence against him and accordingly I had leave given to go to him I dressed myself up as well as the best clothes that I suffered myself ever to appear in there would allow me and went to the press yard but had for some time a hood over my face He said little to me at first but asked me if I knew him I told him Yes very well but as I concealed my face so I counterfeited my voice that he had not the least guess at who I was He asked me where I had seen him I told him between Dunstable and Brickhill but turning to the keeper that stood by I asked if I might not be admitted to talk with him alone He said Yes yes as much as I pleased and so very civilly withdrew As soon as he was gone I had shut the door I threw off my hood and bursting out into tears My dear says I do you not know me He turned pale and stood speechless like one thunderstruck and not able to conquer the surprise said no more but this Let me sit down and sitting down by a table he laid his elbow upon the table and leaning his head on his hand fixed his eyes on the ground as one stupid I cried so vehemently on the other hand that it was a good while ere I could speak any more but after I had given some vent to my passion by tears I repeated the same words My dear do you not know me At which he answered Yes and said no more a good while After some time continuing in the surprise as above he cast up his eyes towards me and said How could you be so cruel I did not readily understand what he meant and I answered How can you call me cruel What have I been cruel to you in To come to me says he in such a place as this is it not to insult me I have not robbed you at least not on the highway I perceived by this that he knew nothing of the miserable circumstances I was in and thought that having got some intelligence of his being there I had come to upbraid him with his leaving me But I had too much to say to him to be affronted and told him in few words that I was far from coming to insult him but at best I came to condole mutually that he would be easily satisfied that I had no such view when I should tell him that my condition was worse than his and that many ways He looked a little concerned at the general expression of my condition being worse than his but with a kind smile looked a little wildly and said How can that be When you see me fettered and in Newgate and two of my companions executed already can you can your condition is worse than mine Come my dear says I we have a long piece of work to do if I should be to relate or you to hear my unfortunate history but if you are disposed to hear it you will soon conclude with me that my condition is worse than yours How is that possible says he again when I expect to be cast for my life the very next sessions Yes says I tis very possible when I shall tell you that I have been cast for my life three sessions ago and am under sentence of death is not my case worse than yours Then indeed he stood silent again like one struck dumb and after a while he starts up Unhappy couple says he How can this be possible I took him by the hand Come my dear said I sit down and let us compare our sorrows I am a prisoner in this very house and in much worse circumstances than you and you will be satisfied I do not come to insult you when I tell you the particulars And with this we sat down together and I told him so much of my story as I thought was convenient bringing it at last to my being reduced to great poverty and representing myself as fallen into some company that led me to relieve my distresses by way that I had been utterly unacquainted with and that they making an attempt at a tradesman s house I was seized upon for having been but just at the door the maid servant pulling me in that I neither had broke any lock nor taken anything away and that notwithstanding that I was brought in guilty and sentenced to die but that the judges having been made sensible of the hardship of my circumstances had obtained leave to remit the sentence upon my consenting to be transported I told him I fared the worse for being taken in the prison for one Moll Flanders who was a famous successful thief that all of them had heard of but none of them had ever seen but that as he knew well was none of my name But I placed all to the account of my ill fortune and that under this name I was dealt with as an old offender though this was the first thing they had ever known of me I gave him a long particular of things that had befallen me since I saw him but I told him if I had seen him since he might think I had and then gave him an account how I had seen him at Brickhill how furiously he was pursued and how by giving an account that I knew him and that he was a very honest gentleman one mister the hue and cry was stopped and the high constable went back again He listened most attentively to all my story and smiled at most of the particulars being all of them petty matters and infinitely below what he had been at the head of but when I came to the story of Brickhill he was surprised And was it you my dear said he that gave the check to the mob that was at our heels there at Brickhill Yes said I it was I indeed And then I told him the particulars which I had observed him there Why then said he it was you that saved my life at that time and I am glad I owe my life to you for I will pay the debt to you now and I ll deliver you from the present condition you are in or I will die in the attempt I told him by no means it was a risk too great not worth his running the hazard of and for a life not worth his saving Twas no matter for that he said it was a life worth all the world to him a life that had given him a new life for says he I was never in real danger of being taken but that time till the last minute when I was taken Indeed he told me his danger then lay in his believing he had not been pursued that way for they had gone from Hockey quite another way and had come over the enclosed country into Brickhill not by the road and were sure they had not been seen by anybody Here he gave me a long history of his life which indeed would make a very strange history and be infinitely diverting He told me he took to the road about twelve years before he married me that the woman which called him brother was not really his sister or any kin to him but one that belonged to their gang and who keeping correspondence with him lived always in town having good store of acquaintance that she gave them a perfect intelligence of persons going out of town and that they had made several good booties by her correspondence that she thought she had fixed a fortune for him when she brought me to him but happened to be disappointed which he really could not blame her for that if it had been his good luck that I had had the estate which she was informed I had he had resolved to leave off the road and live a retired sober live but never to appear in public till some general pardon had been passed or till he could for money have got his name into some particular pardon that so he might have been perfectly easy but that as it had proved otherwise he was obliged to put off his equipage and take up the old trade again He gave me a long account of some of his adventures and particularly one when he robbed the West Chester coaches near Lichfield when he got a very great booty and after that how he robbed five graziers in the west going to Burford Fair in Wiltshire to buy sheep He told me he got so much money on those two occasions that if he had known where to have found me he would certainly have embraced my proposal of going with me to Virginia or to have settled in a plantation on some other parts of the English colonies in America He told me he wrote two or three letters to me directed according to my order but heard nothing from me This I indeed knew to be true but the letters coming to my hand in the time of my latter husband I could do nothing in it and therefore chose to give no answer that so he might rather believe they had miscarried Being thus disappointed he said he carried on the old trade ever since though when he had gotten so much money he said he did not run such desperate risks as he did before Then he gave me some account of several hard and desperate encounters which he had with gentlemen on the road who parted too hardly with their money and showed me some wounds he had received and he had one or two very terrible wounds indeed as particularly one by a pistol bullet which broke his arm and another with a sword which ran him quite through the body but that missing his vitals he was cured again one of his comrades having kept with him so faithfully and so friendly as that he assisted him in riding near eighty miles before his arm was set and then got a surgeon in a considerable city remote from that place where it was done pretending they were gentlemen travelling towards Carlisle and that they had been attacked on the road by highwaymen and that one of them had shot him into the arm and broke the bone This he said his friend managed so well that they were not suspected at all but lay still till he was perfectly cured He gave me so many distinct accounts of his adventures that it is with great reluctance that I decline the relating them but I consider that this is my own story not his I then inquired into the circumstances of his present case at that time and what it was he expected when he came to be tried He told me that they had no evidence against him or but very little for that of three robberies which they were all charged with it was his good fortune that he was but in one of them and that there was but one witness to be had for that fact which was not sufficient but that it was expected some others would come in against him that he thought indeed when he first saw me that I had been one that came of that errand but that if somebody came in against him he hoped he should be cleared that he had had some intimation that if he would submit to transport himself he might be admitted to it without a trial but that he could not think of it with any temper and thought he could much easier submit to be hanged I blamed him for that and told him I blamed him on two accounts first because if he was transported there might be a hundred ways for him that was a gentleman and a bold enterprising man to find his way back again and perhaps some ways and means to come back before he went He smiled at that part and said he should like the last the best of the two for he had a kind of horror upon his mind at his being sent over to the plantations as Romans sent condemned slaves to work in the mines that he thought the passage into another state let it be what it would much more tolerable at the gallows and that this was the general notion of all the gentlemen who were driven by the exigence of their fortunes to take the road that at the place of execution there was at least an end of all the miseries of the present state and as for what was to follow a man was in his opinion as likely to repent sincerely in the last fortnight of his life under the pressures and agonies of a jail and the condemned hole as he would ever be in the woods and wilderness of America that servitude and hard labour were things gentlemen could never stoop to that it was but the way to force them to be their own executioners afterwards which was much worse and that therefore he could not have any patience when he did but think of being transported I used the utmost of my endeavour to persuade him and joined that known woman s rhetoric to it I mean that of tears I told him the infamy of a public execution was certainly a greater pressure upon the spirits of a gentleman than any of the mortifications that he could meet with abroad could be that he had at least in the other a chance for his life whereas here he had none at all that it was the easiest thing in the world for him to manage the captain of a ship who were generally speaking men of good humour and some gallantry and a small matter of conduct especially if there was any money to be had would make way for him to buy himself off when he came to Virginia He looked wistfully at me and I thought I guessed at what he meant that is to say that he had no money but I was mistaken his meaning was another way You hinted just now my dear said he that there might be a way of coming back before I went by which I understood you that it might be possible to buy it off here I had rather give two hundred to prevent going than one hundred to be set at liberty when I came there That is my dear said I because you do not know the place so well as I do That may be said he and yet I believe as well as you know it you would do the same unless it is because as you told me you have a mother there I told him as to my mother it was next to impossible but that she must be dead many years before and as for any other relations that I might have there I knew them not now that since the misfortunes I had been under had reduced me to the condition I had been in for some years I had not kept up any correspondence with them and that he would easily believe I should find but a cold reception from them if I should be put to make my first visit in the condition of a transported felon that therefore if I went thither I resolved not to see them but that I had many views in going there if it should be my fate which took off all the uneasy part of it and if he found himself obliged to go also I should easily instruct him how to manage himself so as never to go a servant at all especially since I found he was not destitute of money which was the only friend in such a condition He smiled and said he did not tell me he had money I took him up short and told him I hoped he did not understand by my speaking that I should expect any supply from him if he had money that on the other hand though I had not a great deal yet I did not want and while I had any I would rather add to him than weaken him in that article seeing whatever he had I knew in the case of transportation he would have occasion of it all He expressed himself in a most tender manner upon that head He told me what money he had was not a great deal but that he would never hide any of it from me if I wanted it and that he assured me he did not speak with any such apprehensions that he was only intent upon what I had hinted to him before he went that here he knew what to do with himself but that there he should be the most ignorant helpless wretch alive I told him he frighted and terrified himself with that which had no terror in it that if he had money as I was glad to hear he had he might not only avoid the servitude supposed to be the consequence of transportation but begin the world upon a new foundation and that such a one as he could not fail of success in with the common application usual in such cases that he could not but call to mind that is was what I had recommended to him many years before and had proposed it for our mutual subsistence and restoring our fortunes in the world and I would tell him now that to convince him both of the certainty of it and of my being fully acquainted with the method and also fully satisfied in the probability of success he should first see me deliver myself from the necessity of going over at all and then that I would go with him freely and of my own choice and perhaps carry enough with me to satisfy him that I did not offer it for want of being able to live without assistance from him but that I thought our mutual misfortunes had been such as were sufficient to reconcile us both to quitting this part of the world and living where nobody could upbraid us with what was past or we be in any dread of a prison and without agonies of a condemned hole to drive us to it this where we should look back on all our past disasters with infinite satisfaction when we should consider that our enemies should entirely forget us and that we should live as new people in a new world nobody having anything to say to us or we to them I pressed this home to him with so many arguments and answered all his own passionate objections so effectually that he embraced me and told me I treated him with such sincerity and affection as overcame him that he would take my advice and would strive to submit to his fate in hope of having the comfort of my assistance and of so faithful a counsellor and such a companion in his misery But still he put me in mind of what I had mentioned before namely that there might be some way to get off before he went and that it might be possible to avoid going at all which he said would be much better I told him he should see and be fully satisfied that I would do my utmost in that part too and if it did not succeed yet that I would make good the rest We parted after this long conference with such testimonies of kindness and affection as I thought were equal if not superior to that at our parting at Dunstable and now I saw more plainly than before the reason why he declined coming at that time any farther with me toward London than Dunstable and why when we parted there he told me it was not convenient for him to come part of the way to London to bring me going as he would otherwise have done I have observed that the account of his life would have made a much more pleasing history than this of mine and indeed nothing in it was more strange than this part viz that he carried on that desperate trade full five and twenty years and had never been taken the success he had met with had been so very uncommon and such that sometimes he had lived handsomely and retired in place for a year or two at a time keeping himself and a man servant to wait on him and had often sat in the coffee houses and heard the very people whom he had robbed give accounts of their being robbed and of the place and circumstances so that he could easily remember that it was the same In this manner it seems he lived near Liverpool at the time he unluckily married me for a fortune Had I been the fortune he expected I verily believe as he said that he would have taken up and lived honestly all his days He had with the rest of his misfortunes the good luck not to be actually upon the spot when the robbery was done which he was committed for and so none of the persons robbed could swear to him or had anything to charge upon him But it seems as he was taken with the gang one hard mouthed countryman swore home to him and they were like to have others come in according to the publication they had made so that they expected more evidence against him and for that reason he was kept in hold However the offer which was made to him of admitting him to transportation was made as I understood upon the intercession of some great person who pressed him hard to accept of it before a trial and indeed as he knew there were several that might come in against him I thought his friend was in the right and I lay at him night and day to delay it no longer At last with much difficulty he gave his consent and as he was not therefore admitted to transportation in court and on his petition as I was so he found himself under a difficulty to avoid embarking himself as I had said he might have done his great friend who was his intercessor for the favour of that grant having given security for him that he should transport himself and not return within the term This hardship broke all my measures for the steps I took afterwards for my own deliverance were hereby rendered wholly ineffectual unless I would abandon him and leave him to go to America by himself than which he protested he would much rather venture although he were certain to go directly to the gallows I must now return to my case The time of my being transported according to my sentence was near at hand my governess who continued my fast friend had tried to obtain a pardon but it could not be done unless with an expense too heavy for my purse considering that to be left naked and empty unless I had resolved to return to my old trade again had been worse than my transportation because there I knew I could live here I could not The good minister stood very hard on another account to prevent my being transported also but he was answered that indeed my life had been given me at his first solicitations and therefore he ought to ask no more He was sensibly grieved at my going because as he said he feared I should lose the good impressions which a prospect of death had at first made on me and which were since increased by his instructions and the pious gentleman was exceedingly concerned about me on that account On the other hand I really was not so solicitous about it as I was before but I industriously concealed my reasons for it from the minister and to the last he did not know but that I went with the utmost reluctance and affliction It was in the month of February that I was with seven other convicts as they called us delivered to a merchant that traded to Virginia on board a ship riding as they called it in Deptford Reach The officer of the prison delivered us on board and the master of the vessel gave a discharge for us We were for that night clapped under hatches and kept so close that I thought I should have been suffocated for want of air and the next morning the ship weighed and fell down the river to a place they call Bugby s Hole which was done as they told us by the agreement of the merchant that all opportunity of escape should be taken from us However when the ship came thither and cast anchor we were allowed more liberty and particularly were permitted to come up on the deck but not up on the quarter deck that being kept particularly for the captain and for passengers When by the noise of the men over my head and the motion of the ship I perceived that they were under sail I was at first greatly surprised fearing we should go away directly and that our friends would not be admitted to see us any more but I was easy soon after when I found they had come to an anchor again and soon after that we had notice given by some of the men where we were that the next morning we should have the liberty to come up on deck and to have our friends come and see us if we had any All that night I lay upon the hard boards of the deck as the passengers did but we had afterwards the liberty of little cabins for such of us as had any bedding to lay in them and room to stow any box or trunk for clothes and linen if we had it which might well be put in for some of them had neither shirt nor shift or a rag of linen or woollen but what was on their backs or a farthing of money to help themselves and yet I did not find but they fared well enough in the ship especially the women who got money from the seamen for washing their clothes sufficient to purchase any common things that they wanted When the next morning we had the liberty to come up on the deck I asked one of the officers of the ship whether I might not have the liberty to send a letter on shore to let my friends know where the ship lay and to get some necessary things sent to me This was it seems the boatswain a very civil courteous sort of man who told me I should have that or any other liberty that I desired that he could allow me with safety I told him I desired no other and he answered that the ship s boat would go up to London the next tide and he would order my letter to be carried Accordingly when the boat went off the boatswain came to me and told me the boat was going off and that he went in it himself and asked me if my letter was ready he would take care of it I had prepared myself you may be sure pen ink and paper beforehand and I had gotten a letter ready directed to my governess and enclosed another for my fellow prisoner which however I did not let her know was my husband not to the last In that to my governess I let her know where the ship lay and pressed her earnestly to send me what things I knew she had got ready for me for my voyage When I gave the boatswain the letter I gave him a shilling with it which I told him was for the charge of a messenger or porter which I entreated him to send with the letter as soon as he came on shore that if possible I might have an answer brought back by the same hand that I might know what was become of my things for sir says I if the ship should go away before I have them on board I am undone I took care when I gave him the shilling to let him see that I had a little better furniture about me than the ordinary prisoners for he saw that I had a purse and in it a pretty deal of money and I found that the very sight of it immediately furnished me with very different treatment from what I should otherwise have met with in the ship for though he was very courteous indeed before in a kind of natural compassion to me as a woman in distress yet he was more than ordinarily so afterwards and procured me to be better treated in the ship than I say I might otherwise have been as shall appear in its place He very honestly had my letter delivered to my governess s own hands and brought me back an answer from her in writing and when he gave me the answer gave me the shilling again There says he there s your shilling again too for I delivered the letter myself I could not tell what to say I was so surprised at the thing but after some pause I said Sir you are too kind it had been but reasonable that you had paid yourself coach hire then No no says he I am overpaid What is the gentlewoman Your sister No sir says I she is no relation to me but she is a dear friend and all the friends I have in the world Well says he there are few such friends in the world Why she cried after you like a child Ay says I again she would give a hundred pounds I believe to deliver me from this dreadful condition I am in Would she so says he For half the money I believe I could put you in a way how to deliver yourself But this he spoke softly that nobody could hear Alas sir said I but then that must be such a deliverance as if I should be taken again would cost me my life Nay said he if you were once out of the ship you must look to yourself afterwards that I can say nothing to So we dropped the discourse for that time In the meantime my governess faithful to the last moment conveyed my letter to the prison to my husband and got an answer to it and the next day came down herself to the ship bringing me in the first place a sea bed as they call it and all its furniture such as was convenient but not to let the people think it was extraordinary She brought with her a sea chest that is a chest such as are made for seamen with all the conveniences in it and filled with everything almost that I could want and in one of the corners of the chest where there was a private drawer was my bank of money this is to say so much of it as I had resolved to carry with me for I ordered a part of my stock to be left behind me to be sent afterwards in such goods as I should want when I came to settle for money in that country is not of much use where all things are brought for tobacco much more is it a great loss to carry it from hence But my case was particular it was by no means proper to me to go thither without money or goods and for a poor convict that was to be sold as soon as I came on shore to carry with me a cargo of goods would be to have notice taken of it and perhaps to have them seized by the public so I took part of my stock with me thus and left the other part with my governess My governess brought me a great many other things but it was not proper for me to look too well provided in the ship at least till I knew what kind of a captain we should have When she came into the ship I thought she would have died indeed her heart sank at the sight of me and at the thoughts of parting with me in that condition and she cried so intolerably I could not for a long time have any talk with her I took that time to read my fellow prisoner s letter which however greatly perplexed me He told me he was determined to go but found it would be impossible for him to be discharged time enough for going in the same ship and which was more than all he began to question whether they would give him leave to go in what ship he pleased though he did voluntarily transport himself but that they would see him put on board such a ship as they should direct and that he would be charged upon the captain as other convict prisoners were so that he began to be in despair of seeing me till he came to Virginia which made him almost desperate seeing that on the other hand if I should not be there if any accident of the sea or of mortality should take me away he should be the most undone creature there in the world This was very perplexing and I knew not what course to take I told my governess the story of the boatswain and she was mighty eager with me treat with him but I had no mind to it till I heard whether my husband or fellow prisoner so she called him could be at liberty to go with me or no At last I was forced to let her into the whole matter except only that of his being my husband I told her I had made a positive bargain or agreement with him to go if he could get the liberty of going in the same ship and that I found he had money Then I read a long lecture to her of what I proposed to do when we came there how we could plant settle and in short grow rich without any more adventures and as a great secret I told her that we were to marry as soon as he came on board She soon agreed cheerfully to my going when she heard this and she made it her business from that time to get him out of the prison in time so that he might go in the same ship with me which at last was brought to pass though with great difficulty and not without all the forms of a transported prisoner convict which he really was not yet for he had not been tried and which was a great mortification to him As our fate was now determined and we were both on board actually bound to Virginia in the despicable quality of transported convicts destined to be sold for slaves I for five years and he under bonds and security not to return to England any more as long as he lived he was very much dejected and cast down the mortification of being brought on board as he was like a prisoner piqued him very much since it was first told him he should transport himself and so that he might go as a gentleman at liberty It is true he was not ordered to be sold when he came there as we were and for that reason he was obliged to pay for his passage to the captain which we were not as to the rest he was as much at a loss as a child what to do with himself or with what he had but by directions Our first business was to compare our stock He was very honest to me and told me his stock was pretty good when he came into the prison but the living there as he did in a figure like a gentleman and which was ten times as much the making of friends and soliciting his case had been very expensive and in a word all his stock that he had left was one hundred eight which he had about him all in gold I gave him an account of my stock as faithfully that is to say of what I had taken to carry with me for I was resolved whatever should happen to keep what I had left with my governess in reserve that in case I should die what I had with me was enough to give him and that which was left in my governess s hands would be her own which she had well deserved of me indeed My stock which I had with me was two hundred forty six some odd shillings so that we had three hundred fifty four between us but a worse gotten estate was scarce ever put together to being the world with Our greatest misfortune as to our stock was that it was all in money which every one knows is an unprofitable cargo to be carried to the plantations I believe his was really all he had left in the world as he told me it was but I who had between seven hundred and eight hundred in bank when this disaster befell me and who had one of the faithfullest friends in the world to manage it for me considering she was a woman of manner of religious principles had still three hundred left in her hand which I reserved as above besides some very valuable things as particularly two gold watches some small pieces of plate and some rings all stolen goods The plate rings and watches were put in my chest with the money and with this fortune and in the sixty first year of my age I launched out into a new world as I may call it in the condition as to what appeared only of a poor naked convict ordered to be transported in respite from the gallows My clothes were poor and mean but not ragged or dirty and none knew in the whole ship that I had anything of value about me However as I had a great many very good clothes and linen in abundance which I had ordered to be packed up in two great boxes I had them shipped on board not as my goods but as consigned to my real name in Virginia and had the bills of loading signed by a captain in my pocket and in these boxes was my plate and watches and everything of value except my money which I kept by itself in a private drawer in my chest which could not be found or opened if found without splitting the chest to pieces In this condition I lay for three weeks in the ship not knowing whether I should have my husband with me or no and therefore not resolving how or in what manner to receive the honest boatswain s proposal which indeed he thought a little strange at first At the end of this time behold my husband came on board He looked with a dejected angry countenance his great heart was swelled with rage and disdain to be dragged along with three keepers of Newgate and put on board like a convict when he had not so much as been brought to a trial He made loud complaints of it by his friends for it seems he had some interest but his friends got some check in their application and were told he had had favour enough and that they had received such an account of him since the last grant of his transportation that he ought to think himself very well treated that he was not prosecuted anew This answer quieted him at once for he knew too much what might have happened and what he had room to expect and now he saw the goodness of the advice to him which prevailed with him to accept of the offer of a voluntary transportation And after this his chagrin at these hell hounds as he called them was a little over he looked a little composed began to be cheerful and as I was telling him how glad I was to have him once more out of their hands he took me in his arms and acknowledged with great tenderness that I had given him the best advice possible My dear says he thou has twice saved my life from henceforward it shall be all employed for you and I ll always take your advice The ship began now to fill several passengers came on board who were embarked on no criminal account and these had accommodations assigned them in the great cabin and other parts of the ship whereas we as convicts were thrust down below I know not where But when my husband came on board I spoke to the boatswain who had so early given me hints of his friendship in carrying my letter I told him he had befriended me in many things and I had not made any suitable return to him and with that I put a guinea into his hand I told him that my husband was now come on board that though we were both under the present misfortune yet we had been persons of a different character from the wretched crew that we came with and desired to know of him whether the captain might not be moved to admit us to some conveniences in the ship for which we would make him what satisfaction he pleased and that we would gratify him for his pains in procuring this for us He took the guinea as I could see with great satisfaction and assured me of his assistance Then he told us he did not doubt but that the captain who was one of the best humoured gentlemen in the world would be easily brought to accommodate us as well as we could desire and to make me easy told me he would go up the next tide on purpose to speak to the captain about it The next morning happening to sleep a little longer than ordinary when I got up and began to look abroad I saw the boatswain among the men in his ordinary business I was a little melancholy at seeing him there and going forward to speak to him he saw me and came towards me but not giving him time to speak first I said smiling I doubt sir you have forgot us for I see you are very busy He returned presently Come along with me and you shall see So he took me into the great cabin and there sat a good sort of a gentlemanly man for a seaman writing and with a great many papers before him Here says the boatswain to him that was a writing is the gentlewoman that the captain spoke to you of and turning to me he said I have been so far from forgetting your business that I have been up at the captain s house and have represented faithfully to the captain what you said relating to you being furnished with better conveniences for yourself and your husband and the captain has sent this gentleman who is mate of the ship down with me on purpose to show you everything and to accommodate you fully to your content and bid me assure you that you shall not be treated like what you were at first expected to be but with the same respect as other passengers are treated The mate then spoke to me and not giving me time to thank the boatswain for his kindness confirmed what the boatswain had said and added that it was the captain s delight to show himself kind and charitable especially to those that were under any misfortunes and with that he showed me several cabins built up some in the great cabin and some partitioned off out of the steerage but opening into the great cabin on purpose for the accommodation of passengers and gave me leave to choose where I would However I chose a cabin which opened into the steerage in which was very good conveniences to set our chest and boxes and a table to eat on The mate then told me that the boatswain had given so good a character of me and my husband as to our civil behaviour that he had orders to tell me we should eat with him if we thought fit during the whole voyage on the common terms of passengers that we might lay in some fresh provisions if we pleased or if not he should lay in his usual store and we should have share with him This was very reviving news to me after so many hardships and afflictions as I had gone through of late I thanked him and told him the captain should make his own terms with us and asked him leave to go and tell my husband of it who was not very well and was not yet out of his cabin Accordingly I went and my husband whose spirits were still so much sunk with the indignity as he understood it offered him that he was scared yet himself was so revived with the account that I gave him of the reception we were like to have in the ship that he was quite another man and new vigour and courage appeared in his very countenance So true is it that the greatest of spirits when overwhelmed by their afflictions are subject to the greatest dejections and are the most apt to despair and give themselves up After some little pause to recover himself my husband came up with me and gave the mate thanks for the kindness which he had expressed to us and sent suitable acknowledgment by him to the captain offering to pay him by advance whatever he demanded for our passage and for the conveniences he had helped us to The mate told him that the captain would be on board in the afternoon and that he would leave all that till he came Accordingly in the afternoon the captain came and we found him the same courteous obliging man that the boatswain had represented him to be and he was so well pleased with my husband s conversation that in short he would not let us keep the cabin we had chosen but gave us one that as I said before opened into the great cabin Nor were his conditions exorbitant or the man craving and eager to make a prey of us but for fifteen guineas we had our whole passage and provisions and cabin ate at the captain s table and were very handsomely entertained The captain lay himself in the other part of the great cabin having let his round house as they call it to a rich planter who went over with his wife and three children who ate by themselves He had some other ordinary passengers who quartered in the steerage and as for our old fraternity they were kept under the hatches while the ship lay there and came very little on the deck I could not refrain acquainting my governess with what had happened it was but just that she who was so really concerned for me should have part in my good fortune Besides I wanted her assistance to supply me with several necessaries which before I was shy of letting anybody see me have that it might not be public but now I had a cabin and room to set things in I ordered abundance of good things for our comfort in the voyage as brandy sugar lemons et cetera to make punch and treat our benefactor the captain and abundance of things for eating and drinking in the voyage also a larger bed and bedding proportioned to it so that in a word we resolved to want for nothing in the voyage All this while I had provided nothing for our assistance when we should come to the place and begin to call ourselves planters and I was far from being ignorant of what was needful on that occasion particularly all sorts of tools for the planter s work and for building and all kinds of furniture for our dwelling which if to be bought in the country must necessarily cost double the price So I discoursed that point with my governess and she went and waited upon the captain and told him that she hoped ways might be found out for her two unfortunate cousins as she called us to obtain our freedom when we came into the country and so entered into a discourse with him about the means and terms also of which I shall say more in its place and after thus sounding the captain she let him know though we were unhappy in the circumstances that occasioned our going yet that we were not unfurnished to set ourselves to work in the country and we resolved to settle and live there as planters if we might be put in a way how to do it The captain readily offered his assistance told her the method of entering upon such business and how easy nay how certain it was for industrious people to recover their fortunes in such a manner Madam says he tis no reproach to any many in that country to have been sent over in worse circumstances than I perceive your cousins are in provided they do but apply with diligence and good judgment to the business of that place when they come there She then inquired of him what things it was necessary we should carry over with us and he like a very honest as well as knowing man told her thus Madam your cousins in the first place must procure somebody to buy them as servants in conformity to the conditions of their transportation and then in the name of that person they may go about what they will they may either purchase some plantations already begun or they may purchase land of the Government of the country and begin where they please and both will be done reasonably She bespoke his favour in the first article which he promised to her to take upon himself and indeed faithfully performed it and as to the rest he promised to recommend us to such as should give us the best advice and not to impose upon us which was as much as could be desired She then asked him if it would not be necessary to furnish us with a stock of tools and materials for the business of planting and he said Yes by all means And then she begged his assistance in it She told him she would furnish us with everything that was convenient whatever it cost her He accordingly gave her a long particular of things necessary for a planter which by his account came to about fourscore or a hundred pounds And in short she went about as dexterously to buy them as if she had been an old Virginia merchant only that she bought by my direction above twice as much of everything as he had given her a list of These she put on board in her own name took his bills of loading for them and endorsed those bills of loading to my husband insuring the cargo afterwards in her own name by our order so that we were provided for all events and for all disasters I should have told you that my husband gave her all his whole stock of one hundred eight which as I have said he had about him in gold to lay out thus and I gave her a good sum besides so that I did not break into the stock which I had left in her hands at all but after we had sorted out our whole cargo we had yet near two hundred in money which was more than enough for our purpose In this condition very cheerful and indeed joyful at being so happily accommodated as we were we set sail from Bugby s Hole to Gravesend where the ship lay about ten more days and where the captain came on board for good and all Here the captain offered us a civility which indeed we had no reason to expect namely to let us go on shore and refresh ourselves upon giving our words in a solemn manner that we would not go from him and that we would return peaceably on board again This was such an evidence of his confidence in us that it overcame my husband who in a mere principle of gratitude told him as he could not be in any capacity to make a suitable return for such a favour so he could not think of accepting of it nor could he be easy that the captain should run such a risk After some mutual civilities I gave my husband a purse in which was eighty guineas and he put in into the captain s hand There captain says he there s part of a pledge for our fidelity if we deal dishonestly with you on any account tis your own And on this we went on shore Indeed the captain had assurance enough of our resolutions to go for that having made such provision to settle there it did not seem rational that we would choose to remain here at the expense and peril of life for such it must have been if we had been taken again In a word we went all on shore with the captain and supped together in Gravesend where we were very merry stayed all night lay at the house where we supped and came all very honestly on board again with him in the morning Here we bought ten dozen bottles of good beer some wine some fowls and such things as we thought might be acceptable on board My governess was with us all this while and went with us round into the Downs as did also the captain s wife with whom she went back I was never so sorrowful at parting with my own mother as I was at parting with her and I never saw her more We had a fair easterly wind sprung up the third day after we came to the Downs and we sailed from thence the tenth of April Nor did we touch any more at any place till being driven on the coast of Ireland by a very hard gale of wind the ship came to an anchor in a little bay near the mouth of a river whose name I remember not but they said the river came down from Limerick and that it was the largest river in Ireland Here being detained by bad weather for some time the captain who continued the same kind good humoured man as at first took us two on shore with him again He did it now in kindness to my husband indeed who bore the sea very ill and was very sick especially when it blew so hard Here we bought in again a store of fresh provisions especially beef pork mutton and fowls and the captain stayed to pickle up five or six barrels of beef to lengthen out the ship s store We were here not above five days when the weather turning mild and a fair wind we set sail again and in two and forty days came safe to the coast of Virginia When we drew near to the shore the captain called me to him and told me that he found by my discourse I had some relations in the place and that I had been there before and so he supposed I understood the custom in their disposing the convict prisoners when they arrived I told him I did not and that as to what relations I had in the place he might be sure I would make myself known to none of them while I was in the circumstances of a prisoner and that as to the rest we left ourselves entirely to him to assist us as he was pleased to promise us he would do He told me I must get somebody in the place to come and buy us as servants and who must answer for us to the governor of the country if he demanded us I told him we should do as he should direct so he brought a planter to treat with him as it were for the purchase of these two servants my husband and me and there we were formally sold to him and went ashore with him The captain went with us and carried us to a certain house whether it was to be called a tavern or not I know not but we had a bowl of punch there made of rum et cetera and were very merry After some time the planter gave us a certificate of discharge and an acknowledgment of having served him faithfully and we were free from him the next morning to go wither we would For this piece of service the captain demanded of us six thousand weight of tabacco which he said he was accountable for to his freighter and which we immediately bought for him and made him a present of twenty guineas besides with which he was abundantly satisfied It is not proper to enter here into the particulars of what part of the colony of Virginia we settled in for divers reasons it may suffice to mention that we went into the great river Potomac the ship being bound thither and there we intended to have settled first though afterwards we altered our minds The first thing I did of moment after having gotten all our goods on shore and placed them in a storehouse or warehouse which with a lodging we hired at the small place or village where we landed I say the first thing was to inquire after my mother and after my brother that fatal person whom I married as a husband as I have related at large A little inquiry furnished me with information that missus that is my mother was dead that my brother or husband was alive which I confess I was not very glad to hear but which was worse I found he was removed from the plantation where he lived formerly and where I lived with him and lived with one of his sons in a plantation just by the place where we landed and where we had hired a warehouse I was a little surprised at first but as I ventured to satisfy myself that he could not know me I was not only perfectly easy but had a great mind to see him if it was possible to so do without his seeing me In order to that I found out by inquiry the plantation where he lived and with a woman of that place whom I got to help me like what we call a chairwoman I rambled about towards the place as if I had only a mind to see the country and look about me At last I came so near that I saw the dwellinghouse I asked the woman whose plantation that was she said it belonged to such a man and looking out a little to our right hands there says she is the gentleman that owns the plantation and his father with him What are their Christian names said I I know not says she what the old gentleman s name is but the son s name is Humphrey and I believe says she the father s is so too You may guess if you can what a confused mixture of joy and fight possessed my thoughts upon this occasion for I immediately knew that this was nobody else but my own son by that father she showed me who was my own brother I had no mask but I ruffled my hood so about my face that I depended upon it that after above twenty years absence and withal not expecting anything of me in that part of the world he would not be able to know anything of me But I need not have used all that caution for the old gentleman was grown dim sighted by some distemper which had fallen upon his eyes and could but just see well enough to walk about and not run against a tree or into a ditch The woman that was with me had told me that by a mere accident knowing nothing of what importance it was to me As they drew near to us I said Does he know you missus Owen so they called the woman Yes said she if he hears me speak he will know me but he can t see well enough to know me or anybody else and so she told me the story of his sight as I have related This made me secure and so I threw open my hoods again and let them pass by me It was a wretched thing for a mother thus to see her own son a handsome comely young gentleman in flourishing circumstances and durst not make herself known to him and durst not take any notice of him Let any mother of children that reads this consider it and but think with what anguish of mind I restrained myself what yearnings of soul I had in me to embrace him and weep over him and how I thought all my entrails turned within me that my very bowels moved and I knew not what to do as I now know not how to express those agonies When he went from me I stood gazing and trembling and looking after him as long as I could see him then sitting down to rest me but turned from her and lying on my face wept and kissed the ground that he had set his foot on I could not conceal my disorder so much from the woman but that she perceived it and thought I was not well which I was obliged to pretend was true upon which she pressed me to rise the ground being damp and dangerous which I did accordingly and walked away As I was going back again and still talking of this gentleman and his son a new occasion of melancholy offered itself thus The woman began as if she would tell me a story to divert me There goes says she a very odd tale among the neighbours where this gentleman formerly live What was that said I Why says she that old gentleman going to England when he was a young man fell in love with a young lady there one of the finest women that ever was seen and married her and brought her over hither to his mother who was then living He lived here several years with her continued she and had several children by her of which the young gentleman that was with him now was one but after some time the old gentlewoman his mother talking to her of something relating to herself when she was in England and of her circumstances in England which were bad enough the daughter in law began to be very much surprised and uneasy and in short examining further into things it appeared past all contradiction that the old gentlewoman was her own mother and that consequently that son was his wife s own brother which struck the whole family with horror and put them into such confusion that it had almost ruined them all The young woman would not live with him the son her brother and husband for a time went distracted and at last the young woman went away for England and has never been heard of since It is easy to believe that I was strangely affected with this story but tis impossible to describe the nature of my disturbance I seemed astonished at the story and asked her a thousand questions about the particulars which I found she was thoroughly acquainted with At last I began to inquire into the circumstances of the family how the old gentlewoman I mean my mother died and how she left what she had for my mother had promised me very solemnly that when she died she would do something for me and leave it so as that if I was living I should one way or other come at it without its being in the power of her son my brother and husband to prevent it She told me she did not know exactly how it was ordered but she had been told that my mother had left a sum of money and had tied her plantation for the payment of it to be made good to the daughter if ever she could be heard of either in England or elsewhere and that the trust was left with this son who was the person that we saw with his father This was news too good for me to make light of and you may be sure filled my heart with a thousand thoughts what course I should take how and when and in what manner I should make myself known or whether I should ever make myself know or no Here was a perplexity that I had not indeed skill to manage myself in neither knew I what course to take It lay heavy upon my mind night and day I could neither sleep nor converse so that my husband perceived it and wondered what ailed me strove to divert me but it was all to no purpose He pressed me to tell him what it was troubled me but I put it off till at last importuning me continually I was forced to form a story which yet had a plain truth to lay it upon too I told him I was troubled because I found we must shift our quarters and alter our scheme of settling for that I found I should be known if I stayed in that part of the country for that my mother being dead several of my relations were come into that part where we then was and that I must either discover myself to them which in our present circumstances was not proper on many accounts or remove and which to do I knew not and that this it was that made me so melancholy and so thoughtful He joined with me in this that it was by no means proper for me to make myself known to anybody in the circumstances in which we then were and therefore he told me he would be willing to remove to any other part of the country or even to any other country if I thought fit But now I had another difficulty which was that if I removed to any other colony I put myself out of the way of ever making a due search after those effects which my mother had left Again I could never so much as think of breaking the secret of my former marriage to my new husband it was not a story as I thought that would bear telling nor could I tell what might be the consequences of it and it was impossible to search into the bottom of the thing without making it public all over the country as well who I was as what I now was also In this perplexity I continued a great while and this made my spouse very uneasy for he found me perplexed and yet thought I was not open with him and did not let him into every part of my grievance and he would often say he wondered what he had done that I would not trust him with whatever it was especially if it was grievous and afflicting The truth is he ought to have been trusted with everything for no man in the world could deserve better of a wife but this was a thing I knew not how to open to him and yet having nobody to disclose any part of it to the burthen was too heavy for my mind for let them say what they please of our sex not being able to keep a secret my life is a plain conviction to me of the contrary but be it our sex or the man s sex a secret of moment should always have a confidant a bosom friend to whom we may communicate the joy of it or the grief of it be it which it will or it will be a double weight upon the spirits and perhaps become even insupportable in itself and this I appeal to all human testimony for the truth of And this is the cause why many times men as well as women and men of the greatest and best qualities other ways yet have found themselves weak in this part and have not been able to bear the weight of a secret joy or of a secret sorrow but have been obliged to disclose it even for the mere giving vent to themselves and to unbend the mind oppressed with the load and weights which attended it Nor was this any token of folly or thoughtlessness at all but a natural consequence of the thing and such people had they struggled longer with the oppression would certainly have told it in their sleep and disclosed the secret let it have been of what fatal nature soever without regard to the person to whom it might be exposed This necessity of nature is a thing which works sometimes with such vehemence in the minds of those who are guilty of any atrocious villainy such as secret murder in particular that they have been obliged to discover it though the consequence would necessarily be their own destruction Now though it may be true that the divine justice ought to have the glory of all those discoveries and confessions yet tis as certain that Providence which ordinarily works by the hands of nature makes use here of the same natural causes to produce those extraordinary effects I could give several remarkable instances of this in my long conversation with crime and with criminals I knew one fellow that while I was in prison in Newgate was one of those they called then night fliers I know not what other word they may have understood it by since but he was one who by connivance was admitted to go abroad every evening when he played his pranks and furnished those honest people they call thief catchers with business to find out the next day and restore for a reward what they had stolen the evening before This fellow was as sure to tell in his sleep all that he had done and every step he had taken what he had stolen and where as sure as if he had engaged to tell it waking and that there was no harm or danger in it and therefore he was obliged after he had been out to lock himself up or be locked up by some of the keepers that had him in fee that nobody should hear him but on the other hand if he had told all the particulars and given a full account of his rambles and success to any comrade any brother thief or to his employers as I may justly call them then all was well with him and he slept as quietly as other people As the publishing this account of my life is for the sake of the just moral of very part of it and for instruction caution warning and improvement to every reader so this will not pass I hope for an unnecessary digression concerning some people being obliged to disclose the greatest secrets either of their own or other people s affairs Under the certain oppression of this weight upon my mind I laboured in the case I have been naming and the only relief I found for it was to let my husband into so much of it as I thought would convince him of the necessity there was for us to think of settling in some other part of the world and the next consideration before us was which part of the English settlements we should go to My husband was a perfect stranger to the country and had not yet so much as a geographical knowledge of the situation of the several places and I that till I wrote this did not know what the word geographical signified had only a general knowledge from long conversation with people that came from or went to several places but this I knew that Maryland Pennsylvania East and West Jersey New York and New England lay all north of Virginia and that they were consequently all colder climates to which for that very reason I had an aversion For that as I naturally loved warm weather so now I grew into years I had a stronger inclination to shun a cold climate I therefore considered of going to Caroline which is the only southern colony of the English on the continent of America and hither I proposed to go and the rather because I might with great ease come from thence at any time when it might be proper to inquire after my mother s effects and to make myself known enough to demand them With this resolution I proposed to my husband our going away from where we was and carrying all our effects with us to Caroline where we resolved to settle for my husband readily agreed to the first part viz that was not at all proper to stay where we was since I had assured him we should be known there and the rest I effectually concealed from him But now I found a new difficulty upon me The main affair grew heavy upon my mind still and I could not think of going out of the country without somehow or other making inquiry into the grand affair of what my mother had done for me nor could I with any patience bear the thought of going away and not make myself known to my old husband brother or to my child his son only I would fain have had this done without my new husband having any knowledge of it or they having any knowledge of him or that I had such a thing as a husband I cast about innumerable ways in my thoughts how this might be done I would gladly have sent my husband away to Caroline with all our goods and have come after myself but this was impracticable he would never stir without me being himself perfectly unacquainted with the country and with the methods of settling there or anywhere else Then I thought we would both go first with part of our goods and that when we were settled I should come back to Virginia and fetch the remainder but even then I knew he would never part with me and be left there to go on alone The case was plain he was bred a gentleman and by consequence was not only unacquainted but indolent and when we did settle would much rather go out into the woods with his gun which they call there hunting and which is the ordinary work of the Indians and which they do as servants I say he would rather do that than attend the natural business of his plantation These were therefore difficulties insurmountable and such as I knew not what to do in I had such strong impressions on my mind about discovering myself to my brother formerly my husband that I could not withstand them and the rather because it ran constantly in my thoughts that if I did not do it while he lived I might in vain endeavour to convince my son afterward that I was really the same person and that I was his mother and so might both lose the assistance and comfort of the relation and the benefit of whatever it was my mother had left me and yet on the other hand I could never think it proper to discover myself to them in the circumstances I was in as well relating to the having a husband with me as to my being brought over by a legal transportation as a criminal on both which accounts it was absolutely necessary to me to remove from the place where I was and come again to him as from another place and in another figure Upon those considerations I went on with telling my husband the absolute necessity there was of our not settling in Potomac River at least that we should be presently made public there whereas if we went to any other place in the world we should come in with as much reputation as any family that came to plant that as it was always agreeable to the inhabitants to have families come among them to plant who brought substance with them either to purchase plantations or begin new ones so we should be sure of a kind agreeable reception and that without any possibility of a discovery of our circumstances I told him in general too that as I had several relations in the place where we were and that I durst not now let myself be known to them because they would soon come into a knowledge of the occasion and reason of my coming over which would be to expose myself to the last degree so I had reason to believe that my mother who died here had left me something and perhaps considerable which it might be very well worth my while to inquire after but that this too could not be done without exposing us publicly unless we went from hence and then wherever we settled I might come as it were to visit and to see my brother and nephews make myself known to them claim and inquire after what was my due be received with respect and at the same time have justice done me with cheerfulness and good will whereas if I did it now I could expect nothing but with trouble such as exacting it by force receiving it with curses and reluctance and with all kinds of affronts which he would not perhaps bear to see that in case of being obliged to legal proofs of being really her daughter I might be at loss be obliged to have recourse to England and it may be to fail at last and so lose it whatever it might be With these arguments and having thus acquainted my husband with the whole secret so far as was needful of him we resolved to go and seek a settlement in some other colony and at first thoughts Caroline was the place we pitched upon In order to this we began to make inquiry for vessels going to Carolina and in a very little while got information that on the other side the bay as they call it namely in Maryland there was a ship which came from Carolina laden with rice and other goods and was going back again thither and from thence to Jamaica with provisions On this news we hired a sloop to take in our goods and taking as it were a final farewell of Potomac River we went with all our cargo over to Maryland This was a long and unpleasant voyage and my spouse said it was worse to him than all the voyage from England because the weather was but indifferent the water rough and the vessel small and inconvenient In the next place we were full a hundred miles up Potomac River in a part which they call Westmoreland County and as that river is by far the greatest in Virginia and I have heard say it is the greatest river in the world that falls into another river and not directly into the sea so we had base weather in it and were frequently in great danger for though we were in the middle we could not see land on either side for many leagues together Then we had the great river or bay of Chesapeake to cross which is where the river Potomac falls into it near thirty miles broad and we entered more great vast waters whose names I know not so that our voyage was full two hundred miles in a poor sorry sloop with all our treasure and if any accident had happened to us we might at last have been very miserable supposing we had lost our goods and saved our lives only and had then been left naked and destitute and in a wild strange place not having one friend or acquaintance in all that part of the world The very thought of it gives me some horror even since the danger is past Well we came to the place in five days sailing I think they call it Philip s Point and behold when we came thither the ship bound to Carolina was loaded and gone away but three days before This was a disappointment but however I that was to be discouraged with nothing told my husband that since we could not get passage to Caroline and that the country we was in was very fertile and good we would if he liked of it see if we could find out anything for our tune where we was and that if he liked things we would settle here We immediately went on shore but found no conveniences just at that place either for our being on shore or preserving our goods on shore but was directed by a very honest Quaker whom we found there to go to a place about sixty miles east that is to say nearer the mouth of the bay where he said he lived and where we should be accommodated either to plant or to wait for any other place to plant in that might be more convenient and he invited us with so much kindness and simple honesty that we agreed to go and the Quaker himself went with us Here we bought us two servants viz an English woman servant just come on shore from a ship of Liverpool and a Negro man servant things absolutely necessary for all people that pretended to settle in that country This honest Quaker was very helpful to us and when we came to the place that he proposed to us found us out a convenient storehouse for our goods and lodging for ourselves and our servants and about two months or thereabouts afterwards by his direction we took up a large piece of land from the governor of that country in order to form our plantation and so we laid the thoughts of going to Caroline wholly aside having been very well received here and accommodated with a convenient lodging till we could prepare things and have land enough cleared and timber and materials provided for building us a house all which we managed by the direction of the Quaker so that in one year s time we had nearly fifty acres of land cleared part of it enclosed and some of it planted with tabacco though not much besides we had garden ground and corn sufficient to help supply our servants with roots and herbs and bread And now I persuaded my husband to let me go over the bay again and inquire after my friends He was the willinger to consent to it now because he had business upon his hands sufficient to employ him besides his gun to divert him which they call hunting there and which he greatly delighted in and indeed we used to look at one another sometimes with a great deal of pleasure reflecting how much better that was not than Newgate only but than the most prosperous of our circumstances in the wicked trade that we had been both carrying on Our affair was in a very good posture we purchased of the proprietors of the colony as much land for thirty five paid in ready money as would make a sufficient plantation to employ between fifty and sixty servants and which being well improved would be sufficient to us as long as we could either of us live and as for children I was past the prospect of anything of that kind But out good fortune did not end here I went as I have said over the bay to the place where my brother once a husband lived but I did not go to the same village where I was before but went up another great river on the east side of the river Potomac called Rappahannock River and by this means came on the back of his plantation which was large and by the help of a navigable creek or little river that ran into the Rappahannock I came very near it I was now fully resolved to go up point blank to my brother husband and to tell him who I was but not knowing what temper I might find him in or how much out of temper rather I might make him by such a rash visit I resolved to write a letter to him first to let him know who I was and that I was come not to give him any trouble upon the old relation which I hoped was entirely forgot but that I applied to him as a sister to a brother desiring his assistance in the case of that provision which our mother at her decease had left for my support and which I did not doubt but he would do me justice in especially considering that I was come thus far to look after it I said some very tender kind things in the letter about his son which I told him he knew to be my own child and that as I was guilty of nothing in marrying him any more than he was in marrying me neither of us having then known our being at all related to one another so I hoped he would allow me the most passionate desire of once seeing my one and only child and of showing something of the infirmities of a mother in preserving a violent affect for him who had never been able to retain any thought of me one way or other I did believe that having received this letter he would immediately give it to his son to read I having understood his eyes being so dim that he could not see to read it but it fell out better than so for as his sight was dim so he had allowed his son to open all letters that came to his hand for him and the old gentleman being from home or out of the way when my messenger came my letter came directly to my son s hand and he opened and read it He called the messenger in after some little stay and asked him where the person was who gave him the letter The messenger told him the place which was about seven miles off so he bid him stay and ordering a horse to be got ready and two servants away he came to me with the messenger Let any one judge the consternation I was in when my messenger came back and told me the old gentleman was not at home but his son was come along with him and was just coming up to me I was perfectly confounded for I knew not whether it was peace or war nor could I tell how to behave however I had but a very few moments to think for my son was at the heels of the messenger and coming up into my lodgings asked the fellow at the door something I suppose it was for I did not hear it so as to understand it which was the gentlewoman that sent him for the messenger said There she is sir at which he comes directly up to me kisses me took me in his arms and embraced me with so much passion that he could not speak but I could feel his breast heave and throb like a child that cries but sobs and cannot cry it out I can neither express nor describe the joy that touched my very soul when I found for it was easy to discover that part that he came not as a stranger but as a son to a mother and indeed as a son who had never before known what a mother of his own was in short we cried over one another a considerable while when at last he broke out first My dear mother says he are you still alive I never expected to have seen your face As for me I could say nothing a great while After we had both recovered ourselves a little and were able to talk he told me how things stood As to what I had written to his father he told me he had not showed my letter to his father or told him anything about it that what his grandmother left me was in his hands and that he would do me justice to my full satisfaction that as to his father he was old and infirm both in body and mind that he was very fretful and passionate almost blind and capable of nothing and he questioned whether he would know how to act in an affair which was of so nice a nature as this and that therefore he had come himself as well to satisfy himself in seeing me which he could not restrain himself from as also to put it into my power to make a judgment after I had seen how things were whether I would discover myself to his father or no This was really so prudently and wisely managed that I found my son was a man of sense and needed no direction from me I told him I did not wonder that his father was as he had described him for that his head was a little touched before I went away and principally his disturbance was because I could not be persuaded to conceal our relation and to live with him as my husband after I knew that he was my brother that as he knew better than I what his father s present condition was I should readily join with him in such measure as he would direct that I was indifferent as to seeing his father since I had seen him first and he could not have told me better news than to tell me that what his grandmother had left me was entrusted in his hands who I doubted not now he knew who I was would as he said do me justice I inquired then how long my mother had been dead and where she died and told so many particulars of the family that I left him no room to doubt the truth of my being really and truly his mother My son then inquired where I was and how I had disposed myself I told him I was on the Maryland side of the bay at the plantation of a particular friend who came from England in the same ship with me that as for that side of the bay where he was I had no habitation He told me I should go home with him and live with him if I pleased as long as I lived that as to his father he knew nobody and would never so much as guess at me I considered of that a little and told him that though it was really no concern to me to live at a distance from him yet I could not say it would be the most comfortable thing in the world to me to live in the house with him and to have that unhappy object always before me which had been such a blow to my peace before that though I should be glad to have his company my son or to be as near him as possible while I stayed yet I could not think of being in the house where I should be also under constant restraint for fear of betraying myself in my discourse nor should I be able to refrain some expressions in my conversing with him as my son that might discover the whole affair which would by no means be convenient He acknowledged that I was right in all this But then dear mother says he you shall be as near me as you can So he took me with him on horseback to a plantation next to his own and where I was as well entertained as I could have been in his own Having left me there he went away home telling me we would talk of the main business the next day and having first called me his aunt and given a charge to the people who it seems were his tenants to treat me with all possible respect About two hours after he was gone he sent me a maid servant and a Negro boy to wait on me and provisions ready dressed for my supper and thus I was as if I had been in a new world and began secretly now to wish that I had not brought my Lancashire husband from England at all However that wish was not hearty neither for I loved my Lancashire husband entirely as indeed I had ever done from the beginning and he merited from me as much as it was possible for a man to do but that by the way The next morning my son came to visit me again almost as soon as I was up After a little discourse he first of all pulled out a deerskin bag and gave it me with five and fifty Spanish pistoles in it and told me that was to supply my expenses from England for though it was not his business to inquire yet he ought to think I did not bring a great deal of money out with me it not being usual to bring much money into that country Then he pulled out his grandmother s will and read it over to me whereby it appeared that she had left a small plantation as he called it on York River that is where my mother lived to me with the stock of servants and cattle upon it and given it in trust to this son of mine for my use whenever he should hear of my being alive and to my heirs if I had any children and in default of heirs to whomsoever I should by will dispose of it but gave the income of it till I should be heard of or found to my said son and if I should not be living then it was to him and his heirs This plantation though remote from him he said he did not let out but managed it by a head clerk steward as he did another that was his father s that lay hard by it and went over himself three or four times a year to look after it I asked him what he thought the plantation might be worth He said if I would let it out he would give me about sixty a year for it but if I would live on it then it would be worth much more and he believed would bring me in about one hundred fifty a year But seeing I was likely either to settle on the other side of the bay or might perhaps have a mind to go back to England again if I would let him be my steward he would manage it for me as he had done for himself and that he believed he should be able to send me as much tobacco to England from it as would yield me about one hundred a year sometimes more This was all strange news to me and things I had not been used to and really my heart began to look up more seriously than I think it ever did before and to look with great thankfulness to the hand of Providence which had done such wonders for me who had been myself the greatest wonder of wickedness perhaps that had been suffered to live in the world And I must again observe that not on this occasion only but even on all other occasions of thankfulness my past wicked and abominable life never looked so monstrous to me and I never so completely abhorred it and reproached myself with it as when I had a sense upon me of Providence doing good to me while I had been making those vile returns on my part But I leave the reader to improve these thoughts as no doubt they will see cause and I go on to the fact My son s tender carriage and kind offers fetched tears from me almost all the while he talked with me Indeed I could scarce discourse with him but in the intervals of my passion however at length I began and expressing myself with wonder at my being so happy to have the trust of what I had left put into the hands of my own child I told him that as to the inheritance of it I had no child but him in the world and was now past having any if I should marry and therefore would desire him to get a writing drawn which I was ready to execute by which I would after me give it wholly to him and to his heirs And in the meantime smiling I asked him what made him continue a bachelor so long His answer was kind and ready that Virginia did not yield any great plenty of wives and that since I talked of going back to England I should send him a wife from London This was the substance of our first day s conversation the pleasantest day that ever passed over my head in my life and which gave me the truest satisfaction He came every day after this and spent a great part of his time with me and carried me about to several of his friends houses where I was entertained with great respect Also I dined several times at his own house when he took care always to see his half dead father so out of the way that I never saw him or he me I made him one present and it was all I had of value and that was one of the gold watches of which I mentioned above that I had two in my chest and this I happened to have with me and I gave it him at his third visit I told him I had nothing of any value to bestow but that and I desired he would now and then kiss it for my sake I did not indeed tell him that I had stole it from a gentlewoman s side at a meeting house in London That s by the way He stood a little while hesitating as if doubtful whether to take it or no but I pressed it on him and made him accept it and it was not much less worth than his leather pouch full of Spanish gold no though it were to be reckoned as if at London whereas it was worth twice as much there where I gave it him At length he took it kissed it told me the watch should be a debt upon him that he would be paying as long as I lived A few days after he brought the writings of gift and the scrivener with them and I signed them very freely and delivered them to him with a hundred kisses for sure nothing ever passed between a mother and a tender dutiful child with more affection The next day he brings me an obligation under his hand and seal whereby he engaged himself to manage and improve the plantation for my account and with his utmost skill and to remit the produce to my order wherever I should be and withal to be obliged himself to make up the produce one hundred a year to me When he had done so he told me that as I came to demand it before the crop was off I had a right to produce of the current year and so he paid me one hundred in Spanish pieces of eight and desired me to give him a receipt for it as in full for that year ending at Christmas following this being about the latter end of August I stayed here about five weeks and indeed had much ado to get away then Nay he would have come over the bay with me but I would by no means allow him to it However he would send me over in a sloop of his own which was built like a yacht and served him as well for pleasure as business This I accepted of and so after the utmost expressions both of duty and affection he let me come away and I arrived safe in two days at my friend s the Quaker s I brought over with me for the use of our plantation three horses with harness and saddles some hogs two cows and a thousand other things the gift of the kindest and tenderest child that ever woman had I related to my husband all the particulars of this voyage except that I called my son my cousin and first I told him that I had lost my watch which he seemed to take as a misfortune but then I told him how kind my cousin had been that my mother had left me such a plantation and that he had preserved it for me in hopes some time or other he should hear from me then I told him that I had left it to his management that he would render me a faithful account of its produce and then I pulled him out the one hundred in silver as the first year s produce and then pulling out the deerskin purse with the pistoles And here my dear says I is the gold watch My husband so is Heaven s goodness sure to work the same effects in all sensible minds where mercies touch the heart lifted up both hands and with an ecstacy of joy What is God a doing says he for such an ungrateful dog as I am Then I let him know what I had brought over in the sloop besides all this I mean the horses hogs and cows and other stores for our plantation all which added to his surprise and filled his heart with thankfulness and from this time forward I believe he was as sincere a penitent and as thoroughly a reformed man as ever God s goodness brought back from a profligate a highwayman and a robber I could fill a larger history than this with the evidence of this truth and but that I doubt that part of the story will not be equally diverting as the wicked part I have had thoughts of making a volume of it by itself As for myself as this is to be my own story not my husband s I return to that part which related to myself We went on with our plantation and managed it with the help and diversion of such friends as we got there by our obliging behaviour and especially the honest Quaker who proved a faithful generous and steady friend to us and we had very good success for having a flourishing stock to begin with as I have said and this being now increased by the addition of one hundred fifty sterling in money we enlarged our number of servants built us a very good house and cured every year a great deal of land The second year I wrote to my old governess giving her part with us of the joy of our success and order her how to lay out the money I had left with her which was two hundred fifty as above and to send it to us in goods which she performed with her usual kindness and fidelity and this arrived safe to us Here we had a supply of all sorts of clothes as well for my husband as for myself and I took especial care to buy for him all those things that I knew he delighted to have as two good long wigs two silver hilted swords three or four fine fowling pieces a fine saddle with holsters and pistols very handsome with a scarlet cloak and in a word everything I could think of to oblige him and to make him appear as he really was a very fine gentleman I ordered a good quantity of such household stuff as we yet wanted with linen of all sorts for us both As for myself I wanted very little of clothes or linen being very well furnished before The rest of my cargo consisted in iron work of all sorts harness for horses tools clothes for servants and woollen cloth stuffs serges stockings shoes hats and the like such as servants wear and whole pieces also to make up for servants all by direction of the Quaker and all this cargo arrived safe and in good condition with three woman servants lusty wenches which my old governess had picked for me suitable enough to the place and to the work we had for them to do one of which happened to come double having been got with child by one of the seamen in the ship as she owned afterwards before the ship got so far as Gravesend so she brought us a stout boy about seven months after her landing My husband you may suppose was a little surprised at the arriving of all this cargo from England and talking with me after he saw the account of this particular My dear says he what is the meaning of all this I fear you will run us too deep in debt when shall we be able to make return for it all I smiled and told him that is was all paid for and then I told him that what our circumstances might expose us to I had not taken my whole stock with me that I had reserved so much in my friend s hands which now we were come over safe and was settled in a way to live I had sent for as he might see He was amazed and stood a while telling upon his fingers but said nothing At last he began thus Hold let s see says he telling upon his fingers still and first on his thumb there s two hundred forty six in money at first then two gold watches diamond rings and plate says he upon the forefinger Then upon the next finger Here s a plantation on York River one hundred a year then one hundred fifty in money then a sloop load of horses cows hogs and stores and so on to the thumb again And now says he a cargo cost two hundred fifty in England and worth here twice the money Well says I what do you make of all that Make of it says he why who says I was deceived when I married a wife in Lancashire I think I have married a fortune and a very good fortune too says he In a word we were now in very considerable circumstances and every year increasing for our new plantation grew upon our hands insensibly and in eight years which we lived upon it we brought it to such pitch that the produce was at least three hundred sterling a year I mean worth so much in England After I had been a year at home again I went over the bay to see my son and to receive another year s income of my plantation and I was surprised to hear just at my landing there that my old husband was dead and had not been buried above a fortnight This I confess was not disagreeable news because now I could appear as I was in a married condition so I told my son before I came from him that I believed I should marry a gentleman who had a plantation near mine and though I was legally free to marry as to any obligation that was on me before yet that I was shy of it lest the blot should some time or other be revived and it might make a husband uneasy My son the same kind dutiful and obliging creature as ever treated me now at his own house paid me my hundred pounds and sent me home again loaded with presents Some time after this I let my son know I was married and invited him over to see us and my husband wrote a very obliging letter to him also inviting him to come and see him and he came accordingly some months after and happened to be there just when my cargo from England came in which I let him believe belonged all to my husband s estate not to me It must be observed that when the old wretch my brother husband was dead I then freely gave my husband an account of all that affair and of this cousin as I had called him before being my own son by that mistaken unhappy match He was perfectly easy in the account and told me he should have been as easy if the old man as we called him had been alive For said he it was no fault of yours nor of his it was a mistake impossible to be prevented He only reproached him with desiring me to conceal it and to live with him as a wife after I knew that he was my brother that he said was a vile part Thus all these difficulties were made easy and we lived together with the greatest kindness and comfort imaginable We are grown old I am come back to England being almost seventy years of age husband sixty eight having performed much more than the limited terms of my transportation and now notwithstanding all the fatigues and all the miseries we have both gone through we are both of us in good heart and health My husband remained there some time after me to settle our affairs and at first I had intended to go back to him but at his desire I altered that resolution and he is come over to England also where we resolve to spend the remainder of our years in sincere penitence for the wicked lives we have lived WRITTEN IN
