Moynihan Aaron Cannon Charles Franks and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life by Homer Eon Flint PART I THE DISCOVERY I THE SKY CUBE The doctor who was easily the most musical of the four men sang in a cheerful baritone The owl and the pussy cat went to sea In a beautiful pea green boat The geologist who had held down the lower end of a quartet in his university days growled an accompaniment under his breath as he blithely peeled the potatoes Occasionally a high pitched note or two came from the direction of the engineer he could not spare much wind while clambering about the machinery oil can in hand The architect alone ignored the famous tune What I can t understand Smith he insisted is how you draw the electricity from the ether into this car without blasting us all to cinders The engineer squinted through an opal glass shutter into one of the tunnels through which the anti gravitation current was pouring If you didn t know any more about buildings than you do about machinery Jackson he grunted because of his squatting position I d hate to live in one of your houses The architect smiled grimly You re living in one of em right now Smith said he that is if you call this car a house Smith straightened up He was an unimportant looking man of medium height and build and bearing a mild good humored expression Nobody would ever look at him twice would ever guess that his skull concealed an unusually complete knowledge of electricity mechanisms and such practical matters I told you yesterday Jackson he said that the air surrounding the earth is chock full of electricity And And that the higher we go the more juice added the other remembering As much as to say that it is the atmosphere then that protects the earth from the surrounding voltage The engineer nodded Occasionally it breaks through anyhow in the form of lightning Now in order to control that current and prevent it from turning this machine and us into ashes all we do is to pass the juice through a cylinder of highly compressed air fixed in this wall By varying the pressure and dampness within the cylinder we can regulate the flow The builder nodded rapidly All right But why doesn t the electricity affect the walls themselves I thought they were made of steel The engineer glanced through the dead light at the reddish disk of the Earth hazy and indistinct at a distance of forty million miles It isn t steel it s a non magnetic alloy Besides there s a layer of crystalline sulphur between the alloy and the vacuum space The vacuum is what keeps out the cold isn t it Jackson knew but he asked in order to learn more Keeps out the sun s heat too The outer shell is pretty blamed hot on that side just as hot as it is cold on the shady side Smith seated himself beside a huge electrical machine a rotary converter which he next indicated with a jerk of his thumb But you don t want to forget that the juice outside is no use to us the way it is We have to change it It s neither positive nor negative it s just neutral So we separate it into two parts and all we have to do when we want to get away from the earth or any other magnetic sphere is to aim a bunch of positive current at the corresponding pole of the planet or negative current at the other pole Like poles repel you know Listens easy commented Jackson Too easy Well it isn t exactly as simple as all that Takes a lot of apparatus all told and the engineer looked about the room his glance resting fondly on his beloved machinery The big room fifty feet square was almost filled with machines some reached nearly to the ceiling the same distance above In fact the interior of the cube as that form of sky car was known had very little waste space The living quarters of the four men who occupied it had to be fitted in wherever there happened to be room The architect s own berth was sandwiched in between two huge dynamos He was thinking hard I see now why you have such a lot of adjustments for those tunnels meaning the six square tubes which opened into the ether through the six walls of the room You ve got to point the juice pretty accurately I should say so Smith led the way to a window and the two shaded their eyes from the lights within while they gazed at the ashy glow of Mercury toward which they were traveling I ve got to adjust the current so as to point exactly toward his northern half Smith might have added that a continual stream of repelling current was still directed toward the earth and another toward the sun away over to their right both to prevent being drawn off their course And how fast are we going Four or five times as fast as mother earth between eighty and ninety miles per second It s easy to get up speed out here of course where there s no air resistance Another voice broke in The geologist had finished his potatoes and a savory smell was already issuing from the frying pan Years spent in the wilderness had made the geologist a good cook and doubly welcome as a member of the expedition We ought to get there tomorrow then he said eagerly Indoor life did not appeal to him even under such exciting circumstances He peered at Mercury through his binoculars Beginning to show up fine now The builder improved upon Van Emmon s example by setting up the car s biggest telescope a four inch tube of unusual excellence All three pronounced the planet which was three fourths full as they viewed it as having pretty much the appearance of the moon Wonder why there s always been so much mystery about Mercury pondered the architect invitingly Looks as though the big five foot telescope on Mt Wilson would have shown everything Ask doc suggested Smith diplomatically Jackson turned and hailed the little man on the other side of the car He looked up absently from the scientific apparatus with which he had been making a test of the room s chemically purified air then he stepped to the oxygen tanks and closed the flow a trifle referring to his figures in the severely exact manner of his craft He crossed to the group Mercury is so close to the sun he answered the architect s question he s always been hard to observe For a long time the astronomers couldn t even agree that he always keeps the same face toward the sun like the moon toward the earth Then his day is as long as his year Eighty eight of our days yes Continual sunlight He can t be inhabited then The architect knew very little about the planets He had been included in the party because along with his professional knowledge he possessed remarkable ability as an amateur antiquarian He knew as much about the doings of the ancients as the average man knows of baseball doctor Kinney shook his head Not at present certainly Instantly Jackson was alert Then perhaps there were people there at one time Why not the doctor put it lightly There s little or no atmosphere there now of course but that s not saying there never has been Even if he is such a little planet less than three thousand smaller than the moon he must have had plenty of air and water at one time the same as the Earth What s become of the air Van Emmon wanted to know Kinney eyed him in reproach He said You ought to know Mercury has only two fifths as much gravitation as the earth a man weighing a hundred and fifty back home would be only a sixty pounder there And you can t expect stuff as light as air to stay forever on a planet with no more pull than that when the sun is on the job only thirty six millions miles away About a third as far as from the Earth to the sun commented the engineer By George it must be hot On the sunlit side yes said Kinney On the dark side it is as cold as space itself four hundred and sixty below Fahrenheit They considered this in silence for some minutes The builder went to another window and looked at Venus at that time about sixty million miles distant on the far side of the sun They were intending to visit Earth s twin sister on their return After a while he came back to the group ready with another question If Mercury ever was inhabited then his day wasn t as long as it is now was it No said the doctor In all probability he once had a day the same length as ours Mercury is a comparatively old planet you know being smaller he cooled off earlier than the earth and has been more affected by the pull of the sun But it s been a mighty long time since he had a day like ours before the earth was cool enough to live on probably But since Mercury was made out of the same batch of material prompted the geologist No reason then why life shouldn t have existed there in the past exclaimed the architect his eyes sparkling with the instinct of the born antiquarian He glanced up eagerly as the doctor coughed apologetically and said Don t forget that even if Mercury is part baked and part frozen there must be a region in between which is neither He picked up a small globe from the table and ran a finger completely around it from pole to pole So There must be a narrow band of country where the sun is only partly above the horizon and where the climate is temperate Then the architect almost shouted in his excitement an excitement only slightly greater than that of the other two then if there were people on Mercury at one time The doctor nodded gravely There may be some there now II A DEAD CITY From a height of a few thousand miles Mercury at first glance strongly reminded them of the moon The general effect was the same leaden disk with slight prominences here and there on the circumference and large irregular splotches of a darkish shade relieved by a great many brilliantly lighted areas lines and spots A second glance however found a marked difference Instead of the craters which always distinguished the moon Mercury showed ranges of bona fide mountains The doctor gave a sigh of regret mixed with a generous amount of excitement Too bad those mountains weren t distinguishable from the earth he complained We wouldn t have been so quick to brand Mercury a dead world The others were too engrossed to comment The sky car was rapidly sinking nearer and nearer the planet already Smith had stopped the current with which he had attracted the cube toward the little world s northern hemisphere and was now using negative voltage This in order to act as a brake and prevent them from falling to destruction Suddenly Van Emmon the geologist whose eyes had been glued to his binoculars gave an exclamation of wonder Look at those faults He pointed toward a region south of that for which they were bound what might be called the planet s torrid zone At first it was hard to see then little by little there unfolded before their eyes a giant spiderlike system of chasms in the strange surface beneath them From a point almost directly opposite the sun these cracks radiated in a half dozen different directions vast irregular clefts they ran through mountain and plain alike In places they must have been hundreds of miles wide while there was no guessing as to their depth For all that the four in the cube could see they were bottomless Small likelihood of anybody being alive there now commented the geologist skeptically If the sun has dried it out enough to produce faults like that how could animal life exist Notice however prompted the doctor that the cracks do not extend all the way to the edge of the disk This was true all the great chasms ended far short of the twilight band which the doctor had declared might still contain life But as the sky car rushed downward their attention became fixed upon the surface directly beneath them a point whose latitude corresponded roughly with that of New York on the Earth It was a region of low lying mountains decidedly different from various precipitous ranges to be seen to the north and east On the west or left hand side of this district a comparatively level stretch with an occasional peak or two projecting suggested the ancient bed of an ocean By this time they were within a thousand miles Smith threw on a little more current their speed diminished to a safer point and they scanned the approaching surface with the greatest of care The architect who was a New Yorker was strongly reminded of the fall aspect of the Appalachians but Van Emmon who was born and raised on the Pacific coast declared that the spot was almost exactly like the region north of San Francisco If I didn t know where I was he declared I d be trying to locate Eureka right now The engineer smiled tolerantly He had spent several years in Scotland and he felt sure he obligingly told the others that this new locality was far more like the Ben Lomond country than any other spot on earth He was so positive he made the doctor a New Zealander smile quite broadly It is just like the hills near my home he stated with an air of finality which made further discussion useless There s a river the architect suddenly exclaimed pointing then added before the others could comment I mean what was once a river They saw that he was right an irregular but well defined streak of sandy hue trickled down the middle of their chosen destination a long L shaped valley surrounded by low hills That s the most likely place outside of the twilight zone for life to be found remarked the doctor Neither mountainous nor dead level He added The spectroscope has plainly shown that there s water vapor in what little air there is Must be precious little If the air was as humid as the earth s we couldn t see the surface at all from this height The inviting looking valley was now less than a hundred miles below Inviting however only in outline in color it was a grayish buff scorched and forbidding The hills were yellower and an alkali white on their summits Do either of you fellows see anything GREEN demanded the engineer a little later They were silent each had noticed long before that not even near the poles was there the slightest sign of vegetation No chance unless there s foliage muttered the doctor half to himself The builder asked what he meant He explained So far as we know all animal life depends upon vegetation for its oxygen Not only the oxygen in the air but that stored in the plants which animals eat Unless there s greenery He paused at a low exclamation from Smith The engineer s eyes were fixed in wonder and excitement upon that part of the valley which lay at the joint of the L below them It was perhaps six miles across and all over the comparatively smooth surface jutted dark projections Viewed through the glasses they had a regular uniform appearance By Jove ejaculated the doctor almost in awe He leaned forward and scrubbed the dead light for the tenth time All four men strained their eyes to see It was the architect who broke the silence which followed The other three were content to let the thrill of the thing have its way with them Such a feeling had little weight with the expert in archeology Well he declared jubilantly in his boyish voice either I eat my hat or that s a genuine bona fide city As swiftly as an elevator drops and as safely the cube shot straight downward Every second the landscape narrowed and shrunk leaving the remaining details larger clearer sharper Bit by bit the amazing thing below them resolved itself into a real metropolis Within five minutes they were less than a mile above it Smith threw on more current so that the descent stopped and the cube hung motionless in space For another five minutes the four men studied the scene in nervous silence Each knew that the others were looking for the same thing some sign of life A little spot of green or possibly something in motion a single whiff of smoke would have been enough to cause a whoop of joy But nobody shouted There was nothing to shout about Nowhere in all that locality apparently was there the slightest indication that any save themselves were alive Instead the most extraordinary city that man had ever laid eyes upon was stretched directly beneath It was grouped about what seemed to be the meeting point of three great roads which led to this spot from as many passes through the surrounding hills And the city seemed thus naturally divided into three segments of equal size and shape and each with its own street system For they undoubtedly were streets No metropolis on earth ever had its blocks laid out with such unvarying exactness This Mercurian city contained none but perfect equilateral triangles and the streets themselves were of absolutely uniform width The buildings however showed no such uniformity On the outskirts of this brilliantly tan mystery the blocks seemed to contain nothing save odd heaps of dingy sun baked mud On the extreme north however lay five blocks grouped together whose buildings like those in the middle of the city were rather tall square cut and of the same dusty cream white hue Down town were several structures especially prominent for their height They towered to such an extent in fact that their upper windows were easily made out Apparently they were hundreds of stories high Here and there on the streets could be seen small spots colored a darker buff than the rest of that dazzling landscape But not one of the spots was moving We ll go down further said the engineer tentatively in a low tone There was no comment He gradually reduced the repelling current so that the sky car resumed its descent They sank down until they were on a level with the top of one of those extraordinary sky scrapers The roof seemed perfectly flat except for a large round black opening in its center No one was in sight When opposite the upper row of windows at a distance of perhaps twenty feet Smith brought the car to a halt and they peered in There were no panes the windows opened directly into a vast room but nothing was clearly visible in the blackness save the outlines of the opening in the opposite walls They went down further keeping well to the middle of the space above the street At every other yard they kept a sharp lookout for the inhabitants but so far as they could see their approach was entirely unobserved When within fifty yards of the surface all four men made a search for cross wires below They saw none there were no poles even Neither to their astonishment was there such a thing as a sidewalk The street stretched unbroken by curbing from wall to wall and from corner to corner As the cube settled slowly to the ground the adventurers left the deadlight to use the windows For a moment the view was obscured by a swirl of dust raised by the spurt of the current then this cloud vanished settling to the ground with astounding suddenness as though jerked down by some invisible hand Directly ahead of them distant perhaps a hundred yards lay a yellowish brown mass of unusual octagonal shape One end contained a small oval opening but the men from the Earth looked in vain for any creature to emerge from it The doctor silently set to work with his apparatus From an air tight double doored compartment he obtained a sample of the ether outside the car and with the aid of previously arranged chemicals quickly learned the truth There was no air Not only was there no oxygen the element upon which all known life depends but there was no nitrogen no carbon dioxide not the slightest trace of water vapor or of the other less known elements which can be found in small amounts in our own atmosphere Clearly as the doctor said whatever air the astronomers had observed must exist on the circumference of the planet only and not in this sun blasted north central spot On the outer walls of the cube so arranged as to be visible through the windows were various instruments The barometer showed no pressure The thermometer a specially devised one which used gas instead of mercury showed a temperature of six hundred degrees Fahrenheit No air no water and a baking heat as the geologist remarked how could life exist there But the architect suggested that possibly there was some form of life of which men knew nothing which could exist under such circumstances They got out three of the suits These were a good deal like those worn by divers except that the outer layer was made of non conducting aluminum cloth flexible air tight and strong Between it and the inner lining was a layer of cells into which the men now pumped several pints of liquid oxygen The terrific cold of this chemical made the heavy flannel of the inner lining very welcome while the oxygen itself as fast as it evaporated revitalized the air within the big glass faced helmet Once safely locked within the clumsy suits Jackson Van Emmon and Smith took their places within the vestibule while the doctor who had volunteered to stay behind watched them open the outer door With a hiss all the air in the vestibule rushed out and the doctor earnestly thanked his stars that the inner door had been built very strongly The men stepped out on to the ground At first they moved with great care being uncertain that their feet were weighted heavily enough to counteract the reduced gravitation of the tiny planet But they had been living in a very peculiar condition gravitationally speaking for the past three days and they quickly adapted themselves After a little shifting about the three artificial monsters gave their telephone wires another scrutiny then keeping always within ten feet of each other so as not to throw any strain on the connections they strode in a matter of fact way toward the nearest doorway For a moment or two they stood outside the queer peaked archway their glimmering suits standing out oddly in the blinding sunlight Then they advanced boldly into the opening in a flash they vanished from the doctor s sight and the inklike blackness of the opening again stared at him from that dazzling wall III THE HOUSE OF DUST The geologist strong man that he was and by profession an investigator of the unknown Van Emmon took the lead He stalked straight ahead into a vast space which without any preliminary hallway filled the entire triangular block 
6747-76145-0000	train-other-500	Before their eyes were accustomed to the shadow Pretty cold murmured the architect into the phone transmitter
none	none	 it was fastened to the inside of the helmet directly in front of his mouth 
6747-76145-0001	train-other-500	while the receiver was placed beside his ear All three stopped short to adjust each other s electrical heating apparatus To do this they did not use their fingers directly
none	none	 they manipulated ingenious non magnetic pliers attached to the ends of fingerless insulated mittens 
6747-76145-0002	train-other-500	Before they had finished the builder who had been puzzling over the extraordinary suddenness with which that cloud of dust had settled received an inspiration He was carrying note book and camera
6747-76145-0003	train-other-500	With his pliers he tore out a sheet from the former and holding book in one hand and the leaf in the other
none	none	 he allowed them to drop at the same instant 
6747-76145-0004	train-other-500	They reached the ground together See The architect repeated the experiment Back home where there s air the paper would have floated down it would have taken three times as long for it to fall as the book
none	none	 Smith nodded but 
6747-76145-0005	train-other-500	he had been thinking of something else He said gravely Remember what I told you
none	none	 it s air that insulates the earth from the ether 
6747-76145-0006	train-other-500	If there s no air here
none	none	 he glanced out into the pitiless sunlight 
6747-76145-0007	train-other-500	then I hope there s no flaw in our insulation We re walking in an electrical bath They looked around Objects were pretty distinct now
none	none	 They could easily see that the floor was covered with what appeared to be machines 
6747-76145-0008	train-other-500	laid out in orderly fashion Here however as outside everything was coated with that fine cream colored dust It filled every nook and cranny
6747-76145-0009	train-other-500	it stirred about their feet with every step The geologist led the way down a broad aisle on either side of which towered immense machinery Smith was for stopping to examine them one by one but the others vetoed the engineer s passion
6747-76145-0010	train-other-500	and strode on toward the end of the triangle More than anything else they looked for the absent population to show itself Suddenly Van Emmon stopped short Is it possible that they re all asleep
none	none	 He added that even though the sun shone steadily the year around the people must take time for rest 
6747-76145-0011	train-other-500	But Smith stirred the dust with his foot and shook his head I ve seen no tracks This dust has been lying here for weeks perhaps months
none	none	 If the folks are away then they must be taking a community vacation 
6747-76145-0012	train-other-500	At the end of the aisle they reached a small railed in space
none	none	 strongly resembling what might be seen in any office on the earth 
6747-76145-0013	train-other-500	In the middle of it stood a low flat topped desk for all the world like that of a prosperous real estate agent
none	none	 except that it was about half a foot lower 
6747-76145-0014	train-other-500	There was no chair For lack of a visible gate in the railing the explorers stepped over
none	none	 being careful not to touch it 
6747-76145-0015	train-other-500	There was nothing on top of the desk save the usual coat of dust Below a very wide space had been left for the legs of whoever had used it and flanking this space were two pedestals
6747-76145-0016	train-other-500	containing what looked to be a multitude of exceedingly small drawers
none	none	 Smith bent and examined them 
6747-76145-0017	train-other-500	apparently they had no locks and he unhesitatingly reached out gripped the knob of one and pulled Noiselessly instantaneously the whole desk crumbled to powder Startled Smith stumbled backwards
6747-76145-0018	train-other-500	knocking against the railing Next instant it lay on the floor
none	none	 its fragments scarcely distinguishable from what had already covered the surface 
6747-76145-0019	train-other-500	Only a tiny cloud of dust arose and in half a second this had settled The three looked at each other significantly Clearly the thing that had just happened argued a great lapse of time since the user of that desk officiated in that enclosure
6747-76145-0020	train-other-500	It looked as though Smith s guess of weeks perhaps months would have to be changed to years perhaps centuries Feel all right asked the geologist Jackson and Smith made affirmative noises and again they stepped out
6747-76145-0021	train-other-500	this time walking in the aisle along the outer wall They could see their sky car plainly through the ovals Here the machinery could be examined more closely They resembled automatic testing scales said Smith
none	none	 such as is used in weighing complicated metal products after finishing and assembling 
6747-76145-0022	train-other-500	Moreover they seemed to be connected the one to the other with a series of endless belts which Smith thought indicated automatic production To all appearances the dust covered apparatus stood just as it had been left when operations ceased
6747-76145-0023	train-other-500	an unguessable length of time before
none	none	 Smith showed no desire to touch the things now 
6747-76145-0024	train-other-500	Seeing this the geologist deliberately reached out and scraped the dust from the nearest machine
none	none	 and to the vast relief of all three no damage was done 
6747-76145-0025	train-other-500	The dust fell straight to the floor exposing a brilliantly polished streak of greenish white metal
none	none	 Van Emmon made another tentative brush or so at other points 
6747-76145-0026	train-other-500	with the same result Clean untarnished metal lay beneath all that dust Clearly it was some non conducting alloy whatever it was it had successfully resisted the action of the elements all the while that such presumably wooden articles
6747-76145-0027	train-other-500	as the desk and railing had been steadily rotting Emboldened
none	none	 Smith clambered up on the frame of one of the machines 
6747-76145-0028	train-other-500	He examined it closely as to its cams clutches gearing and other details significant enough to his mechanical training He noted their adjustments scrutinized the conveying apparatus
6747-76145-0029	train-other-500	and came back carrying a cylindrical object which he had removed from an automatic chuck This is what they were making he remarked trying to conceal his excitement
none	none	 The others brushed the dust from the thing a huge piece of metal which would have been too much for their strength on the earth 
6747-76145-0030	train-other-500	Instantly they identified it It was a cannon shell Again Van Emmon led the way They took a reassuring glance out the window at the familiar cube then passed along the aisle toward the farther corner
none	none	 As they neared it they saw that it contained a small enclosure of heavy metal scrollwork 
6747-76145-0031	train-other-500	within which stood a triangular elevator The men examined it as closely as possible noting especially the extremely low stool which stood upon its platform The same unerodable metal seemed to have been used throughout the whole affair
6747-76145-0032	train-other-500	After a careful scrutiny of the two levers which appeared to control the thing
none	none	 I m going to try it out 
6747-76145-0033	train-other-500	announced Smith well knowing that the others would have to go with him if they kept the telephones intact They protested that the thing was not safe Smith replied that they had seen no stairway or anything corresponding to one
6747-76145-0034	train-other-500	If this lift is made of that alloy admiringly then it s safe But Jackson managed to talk him out of it When they returned to the heap of powdered wood which had been the desk
6747-76145-0035	train-other-500	Smith spied a long work bench under a nearby window
none	none	 There they found a very ordinary vise in which was clamped a piece of metal 
6747-76145-0036	train-other-500	but for the dust it might have been placed there ten minutes before On the bench lay several tools some familiar to the engineer and some entirely strange A set of screw drivers of various sizes caught his eye
6747-76145-0037	train-other-500	He picked them up and again experienced the sensation of having wood turn to dust at his touch The blades were whole Still searching the engineer found a square metal chest of drawers each of which he promptly opened
6747-76145-0038	train-other-500	The contents were laden with dust but he brushed this off and disclosed a quantity of exceedingly delicate instruments They were more like dentists tools than machinists yet plainly were intended for mechanical use
6747-76145-0039	train-other-500	One drawer held what appeared to be a roll of drawings Smith did not want to touch them with infinite care he blew off the dust with the aid of his oxygen pipe After a moment or two the surface was clear
none	none	 but it offered no encouragement it 
6747-76145-0040	train-other-500	was the blank side of the paper There was no help for it Smith grasped the roll firmly with his pliers and next second gazed upon dust In the bottom drawer lay something that aroused the curiosity of all three
6747-76145-0041	train-other-500	These were small reels about two inches in diameter and a quarter of an inch thick each incased in a tight fitting box They resembled measuring tapes to some extent except that the ribbons were made of marvelously thin material
6747-76145-0042	train-other-500	Van Emmon guessed that there were a hundred yards in a roll Smith estimated it at three hundred
none	none	 They seemed to be made of a metal similar to that composing the machines 
6747-76145-0043	train-other-500	Smith pocketed them all It was the builder who thought to look under the bench but it was Smith who had brought a light By its aid they discovered a very small machine decidedly like a stock ticker
6747-76145-0044	train-other-500	except that it had no glass dome but possessed at one end a curious metal disk about a foot in diameter Apparently it had been undergoing repairs it was impossible to guess its purpose
6747-76145-0045	train-other-500	Smith s pride was instantly aroused he tucked it under his arm and was impatient to get back to the cube
none	none	 where he might more carefully examine his find with the tips of his fingers 
6747-76145-0046	train-other-500	It was when they were about to leave the building that they thought to inspect walls and ceiling Not that anything worth while was to be seen the surfaces seemed perfectly plain and bare
none	none	 except for the inevitable dust 
6747-76145-0047	train-other-500	Even the uppermost corners ten feet above their heads
none	none	 showed dust to the light of Smith s electric torch 
6747-76145-0048	train-other-500	Van Emmon stopped and stared at the spot as though fascinated The others were ready to go
none	none	 they turned and looked at him curiously 
6747-76145-0049	train-other-500	For a moment or two he seemed struggling for breath Good Heavens he gasped almost in a whisper
none	none	 His face was white the other two leaped toward him fearful that he was suffocating But he pushed them away roughly We re fools Blind blithering idiots that s what we are He pointed toward the ceiling with a hand that trembled plainly and went on in a voice which he tried to make fierce despite the awe which shook it Look at that dust again How d it get there He paused while the others the thought finally getting to them felt a queer chill striking at the backs of their necks Men there s only one way for the dust to settle on a wall It s got to have air to carry it It couldn t possibly get there without air That dust settled long before life appeared on the Earth even It s been there ever since the air disappeared from Mercury IV THE LIBRARY I thought you d never get back complained the doctor crossly when the three entered They had been gone just half an hour Next moment he was studying their faces and at once he demanded the most important fact They told him and before they had finished he was half way into another suit He was all eagerness but somehow the three were very glad to be inside the cube again and firmly insisted upon moving to another spot before making further explorations Within a minute or two the cube was hovering opposite the upper floor of the building the three had entered and with only a foot of space separating the window of the sky car and the dust covered wall the men from the earth inspected the interior at considerable length They flashed a search light all about the place and concluded that it was the receiving room where the raw iron billets were brought via the elevator and from there slid to the floor below At one end in exactly the same location as the desk Smith had destroyed stood another with a low and remarkably broad chair beside it So far as could be seen there were neither doors window panes nor shutters through the structure To get all the light and air they could guessed the doctor Perhaps that s why the buildings are all triangular most wall surface in proportion to floor area that way A few hundred feet higher they began to look for prominent buildings Only in forgetful moments did either of them scan the landscape for signs of life they knew now that there could be none We ought to learn something there the doctor said after a while pointing out a particularly large squat irregularly built affair on the edge of the business district The architect however was in favor of an exceptionally large high building in the isolated group previously noted in the suburbs But because it was nearer they maneuvered first in the direction of the doctor s choice The sky car came to rest in a large plaza opposite what appeared to be the structure s main entrance From their window the explorers saw that the squat effect was due only to the space the edifice covered for it was an edifice a full five stories high The doctor was impatient to go Smith was willing enough to stay behind he was already joyously examining the strange machine he had found Two minutes later Kinney Van Emmon and Jackson were standing before the portals of the great building There they halted and no wonder The entire face of the building could now be seen to be covered with a mass of carvings for the most part they were statues in bas relief All were fantastic in the extreme but whether purposely so or not there was no way to tell Certainly any such work on the part of an earthly artist would have branded him either as insane or as an incomprehensible genius Directly above the entrance was a group which might have been labeled The Triumph of the Brute An enormously powerful man nearly as broad as he was tall stood exulting over his victim a less robust figure prostrate under his feet Both were clad in armor The victor s face was distorted into a savage snarl startlingly hideous by reason of the prodigious size of his head planted as it was directly upon his shoulders for he had no neck His eyes were set so close together that at first glance they seemed to be but one His nose was flat and African in type while his mouth devoid of curves was simply revolting in its huge thick lipped lack of proportion His chin was square and aggressive his forehead strangely enough extremely high and narrow rather than low and broad His victim lay in an attitude that indicated the most agonizing torture his head was bent completely back and around behind his shoulders On the ground lay two battle axes huge affairs almost as heavy as the massively muscled men who had used them But the eyes of the explorers kept coming back to the fearsome face of the conqueror From the brows down he was simply a huge brutal giant above his eyes he was an intellectual The combination was absolutely frightful the beast looked capable of anything of overcoming any obstacle mental or physical internal or external in order to assert his apparently enormous will He could control himself or dominate others with equal ease and assurance It can t be that he was drawn from life said the doctor with an effort It wasn t easy to criticize that figure lifeless though it was On a planet like this with such slight gravitation there is no need for such huge strength The typical Mercurian should be tall and flimsy in build rather than short and compact But the geologist differed We want to remember that the earth has no standard type Think what a difference there is between the mosquito and the elephant the snake and the spider One would suppose that they had been developed under totally different planetary conditions instead of all right on the same globe No I think this monster may have been genuine And with that the geologist turned to examine the other statuary Without exception it resembled the central group all the figures were neckless and all much more heavily built than any people on earth There were several female figures they had the same general build and in every case were so placed as to enhance the glory of the males In one group the woman was offering up food and drink to a resting worker in another she was being carried off struggling in the arms of a fairly good looking warrior doctor Kinney led the way into the building As in the other structure there was no door The space seemed to be but one story in height although that had the effect of a cathedral The whole of the ceiling irregularly arched in a curious pointed manner was ornamented with grotesque figures while the walls were also partially formed of squat semi human statues set upon huge triangular shafts In the spaces between these outlandish pilasters there had once been some sort of decorations A great many photos were taken here As for the floor it was divided in all directions by low walls About five and a half feet in height these walls separated the great room into perhaps a hundred triangular compartments each about the size of an ordinary living room Broad openings about five feet square provided free access from one compartment to any other The men from the earth by standing on tiptoes could see over and beyond this system Wonder if these walls were supposed to cut off the view speculated the doctor I mean do you suppose that the Mercurians were such short people as that His question had to go unanswered They stepped into the nearest compartment and were on the point of pronouncing it bare when Jackson with an exclamation excitedly brushed away some of the dust and showed that the presumably solid walls were really chests of drawers Shallow things of that peculiar metal these drawers numbered several hundred to the compartment In the whole building there must have been millions Once more the dust was carefully removed revealing a layer of those curious rolls or reels exactly similar to what had been found in the tool chest in the shell works A careful examination of the metallic tape showed nothing whatever to the naked eye although the doctor fancied that he made out some strange characters on the little boxes themselves His view was shortly proved Finding drawer after drawer to contain a similar display varying from one to a dozen of the diminutive ribbons Van Emmon adopted the plan of gently blowing away the dust from the faces of the drawers before opening them This revealed the fact that each of the shallow things was neatly labeled Instantly the three were intent upon this fresh clue The markings were very faint and delicate the slightest touch being enough to destroy them To the untrained eye they resembled ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics to the archeologist they meant that a brand new system of ideographs had been found Suddenly Jackson straightened up and looked about with a new interest He went to one of the square doorways and very carefully removed the dust from a small plate on the lintel He need not have been so careful engraved in the solid metal was a single character plainly in the same language as the other ideographs The architect smiled triumphantly into the inquiring eyes of his friends I won t have to eat my hat said he This is a sure enough city all right and this is its library Smith was still busy on the little machine when they returned to the cube He said that one part of it had disappeared and was busily engaged in filing a bit of steel to take its place As soon as it was ready he thought they could see what the apparatus meant The three had brought a large number of the reels They were confident that a microscopic search of the ribbons would disclose something to bear out Jackson s theory that the great structure was really a repository for books or whatever corresponded with books on Mercury But the main thing said the doctor enthusiastically is to get over to the twilight band I m beginning to have all sorts of wild hopes Jackson urged that they first visit the big mansion on the outskirts of this place he said he felt sure somehow that it would be worth while But Van Emmon backed up the doctor and the architect had to be content with an agreement to return in case their trip was futile Inside of a few minutes the cube was being drawn steadily over toward the left or western edge of the planet s sunlit face As it moved all except Smith kept close watch on the ground below They made out town after town as well as separate buildings and on the roads were to be seen a great many of those octagonal structures all motionless After several hundred miles of this the surface abruptly sloped toward what had clearly been the bed of an ocean No sign of habitations here however so apparently the water had disappeared AFTER the humans had gone This ancient sea ended a short distance from the district they were seeking A little more travel brought them to a point where the sun cast as much shadow as light on the surface It was here they descended coming to rest on a sunlit knoll which overlooked a small building filled valley According to Kinney s apparatus there was about one fortieth the amount of air that exists on the earth Of water vapor there was a trace but all their search revealed no human life Not only that but there was no trace of lower animals there was not even a lizard much less a bird And even the most ancient looking of the sculptures showed no creatures of the air only huge antediluvian monsters were ever depicted They took a great many photos as a matter of course Also they investigated some of the big octagonal machines in the streets finding them to be similar to the great tanks that were used in the war except that they did not have the characteristic caterpillar tread their eight faces were so linked together that the entire affair could roll after a jolting slab sided flopping fashion Inside were curious engines and sturdy machines designed to throw the cannon shells they had seen no explosive was employed apparently but centrifugal force generated in whirling wheels Apparently these cars or chariots were universally used The explorers returned to the cube where they found that Smith happening to look out a window had spied a pond not far off The three visited it and found on its banks the first green stuff they had seen a tiny flowerless salt grass very scarce It bordered a slimy bluish pool of absolutely still fluid Nobody would call it water They took a few samples of it and went back And within a few minutes the doctor slid a small glass slide into his microscope and examined the object with much satisfaction What he saw was a tiny gelatinlike globule among scientists it is known as the amoeba It is the simplest known form of life the so called single cell It had been the first thing to live on that planet and apparently it was also the last V THE CLOSED DOOR As they neared Jackson s pet mansion each man paid close attention to the intervening blocks For the most part these were simply shapeless ruins heaps of what had once been perhaps brick or stone Once they allowed the cube to rest on the top of one of these mounds but the sky car s great weight merely sank it into the mass There was nothing under it save that same sandy dust Apparently the locality they were approaching had been set aside as a very exclusive residence district for the elite of the country Possibly it contained the homes of the royalty assuming that there had been a royalty At any rate the conspicuous structure Jackson had selected was certainly the home of the most important member of that colony When the three once more in their helmets and suits stood before the low broad portico which protected the entrance to that edifice the first thing they made out was an ornamental frieze running across the face In the same bold realistic style as the other sculpture there was depicted a hand to hand battle between two groups of those half savage half cultured monstrosities And in the background was shown a glowing orb obviously the sun See that exclaimed the doctor The size of that sun I mean Compare it with the way old Sol looks now They took a single glance at the great ball of fire over their heads nine times the size it always seemed at home it contrasted sharply with the rather small ball shown in the carvings Understand the doctor went on When that sculpture was made Mercury was little nearer the sun than the earth is now The builder was hugely impressed He asked eagerly Then probably the people became as highly developed as we Van Emmon nodded approvingly but the doctor opposed No I think not Jackson Mercury never did have as much air as the earth and consequently had much less oxygen And the struggle for existence he went on watching to see if the geologist approved each point as he made it the struggle for life is in the last analysis a struggle for oxygen So I would say that life was a pretty strenuous proposition here while it lasted Perhaps they were He stopped then added What I can t understand is how did it happen that their affairs came to such an abrupt end And why don t we see any er indications Skeletons The architect shuddered Next second though his face lit up with a thought I remember reading that electricity will decompose bone in time And then he shuddered again as his foot stirred that lifeless impalpable dust Was it possible As they passed into the great house the first thing they noted was the floor undivided dust covered and bare except for what had perhaps been rugs The shape was the inevitable equilateral triangle and here with a certain magnificent disregard for precedent the builders had done away with a ceiling entirely and instead had sloped the three walls up till they met in a single point a hundred feet overhead The effect was massively simple In one corner a section of the floor was elevated perhaps three feet above the rest and directly back of this was a broad doorway set in a short wall The three advanced at once toward it Here the electric torch came in very handy It disclosed a poorly lighted stairway very broad unrailed and preposterously steep The steps were each over three feet high Difference in gravitation said the doctor in response to Jackson s questioning look Easy enough for the old timers perhaps They struggled up the flight as best they could reaching the top after over five minutes of climbing Perhaps it was the reaction from this exertion at all events each felt a distinct loss of confidence as after regaining their wind they again began to explore Neither said anything about it to the others but each noted a queer sense of foreboding far more disquieting than either of them had felt when investigating anything else It may have been due to the fact that in their hurry they had not stopped to eat The floor they were on was fairly well lighted with the usual oval windows The space was open except that it contained the same kind of dividing walls they had found in the library Here however each compartment contained but one opening and that not uniformly placed In fact as the three noted with a growing uneasiness it was necessary to pass through every one of them in order to reach the corner farthest from the ladderlike stairs Why it should make them uneasy neither could have said When they were almost through the labyrinth Van Emmon after standing on tiptoes for the tenth time in order to locate himself noted something that had escaped their attention before These compartments used to be covered over he said for some reason lowering his voice He pointed out niches in the walls such as undoubtedly once held the ends of heavy timbers What was this place anyhow A trap Unconsciously they lightened their steps as they neared the last compartment They found as expected that it was another stairwell Van Emmon turned the light upon every corner of the place before going any further but except for a formless heap of rubbish in one corner which they did not investigate the place was as bare as the rest of the floor Again they climbed this time for a much shorter distance but Jackson slightly built chap that he was needed a little help on the steep stairs They were not sorry that they had reached the uppermost floor of the mansion It was somewhat better lighted than the floor below and they were relieved to find that the triangular compartments did not have the significant niches in their walls Their spirits rose perceptibly At the corner farthest from the stairs one of the walls rose straight to the ceiling completely cutting off a rather large triangle The three paid no attention to the other compartments but went straight to what they felt sure was the most vital spot in the place And their feelings were justified with a vengeance when they saw that the usual doorway in this wall was protected by something that had so far been entirely missing everywhere else It was barred by a heavy door For several minutes the doctor the geologist and the architect stood before it Neither would have liked to admit that he would just as soon leave that door unopened All the former uneasiness came back It was all the more inexplicable with the brilliant sunlight only a few feet away that each should have felt chilled by the place Wonder if it s locked remarked Van Emmon He pressed against the dust covered barrier half expecting it to turn to dust but evidently it had been made of the time defying alloy It stood firm And to all appearances it was nearly air tight Well said the doctor suddenly so that the other two started nervously The door s got to come down that s all They looked around there was no furniture no loose piece of material of any kind Van Emmon straightway backed away from the door about six feet and the others followed his example All together grunted the geologist and the three aluminum armored monsters charged the door It shook under the impact a shower of dust fell down and they saw that they had loosened the thing Once more This time a wide crack showed all around the edge of the door and the third attempt finished the job Noiselessly for there was no air to carry the sound but with a heavy jar which all three felt through their feet the barrier went flat on the floor beyond At the same instant a curious invisible wave like a tiny puff of wind floated out of the darkness and passed by the three men from the earth Each noticed it but neither mentioned it at the time Van Emmon was already searching the darkness with the torch Apparently it was only an anteroom A few feet beyond was another wall and in it stood another door larger and heavier than the first The three did not stop they immediately tried their strength on this one also After a half dozen attempts without so much as shaking the massive affair It s no use panted the geologist wishing that he could get a handkerchief to his forehead We can t loosen it without tools Jackson was for trying again but the doctor agreed with Van Emmon They reflected that they had been away from Smith long enough anyhow The cube was out of sight from where they were Van Emmon turned the light on the walls of the anteroom and found on a shelf at one end a neat pile of those little reels eleven in all He pocketed the lot There was nothing else Jackson and Kinney started to go They retreated as far into the main room as their telephone wires would allow Still the geologist held back Come on said the doctor uneasily It s getting cold Next second they stopped short nerves on edge at a strange exclamation from Van Emmon They looked around to see him pointing his light directly at the floor Even in that unnatural suit of mail his attitude was one of horror Look here he said in a low strained voice They went to his side and instinctively glanced behind them before looking at what lay in the dust It was the imprint of an enormous human foot The first thing that greeted the ears of the explorers upon taking off their suits in the sky car was the exultant voice of Smith He was too excited to notice anything out of the way in their manner he was almost dancing in front of his bench where the unknown machine now reconstructed stood belted to a small electric motor It runs he was shouting You got here just in time He began to fumble with a switch What of it remarked the doctor in the bland tone which he kept for occasions when Smith needed calming What will it do if it does run The engineer looked blank Why Then he remembered and picked up one of the reels at random There s a clamp here just the right size to hold one of these he explained fitting the ribbon into place and threading its free end into a loop on a spool which looked as though made for it But his excitement had passed he now cautiously set a small anvil between himself and the apparatus and then with the aid of a long stick he threw on the current For a moment nothing happened save the hum of the motor Then a strange leafy rustling sounded from the mechanism and next without any warning a high pitched voice nasal and plaintive but distinctly human spoke from the big metal disk The words were unintelligible The language was totally unlike anything ever heard on the earth And yet deliberately if somewhat cringingly the voice proceeded with what was apparently a recitation There were modulations pauses sentences but seemingly the paragraphs were all short and to the point As the thing went on the four men came closer and watched the operation of the machine The ribbon unrolled slowly it was plain that if the one topic occupied the whole reel then it must have the length of an ordinary chapter And as the voice continued certain dramatic qualities came out and governed the words utterly incomprehensible though they were There was a real thrill to it After a while they stopped the thing No use listening to this now as the doctor said We ve got to learn a good deal more about these people before we can guess what it all means And yet although all were very hungry on Jackson s suggestion they tried out one of the records that was brought from that baffling anteroom Smith was very much interested in that unopened door and Van Emmon was in the midst of it when Jackson started the motor The geologist s words stuck in his throat The disk was actually shaking with the vibrations of a most terrific voice Prodigiously loud and powerful its booming resonant bass smote the ears like the roll of thunder It was irresistible in its force compelling in its assurance masterful and strong to an overpowering degree Involuntarily the men from the earth stepped back On it roared and rumbled speaking the same language as that of the other record but whereas the first speaker merely USED the words the last speaker demolished them One felt that he had extracted every ounce of power in the language leaving it weak and flabby unfit for further use He threw out his sentences as though done with them not boldly not defiantly least of all tentatively he spoke with a certainty and force that came from a knowledge that he could compel rather than induce his hearers to believe It took a little nerve to shut him off Van Emmon was the one who did it Somehow they all felt immensely relieved when the gigantic voice was silenced and at once began discussing the thing with great earnestness Jackson was for assuming that the first record was worn and old the last one fresh and new but after examining both tapes under a glass and seeing how equally clear cut and sharp the impressions all were they agreed that the extraordinary voice they had heard was practically true to life They tried out the rest of the records in that batch finding that they were all by the same speaker Nowhere among the ribbons brought from the library was another of his making although a great number of different voices was included neither was there another talker with a fifth the volume the resonance the absolute power of conviction that this unknown colossus possessed Of course this is no place to describe the laborious process of interpreting these documents records of a past which was gone before earth s mankind had even begun The work involved the study of countless photos covering everything from inscriptions to parts of machinery and other details which furnished clue after clue to that superancient language It was not deciphered in fact until several years after the explorers had submitted their finds to the world s foremost lexicographers antiquarians and paleontologists Even today some of it is disputed But right here is most emphatically the place to insert the tale told by that unparalleled voice And incredible though it may seem as judged by the standards of the peoples of this earth the account is fairly proved by the facts uncovered by the expedition It would be but begging the question to doubt the genuineness of the thing and if understanding the language one were to hear the original as it fell word for word from the iron mouth of Strokor Footnote Translator s note In the Mercurian language stroke means iron or heart the Great hearing one would believe none could doubt nor would And so it does not do him justice to set it down in ordinary print One must imagine the story being related by Stentor himself must conceive of each word falling like the blow of a mammoth sledge The tale was not told it was BELLOWED and this is how it ran PART II THE STORY I THE MAN I am Strokor son of Strok the armorer I am Strokor a maker of tools of war Strokor the mightiest man in the world Strokor whose wisdom outwitted the hordes of Klow Strokor who has never feared and never failed Let him who dares dispute it I I am Strokor In my youth I was as now the marvel of all who saw I was ever robust and daring and naught but much older bigger lads could outdo me I balked at nothing be it a game or a battle it was and forever shall be my chief delight to best all others Twas from my mother that I gained my huge frame and sound heart In truth I am very like her now that I think upon it She too was indomitable in battle and famed for her liking for strife No doubt twas her stalwart figure that caught my father s fancy Aye my mother was a very likely woman but she boasted no brains I need no cunning I remember she said and he who was so unlucky in battle as to fall into her hands could vouch for the truth of it as long as he lived which would not be long She was a grand woman slow to anger and a match for many a good pair of men Often as a lad have I carried the marks of her punishment for the most of a year And thus it seems that I owe my head to my father He was a marvelously clever man dexterous with hand and brain alike Moreover he was no weakling perchance I should credit him with some of my agility for he was famed as a gymnast though not a powerful one Twas he who taught me how to disable my enemy with a mere clutch of the neck at a certain spot But Strok the armorer was feared most because of his brain and his knack of using his mind to the undoing of others And he taught me all that he knew taught me all that he had learned in a lifetime of fighting for the emperor of mending the complicated machines in the armory of contact with the chemists who wrought the secret alloy and the chiefs who led the army Some of this he taught me when I was not yet a man Why he should have done so I know not save that he seemed to value my affection and liked not my mother s demands that I heed her call not his At all events I oft found his shop a place of refuge from her wrath and I early came to value his teachings When I became a man he abruptly ended the practice I think he saw that I was become as dexterous as he with the tools of the craft and he feared lest I know more than he Well he might the day I realized this I laughed long and loud And from that time forth he taught me not because he chose to but because I bent a chisel in my bare hands before his eyes and told him his place Many times he strove to trick me and more than once he all but caught me in some trap He was a crafty man and relied not upon brawn but upon wits Yet I was ever on the watch and I but learned the more from him Ye are very kind I mocked him one morning When I had taken my seat a huge weight had dropped from above and crushed my stool to splinters much as it would have crushed my skull had I not leaped instantly aside Ye are kinder than most fathers who teach their sons nothing at all He foamed at his mouth in his rage and discomfiture Insolent whelp he snarled Thou art quick as a cat on thy feet But I was not to be appeased by words I smote him on the chest with my bare hand so that he fell on the far side of the room Let that be a warning I told him when he had recovered some time later If ye have any more tricks try them for not on me Which I claim to be a neat twist of words It was not long after that when I saw a change in my father He no longer tried to snare me instead he began of his own free will to train my mind to other than warlike things At first I was suspicious enough I looked for new traps and watched all the closer I told him that his next try would surely be his last and I meant it But the time came when I saw that my father was reconciled to his master I saw that he genuinely admitted my prowess and where he formerly envied me he now took great pride in all I accomplished and claimed that it was but his own brains acting through my body I let him indulge in the conceit I grudged it not to him so long as he taught me In truth he was so eager to add to my store of facts so intent upon filling my head with what filled his that at times I was fairly compelled to stop him lest I tire My mother opposed all this The lad needs none of thy wiles she gibed He is no stripling he is a man s man and a fit son of his mother Aye quoth my father slyly He has thy muscle and thy courage Thank Jon he hath not thy empty head Whereat she flew at him Had she caught him she would have destroyed him such was her rage and afterwards she would have mourned her folly and mayhap have injured herself for she loved him greatly But he stepped aside just in the nick of time and she crashed into the wall behind him with such force that she was senseless for a time I remember it well And yet to give credit where credit is due I must admit that I owe a great deal to that gray beard Maka the star gazer But for him perchance the name of Strokor would mean but little for twas he who gave me ambition Truly it was an uncommon affair my first meeting with him Now that I shake my memory for it it seems that something else of like consequence came to pass on the same occasion Curious but I have not thought on it for many days Yes it is true I met Maka on the very morn that I first laid eyes on the girl Ave I was returning from the northland at the time A rumor had come down to Vlama that one of the people in the snow country had seen a lone specimen of the mulikka Now these were but a myth No man living remembers when the carvings on the House of Learning were made and all the wise men say that it hath been ages since any being other than man roamed the world Yet I was young I determined to search for the thing anyhow and twas only after wasting many days in the snow that I cursed my luck and turned back I was afoot for the going was too rough for my chariot I had not yet quit the wilderness before from a height I spied a group of people ascending from the valley Knowing not whether they be friends or foes I hid beside the path up which they must come for I was weary and wanting no strife Yet I became alert enough when the three they were two ditch tenders one old one young and a girl came within earshot For they were quarreling It seemed that the young man who was plainly eager to gain the girl had fouled in a try to force her favor The older man chided him hotly And just when they came opposite my rock the younger man whose passion had got the better of him suddenly tripped the older so that he fell upon the ledge and would have fallen to his death on the rocks below had not the girl crying out in her terror leaped forward and caught his hand At once the ditch tender took the lass about the waist and strove to pull her away For a moment she held fast and in that moment I Strokor stood forth from behind the rock Now be it known that I am no champion of weaklings I have no liking for the troubles of others enough of my own say I I was but angered that the ditch tender should have done the trick so clumsily and upon an old man at that I cared not for the gray beard nor what became of the chit I clapped the trickster upon the shoulder and spun him about Ye clumsy coward I jeered Have ye had no practice that ye should trip the old one no better than that Who are ye he stuttered like the coward he was I laughed and helped the chit drag Maka for it was he up to safety I am a far better man than ye I said not caring to give my name And I can show ye how the thing should be done Come at me if ye are a man At that he dashed upon me and such was his fear of ridicule for the girl was laughing him to scorn now he put up a fair stiff fight But I forgot my weariness when he foully clotted me on the head with a stone I drove at him with all the speed and suddenness my father had taught me caught the fellow by the ankle and brought him down atop me The rest was easy I bent my knee under his middle and tossed him high In a flash I was upon my feet and caught him from behind And in another second I had rushed him to the cliff and when he turned to save himself I tripped him as neatly as father himself could have done it so that the fellow will guard the ditch no more save in the caverns of Hofe I laughed and picked up my pack My head hurt a bit from the fellow s blow but a little water would do for that I started to go Ye are a brave man cried the girl I turned carelessly and then quite for the first time I had a real look at her She was in no way like any woman I had seen All of them had been much like the men brawny and close knit as well fitted for their work as are men for war But this chit was all but slender not skinny but prettily rounded out and soft like I cannot say that I admired her at first glance she seemed fit only to look at not to live I was minded of some of the ancient carvings which show delicate lightly built animals that have long since been killed off graceful trifles that rested the eye As for the old man Aye thou art brave and wondrous strong my lad said he still a bit shaky from his close call I was pleased with the acknowledgment and turned back It was nothing I told them and I recounted some of my exploits notably one in which I routed a raiding party of men from Klow six in all carrying in two alive on my shoulders I am the son of Strok the armorer Ye are Strokor marveled the girl staring at me as though I were a god Then she threw back her head and stepped close I am Ave This is Maka he is my uncle but best known as a star gazer My father was Durok the engine maker She watched my face Durok I knew him well My father had said that he was quite as brainy as himself He were a fine man Ave Aye said she proudly She stepped closer I could not but see how like him she was though a woman And next second she laid a hand on my arm I am yet a free woman Strokor Hast thou picked thy mate And her cheeks flamed Now twas not my first experience of the kind Many women had looked like that at me before But I had always been a man s man and had ever heeded my father s warning to have naught whatever to do with women They are the worst trick of all he told me and I had never forgot Belike I owe much of my power to just this But Ave had acted too quickly for me to get away I laughed again and shook her off I will have naught to do with ye I told her civilly enough When I am ready to take a woman I shall take her not before At that the blood left her face she stood very straight and her eyes flashed dangerously Were she a man I should have stood on my guard But she made no move only the softness in her eyes gave way to such a savage look that I was filled with amaze And thus I left them the old man calling down the blessing of Jon upon me for having saved his life and the chit glaring after me as though no curses would suffice A right queer matter I thought at the time I guessed not what would come of it not then II THE VISION Twas a fortnight later more or less when next I saw Maka I was lumbering along in my chariot feeling most uncomfortable under the eyes of my friends for one foot of my machine had a loose link and twas flapping absurdly And I liked it none too well when Maka stopped his own rattletrap in front of mine and came running to my window Next moment I forgot his impertinence Strokor he whispered his face alive with excitement thou art a brave lad and didst save my life Now know you that a party of the men of Klow have secreted themselves under the stairway behind the emperor s throne They have killed the guards and will of a certainty kill the emperor too Twould serve the dolt right I replied for I really cared but little But why have ye come to me old man I am but a lieutenant in the armory I am not the captain of the palace guard Because he answered gazing at me very pleasingly thou couldst dispose of the whole party single handed there are but four and gain much glory for thyself By Jon I swore vastly delighted and without stopping to ask Maka whence he had got his knowledge I went at once to the spot However when I got back I sought the star gazer I ought to mention that I had no trouble with the louts and that the emperor himself saw me finishing off the last of them I sought the star gazer and demanded how he had known Hast ever heard of Edam he inquired in return Edam I had not the name was strange to me Who is he A man as young as thyself but a mere stripling quoth Maka He was a pupil of mine when I taught in the House of Learning Of late he has turned to prophecy and it is fair remarkable how well the lad doth guess At all events twas he Strokor who told me of the plot He saw it in a dream Then Edam must yet be in Vlama said I if he were able to tell ye Canst bring him to me I would know him And so it came about that on the eve of that same day Maka brought Edam to my house I remember it well for twas the same day that the emperor in gratitude of my little service in the anteroom had relieved me from my post in the armory and made me captain of the palace guard I was thus become the youngest captain also the biggest and strongest and as will soon appear by far the longest headed I was in high good humor and had decided to celebrate with a feast So when my two callers arrived I sat them down before a meal such as cost a tenth Footnote Since Mercury had no moon its people never coined a word to correspond with our month and for the same reason they never had a week Their time was reckoned only in days years and fractions of the two of my year s salary I served not only the usual products of the field variously prepared but as a special gift from the emperor s own stock a piece of mulikka meat frozen which had been found in the northland by some geologists a few years aback It had been kept in the palace icing room all this time and was in prime condition Maka and I enjoyed it overmuch but Edam would touch it not He was a slightly built lad not at all the sturdy man that I am but of less than half the weight His head too was unlike mine his forehead was wide as well as tall and his eyes were mild as a slave s Ye are very young to be a prophet I said to him after we were filled and the slaves had cleared away our litter Tell me hast foretold anything else that has come to pass Aye he replied not at all boldly but what some call modestly I prophesied the armistice which now stands between our empire and Klow s Is this true I demanded of Maka The old man bowed his head gravely and looked upon the young man with far more respect than I felt He added Tell Strokor the dream thou hadst two nights ago Edam It were a right strange thing whether true or no The stripling shifted his weight on his stool and moved the bowl closer Then he thrust his pipe deep into it and let the liquid flow slowly out his nostrils Footnote A curious custom among the Mercurians who had no tobacco There is no other way to explain some of the carvings Doubtless the liquid was sweet smelling and perhaps slightly narcotic I saw this he began immediately before rising and after a very light supper so I know that it was a vision from Jon and not of my own making I was standing upon the summit of a mountain and gazing down upon a very large fertile valley It was heavily wooded dark green and inviting But what first drew my attention was a great number of animals moving about IN THE AIR They were passing strange affairs some large some small variously colored and all covered with the same sort of fur quite unlike any hair I have ever seen In the air I echoed recovering from my astonishment Then I laughed mightily Man ye must be crazy There is no animal can live in the air Ye must mean in the water or on land Nay interposed the star gazer Thou hast never studied the stars Strokor or thou wouldst know that there be a number of them which through the enlarging tube show themselves to be round worlds like unto our own And it doth further appear that these other worlds also have air like this we breathe and that some have less while others have even more From what Edam has told me finished the old man I judge that his vision took place on Jeos Footnote The Mercurian word for earth a world much larger than ours according to my calculations and doubtless having enough air to permit very light creatures to move about in it Go on said I to Edam good humoredly I be ever willing to believe anything strange when my stomach is full The dreamer had taken no offense Then I bent my gaze closer as I am always able in visions And I saw that the greenery was most remarkably dense tangled and luxuriant to a degree not ever seen here And moving about in it was the most extraordinary collection of beings that I have ever laid these eyes upon There were some huge creatures quite as tall as thy house Strokor with legs as big around as that huge chest of thine They had tails as had our ancient mulikka save that these were terrific things as long and as big as the trunk of a large tree I know not their names Footnote Probably the dinosaur And then at the other extreme was a tiny creature of the air which moved with a musical hum It could have hid under thy finger nail Strokor yet it had a tiny sharp pointed bill with which it stung most aggravatingly And between these two there were any number of creatures of varying size and shape But nowhere was there a sign of a man True there was one hairy grotesque creature which hung by its hands and feet from the tree tops very like thee in some way Strokor but its face and head were those of a brainless beast not of a man Nowhere was a creature like me or thee And the most curious thing was this Although there were ten times as many of these creatures big and little to the same space as on our world yet there was no great amount of strife In truth there is far more combat and destruction among we men than among the beasts And he spoke most earnestly as though he would not care to be disbelieved I saw fathers fight to protect their young I near fell from my stool in my amaze Never in all my life had I heard a thing so far from the fact What I shouted Ye sit there like a sane man and tell me ye saw fathers fight for their young He nodded his head still very gravely I fell silent for want of words but Maka put in a thought It would appear Strokor that it be not so much of an effort for beings to live there on Jeos as here Perchance tis the greater amount of vegetation at all accounts the animals need not prey upon one another so generally and that then would explain why some have energy enough to waste in the care of their young I can understand I said very slowly I can understand why a mother will fight for her babes tis reasonable enough no doubt But as for fathers doing the same Edam dost mean to say that ALL creatures on Jeos do this Nay only some It may be that fewer than half of the varieties have the custom Howbeit tis a beautiful one When the vision ended I was right loath to go Faugh I spat upon the ground Such softness makes me ill I be glad I were born in a man s world where I can take a man s chances I want no favoring If I am strong enough to live I live if not I die What more can I ask Aye my lad said Maka approvingly This be a world for the strong There is no room here for others there is scarce enough food for those who thanks to their strength do survive He slipped the gold band from off his wrist and held it up for Jon to see Here Strokor a pledge A pledge to the survival of the fittest A neat neat wording I roared as I took the pledge with him Then we both stopped short Edam had not joined us Edam my lad spake the old man ye will take the pledge with us The stripling s eyes were troubled Well he knew that once he refused such an act he were no longer welcome in my house nor in Maka s But when he looked around it were bravely enough Men I have neither the strength of the one nor the brains of the other of ye I am but a watchmaker I live because of my skill with the little wheels I have no quarrel with either of ye He got to his feet and started to the door But I cannot take the pledge with ye I have seen a wondrous thing and I love it And though I know not why I feel that Jon has willed it for Jeos to see a new race of men a race even better than ours I leaped to my feet Better than ours Mean ye to say stripling that there can be a better man than Strokor I full expected him to shrink from me in fear I was able to crush him with one blow But he stood his ground nay stepped forward and laid a hand easily upon my shoulder Strokor ye are more than a man ye are two men in one There is no finer I say it fair And yet I doubt not that there can be and will be a better And with that such a curious expression came into his face such a glow of some strange land of warmth that I let my hand drop and suffered him to depart in peace such was my wonder Besides any miserable lout could have destroyed the lad Maka sat deep in thought for a time and when he did speak he made no mention of the lad who had just quit us Instead he looked me over long and earnestly and at the end he shook his head sorrowfully and sighed Thou art the sort of a son I would have had Strokor given the wits of thy father to hold a woman like thy mother And thou didst save my life He mused a little longer then roused himself and spake sharply Thou art a vain man Strokor Aye I agreed willingly enough And none has better cause than I He would not acknowledge the quip Thou hast everything needful to tickle thy vanity Thou hast the envy of those who note thy strength the praise of them who love thy courage and the respect of they who value thy brains All these thou hast and yet ye have not that which is best I thought swiftly and turned on him with a frown Mean ye that I am not handsome enough Nay Strokor quoth the star gazer There be none handsomer in this world no matter what the standard of any other such as Edam s Jeos It is not that It is that thou hast no ambition I considered this deeply At first thought it was not true had I not always made it a point to best my opponent From my youth it had been ever my custom to succeed where bigger bodies and older minds had failed Was not this ambition But before I disputed the point with Maka I saw what he meant I had no FINAL ambition no ultimate goal for which to strive I had been content from year to year to outdo each rival as he came before me and now with mind and body alike in the pink of condition I was come to the place where none durst stand before me Ye are right Maka I admitted not because I cared to gratify his conceit but because it were always for my own good to own up when wrong that I might learn the better Ye are right I need to decide upon a life purpose What have ye thought The old man was greatly pleased Our talk with Edam brought it all before me Know you Strokor that the survival of the fittest is a rule which governs man as well as men It applies to the entire population Strokor just as truly as to me or thee In fine we men who are now the sole inhabitants of this world are descended from a race of people who survived solely because they were fitter than the mulikka fitter than the reptiles the fittest by far of all the creatures That being the case it is plain that in time either our empire or that of Klow s must triumph over the other And that which remains shall be the fittest Hold I cried Why cannot matters remain just as they now are and forever That he said rapidly is because thou knowest so little about the future of this world But I am famed as a student of the heavens and I tell thee it is possible by means of certain delicate measuring instruments together with the highest mathematics to keep a very close watch upon the course of our world And we now know that our year is much shorter than it was in the days of the mulikka I nodded my head Rightly enough since our days are become steadily longer for some mysterious reason A reason no longer a mystery quoth Maka It is now known that the sun is a very powerful magnet and that it is constantly pulling upon our world and bringing it nearer and nearer to himself That is why it hath become slightly warmer during the past hundred years the records show it plain And the same influence has caused the lengthening of our day He stopped and let me think Soon I saw it clearly enough a time must come when the increasing warmth of the sun would stifle all forms of vegetable life and that would mean the choking of mankind It might take untold centuries yet plainly enough the world must some day become too small for even those who now remained upon it Suddenly I leaped to my feet and strode the room in my excitement Ye are right Maka I shouted thoroughly aroused There cannot always be the two empires In time one or the other must prevail Jon has willed it And I stopped short and stared at him I need not tell ye which it shall be I knew thou wouldst see the light Strokor Thou hast thy father s brains I sat me down but instantly leaped up again such was my enthusiasm Maka I cried our emperor is not the man for the place It is true that he were a brave warrior in his youth he won the throne fairly And we have suffered him to keep it because he is a wise man and because we have had little trouble with the men of Klow since their defeat two generations agone But he today is content to sit at his ease and quote platitudes about live and let live Faugh I am ashamed that I should even have given ear to him I stopped short and glared at the old man Maka hark ye well If it be the will of Jon to decide between the men of Klow and the men of Vlamaland then it is my intent to take a hand in this decision Aye my lad he said tranquilly and then added quite as though he knew what my answer must be How do ye intend to go about it Like a man I Strokor shall become the emperor III THE THRONE A small storm had come up while Maka and I were talking 
6784-76150-0000	train-other-500	Now as he was about to quit me the clouds were clearing away and an occasional stroke of lightning came down One of these however hit the ground such a short distance away that both of us could smell the smoke
6784-76150-0001	train-other-500	My mind was more alive than it had ever been before Now what caused that Maka The lightning I mean we have it nearly every day yet I have never thought to question it before
6784-76150-0002	train-other-500	It is no mystery my lad quoth Maka dodging into his chariot so that he was not wet
none	none	 I myself have watched the thing from the top of high mountains 
6784-76150-0003	train-other-500	where the air is so light that a man can scarce get enough to fill his lungs
none	none	 and I say unto you that were it not for what air we have we should have naught save the lightning 
6784-76150-0004	train-other-500	The space about the air is full of it He started his engine then leaned out into the rain and said softly Hold fast to what thy father has taught thee Strokor
6784-76150-0005	train-other-500	Have nothing to do with the women Tis a man s job ahead of thee and the future of the empire is in thy hands And as he clattered off fill not thy head with wonderings about the lightning
none	none	 Aye said I right earnestly 
6784-76150-0006	train-other-500	and immediately turned my thoughts to my new ambition And yet
none	none	 the thing Maka had just told me kept coming back to my mind 
6784-76150-0007	train-other-500	and so it does to this very day
none	none	 I know not why I should mention it at all save that each time I think upon Maka I also think upon the lightning 
6784-76150-0008	train-other-500	whether I will or no I slept not at all that night but sat Footnote It seems to have been the custom among the soldiers never to lie down but to take their sleep sitting or standing
none	none	 a habit not hard to form where the gravitation was so slight 
6784-76150-0009	train-other-500	No doubt this also explains their stunted legs
6784-76150-0010	train-other-500	till the dawn came thinking out a plan of action By that time I was fair convinced that there was naught to be gained by waiting waiting makes me impatient as well
6784-76150-0011	train-other-500	I determined to act at once and since one day is quite as good as the next I decided that this day was to see the thing begun I came before the emperor at noon and received my decorations
6784-76150-0012	train-other-500	Within the hour I had made myself known to the four and ninety men who were to be my command a picked company all of a height and weight with bodies that lacked little of my own perfection
6784-76150-0013	train-other-500	Never was there a finer guard about the palace My first care was to pick a quarrel with the outgoing commander Twere easy enough he was green with envy anyhow
6784-76150-0014	train-other-500	And so it came about that we met about mid afternoon with seconds in a well frequented field in the outskirts
6784-76150-0015	train-other-500	Before supper was eaten my entire troop knew that their new captain had tossed his ball slinger away without using it had taken twenty balls from their former commander s weapon
6784-76150-0016	train-other-500	and while thus wounded had charged the man and despatched him with bare hands Needless to say this exploit quite won their hearts
6784-76150-0017	train-other-500	none but a blind man could have missed the respect they showed me when all bandaged and sore I lined them up next morning Afterward I learned that they had all taken a pledge to follow Strokor through the gates of Hofe itself
none	none	 Twere but a week later that fully recovered and in perfect fettle 
6784-76150-0018	train-other-500	I called my men together one morn as the sun rose By that time I had given them a sample of my brains through ordering a rearrangement of their quarters such as made the same much more comfortable Also
6784-76150-0019	train-other-500	I had dealt with one slight infraction of the rules in such a drastic fashion that they knew I would brook no trifling All told tis hard to say whether they thought the most of me or of Jon
6784-76150-0020	train-other-500	Men said I as bluntly as I knew the emperor is an old man And as ye know he is disposed to be lenient toward the men of Klow
none	none	 whereas ye and I well know that the louts are blackguards 
6784-76150-0021	train-other-500	Now I will tell ye more It has come to me lately that Klow is plotting to attack us with strange weapons I thought best considering their ignorance not to give them my own reasons
6784-76150-0022	train-other-500	Of course I have told the emperor of it yet he will not act He says to wait till we are attacked I stopped and watched their faces
6784-76150-0023	train-other-500	Sure enough the idea fair made them ache Each and every one of these men was spoiling for a fight Now tell me how would ye like to become the emperor s body guard
6784-76150-0024	train-other-500	I did not have to wait long the light that flared in their faces told me plainly And how would ye like to have me for your emperor
none	none	 At that their tongues were loosed and I hindered them not 
6784-76150-0025	train-other-500	They yelled for pure joy and pressed about me like a pack of children I saw that the time was ripe for action Up then I roared and of course led the way
6784-76150-0026	train-other-500	We met the emperor s guard on the lower stairs and from that point on we fair hacked our way through Well no need to describe the fight For a time I thought we were gone
6784-76150-0027	train-other-500	the guards had a cunningly devised labyrinth on the second floor and attacked us from holes in a false ceiling so that we suffered heavily at first But I saw what was amiss
6784-76150-0028	train-other-500	and shouted to my men to clear away the timbers and after that it was clear work I lost forty men before the guard was disposed of The emperor I finished myself
6784-76150-0029	train-other-500	he dodged right spryly for a time but at last I caught him and tossed him to the foot of the upper stairs And there he still lies for none of my men would touch him nor would I
6784-76150-0030	train-other-500	We covered him with quicklime and some earth As soon as we had taken care of those who were not too far gone I called the men together and caused a round of spirits to be served
6784-76150-0031	train-other-500	Then we all feasted on the emperor s store and soon were feeling like ourselves Men I said impressively I am proud of ye
none	none	 Never did an emperor have such a dangerous gang of bullies 
6784-76150-0032	train-other-500	At that they all grinned happily and I added And tis a fine staff of generals that ye ll make Need I say more
6784-76150-0033	train-other-500	Those men would have overturned the palace for me had I said the word As it was they obeyed my next orders in such a spirit that success was assured from the first
6784-76150-0034	train-other-500	First using the dead emperor s name I caused the various chiefs to be brought together at once to the court chamber At the same time I contrived by means I need not go into here
6784-76150-0035	train-other-500	to prevent any word of our action from getting abroad So when the former staff faced me the next morning they learned that they were to be executed I could trust not one they were all friends of the old man
6784-76150-0036	train-other-500	With the chiefs out of the way and my own men taking their commands the whole army fell into my hands True there were some insurrections here and there but my men handled them with such speed and harshness
6784-76150-0037	train-other-500	that any further stubbornness turned to admiration By this time the fame of Strokor was spread throughout the empire And thus it came about that
none	none	 within a week of the night that old Maka first put the idea into my head 
6784-76150-0038	train-other-500	Strokor son of Strok reigned throughout Vlamaland
none	none	 And to make it complete the army celebrated my accession by taking a pledge before Jon To Strokor the fittest of the fit IV THE ASSAULT 
6784-76151-0000	train-other-500	Now out of a total population of perhaps three million I had about a quarter million first class fighters in my half of the world
none	none	 Klow by comparison had but two thirds the number 
6784-76151-0001	train-other-500	his land was not a rich one But he had the advantage of knowing some while in advance of the new ruler in Vlama and shortly my spies reported that his armories were devising a new type of weapon
6784-76151-0002	train-other-500	Twas a strange verification of my own fiction to my men I could learn nothing however about it Meanwhile I caused a vast number of flat boats to be built all in secret
6784-76151-0003	train-other-500	Each of them was intended for a single fighter and his supplies and each was so arranged with side paddle wheels that it would be driven by the motor in the soldier s chariot and thus give each his own boat
6784-76151-0004	train-other-500	Again discarding all precedent I packed not all my forces together as had been done in the past but scattered them up and adown the coast fronting the land of Klow
6784-76151-0005	train-other-500	and at a prearranged time my quarter million men set out a company in each tiny fleet Some were slightly in advance of the rest who had the shorter distance to travel
6784-76151-0006	train-other-500	And just as I had planned we all arrived at a certain spot on Klow s coast at practically the same hour although two nights later Twas a brilliant stroke
6784-76151-0007	train-other-500	The enemy looked not for a fleet of water ants ready to step right out of the sea into battle Their fleet was looking for us true but not in that shape
6784-76151-0008	train-other-500	And we were all safely ashore before they had ceased to scour the seas for us I immediately placed my heavy machines and just as all former expeditions had done
6784-76151-0009	train-other-500	opened the assault at once with a shower of the poison shells I relied it will be seen upon the surprise of my attack to strike terror into the hearts of the louts But apparently they were prepared for anything
6784-76151-0010	train-other-500	no matter how rapid the attack My bombardment had not proceeded many moments before to my dismay some of their own shells began to fall among us Soon they were giving as good as we
none	none	 Now how knew they that we should come to this spot 
6784-76151-0011	train-other-500	I demanded of Maka I had placed him in my cabinet as soon as I had reached the throne The old man stroked his beard gravely Perchance it had been wrong to come to the old landing
6784-76151-0012	train-other-500	They simply began shelling it as a matter of course Ye are right again I told him and forthwith moved my pieces over into another triangle
6784-76151-0013	train-other-500	Previously of course all my charioteers had gone on toward the capital However I took care to move my machines one at a time so that there was no let up in my bombardment
6784-76151-0014	train-other-500	But scarce had we taken up the new position before the enemy s shells likewise shifted and began to strike once more in our midst
none	none	 I swore a great oath 
6784-76151-0015	train-other-500	and whirled upon Maka in wrath Think ye that there be a spy among us I demanded How else can ye explain this thing My men have combed the land about us
6784-76151-0016	train-other-500	there are none of the louts secreted here and even so they could not have notified Klow so soon Besides tis pitch dark I were sorely mystified
6784-76151-0017	train-other-500	All we could do was to fling our shells as fast as our machines would work and dodge the enemy s hail as best we could Thus the time passed and it were near dawn when the first messengers Footnote
6784-76151-0018	train-other-500	Messengers no telegraph or telephone much less wireless In a civilization as strenuous as that of Mercury there was never enough consideration for others to lead to such socially beneficial things as these
6784-76151-0019	train-other-500	no more than railroads or printing presses Civilization appears to be in exact proportion to the ease of getting a living other conditions being equal
6784-76151-0020	train-other-500	returned They have stopped us just outside the walls of the city was the report It pleased me that they should have pushed so far at first I climbed at once into my chariot
6784-76151-0021	train-other-500	Now is the time for Strokor to strike I gave orders for the staff to remain where it was I will send ye word when the city is mine
6784-76151-0022	train-other-500	But before I started my engine I glanced up at the sky to see if the dawn were yet come and as I gazed I thought I saw something come between me and a star
6784-76151-0023	train-other-500	I brushed the hair away from my eyes and looked again
none	none	 To my boundless surprise I made out not one but three strange objects moving about swiftly in the air 
6784-76151-0024	train-other-500	Look I cried and my whole staff craned their necks In a moment all had seen and great was their wonder I blamed them not for their fears
none	none	 Twas Maka who spoke first 
6784-76151-0025	train-other-500	They are much too large to be creatures of Jon he muttered They must be some trick of the enemy
6784-76151-0026	train-other-500	Dost recall Edam s vision of the creatures in the air of Jeos he went on knowing that I would not hinder him Now as I remember it he said they flew with great speed
6784-76151-0027	train-other-500	Were it not possible Strokor for suitable engines to propel very light structures at such high speed as to remain suspended in the air after the manner of leaves in a storm
6784-76151-0028	train-other-500	I note these strangers move quite fast It was even so and at that same instant one of them swung directly above our heads so close that I could hear the hum of a powerful engine
6784-76151-0029	train-other-500	So it was only a trick I shook myself together Attention My staff drew up at the word They are but few fear them not
none	none	 We waste no more time here 
6784-76151-0030	train-other-500	Pack up the machines and follow And thus we charged upon Klow I found that my men had entirely surrounded the city Klow s men were putting up a plucky fight
6784-76151-0031	train-other-500	and showing no signs of fearing us Seeing this I blew a blast on my engine s whistle so that my bullies might know that I had come Immediately the word ran up and down the line
none	none	 so that within a few minutes Klow was facing a roaring crowd of half mad terrors 
6784-76151-0032	train-other-500	I myself set the example by charging the nearest group of the enemy all of whom were mounted within the rather small and perfectly circular chariots which they preferred They were quick but slippery
6784-76151-0033	train-other-500	Also they could not stand before a determined rush as several of them learned after vainly trying to slip some balls through my windows and failing in that striving to get away from me
6784-76151-0034	train-other-500	But I ran them down and toppled them over and dropped suffocation bombs into their little cages with such vigor and disregard of their volleys that my men could not resist the example
6784-76151-0035	train-other-500	We charged all along that vast circular line and we cheered mightily when the whole front broke turned tail and ran before us But scarce had they got away before a queer thing happened
6784-76151-0036	train-other-500	A flock of those great air creatures some eight altogether rose up from the middle of the city It was now fairly light and we could see well One of them had some sort of engine trouble
6784-76151-0037	train-other-500	so that it had to return at once but the other seven came out to the battle line and began to circle the city As they did so they dropped odd misshapen parcels totally unlike materials of war
6784-76151-0038	train-other-500	but when they struck they gave off prodigious puffs of a greenish smoke of so terribly pungent a nature that my men dropped before it like apples from a shaken tree Twas a fearful sight
6784-76151-0039	train-other-500	lucky for us that the louts had had no practice else few of us should be alive to tell the tale And so they swept around the great circle many triangles in area
6784-76151-0040	train-other-500	and everywhere the unthinkable things smote the hearts of my men with a fear they had never known Only one of the devices suffered it was brought down by a chance fling of a poison shell
6784-76151-0041	train-other-500	The rest after loosing their burdens returned to the city for more
none	none	 I am no fool 
6784-76151-0042	train-other-500	I saw that we could do nothing against such weapons but must use all our wits if we escaped even Return I commanded and instantly my staff whistled the code
6784-76151-0043	train-other-500	The men obeyed with alacrity making off at top speed with the men of Klow in hot pursuit although able to do little damage Aye it were a sorrowful thing that retreat The best I could do
none	none	 was to remain till the very last having to deal with a number of persistent louts who all but suffocated me at that 
6784-76151-0044	train-other-500	But I managed to empty my slinger into some of them and to topple the rest
none	none	 I was mainly angry that Klow had not showed himself 
6784-76151-0045	train-other-500	By the time I had reached the seashore most of my men were in their boats Again I stayed till the last although I could see the enemy s fleet bearing down hard upon us from the north
6784-76151-0046	train-other-500	In truth we would have all been lost had we come in the manner of former campaigns all together in big transports But because we could scatter every which way
6784-76151-0047	train-other-500	the fleet harmed us little and four fifths of us got safely back Happily none of the air machines had range enough to reach Vlamaland
6784-76151-0048	train-other-500	As soon as I could get my staff together I gave orders such as would insure discipline Then reminding my hearties that Klow knowing our helplessness would surely attack as soon as fully equipped I made this offer
6784-76151-0049	train-other-500	To the man who shall suggest the best way of meeting their attack I shall give the third of my empire So they knew that the case was desperate As for myself I slept not a bit
6784-76151-0050	train-other-500	but paced my sleep chamber and thought deeply Now a bit of a shell from an enemy slinger had penetrated my arm Till now I had paid no attention to it
6784-76151-0051	train-other-500	But it began to bother me so I pulled the metal from my arm with my teeth And quite by chance I placed the billet on the table within a few inches of the compass I had carried on my boat To my intense surprise
6784-76151-0052	train-other-500	the needle of the compass swung violently about so that one end pointed directly at the fragment of metal I moved them closer together there was no doubt that they were strongly attracted
6784-76151-0053	train-other-500	The enemy s shells were made of mere iron The moment I fully realized this I saw clearly how we might baffle the men of Klow I instantly summoned some men
none	none	 gave the orders much as though I had known for years what was to be done 
6784-76151-0054	train-other-500	and in a few moments had the satisfaction of seeing my messengers hurrying north and south And so it came about that within three days of our shameful retreat
6784-76151-0055	train-other-500	a tenth of my men were at work on the new project As yet there was no word from my spies across the sea but we worked with all possible haste And this very briefly is what we did
6784-76151-0056	train-other-500	We laid a gigantic line of iron clear across the empire From north to south from snow to snow one end was bedded in the island of Pathna where the north magnetic pole is found
none	none	 while the other stopped on the opposite side of the world 
6784-76151-0057	train-other-500	in a hole dug through the ice into the solid earth of the South Polar Plain And every foot of that enormous rod twas as big around as my leg
6784-76151-0058	train-other-500	was insulated from the ground with pieces of our secret non magnetic alloy Not for nothing had our chemists sought the metal which would resist the lightning And not for nothing did my bullies piece the rod together
6784-76151-0059	train-other-500	all working at the same time so that the whole thing were complete in seven days That is complete save for the final connecting link
none	none	 and that lay a loglike roll of iron at the door of my palace ready to be rolled into place when I were but ready And on the morrow the Klow reached our shores V 
6784-76152-0000	train-other-500	THE VICTORY My first intent was to let them advance unhampered
none	none	 but Maka pointed out that such a policy might give them suspicions 
6784-76152-0001	train-other-500	and so we disputed their course all the way I gave orders to show no great amount of resistance and thus the louts reached Vlama in high feather confident that the game was theirs
6784-76152-0002	train-other-500	I stood at the door of the palace as Klow himself rolled up to the edge of the parade ground My men obeying orders had given way to him his crews swarmed the space behind and on all sides of him
6784-76152-0003	train-other-500	while my own bullies were all about and behind the palace Never did two such giant armies face one another in peace for I had caused my banner to be floated wrong end to in token of surrender
6784-76152-0004	train-other-500	First a small body of subordinates waited upon me demanding that I give up the throne
none	none	 I answered that I would treat with none save Klow himself 
6784-76152-0005	train-other-500	and shortly the knave surrounded by perhaps fifty underlings stepped up before me Hail Stroker he growled his voice shaking a bit with excitement not with fear for he were a brave man
6784-76152-0006	train-other-500	Hail to thee and to thine and a pleasant stay in Hofe for ye all Hail Klow replied I glancing up meaningly at the air monsters wheeling there
6784-76152-0007	train-other-500	I take it that ye purpose to execute us
none	none	 Aye he growled savagely 
6784-76152-0008	train-other-500	Thou didst attack without provocation Thy life is forfeit and as many more as may be found needful to guarantee peace Then I quoth my manner changing
6784-76152-0009	train-other-500	then ye have saved me the trouble of deciding what shall be thy fate Execution say you So be it And I strode down to the great log of iron which lay ready to fill the gap
6784-76152-0010	train-other-500	Klow looked at me with a peculiar expression as though he thought me mad True it looked it how could I do him harm without myself suffering But I kicked the props which held the iron
6784-76152-0011	train-other-500	and gave it a start with my foot The ends of the pole to pole rod lay concealed by brush perchance fifty yards away In ten seconds that last section had rolled completely between them
6784-76152-0012	train-other-500	and only a fool would have missed seeing that the last ten feet the iron was fair jerked through the air As this happened we all heard a tremendous crackling like that of nearby lightning
6784-76152-0013	train-other-500	while enormous clouds of dust arose from the two concealed ends which were now become connections And at the same time a loud steely click just one and no more sounded from the intruding host
none	none	 For a moment Klow was vastly puzzled 
6784-76152-0014	train-other-500	Then he snarled angrily What means this foolery Strokor Advance and give up thy ax For answer I turned me about so as to face my men and held up my hand in signal
6784-76152-0015	train-other-500	Instantly the whistles sounded and my hearties came bounding into the field Treachery shouted Klow and his officers ran here and there shouting To arms Charge and destroy
none	none	 No quarter 
6784-76152-0016	train-other-500	But I paid little attention to the hubbub I were gazing up at those infernal creatures of the air and my heart sang within me as I saw them circling erratically but very surely down to the earth
6784-76152-0017	train-other-500	And as they came nearer my satisfaction was entire for their engines were silent At the same time consternation was reigning among our visitors
none	none	 Not a man of all Klow s thousands was able to move his car or lift a weapon 
6784-76152-0018	train-other-500	Every slinger was jammed as though frozen by invisible ice all their balls and shells were stuck together like the work of a transparent glue Even their side arms were locked in their scabbards
6784-76152-0019	train-other-500	and all their tugging could budge them not But none of my men were so handicapped Each man s chariot was running as though naught had happened
6784-76152-0020	train-other-500	they thundered forward discharging their balls and shells as freely as they had across the sea Their charge was a murderous one not a man of Klow s was able to resist save with what force he could put into his bare hands
none	none	 Klow saw all this from the middle of his group of officers 
6784-76152-0021	train-other-500	None were able to more than place his body twixt us and their chief In a very few moments they saw that the unknown magic had made them as children in our hands they were utterly lost
none	none	 and Klow turned away from the sight with a black face Again he faced me 
6784-76152-0022	train-other-500	What means this ye huge bundle of lies What mean ye by tricking us with yon badge of surrender only to tie our hands with thy magic of Hofe Is this the way to fight like a man
6784-76152-0023	train-other-500	I had stood at ease in my door since rolling the iron Now I looked about me still more easily my men were running down the louts who had jumped from their useless chariots and taken to their heels
none	none	 Twere but a matter of time before the army of Klow would be no more at that rate Klow I answered him mildly 
6784-76152-0024	train-other-500	ye are right this is not the way to fight like a man Neither I pointed out one of the fallen air cars neither is that the way
6784-76152-0025	train-other-500	flitting over our heads like shadows and destroying us with filthy smoke
none	none	 Shame on ye Klow for stooping to such And upon thy own head be the blame for the trick I have played upon ye 
6784-76152-0026	train-other-500	You attacked us without provocation he muttered sourly Aye and for a very good reason I replied Yet I see thy viewpoint
6784-76152-0027	train-other-500	and shalt give thee the benefit of the doubt I turned to my whistlers and gave an order so that presently the great slaughter had stopped My men and Klow s alike struggled back to see what were amiss
6784-76152-0028	train-other-500	I handed Klow an ax Throw away thine own scabbard and all I told him It is useless for tis made of iron
6784-76152-0029	train-other-500	Ours and all our tools of war are formed of an alloy which is immune from the magic He took the ax in wonderment What means it Strokor
6784-76152-0030	train-other-500	asked he again meanwhile stripping himself in a businesslike fashion that it were good to see It means said I throwing off my robe that I have unchained the magnetism of this world
none	none	 Know you Klow that all of the children of the sun are full of his power 
6784-76152-0031	train-other-500	it is like unto that of the tiny magnet which ye give children for to play but it is mighty even as our world is mighty Good Jon he gasped for his was not a daring mind
6784-76152-0032	train-other-500	What have ye done ye trifler I have transformed this empire into one vast magnet I answered coolly Then I showed him a boulder on the summit of a distant hill
6784-76152-0033	train-other-500	through the tube Klow could see some of my men standing beside it Place one of thy own men on the roof of the palace I told Klow and give him orders to lower my banner should ye give him the word
none	none	 For upon the outcome of this fight twixt me and thee Klow 
6784-76152-0034	train-other-500	hinges the whole affair If thou dost survive down comes my banner and my men on the hill shall topple the boulder which shall rush down the slope and burst the iron rod and break the spell
6784-76152-0035	train-other-500	Stand then and defend thyself And it did me good to see the spirit fly into his eyes He saw that his empire lived or died as he lived or died
6784-76152-0036	train-other-500	and he fought as he had never fought before Small man that he was beside myself he were wondrous quick and sure in his motions before I knew it he had bit his ax deep into my side
6784-76152-0037	train-other-500	And in another moment or two it was over
none	none	 For as soon as I felt the pain of that gash I flung my own blade away and with a roar such as would have shaken a stouter heart than his I charged the man took a second fearful blow full on my chest and heeding it not at all I snatched the ax from his hands Then as he turned to run I dropped that tool also And I ran him down and felled him and broke his head with my hands VI THE FITTEST Footnote This chapter was originally as long as the others but an unfortunate accident of mister Smith s before he was thoroughly familiar with the machine mutilated a large portion of the tape so badly that it was made worthless This explains why something appears to be missing from the account and also why this chapter begins in the middle of a sentence slaves but the most were slain Neither could we bother with their women and others left behind Now by this time the empire was as one man in its worship of me I had been emperor but a year and already I had made it certain that only the men of Vlamaland and no others should live in the sight of Jon So well thought they of me I might fair have sat upon my reputation and have spent my last days in feasting like the man before me But I was still too young and full of energy to take my ease I found myself more and more restless I had naught to do it had all been done At last I sent for old Maka Ye put me up to this ye old fraud I told him pretending to be wrathful Now set me another task or I ll have thy head He knew me too well to be affrighted He said that he had been considering my case of late Strokor thy father was right when he told thee to have naught to do with women That is to say he were right at the time Were he alive today I forgot to say that my father was killed in the battle across the sea he would of a certainty say that it were high time for thee to pick thy mate Remember Strokor great though thou art yet when death taketh thee thy greatness is become a memory Methinks ye should leave something more substantial behind It took but little thought to convince me that Maka were right once more Fact as soon as I thought upon it it were a woman that I was restless for The mere notion instantly gave me something worth while to look forward to Jon bless thee I told the old man Ye have named both the trouble and the remedy I will attend to it at once He sat thinking for some time longer Has thought of any woman in special Strokor said he I had not The idea was too new to me The best in the world shall be mine of course I told him But as for which one hast any notion thyself Aye he quoth Tis my own niece I have in mind Perchance ye remember her a pretty child who was with me when thou didst save my life up there on the mountainside I recalled the chit fairly well But she were not a vigorous woman Maka Think you she is fit for me Aye if any be he replied earnestly Ave is not robust true but her muscles are as wires It is because of what lies in her head however that I commend her I have taught her all I know So I exclaimed much pleased Then she is indeed fit to be the empress And as I recall her she were exceedingly good to look at Say no more Ave shall be the wife of Strokor And so it was arranged Well and there ye have the story of Strokor the mightiest man in the world and the wisest More than this I shall not tell with my own lips I shall have singers recite my deeds until half the compartments in the House of Words is filled with the records thereof But it were well that I should tell this much in mine own way My ambition is fulfilled Let the hand of Jon descend upon our world if it may I care not if presently the sun come nearer and the water dry up and the days grow longer and longer till the day and the year become of the same length I care not my people such as be left of them shall own what there is and shall live as long as life is possible I shall leave behind no race of weaklings Every man shall be fit to live and the fittest of them all shall live the longer And he no matter how many cycles hence shall look back to Strokor and to Ave his wife and shall say I am what I am the last man on the world because Strokor was the fittest man of his time Aye my fame shall live as long as there be life Tonight as I speak these things into the word machine my heart is singing with the joy of it all Thank Jon I were born a man not a woman Tomorrow I go to fetch Ave I shall not send for her I cannot trust her beauty to the hands of my crew The more I think of her the more I see that mine whole life hath been devised for this one moment I see that insignificant though she be Ave is a needed link in the chain I have come to want her more than food I am become a lovesick fool Aye I can afford to poke fun at myself I can afford anything in this world for I be its greatest man Its greatest man Here is the place to stop There is no more I can say the story is done the story of Strokor the greatest man in the whole world VII THE GOING Tis several years since last I faced this machine many and many a day since I said that my story was done and placed the record on the shelf of my anteroom my heart full of satisfaction And today I must needs add another record perhaps two to the pile When I set out for the highlands on the morn following what I last related I took with me but two or three men not that I had any need for guards but because it looketh not well for the emperor to travel without retainers however few Practically I was alone I reached the locality as the sun went down The sky was a brilliant color I remember it well Darkness would come soon though not as quickly as farther south Commonly I think not upon such trifles but I were nearing my love and tender things came easily to my mind My chariot kept to the road which lay alongside the irrigating flume a stone trough which runs from the snow covered hills to the dry country below I had already noted this flume where it emptied into the basin in the valley below for it had had a new kind of a spillway affixed to it a broad smooth platform with a slightly upward curve over which the water was shooting I saw no sense in the arrangement and made up my mind to ask Maka about it for the empire prized this trough most highly It ran straight and true over expensive bridges where needed with scarce a bend to hold back the flow When I stopped my car outside the house I was surprised that none should come out to greet me Maka had sent word of my coming all should have been in readiness But I was forced to use my whistle There was no stir I became angry I told my bullies to stay where they were and myself burst in the door The house was a sturdy stone affair of one floor set against the side of the mountain a short distance above the flume I looked about the interior in surprise for not a soul was in sight in any of the compartments There were signs that people had been there but a few moments before I called it strange for I had seen no one leave the house as I approached At last as I was inspecting the eating place I noted a small door let into the outer wall It was open and by squeezing I managed to get through I found that it let into a long dark passage I followed this going steadily down a flight of stairs and all of a sudden bumped into an iron grating At the same moment I saw that the passageway made a turn just beyond and by craning my neck and straining my eyes I could see a faintly lighted chamber just a few feet away And before my eyes could scarce make out the figures of some people in the middle of the place a voice came to my ear Hail Strokor it said and great was my astonishment as I recognized the tones of Edam the young dreamer whom Maka had brought to my house Edam I cried What do ye here Come and open these bars He made no reply save to laugh in a way I did not like I shook the grating savagely so that I felt it give Edam I roared Open this grating at once and tell me where is Ave I am here came another voice and I stopped in sheer surprise to peer closer and to see for the first time that it were really the dreamer and the chit these two and no more who sat there in the underground chamber They seemed to be sitting in some sort of a box with glass windows Ave come here I spoke much more gently than to Edam for my heart was soft with thoughts of her It is thy lord Strokor the emperor who calls thee Come I stay here said she in the same clear voice entirely unshaken by my presence Edam hath claimed me and I shall cleave to him I want none of ye ye giant For a moment I was minded to throw my weight against the barrier such was my rage Then I thought better on it and closely examined the bars Two were loose Ave said I contriving to keep my voice even although my hands were busy with the bars as I spake Ave ye do wrong to spite me thus Know ye not that I am the emperor and that these bars cannot stand before me I warn ye if I must call my men to help me and to witness my shame it will go hard with ye Better that ye should come willingly Ye are not for such as Edam No quoth the young man speaking up for the chit Ye are wrong Strokor We defy thee to do thy worst we are prepared to flee from ye at all costs I had twisted one of the bars out of my way without their seeing it I strove at the next as I answered still controlling my voice Twill do ye no good to flee Edam ye know that And as for Ave she shall wish she had never been born So I should she replied with spirit if I were to become thy woman But know you Strokor that Ave the daughter of Durok would rather die than take the name of one who had spurned her as ye did me So I had it had slipped my mind But I want thee now Ave said I softly preparing to slip through the opening I had made Surely ye would not take thine own life Nay she answered with a laugh in her voice Rather I would go with Edam here I would go she finished her voice rising in her excitement away from this horrible man s world away from it all Strokor and to Jeos Hear ye To Jeos And But at that instant I burst through the grating Without a sound I charged straight for the pair of them And without a sound they slipped away from before my grasp Next second I was gazing stupidly at the rushing swirling water of the flume And I saw that they had been sitting in the cabin of a tiny boat and that they had got away There was an opening into the outer air I rushed through and stared in the growing twilight down the black furrow of the flume Far in the distance and going like a streak I spied the glittering glass windows of the little craft Once I made out the flutter of a saucy hand We shall get them when they reach the valley I shouted to the men Then I reached for my tube and sighted it on the lower end of the flume far far below almost too far away to be clear to the naked eye In an incredibly short time the craft reached the end It traveled at an extraordinary rate perchance twas weighted I marveled that its windows could stand the force of the air And I scarce had time to fear that the twain should be destroyed on that upturned spillway before it was there And then an awesome thing happened As the boat struck the incline it shot upward into the air at a steep slant Up up it went my heart jumped into my mouth for surely they must be crushed when they came down But the craft did not come down It went on and on up and up its speed scarcely slackened twas like that of a shooting star And in far less time than it takes to tell it the little boat was high up among the stars going higher every instant and farther away from me And suddenly the sweat broke cold on my forehead for dead ahead directly in line with their travel lay the bluish white gleam of Jeos So great was my rage over the escape of the dreamer with my woman at first I felt no sorrow Later after days and days of search in and about the basin I came to grieve most terribly over my loss When I came home to the palace I was well nigh ill In vain did I make the most generous of rewards The whole empire turned out to search for the missing ones but nothing came of it all Yet I never ceased to hope especially after my talk with Maka Aye he said when I questioned him it were barely possible that they have left this world for all time I have calculated the speed which their craft might have attained had it the right proportions and in truth it might have left the spillway at such a speed that it entirely overcame the draw of the ground But I think it were a slim chance It is more than likely Strokor that Ave shall return to thee Was I not the fitter man Surely Edam s purpose could not succeed Jon would not have it so The woman was mine because I had chosen her and she must come back to me and in safety or I should tear Edam into bits But as time went on and naught transpired I became more and more melancholy Life became an empty thing it had been empty enough before I had craved the girl but now it was empty with hopelessness After a while I got to thinking of some of the things Maka had told me The more I thought of the future the blacker it seemed True there were many other women but there had been only one Ave No such beauty had ever graced this world before And I knew I could be happy with no other Now I saw that all my fame had been in vain I had lost the only woman that was fit for me and when I died there would be naught left but my name Even that the next emperor might blot out if he chose It had all been in vain It shall not be I roared to myself as I strode about my compartment gnawing at my hands in my misery And in just such a fit of helpless anger the great idea came to me No sooner conceived than put into practice I will not go closely into details I will relate just the outstanding facts What I did was to select a very tall mountain located almost on the equator and proclaimed my intention to erect a monument to Jon upon its summit I caused vast quanities of materials to be brought to the place and for a year a hundred thousand men labored to put the pieces together When they had finished they had made a mammoth tower partly of wood and partly of alloy It was made in sections so that it might be placed piece upon piece one above another high into the sky It was an enormous task When it was complete I had a tower as high as the mountain itself erected upon its summit And next I caused section after section of the long iron pole to pole rod which had tricked Klow to be hauled up into the tower I was only careful to begin the process from the top and work downward I gave word that the last three sections be inserted at midday at a given day And at that hour I was safe inside a non magnetic room I know right well when the deed was done There was a most terrific earthquake All about me though I could see nothing at all I could hear buildings falling The din was appalling At the same time the air was fairly shattered with the rattle of the lightning Never have I heard the like before The rod had loosed the wrath of the forces above our air And as suddenly the whole deafening storm ended Perchance the rod was destroyed by the lightning I never went to see For I know the electricity split the very ground apart But I gazed out of a window in the top of my palace and saw that I had succeeded Not a soul but myself remained alive None but buildings made of the alloy were standing Not only man but most of his works had perished in that awful blast I alone remained I Strokor am the survivor I the greatest man it were but fit that I should be the last No man shall come after me to honor me or not as he chooses I and no other shall be the last man And when Ave returns as she must though it be ages hence when she comes she shall find me waiting I Strokor the mighty and wise shall be here when she returns I shall wait for her forever here I shall always stay The stars may move from their places but I shall not go For it is my intention to make use of another secret Maka taught me In brief Footnote The record ends here It may be that Strokor left the machine for some trivial reason and forgot to finish his story At all events it is necessary to refer to the further discoveries of the expedition in order to learn the outcome of it all PART III THE SURVIVOR Provided with a sledge hammer a crowbar and a hydraulic jack and even with drills and explosives as a last resort Jackson Kinney and Van Emmon returned the same day to the walled in room in the top of that mystifying mansion The materials they carried would have made considerable of a load had not Smith removed enough of the weights from their suits to offset their burden They reached the unopened door without special exertion and with no mishap They looked in vain for a crack big enough to hold the point of the crowbar neither could the most vigorous jabbing loosen any of the material They dropped that tool and tried the sledge It got no results even in the hands of the husky geologist the most vigorous blows failed to budge the door They did not even dent it So they propped the powerful hydraulic jack a tool sturdy enough to lift a house at an angle against the door Then using the crowbar as a lever the architect steadily turned up the screw the mechanism multiplying his very ordinary strength a hundredfold In a moment it could be seen that he was getting results the door began to stir Van Emmon struck one edge with the sledge hammer and it gave slightly In another minute the whole door weighing over a ton had been pushed almost out of its opening The jack overbalanced toppled over they did not readjust it but threw their combined weight upon the barrier There was no need to try again With a shiver the huge slab of metal slid upright into the space beyond stood straight on end for a second or so then toppled to the floor AND THIS TIME THEY HEARD THE CRASH For as the door fell a great gust of wind rushed out with a hissing shriek almost overbalancing the men from the earth They stood still for a while breathing hard from their exertion trying in vain to peer into the blackness before them Under no circumstances would either of them have admitted that he was gathering courage In a minute the architect his eyes sparkling with his enthusiasm for the antique picked up the electric torch and turned it into the compartment As he did so the other two stepped to his side so that the three of them faced the unknown together It was just as well Outlined in that circle of light and not six feet in front of them stood a great chair upon a wide platform and seated in it erect and alert his wide open eyes staring straight into those of the three was the frightful mountainous form of Strokor the giant himself For an indeterminable length of time the men from the earth stood there speechless unbreathing staring at that awful monster as though at a nightmare He did not move he was entirely at ease and yet plainly on guard glaring at them with an air of conscious superiority which held them powerless Instinctively they knew that the all dominating voice in the records had belonged to this Hercules But their instinct could not tell them whether the man still lived It was the doctor s brain that worked first Automatically from a lifelong habit of diagnosis he inspected that dreadful figure quite as though it were that of a patient Bit by bit his subconscious mind pieced together the evidence the man in the chair showed no signs of life And after a while the doctor s conscious mind also knew He is dead he said positively in his natural voice and such was the vast relief of the other two that they were in no way startled by the sound Instantly all three drew long breaths the tension was relaxed and Van Emmon s curiosity found a harsh and unsteady voice How under heaven has he been preserved all this time Especially he added remembering considering the air that we found in the room The doctor answered after a moment his reply taking the form of advancing a step or two and holding out a hand It touched glass For the first time since the discovery the builder shifted the light He had held it as still as death for a full minute Now he flashed it all about the place and they saw that the huge figure was entirely encased in glass The cabinet measured about six feet on each of its sides and about five feet in height but such were the squat proportions of the occupant that he filled the whole space A slight examination showed that the case was not fixed to the platform but had a separate bottom upon which the stumplike chair was set Also they found that thanks to the reduced pull of the planet it was not hard for the three of them to lift the cabinet bodily despite its weight of almost a thousand pounds They left the tools lie there discarded as much weight as they could and proceeded to carry that ages old superman out into the light Here they could see that the great man was all but a negro in color It was equally clear however from an examination of his mammoth cranium and extraordinary expression that he was as highly developed along most mental lines as the greatest men on earth It was the back of his head however so flat that it was only a continuation of his neck or rather shoulders that told where the flaw lay That together with the hardness of his eye the cruelty of his mouth and the absolute lack of softness anywhere in the ironlike face or frame all this condemned the monster for what he was inhuman It was not easy to get him down the two flights of stairs More than once they had to prop the case on a step while they rested and at one time just before they reached that curious heap of rubbish at the foot of the upper stairs Jackson s strength gave way and it looked as though the whole thing would get away from them Van Emmon saved it at the cost of a bruised shoulder Once at the bottom of the lower flight the rest was easy Within a very few minutes the astonished face of the engineer was peering into the vestibule he could hardly wait until the air tight door was locked before opening the inner valves He stared at the mammoth figure in the case long and hard and from then on showed a great deal of respect for his three friends Of course at that time the members of the expedition did not understand the conditions of Mercury as they are now known They had to depend upon the general impression they got from their first hand investigations and it is remarkable that the doctor should have guessed so close to the truth He must have made up his mind to outlast everybody else was the way he put it as he kicked off his suit He stepped up to the cabinet and felt of the glass I wish it were possible without breaking the case to see how he was embalmed His fingers still rested on the glass Suddenly his eyes narrowed he ran his fingers over the entire surface of the pane and then whirled to stare at a thermometer That s mighty curious he ejaculated This thing was bitter cold when we brought it in Now it s already as warm as this car Smith s eyes lit up It may be he offered that the case doesn t contain a vacuum but some gas which has an electrical affinity for our atmosphere Or exclaimed the geologist suddenly the glass itself may be totally different from ours It may be made of GOD shouted the doctor jerking his hand from the cabinet and leaping straight backward At the same instant with a grinding crash all three sides of the case collapsed and fell in splinters to the floor Look out shrieked Jackson He was staring straight into the now unhooded eyes of the giant He backed away stumbled against a stool and fell to the floor in a dead faint Smith fumbled impotently with a hammer The doctor was shaking like a leaf But Van Emmon stood still in his tracks his eyes fixed on the Goliath his fingernails gashed the palms of his hands but he would not budge And as he stared he saw from first to last the whole ghastly change that came after billions of years of waiting to the sole survivor of Mercury A glaze swept over the huge figure Next instant every line in that adamant frame lost its strength the hardness left the eyes and mouth The head seemed to sink lower into the massive shoulders and the irresistible hands relaxed In another second the thing that had once been as iron had become as rubber But only for an instant Second by second that huge mountain of muscle slipped and jellied and actually melted before the eyes of the humans At the same time a curious acrid odor arose Smith fell to coughing The doctor turned on more oxygen In less than half a minute the man who had once conquered a planet was reduced to a steaming mound of brownish paste As it sank to the floor of the case it touched a layer of coarse yellow powder sprinkled there and it was this that caused the vapor In a moment the room was filled with the haze of it luckily the doctor s apparatus worked well And thus it came about that within five minutes from being exposed to the air of the sky car that whole immense bulk chair and all had vanished The powder had turned it to vapor and the purifying chemicals had sucked it up Nothing was left save a heap of smoking grayish ashes in the center of the broken glass Van Emmon s fingers relaxed their grip He stirred to action and turned briskly to Smith Here Help me with this thing Between them they got the remains of the cabinet with its gruesome load into the vestibule As for the doctor he was bending over Jackson s still unconscious form When he saw what the others were doing he gave a great sigh of relief Good He helped them close the door Let s get away from this damned place The outer door was opened At the same time Smith started the machinery and as the sky car shot away from the ground he tilted it slightly so that the contents of the vestibule was slid into space Down it fell like so much lead The doctor glanced through a nearby window and his face brightened as he made out the distant gleam of another planet He watched the receding surface of Mercury with positive delight Nice place to get away from he commented And now my friends for Venus and then home But the other s eyes were fixed upon a tiny sparkle in the dust outside the palace where the vestibule had dropped its load It was the sun shining upon some broken bits of glass the glass which for untold ages had enclosed the throne of the Death lord Part IV THE QUEEN OF LIFE I NEXT STOP VENUS When he first got the idea of the sky car the doctor never stopped to consider whether he was the right man for such an excursion Personally he hated travel He was merely a general practitioner with a great fondness for astronomy and the sole reason why he wanted to visit the planets was that he couldn t see them well enough with his telescope So he dabbled a little in magnetism and so forth and stumbled upon the principle of the cube But he had no mechanical ability and was on the point of giving up the scheme when he met Smith He was instantly impressed by the engineer s highly commonplace face he had had considerable experience with human contrariness and felt sure that Smith must be an absolute wonder since he looked so very ordinary Kinney s diagnosis proved correct Smith knew his business the machinery was finished in a hurry and done right However when it came to fitting the outfit into a suitable sky car Kinney was obliged to call in an architect That accounts for E Williams Jackson At the same time it occurred to the doctor that they would need a cook missus Kinney had refused to have anything whatever to do with the trip and so Kinney put an ad in the paper As luck would have it Van Emmon the geologist who had learned how to cook when he first became a mountaineer saw the ad and answered it in hope of adventure The doctor himself besides his training in the mental and bodily frailities of human beings had also an unusual command of the related sciences such as biology Smith s specialties have already been named he could drive an airplane or a nail with equal ease Van Emmon as a part of his profession was a skilled fossilologist and was well up in natural history As for E Williams Jackson the architect was also the sociologist of the four Moreover he had quite a reputation as an amateur antiquarian Nevertheless the most important thing about E Williams Jackson was not learned until after the visit to Mercury after the terrible end of that exploration after the architect falling in a faint had been revived under the doctor s care Gentlemen said Kinney coming from the secluded nook among the dynamos which had been the architect s bunk gentlemen I must inform you that Jackson is not what we thought He I mean she is a woman Which put an entirely new face upon matters The three men discussing it marveled that the architect had been able to keep her sex a secret all the time they were exploring at Mercury They did not know that none of E Williams Jackson s fellow architects had ever guessed the truth Ambitious and ingenious with a natural liking for house planning she had resolved that her sex should not stand in the way of success And when she finally came to herself there in her bunk and suspected that her secret was out instead of shame or embarrassment she felt only chagrin She walked rather unsteadily across the floor of the great cube shaped car to the window where the three were standing and as they quietly made a place for her she took it entirely as a matter of course and without a word The doctor had been speaking of the peculiar fitness of the four for what they were doing And if I m not mistaken he went on we re going to need all the brains we can pool when we get to Venus I never would have claimed when we started out that Mercury had ever been inhabited But now that we ve seen what we ve seen I feel dead sure that Venus once was peopled The four looked out the triple glazed vacuum insulated window at the steadily growing globe of Earth s twin sister Half in sunlight and half in shadow this planet for ages the synonym for beauty was now but a million miles away She looked as large as the moon but instead of a silvery gleam she showed a creamy radiance fully three times as bright Let s see reflected the geologist aloud As I recall it the brightness of a planet depends upon the amount of its air That would indicate then that Venus has about as much as the earth wouldn t it remembering how the home planet had looked when they left it The doctor nodded There are other factors but undoubtedly we are approaching a world which is a great deal like our own Venus is nearly as large as the earth has about nine tenths the surface and a gravity almost as strong The main difference is that she s only two thirds as far from the sun as we are How long is her day Smith wanted to know Can t say Some observers claim to have seen her clearly enough to announce a day of the same length as ours Others calculate that she s like Mercury always the same face toward the sun If so her day is also her year two hundred and twenty five of our days Van Emmon looked disappointed In that case she would be blistering hot on one side and freezing cold on the other except remembering Mercury except for the twilight zone where the climate would be neither one nor the other but temperate He pointed to the line down the middle of the disk before them the line which divided the lighted from the unlighted the day from the night The four looked more intently It should be remembered that the very brilliance of Venus has always hindered the astronomers the planet as a whole is always very conspicuous but its very glare makes it impossible to see any details The surface has always seemed to be covered by a veil of hazy faintly streaked vapor Smith gave a queer exclamation For a moment or two he stared hard at the planet then looked up with an apologetic grin I had a foolish idea I thought He checked himself Say doesn t Venus remind you of something The doctor slowly shook his head Can t say that it does Smith I have always considered Venus as having an appearance peculiarly her own Why The engineer started to answer stopped thought better of it and instead pointed out the half that was in shadow Why is it that we can make out the black portion so easily Kinney could answer this The fact is it isn t really black at all but faintly lighted Presumably it is star shine Star shine echoed the architect interested Just that You see finished the doctor if that side is never turned toward the sun then it must be covered with ice which would reflect the star Ah exclaimed Smith with satisfaction I wasn t so crazy after all My notion was that the whole blamed thing is covered with ice It looked reasonable Certainly the entire sphere had a somewhat watery appearance It prompted the geologist to say Kinney if that reflection is really due to ice then there must be plenty of water vapor in the air And if that s the case Not only is life entirely possible stated the doctor quietly but I ll bet you this sky car against an abandoned soap stone mine that we find humans or near human beings there when we land tomorrow II SPEAKING OF VENUS The architect was still dressed in the fashionably cut suit of men s clothes she had worn while in the car Van Emmon thought of this when he said somewhat awkwardly Well I m going to fix something to eat It ll be ready in half an hour Miss er Jackson She looked at him slightly puzzled then understood You mean to give me time to change my clothes Thanks but I m used to these And besides with spirit I never could see why women couldn t wear what they choose so long as it is decent There was no denying that hers were both becoming and decent Modeled after the usual riding costume both coat and breeches were youthfully rather than mannishly tailored and the narrow vertical stripe of the dark gray material served to make her slenderness almost girlish In short what with her poet style hair her independent manner and direct speech she was far more like a boy of twenty than a woman nearing thirty She walked with Van Emmon dodging machinery all the way across the big car to the little kitchenette over which he had presided There to his dismay the girl took off her coat rolled up her sleeves and announced her intention of helping You re a good cook Van I mean mister Let it go at Van please said he hastily My first name is Gustave but nobody has ever used it since I was christened Same with my Edna she declared Mother s name was Williams and I was nicknamed Billie before I can remember So that s settled with great firmness The point is Van you re a good cook but everything tastes of bacon I wish you d let me boss this meal He looked rebellious for an instant then gave a sigh of relief I m really tickled to death A little later the doctor and Smith looking across saw Van Emmon being initiated into the system which constructs scalloped potatoes Next he was discovering that there is more than one way to prepare dried beef For once we won t cream it said E Billie Jackson dryly as Van Emmon laid down the can opener We ll make an omelet out of it and see if anything happens She was already beating the eggs He cut up the meat into small pieces and when he was finished took the egg beater away from her He turned it so energetically that a speck of foam flew into his face Go slow she advised nonchalantly reaching up with a dish towel and wiping the fleck away Whereupon he worked the machine more furiously than ever Soon he was wondering how on earth he had come to assume all along that she was not a woman He now saw that what he had previously considered boyishness in her was in fact simply the vigor and freshness of an earnest healthy energetic girl It dawned upon him that her keen gray eyes were not sharp but alert her mouth not hard but resolute her whole expression instead of mannish just as womanly as that of any girl who has been thrown upon her own resources and made good He soon found that his eyesight did not suffer in any way because he looked at her Now she remarked in her businesslike way as she placed the brimming pan into the oven I suppose that I ll hear various hints to the effect that a woman has no business trying to do men s stunts And I warn you right now that I m prepared to put up a warm argument Of course said the geologist with such gravity that the girl knew he didn t mean it of course a woman s place is in the home Surrounded by seventeen or eighteen children and cooking for that many more hired men besides she is simply ideal We realize that Then admitting that much why shouldn t a woman be as independent as she likes Think what women did during the war remember what a lot of women are doctors and lawyers Is there any good reason why I couldn t design a library as well as a man could None at all agreed Van Emmon handing over the dish of chopped meat The girl carefully folded the contents into the now spongelike omelet as he went on By the way a neighbor of mine told me just before I left that he was having trouble with a broken sewer How d you like to About as well as you d like to darn socks she came back evidently being primed for such comments She took a look at the potatoes and then permitted the geologist to open their sixth can of peaches I must say they re good she admitted as she noted the eagerness with which he obeyed Bread and butter olives coffee and cake completed that meal The table was set with more care than usual a clean cloth and napkins being unearthed for the occasion When Smith and Kinney were called both declared that they weren t hungry enough to do justice to it all It s just as well you weren t very hungry commented Billie as she finished giving each of them a second helping of the potatoes There s barely enough left for me and she took it Say I never thought of it before Miss er Miss Billie said Smith coloring but you eat just as much as a man Ye gods how shocking she jeered Come to think of it Smith you eat MORE than a woman The doctor s face grew red with some suppressed emotion After a while he said soberly I ll tell you what s worrying Smith He s afraid that women having suddenly become very progressive will forge entirely ahead of men You understand having started they can t stop And I must admit that I ve thought seriously of it at times myself Me too added Van Emmon earnestly I have the same feeling about it that an elderly man must have when he sees a young one get on the job Instead of being glad that the women are making good I sort of resent it I knew it exclaimed the girl delightedly But I never heard a man admit it before Perhaps it isn t as serious as we think said the practical Smith scraping the bottom of the potato pan I believe that the progress of women may have a fine effect upon men making us less self satisfied and more alert For one thing glancing about the cube we ve got to clean up a bit now that we know you re a woman The architect s eyes flashed Because you know mighty well I ll light in and do it myself if you don t that s what you mean Please take notice that I m to be respected not because of what I AM but because of what I can DO In behalf of myself and companions I surrender said the doctor gallantly Then he instantly added And yet even when we are actually chivalrous we are disregarding your desire to be appreciated for what you are worth Pardon me Miss Billie I ll not forget again At the same time my dear remembering that he had a daughter of his own nearly the builder s age we men have come to think of women primarily as potential mothers and secondarily as people of affairs And considering that motherhood is something that is denied to us lords of the earth For which we can thank a merciful Providence interjected the girl solemnly Considering this excuse my seriousness really amazing fact you can t blame us for expecting women to fulfil this vital function before taking up other matters Yes remarked the girl watching the peaches with anxious eye as Van Emmon helped himself Funny but I always understood that the first function of man was to father the race yet invariably the young fellows try to make names for themselves before not after they marry Scalped chuckled Van Emmon as the doctor hid his discomfiture behind a large piece of cake You may know a lot about Venus doc but you don t know much about women Speaking about Venus Smith was reminded we may learn something bearing upon the very point we have been discussing if Kinney s right about the inhabitants The doctor nodded eagerly You see if there s people still alive on the planet they re probably further advanced than we on the earth Other things being equal of course Being a smaller planet than ours she cooled off sooner and thus became fit for life earlier And having been made from the same batch to use Van s expression that Mercury and all the rest were why in all likelihood evolution has taken place there much the same as with us only sooner I should expect he elaborated largely that we shall find the inhabitants much the same as we humans only extremely civilized It may be that they are as far above us as we are above monkeys Smith broke in by quoting an astronomer who contended that Venus kept only one face toward the sun Maybe she always did Kinney The doctor shook his head See how perfectly round she is No oblateness whatever It proves that she once revolved otherwise she d be pear shaped from the sun s pull There was a short silence during which Billie concluded that the only scraps left would be the coffee grounds Then Van Emmon pushed away from the table got to his feet stretched a little to relieve his nerves and said Well whatever we find on Venus I hope the women do the cooking III THE FIRST VENUSIAN When the sky car was within a thousand miles of the surface Smith adjusted the currents so that the floor was directed downward The four changed from the window to the deadlight and watched the approaching disk with every bit of the excitement and interest they had felt when nearing Mercury The doctor had warned them that the heavy atmosphere which Venus was known to possess would prevent seeing as clearly as in the case of the smaller planet All were much disappointed however to find that they were still unable to make out a single definite detail The great half shining half black world showed nothing but that vaguely streaked ice like haze There was something very queer about it all Strange that we should see no movement in those clouds mused the doctor aloud That is if they really are clouds Van Emmon already doubted it Just what I was thinking There ought to be terrific winds yet so far as I have seen there s been nothing doing anywhere on the surface since we first began to observe it After a while the doctor put away his binoculars and rubbed his eyes We might as well descend faster Smith Can t see a thing from here Unhindered by air to impede its progress the sky car had been hurtling through space at cometary speed Now however Smith added the power of the apparatus to the pull of the planet so that the disk began to rush toward them at a truly alarming rate After a few seconds of it Billie found herself unconsciously moving to the side of the geologist He looked down at her understood and flushed with pleasure There s no danger he confidently assured her with the result that her courage fortified the girl moved back to her place again Van Emmon inwardly kicked himself So deceptive was that peculiar fogginess Smith throttled their descent as soon as they had reached the point where the planet s appearance changed from round to flat They were headed for the line which marked the boundary of the shadow This gray twilight zone was three or four hundred miles in width on the right of it to the east the dazzling surface of that sunlit vapor contrasted sharply with the all but black mistiness of the starward side Clearly the zone ought to be temperate enough Down they sank As they came nearer a curious pinkish tint began to show beneath them Shortly it became more noticeable the doctor gave a sudden grunt of satisfaction and Smith stopped the car A minute later the doctor had taken a sample of the surrounding ether through his laboratory test vestibule and shortly announced that they were now floating in air instead of space Good deal like ours back home too exultingly Pretty thin of course He made a short calculation referring to the aneroid barometer which was mounted on the outer frame of a window and said he judged that their altitude was about five miles The descent continued Smith using the utmost caution The other three kept their eyes glued to the deadlight and their mystification was only equaled by their uneasiness as that motionless bleary glaze failed absolutely to show anything they had not seen a thousand miles higher Not a single detail It reminds me said the girl in a low voice of something I once saw from the top of a hill It was the reflection of the sun from the surface of a pond not clear water but covered with Good Heavens interrupted Van Emmon struck with the thought Can it be that the whole planet is under water Beyond a doubt his guess was justified There was an oily smoothness about that dazzling haze which made it remarkably like a lake of still and rather dirty water under a bright sun But the doctor said no Any water I ever heard of would make clouds said he and we know there s air enough to guarantee plenty of wind Yet nothing seems to be in motion He was frowning continually now It was Billie who first declared that she saw the surface Stop she said to Smith evenly and he instantly obeyed All four gathered around the deadlight and soon agreed that the peculiarly elusive skin of the planet was actually within sight However it was like deciding upon the distance of the moon as easy to say that it were within arm s reach as a long ways off The doctor went to a window There he could look out upon the sun a painfully bright object much larger than it looks from the Earth It was just ascending and half of it was below the horizon A blinding streak of light was reflected from a point on the surface not far from the cube Shading his eyes with his hand the doctor could see that the mysterious crust was absolutely smooth On the opposite side of the car the horizon ended in a sunrise glow of a slightly greenish radiance From that side the pinkish tint of the surface was quite pronounced Before going any lower the doctor struck with an idea declared We always want to remember that this car is perfectly soundproof Suppose we open the outer door of the vestibule I imagine we ll learn something peculiar It was possible to open this door without touching the inner valves using mechanism concealed within the walls The moment it was done the door faced the north pandemonium itself broke loose A most terrific shrieking and howling came from the outside it was wind passing at a rate such as would make a hurricane seem a mere zephyr The doctor closed the door so that they could think It s the draft he concluded the draft from the sun warmed side to the cold side As for Van Emmon he was getting out a rope and a heavy leaden weight On the rope he formed knots every five feet about twenty of them and after getting into one of the insulated aluminum armored and oxygen helmeted suits with which they had explored Mercury he locked himself on the other side of the inner vestibule door and proceeded to sound To the amazement of all except Billie bottom was reached in less than twenty feet I thought so she said with satisfaction but she was not at ease until Van Emmon had returned in safety from that booming whistling turmoil His first remark upon removing his helmet almost took them off their feet The point is said he throttling his excitement the point is the rope was nearly jerked out of my hands Understand what I mean The surface is REVOLVING This upset every idea they had had it never occurred to any of them that the planet could revolve at such speed that it would appear stationary Smith went at once to the eastern window and watched closely for fear some irregularity in that apparently perfect sphere might catch them unawares They did not learn till later that Venus s day is a little less than twenty five hours and therefore since they had approached her near the equator the wind they had encountered was moving at nearly nine hundred miles per hour Bit by bit though the cube answered to the wind pressure Soon they noted the sun rising slowly and by the time it was two hours high the surface which had been whizzing under them like some highly polished top became entirely motionless The cube had stopped One minute later the car touched the level Smith very slowly reduced the repelling current so that the immense weight of the cube was but gradually shifted to the unknown surface beneath Ton after ton was added until Stop came from the doctor He had noted through the window a slight curvature in the material So the machinery was left in action At any rate said Smith we know that the confounded stuff isn t antimagnetic whatever it is Of course this was true even though the gelatinlike shell could not support the cube s weight yet it did not insulate the planet from the repelling current The thermometer registered three hundred and thirty five degrees Fahrenheit Two hundred and eighty degrees higher than it would be at home in the same latitude remarked the doctor We ll have to use the suits He took it for granted that exploration should begin at once No one stayed behind The machines could be relied upon as they knew from nearly two weeks of use and certainly there was nothing in sight which could possibly interfere with the cube Nevertheless the matter of fact engineer took care to remove part of the door operating apparatus when he left the vestibule and nobody commented upon it It seemed the sensible thing to do that was all There was just about enough additional weight in their suits to balance the slightly reduced gravitation so they moved about four misshapen metallic hulks with as much freedom as though back home Always they kept within a few feet of each other so as to throw no strain on their interconnecting telephone wires The big glass faced helmets gave a remarkable sense of security They made a complete circuit of the cube and at the end of it looked at each other in perplexity Never save in the middle of an ocean in the doldrums did any man ever see such a totally barren spot Not a tree much less a sign of human occupation there was not even the slightest mound The planet was in actual fact as smooth and as bare as a billiard ball Moreover the surface itself remained as mysterious as before Of course they did not touch it with bare hands all wore insulated mittens but the dazzling stuff was certainly as hard as steel and as highly polished It was neither transparent nor opaque but translucent like pink mother of pearl as Billie suggested She was the first to propose that they move to another spot We ought to try a place where it s not yet dawn said she shielding her eyes from the glare It will be remembered that the suits protected them from the heat itself Can t see anything Hush hissed the doctor They turned and followed his gaze to a spot not thirty feet from where they stood At the same instant they felt a faint jar in the material under their feet And next second they saw that a large section of the supposedly solid surface was in motion A portion about ten feet square was being lifted bodily in front of their eyes and before another word was said this block of the unknown substance was raised until they could see that it was all of a yard thick Up it went at the same deliberate rate and the four involuntarily moved closer together as they saw that there was something underneath It was a cage for all the world like that of an elevator except that it was made of clear glass Another second and it had stopped with its floor level with the surface and the people from the earth saw that it contained a man He was quite tall slenderly built and dressed in a queer satiny material which fitted him like an acrobat s suit He was extremely thin as to legs narrow as to shoulders deep in the chest and short in the waist All this however they saw after their inspection of his head It was human Marvelously refined in every detail yet it was set upon a graceful neck and modeled upon much the same lines as that of any man It was not that of a brute nor yet that of a bird it was human He stood at ease resting slightly on one foot and dispelled any notion that he might be unreal by shifting his weight occasionally Meanwhile he watched the four with a grave interested smile and they in turn came closer His chin was small even retreating but his mouth was wide and curved into an exaggerated Cupid s bow Even as he continued to smile the curves did not leave his lips they however were thin rather than thick His nose was quite small with a decidedly Irish cast but his eyes set far apart above quite shallow cheekbones were exceedingly large and of a brilliant blue In fact it was mainly his eyes that gave character to his face although none could overlook his breadth of forehead running back to a cranium that fairly bulged over the ears and seemed ready to rise like a tightly inflated balloon His skin was pure white And so they stood for uncounted minutes At last the doctor noted that the stranger was eying them with far less interest than they showed in him he stood as though he felt on display and the doctor gave an exclamation of perplexity that broke the spell The four impulsively drew up to the glass Van Emmon touched it with his mitten and that is how the four explorers came to receive the vibrations that came next For the man in the cage in turn put out his hand and touched the glass opposite Van Emmon Then he opened his mouth I am very glad to see you said he in a soft pulsating voice and in the best of English IV A PUZZLED WORLD For a moment blank amazement gripped the four Then amazement gave way to genuine apprehension Were they insane to imagine that this man of another world had spoken to them in their own language Each looked at the other and was astounded to see that all had heard the same thing Presently the stranger spoke again if anything the kindly smile on his face became even broader Suppose we postpone explaining how I am able to use your tongue It will be easier for you to understand after you have been with us a while He spoke slowly and carefully yet with a faint lisp much as some infant prodigy might speak But there was no doubt that he had really done it The doctor managed to clear his throat You are right said he with vastly less assurance than the amazing stranger We will try to understand things in the order you think best to present them You should know best Kinney introduced himself by name and profession also the other three The stranger nodded affably to each You may call me Estra said he pronouncing it Ethtra There is no occupation on the Earth corresponding with mine but in my spare moments I am an astronomer like yourself The doctor silently marveled He had not told the stranger about his hobby Meanwhile the architect attempted to break the ice even finer We take it for granted said she rather nervously that your people are somewhat further advanced than us on the earth However we expect to be given credit for having visited your planet before you visited ours She said this with an engaging smile which won an instant response the Venusian s lips almost lost their curves in his generous effort You will find that we greatly respect all that you have accomplished he declared earnestly As for your apparatus glancing at the cube you have the advantage on the earth of certain chemical elements which are entirely lacking here otherwise we should have called upon you long ago He slipped a panel of glass to one side Step in quickly he exclaimed gasping and the four obeyed him without thought It was only when the panel was replaced that they noticed the floor of the cage it was of clear glass like the sides and looked totally incapable of bearing their combined weight The Venusian smiled at Smith s worried look The material is amply strong enough said he I am only concerned about your machine there Is it safe to be left alone So far as we know yes answered Van Emmon who did not feel quite as much confidence in the stranger as the rest Then we can go down at once With these words the man in satin turned to a small black box in one wall of the elevator and touched a button Footnote For details of this and other matters of an electrical and mechanical nature the technical reader is referred to mister Smith s reports to the A S M E Instantly the car began to descend at first slowly and then with swiftly increasing velocity By the time the explorers had accustomed their eyes to the sudden semi darkness the cage was dropping at such a speed that the air fairly sang past its sides Far overhead was a square black shadow in the waxlike crust which they had left it was the shadow of the cube All about them was a dimly lit network of braces arches and semitransparent columns to all appearances the system seemed to support the crust Billie whirled upon the Venusian I ve got it now The whole globe is covered with glass Estra smiled his approval For thousands upon thousands of centuries my friend The thing was done when our ancestors first suspected that our planet was doomed to come so near the sun It was the only way we could protect ourselves from the heat Great exploded the doctor admiration overcoming regret that he had not thought of it himself But Smith had other thoughts How long did it take to finish the job And what did it cost Two centuries and about twice the cost of your last war I need only suggest to you that we colored the material so as to reflect most of the heat That is why the material looks blue from below although pink from above Say from Billie how long are we to keep on dropping like this We will arrive in a moment or two answered the smiling one The roof is raised several miles above the sea level in order to cover all the mountains By this time the four were able to make out things pretty well They saw that the dimness was only relative the Venusian world was actually as well lighted as any part of the earth on a cloudy day And they saw that they were descending in a locality of astonishing beauty The stranger halted the car so that they could inspect the scene as though from an airplane In no way did the landscape resemble that of the earth To begin with pillars of huge dimensions were placed every quarter mile or so it was these that supported the intricate archwork above They were made of the same translucent stuff as the crust but had a light topaz tint The Venusian said You will not need to be told that the science of metallurgy has advanced quite far with us All our metals can be made transparent if we like those pillars are colored variously in different regions so as to be clearly distinguishable and prevent collisions of flying apparatus But Van Emmon and Billie were both more interested in what lay between the columns They scarcely noticed that there were no people in sight at the time The ground was covered with an indescribable wealth of color and it was only by a close examination that the buildings could be distinguished as such For they were all made of that semi transparent stuff Of every conceivable tint and shade the structure showed an utter lack of uniformity in size shape or arrangement Moreover the ground was absolutely packed with them they spread as far as the eye could reach But if there was profusion there also was confusion apparently Streets ran anywhere and everywhere there was no visible system to anything And where there was no space for a building invariably there was a shrub a bush or a small tree of some kind all in full flower The only sign of regularity to be seen was in the roofs practically all of them were flat Whether the building was some rambling loosely gathered agglomeration of vari colored wings or a single towering skyscraper of one tint almost inevitably it was crowned with a perfectly level surface I see said Van Emmon thoughtfully You have no rain Precisely from Estra We have the air completely under our control We give our vegetation artificial showers when we think it should have it not when nature wills and similarly we use electricity instead of sunlight that we may stimulate its growth In short Van Emmon put it as the car slid slowly down the remaining distance in short you have abolished the weather The Venusian nodded And I ll save you the trouble of suggesting he added that we are nothing more nor less than hothouse people V THE HUMAN CONSERVATORY But there is this difference he cautioned as they stepped out of the elevator into a sort of a plaza 
6749-76160-0000	train-other-500	that whereas you people on the earth have only begun to use the hothouse principle we here have perfected it I suggest that you waste no time looking for faults Van Emmon stared at the doctor
6749-76160-0001	train-other-500	How does this idea fit your theory Kinney that Venus is simply the earth plus several thousand extra generations of civilization Fit echoed the doctor Fits like a glove
none	none	 We humans are fast becoming a race of indoor people despite all the various back to nature movements Look at the popularity of inclosed automobiles for example The only thing that surprises me 
6749-76160-0002	train-other-500	turning to their guide is that you use your legs for their original purpose Estra smiled and pointed out something standing a few feet away It was a small shuttle shaped air craft
6749-76160-0003	train-other-500	with clear glass sides which had actually made them overlook it at first Peering closer they saw that the plaza and surrounding streets were nearly filled with these all but invisible cars The Venusian explained
none	none	 You marvel that I use my legs and walk the same as you do 
6749-76160-0004	train-other-500	I am glad you have brought up this point because it is a fact that our people use mechanisms instead of bodily energy almost altogether These cars you see are universally used for transportation I am one of the very few
6749-76160-0005	train-other-500	who appreciate the value of natural exercise Do you mean to say demanded Van Emmon that the average Venusian does no walking Not a mile a year said Estra gravely
6749-76160-0006	train-other-500	Just what he is obliged to do indoors from room to room And he involuntarily glanced down at his own extremely thin legs
none	none	 The architect s eyes widened with a growing understanding 
6749-76160-0007	train-other-500	I see now she murmured That s why there was no one else to greet us The Venusian smiled gratefully We thought it best You d have been shocked outright I am sure
none	none	 had you been introduced to a representative Venusian 
6749-76160-0008	train-other-500	without any explanation They fell silent Still without moving from the point where they had left the elevator
none	none	 the four from the earth examined the surrounding buildings in a renewed effort to see some system in their arrangement Directly in front of them 
6749-76160-0009	train-other-500	was a particularly large structure Like all the rest it was of hopelessly irregular design yet it had a large domed central portion which gave it the appearance of an auditorium
none	none	 and the effect was further borne out by a subdued humming sound which seemed to come from it Smith asked Estra if it were a hall Yes and no was the answer It fills the purpose of a hall but is not built on the hall plan 
6749-76160-0010	train-other-500	And Smith tried to stare through the translucent walls of the thing The other buildings within immediate reach were of every possible appearance Some would have passed for cottages others for stores still others
6749-76160-0011	train-other-500	for the most fanciful of studios And nowhere was there such a thing as a sign even at the street corners much less on a building Not that we would be able to read your signs if you had them commented the doctor
6749-76160-0012	train-other-500	but I d like to know how your people find their way without something of that kind to guide them Estra s smile did not change That is something you will understand better before long said he
6749-76160-0013	train-other-500	provided you feel ready to explore a little further The four looked at each other in question and suddenly it struck them all
none	none	 that they were a rather pugnacious looking crew 
6749-76160-0014	train-other-500	in their cumbersome suits of armor and formidable helmets The doctor turned to Estra You ought to know he appealed whether we can take off these suits now It would be best was the reply
none	none	 You will find the air and temperature decidedly more warm and moist than what you have been used to but otherwise practically the same There is a slightly larger proportion of oxygen that is all Just imagine you are in a hothouse Smith and the doctor were already discarding their suits 
6749-76160-0015	train-other-500	Van Emmon and Billie followed more slowly the one because he did not share the doctor s confidence in their guide the other because of a sudden shyness in his presence The Venusian noted this
6749-76160-0016	train-other-500	You need not feel any embarrassment said he to Billie s vast astonishment There is no distinction here between the dress of the two sexes And again all four marveled that he should know so much about them
6749-76160-0017	train-other-500	Once out of the armor the visitors felt much more at ease The slightly reduced gravitation gave them a sense of lightness and freedom which more than balanced the junglelike oppressiveness of the air
6749-76160-0018	train-other-500	They found themselves guarding against a certain exuberance perhaps it was the extra oxygen too They strode toward the large structure directly ahead At its entrance a wide square portal
6749-76160-0019	train-other-500	which opened into a fan shaped lobby Estra paused and smiled apologetically as he mopped his forehead and upper lip with a paper handkerchief
none	none	 which he immediately dropped into a small 
6749-76160-0020	train-other-500	trap covered opening in the wall at his side These little doors by the way were to be seen at frequent intervals wherever they went Incidentally not a scrap of paper or other refuse was to be noted anywhere
6749-76160-0021	train-other-500	streets and all were spotless As for Estra I am not accustomed to moving at such speed he explained his discomfort If you do not mind please walk a little more leisurely
none	none	 They took their time about passing through this lobby For one thing Estra said there would have to be a small delay and for another the walls and ceilings of the space 
6749-76160-0022	train-other-500	were most remarkably ornamented They were fairly covered with what appeared at first glance to be absolutely lifelike paintings and sculptures They were so arranged as to strengthen the structural lines of the place and of course
none	none	 they were of more interest to Billie than to the others 
6749-76160-0023	train-other-500	Footnote The specialist in architecture and related subjects is referred to E Williams Jackson s report to the A I A for details of these basrelief photographs
6749-76160-0024	train-other-500	Desiring to examine some of the work far overhead Billie clambered up on a convenient pedestal in order to look more closely She took the strength of things for granted
6749-76160-0025	train-other-500	and put her weight too heavily on a molding on the edge of the pedestal with the result that there was a sharp crack and the girl struck the floor in a heap She got to her feet before Van Emmon could reach her side but her face was white with pain
none	none	 Sprained ankle said she between set lips and proceeded to stump up and down the lobby to limber up as she said although her three companions offered to do anything that might relieve her To the surprise of all Estra leaned against a pillar and watched the whole affair with perfect composure He made no offer of help said nothing whatever in sympathy In a moment he noticed the looks they gave him their stares I must beg your pardon he said still smiling 
6749-76160-0026	train-other-500	I am sorry this happened it will not be easy to explain But you will find all Venusians very unsympathetic Not
none	none	 that we are hard hearted 
6749-76160-0027	train-other-500	but because we simply lost the power of sympathy We do not know what pity is We have eliminated everything that is disagreeable all that is painful from our lives to such an extent that
6749-76160-0028	train-other-500	there is never any cause for pity The three young people could say nothing in answer The doctor however spoke thoughtfully Perhaps it is superfluous but tell me have you done away with injustice Estra
none	none	 That is just the point agreed the Venusian Justice took the place of pity and mercy it was so long ago I am barely able to appreciate your own views on the subject Billie her ankle somewhat better 
6749-76160-0029	train-other-500	turned to examine other work but at the moment another Venusian approached from the upper end of the lobby Walking slowly he carried four small parcels with a great deal of effort and the explorers had time to scrutinize him closely
6749-76160-0030	train-other-500	He was built much like Estra but shorter and with a little more flesh about the torso His forehead bulged directly over his eyes instead of above his ears as did Estra s
6749-76160-0031	train-other-500	also his eyes were smaller and not as far apart His whole expression was equally kind and affable despite a curiously shriveled appearance of his lips
none	none	 they made the front of his mouth quite flat and served to take attention away from his pitifully thin legs Estra greeted him with a cheery phrase in a language decidedly different from any the explorers were familiar with 
6749-76160-0032	train-other-500	In a way it was Spanish or rather the pure Castilian tongue but it seemed to be devoid of dental consonants
none	none	 It was very agreeable to listen to Estra however had taken the four parcels from his comrade and now presented him to the four saying that his name was Kalara and that he was a machinist He cannot use your tongue said the Venusian 
6749-76160-0033	train-other-500	Few of us have mastered it There are difficulties As for these machines
none	none	 unwrapping the parcels 
6749-76160-0034	train-other-500	I must apologize in advance for certain defects in their design I invented them under pressure so to speak having to perfect the whole idea in the rather short time that has elapsed since you doctor began the sky car And
6749-76160-0035	train-other-500	what is the purpose of the machines from Billie as she was about to accept the first of the devices from the Venusian For some reason he appeared to be especially interested in the girl and addressed half of his remarks to her and
6749-76160-0036	train-other-500	it was while his smiling gaze was fixed upon her eyes that he gave the answer They are to serve very carefully partly as lexicons and partly as grammars
none	none	 In short they are mechanical interpreters VI THE TRANSLATING MACHINES First let me remind you said the Venusian of our lack of certain elements that you are familiar with on the Earth We have never been able to improve on the common telephone That is why we must still assemble in person whenever we have any collective activity while on the Earth the time will come when your wireless principle will be developed to the point of transmitting both light and sound and after that there will be little need of gatherings of any sort Then he explained the apparatus It consisted of a miniature head telephone connected to a small metallic case the size of a cigar box the cover of which was a transparent diaphragm Estra did not open the case but showed the mechanism through the cover Essentially this is a word for word device said he pointing to a swiftly revolving dial within the box On one face of that dial are some ten thousand word images made by vibration after the phonograph method Directly opposite on the other face are the corresponding words in the other language The disk is rotating at such an enormous speed that for all practical purposes any word which may chance to be spoken will be translated almost instantaneously He indicated two delicate many tentacled feelers as he called them one on each face of the disk One of these felt the proper word image as it whirled beneath while the other established an electrical contact with the corresponding waves beneath at the same time exciting a complicated looking talking machine That commented Estra is not so easy to explain It transforms this literal translation into an idiomatic one Perhaps you will understand its workings a little later when you learn how and why I am able to use your own language By this time the four had reached the point where nothing could surprise them They were becoming accustomed to the unaccustomed Had they been told that the Venusians had abolished speech altogether they would have felt disappointed but not incredulous However the doctor thought of something Have you any extra records to be used in case we visit some other nations while we are here For just a second the Venusian was puzzled then his smile broadened The one record will do said he wherever you go A universal language Billie s eyes sparkled with interest Long long ago Estra said It was established soon after our league of nations was formed Does the league actually prevent war and promote peace demanded Van Emmon This had been a disputed question when the four left the earth We no longer have a league of nations said their guide slowly And instantly the four were eying him eagerly This was really refreshing to find that the Venusians were actually lacking in something So it didn t work commented the doctor disappointed But the Venusian s smile was still there It worked itself out said he We have no further use for a league We have no more nations We are now one And he helped them adjust the machines The cases were slung over their shoulders and the telephones clamped to their ears When all ready Estra began to talk and his voice came nearly as sharp and clear through the apparatus as before It was modified by a metallic flatness together with a certain amount of mechanical noise in which a peculiar hissing was the most noticeable Otherwise he said I am now using my own language If I make any mistakes you must not blame the machine It is as nearly perfect as I was able to make it He then asked them what blunders they noted Billie who was the most enthusiastic about the thing declared that they would have no trouble in understanding whereupon Estra quietly asked Do you feel like going now to try them out Once more an exchange of glances between the four from the earth Clearly the Venusians were extremely considerate people to leave their visitors in the care of the one man apparently who was able to make them feel at home There seemed to be no reason for uneasiness But Van Emmon still had his old misgivings about Estra There was something about the effeminate Venusian which irritated the big geologist it always does make a strong man suspicious to see a weaker one show such self confidence Van Emmon drew the doctor and Billie aside while Smith and Estra went on with the test Said Van Emmon It just occurred to me that the cube might look pretty good to these people You remember what this chap said about their lack of some of our chemicals What do you think is it really safe to put ourselves entirely in their power You mean said the doctor slowly that they might try to keep us here rather than lose the cube Van Emmon nodded gravely but Billie had strong objections Estra doesn t look like that sort she declared vehemently He s too good natured to be a crook he needs a guardian rather than a warden It flashed into the doctor s mind that many a woman had fallen in love with a man merely because he seemed to be in need of some one to take care of him That is the self reliant kind of woman and Billie certainly was self reliant Something of the same notion came vaguely to the geologist at the same time and with a vigor that was quite uncalled for he urged I say safety first We shouldn t have left the cube unguarded I propose that one of us at least return to the surface while the others attend this meeting or trap for all we know All right said Billie promptly Get Estra to show you how to use the elevator and wait for us in the vestibule Van Emmon s face flamed That isn t what I meant hotly If anybody goes to the cube it should be you Billie If Billie did not notice the use of her nickname at least the doctor did The girl simply snorted If you think for one second that I m going to back out just because I m a woman let me tell you that you re very badly mistaken Van Emmon turned to the doctor appealingly but the doctor took the action personally He shook his head I wouldn t miss this for anything Van Estra looks safe to me Go and ask Smith maybe he is willing to be the goat The geologist took one good look at the engineer s absorbed unquestioning manner as he listened to the Venusian and gave up the idea with a sigh For a moment he was sour then he smiled shyly I m more than anxious to meet the bunch myself he admitted and led the way back to Estra The Venusian looked at him with no change of expression although there was something very disconcerting in the precocious wisdom of his eyes Their very kindliness and serenity gave him an appearance of superiority such as only aggravated the geologist s suspicions But there was nothing to do but to trust him They followed him through two sets of doors which slid noiselessly open before them in response to some mechanism operated by the Venusian s steps This brought them to another of the glass elevators in which they descended perhaps ten feet stepping out of it onto a moving platform this in turn extended the length of a low dimly lighted passageway about a hundred yards long When they got off they were standing in a small anteroom The Venusian paused and smiled at the four again Do you feel like going on display now he asked then added I should have said Do you feel like seeing Venus on display for we all know more or less about you already But the visitors were braced for the experience Estra looked at each approvingly and then did something which made them wonder He stood stock still for perhaps a second his eyes closed as though listening and then without explanation he led the way through an opal glass door into a brilliantly lighted space Next moment the explorers were standing in the midst of the people of Venus VII THE ULTIMATE RACE The four were at the bottom of a huge conelike pit such as instantly reminded the doctor of a medical clinic The space where they stood was perhaps twenty feet in diameter while the walls enclosing the whole hall were many hundreds of feet apart And sloping up from the center on all sides was tier upon tier of the most extraordinary seats in all creation For each and every one of those thousands of Venusians was separately enclosed in glass Nowhere was there a figure to be seen who was not installed in one of those small transparent boxes just large enough for a single person Moreover and it came somewhat as a shock to the four when they noted it the central platform itself was both covered and surrounded with the same material Make yourselves at home Estra was saying He pointed to several microphones within easy reach These are provided with my translators so when you are ready to open up conversation go right ahead as though you were among your own people And he made himself comfortable in a saddlelike chair as much as to say that there was no hurry For a long time the explorers stood taking it in The Venusians without exception stared back at them with nearly equal curiosity And despite the extraordinary nature of the proceeding this mutual scrutiny took place in comparative silence for while the glass gave a certain sense of security to the newcomers it also cut off all sound except that low humming The nearest row of the people got their closest attention Without exception they had the same general build as Estra slim delicate and anemic they resembled a ward full of convalescent consumptives as the doctor commented under his breath Not one of them would ever give a joke smith material for a fat man anecdote at the same time there was nothing feverish nervous or broken down in their appearance A pretty lot of invalids as Billie added to the doctor s remark Many observers would have been struck first by the extreme diversity in the matter of dress All wore skin tight clothing and much of it was silky like Estra s But there was a bewildering assortment of colors and the most extraordinary decorations or rather ornaments So far as dress went there was no telling anything whatever about sex Are they all men asked Billie wondering of Estra The Venusian shook his head with his invariable smile Nor all women either said he enigmatically But in many respects they were astonishingly alike Almost to a soul their upper lips were withered and flat One and all had short emaciated looking legs Each and every one had a crop of really luxuriant hair the shades varied between the usual blonde and brunette with little of the reddishness so common on the earth but there were no bald people at all On the other hand there were no beards or mustaches in the whole crowd every face was bare Like a lot of Chinamen said Van Emmon in an undertone can t tell one from another But Billie pointed out that this was not strictly true a close inspection of the faces showed an extremely wide range of distinction No two chins in the crowd were exactly alike although not one of them showed any of the resolute firmness which is admired on the Earth All were weak yet different Neither were there any prominent noses although there were none that could have been called insignificant And while every pair of eyes in the place was large as large as Estra s yet there was every desirable color and expression To sum it all up and to use the doctor s words They ve developed a standard type all right just as the characteristic American face is the standard Earth type but did you ever see such variations Nevertheless the most striking thing about these people to the eyes of the visitors was their mutual resemblance For one thing there seemed to be no nervous people present There were many children in the crowd too yet all sat very still and only an occasional movement of the hands served to indicate consciousness In this sense they were all remarkably well bred In another they were remarkably rude At any given moment a good half of the people were eating or rather sipping liquids of various sorts from small tumblers Probably every person in the house before the affair was over had imbibed two or three ounces of fluid but not once was the matter apologized for nor the four invited to partake So this may be the outcome of our outrageous habit of eating sweetmeats at theaters muttered the doctor And again noting the hairless faces Just what I said when men first began using those depilatories instead of shaving no more beards But it was Billie who explained the invariable crop of hair No use to look for baldness they don t wear hats Why should they since there s neither sun nor rain to protect their heads from Mainly however the architect was interested in the building itself To her the most striking feature was not the tremendously arched dome nor yet the remarkable system of bracing which dispensed with any columns in all that vast space It was something simpler there were no aisles Now what do you make of that the girl asked Van Emmon How do they ever get to their places But he could not suggest anything more than to recall an individual elevator scheme once proposed To Smith one object of interest was the telephone system Remarkably like those used on the Earth one was located in each of the tiny glass cages He was likewise puzzled to account for the ventilation system each cage was apparently air tight yet no Venusian showed any discomfort But the geologist for want of anything strictly within his professional range interested himself in trying to fathom the moral attitude of these people He was still suspicious of them notwithstanding a growing tendency to like every one of their pleasant really agreeable faces There was neither solemnity sourness nor bitterness to be seen anywhere at the same time there was no sign of levity In every countenance was the same inexplicable mixture of wisdom and benevolence that distinguished Estra Nowhere was there hostility and nowhere was there crudity Somehow the big geologist would have felt more at home had he seen something antagonistic Essentially Van Emmon was a fighter At last the four felt their attention lagging Novelties always pall quickly no matter how striking Estra sensed the feeling and inquired Which of you will do the honors Instinctively the three younger folk turned to the doctor He made no protest but stepped at once to one of the microphones put on his most impressive professional face and began My friends and Van Emmon noted a pleased look come into every face about them my friends I do not need to state how significant this meeting is to us all From what Estra has said I gather that you have informed yourselves regarding us in some manner which he has promised to make clear At all events I am exceedingly anxious to see your astronomical apparatus At this a broad smile came to many of the faces before him but he went on unnoticing Certainly there is not much I could tell you which you do not already know Estra s use of our language proves this I only need to assure you that we will be glad to answer any questions that may occur to you It goes without saying that we of course are filled with delight to find your planet so wondrously and happily populated especially after our experience on Mercury of which I presume you are informed Apparently they were The doctor went on You may be sure that we are fairly bursting with questions However we are content to become informed as Estra sees fit to guide us There is just one thing more than any other which I would like to know at this time Why is it that although you all show a great lack of exercise and are continually eating you never appear to be healthy Instantly a Venusian in the fifth row to the doctor s right touched his phone and replied It is a matter of diet We have nothing but absolute foods if you understand what that means And from that time on despite the fact that the explorers asked questions which at home would have found hundreds ready and able to answer on Venus only one person answered any given question and always without any apparent prearrangement For a long time they could not account for this The doctor motioned for Smith to take his place The engineer looked a little embarrassed but cleared his throat noisily and said I am especially struck with the fact that each of you sits in a separate glass pew or case Why is this The reply came from one of the few people present who showed any signs of age He was perhaps sixty and his hair was fast whitening He said For reasons of sanitation It is not wise to breathe the breath of another Also supplemented someone from the other side of that vast pit also each is thereby enabled to surround himself with the electrical influences which suit him best Smith stepped back pondering The doctor looked to the geologist to take his place but Van Emmon made way for Billie At any other time she would have resented his woman first attitude now she quickly found voice How are you able to get along without aisles It may seem a foolish question to you but on earth we would consider a hall without aisles about as convenient as a room without a door Immediately a Venusian directly in front of her and on a level with her eyes called out Watch me madam And quite without an effort beyond touching a button or two the fellow rose straight into the air glass and all and then floated gently over toward the middle of the hall It probably appears complicated to you explained the Venusian whose side he had just left We make use of elements not found on your earth Billie s sang froid was not shaken Instantly she came back energetically Apparently your method overcomes gravitation Why haven t you tried to travel away from your planet And she looked around with the air of one who has uttered a poser only to have another of the satin clad people reply from a point which she was not able to locate Because enough such power cannot be safely concentrated As Billie retired Van Emmon noted with growing irritation that the continuously affable aspect of the Venusians had not altered in any way unless it was to become even more genial and sure The big man strode energetically to the microphone and the other three noted a general movement of interest and admiration as the people inspected him Why demanded he do we see no signs of contention If you are familiar with conditions on the earth you surely know that rivalry in one form or another is the accepted basis of life But all of you here appear to be perfectly happy and at the same time entirely sure of yourselves We have just come from a planet where we have seen the principle of combat of competition carried so far that it seems to have wrecked the race so you will pardon my curiosity I am sure From your faces one would conclude that you had abolished self interest altogether Just why are you so well extraordinarily self complacent And he thrust out his aggressive jaw as though to make up for the lack of chins about him Because there is nothing for us to combat save within ourselves This from a wide faced chap in a bluish white suit But surely you have rivalry of some sort No Another voice added Rivalry is the outgrowth of getting a livelihood on earth it is inevitable because men do the work Here everything is done by machines Still another put in Discontent is the mother of ambition but we are all content because each possesses all he desires But the geologist was far from satisfied Then said he vigorously if you have eliminated all contention you have nullified the great law of contrasts You say you are all rich How do you know if you have no poverty to contrast it with On earth we appreciate warmth because we have experienced cold pleasure because we know pain happiness because we have always had misery with us If we have not had the one we cannot value the other If you have never been discontented how do you know that you are content VIII THE KEY NOTE For a minute or two it looked as though Van Emmon had raised an unanswerable question There was no immediate reply Even Estra looked around as though in wonder at the silence and seemed on the point of answering of his own accord when a voice came from a man far up on the left He said A little explanation may be wise To begin with you will agree that black is black because white is white but it doesn t follow that blue is blue because green is green or red is red Blue is blue because it is neither green nor red nor any other color It is blue not because it contrasts with these other colors but because it merely differs from them Now we on Venus do not need poverty in order to appreciate wealth Instead each of us is blessed with his own particular choice of wealth Each is blessed in a different way some with children some with intellect some with other matters and the question of mere quantity never enters We do not need pain or misery spoke up someone else any more than you people on the earth require an additional color in order to appreciate the variety you already have And then from a Venusian with an especially strong voice That we are really content we know absolutely For each of us in his own distinctive way is wholly and peculiarly satisfied And it only added to the geologist s irritation to have these striking statements made in a good humored impersonal fashion which totally disarmed all opposition That the Venusians were perfectly sure of their ground was undeniable but they had such a cheerful way of looking at it as though they didn t care a rap whether Van Emmon agreed or not that If they d only have shown some spirit Van Emmon would have liked it infinitely better if one of them had only become hot about it At this point Estra rose in his chair I think you had best approach us from a fresh viewpoint said he in his unfailingly agreeable manner The doctor nodded vigorously and again Estra closed his eyes in that odd hesitating way Immediately every one in the place with the exception of a single person in the lowest row took flight in his or her little glass pew In a moment the great vault overhead was fairly swarming with people and in less than a minute the last of them had floated out through one of the arches in the walls Estra opened a panel in the central cage and admitted the Venusian who had stayed behind She for it appeared to be a young woman walked with about the same facility as Estra but as soon as she had entered the space took the seat Estra had vacated and waited The action rather disappointed the doctor He removed the interpreting telephone from his head and asked I rather thought we were going to meet one of your officials Estra We d hate to go back home without having met your president or whatever you call your chief executive The two Venusians exchanged smiles and to the surprise of the explorers the woman gave the reply in language as good as Estra s but an even sweeter expression There is no such thing as a chief executive on Venus friends I meant explained the doctor rattled the chairman of your cabinet or council or whatever it is that regulates your affairs Perhaps with an inspiration I should have said the speaker of your congress The Venusian shook her head still smiling She hesitated while selecting the best words and the four noted that while her features were quite as delicate as Estra s her face was proportionately larger and her whole figure better filled out No one would have said that she was pretty much less beautiful but none would deny that she was very good looking in a wholesome intelligent capable sort of a way Her name Estra told them later was Myrin and he explained that he and she were associated solely because of their mutual interest in the same planet the Earth Said Myrin You are accustomed to the idea of government We however have outgrown it If you stop to think you will agree that the purpose of government is to maintain peace on the one hand and to wage war on the other Now as to war we haven t even separate nations any more So we have no wars And as for internal conflict why should we ever quarrel when each of us is assured all that he can possibly want So you have abolished government A very long time ago You on the earth will do the same as soon as your people have been educated up to the point of trusting each other You haven t even a congress then Myrin shook her head All questions such as a congress would deal with were settled ages ago You must remember that the material features of our civilization have not changed for thousands of generations The only questions that come up now are purely personal ones which each must settle for himself Van Emmon as before was not at all satisfied You say that machinery does your work for you I presume you do not mean that literally there must be some duties which cannot be performed without human direction at least How do you get these duties accomplished if you have no government to compel your people to do them Myrin looked at a loss either for the answer itself or for the most suitable words Estra gave the reply Every device we possess is absolutely automatic There is not one item in the materials we use but that was constructed exactly as you see it now many thousands of years ago Smith was incredulous Do you mean to say that those little glass pews have been in use all that time Estra nodded smiling gently at the engineer s amazement Like everything else they were built to last You must remember that we do not have anything like an investment here we do not have to consider the question of getting our capital back So if any further improvements were to be made they also would be done in a permanent fashion Billie gave an exclamation of bewilderment I don t understand You say that nothing new has been built or even replaced for centuries How do you take care of your increase in population thinking of the great crowd that had just left Myrin was the one who answered this As she did so she got slowly to her feet and speaking with the utmost care watched to be sure that the four understood her Ever since the roof was put on our increase of population has been exactly balanced by our death rate The four followed their guides in silence as they led the way into the plaza Now the space was alive with Venusians The little cages were everywhere floating about in the air some of the people were laboriously shifting themselves into their aircraft others were guiding their pews direct to nearby houses The visitors got plenty of curious stares from these quiet miracle workers who seemed vastly more at home in the air than on the ground As thick as flies Van Emmon commented Estra and Myrin walking very slowly took them to a side street where two of the cigar shaped cars were standing Billie and Smith got in with Estra while Van Emmon and the doctor were given seats beside the Venusian woman The two cars were connected by telephone so that in effect the two parties were one By this time the visitors had become so accustomed to the transparent material that they felt no uneasiness as the ground receded below them Smith especially was tremendously impressed with Estra s declaration that the glass was except for appearance nothing more nor less than an extremely strong steel alloy Propelled by the unexplained forces which the two drivers controlled by means of buttons in black cases the two cars began to thread their way through the great roof columns and as they proceeded the four grew more and more amazed at the great extent of the city For miles upon miles that heterogeneous collection of buildings stretched unbroken and without system until the eye tired of trying to make out the limits of it What is the name of this city asked Billie secretly hoping that it might bear some resemblance to New York It struck her fancy to assume that this supermetropolis represented what Gotham in time might become Estra did not take his attention from what he was doing but answered as readily as ever I do not blame you for mistaking this for a city The fact is however that we have no such thing Billie stared at him helplessly You ve abolished cities too Not exactly In the same sense that we have abolished nations yes Likewise we have abolished states also counties Neither have we such a thing as the country now My friends Venus is simply one immense city IX THE SURVIVAL OF ALL Somehow all four were unwilling to press this question It did not seem possible that Estra was right or if he was that they could possibly understand his explanation should he give it The cars flew side by side for perhaps a hundred miles while the visitors put in the time in examining the landscape with the never ending interest of all aeronauts Here and there in that closely packed surface a particularly large building was to be noted every half mile or so Factories asked Billie of Estra but he shook his head I ll show you factories later on said he What you see are schools But most observers would have considered the structures severely plain for their purpose After a long silence I m still looking for streams said Van Emmon to Myrin Are your rivers as large as ours We have no rivers was the calm reply Rivers are entirely too wasteful of water All our drainage is carried off through underground canals You haven t done away with your oceans too have you the geologist asked rather sarcastically But he was scarcely prepared for the reply he got No we couldn t get along without them I am afraid However we did the best we could in their case And without signaling to Estra she dove the machine towards the ground Smith looked for the telephone wires to snap but Estra seemed to know and instantly followed Myrin s lead The doctor noticed and wondered all the more And then came another surprise As the machines neared the surface a familiar odor floated in through the open windows of the air craft and the four found themselves looking at each other for signs of irrationality A moment and they saw that they were not mistaken For although that kaleidoscopic expanse of buildings showed not the slightest break yet they were now located on the sea The houses were packed as closely together as anywhere apparently all were floating yet not ten square yards of open sea could be seen in any one spot Van Emmon almost forgot his resentment in his growing wonder That gets me Myrin Those houses seem to be merely floating yet I see no motion whatever Why are there no waves The doctor snorted Shame on you Van Don t let our friends think that you re an absolute ignoramus He added Venus has no moon and no wind at least under the roof Therefore no waves Smith put in That being the case there is no chance to start a wave motor industry here Neither as he thought further neither for water power Having no rain in your mountains Estra where do you get your power But it was Myrin who answered I suppose you are all familiar with radium It is nothing more or less than condensed sunlight which in turn is simply electromagnetic waves although it may take your scientists a good many centuries to reach that conclusion Well every particle of the material which composes this planet contains radioactivity of some sort and we long ago discovered a way to release it and use it One pound of solid granite yields enough energy to well a great deal of power They had now been flying for two hours and still no end to that thickly housed ever different appearance of the ground Also although they saw a great many birds they noted no animals Finally Billie could hold in no longer Are we to understand she demanded of Estra that the whole of this planet is as densely populated as we see it Just that replied the Venusian Why not The roof makes our climate uniform from pole to pole while our buildings are such that whether on land or on sea they are equally livable But Estra expostulated the girl Venus is nearly as big as the earth And it looks to be as thickly populated as as Rhode Island Why you must have a colossal population let me see And she scribbled away in her memorandum book But both Smith and the doctor had already worked it out They looked up blinking dazedly Over three hundred billion murmured the doctor as though dizzy The Venusian checked Smith s correction with You dropped one cipher doctor There are three and a half trillion of us Good lord whispered Van Emmon all his antagonism gone for the moment And again the explorers were silent for a long time By and by however We have just seen what it meant there on Mercury said the doctor in a low voice for the principle of the survival of the fit to be carried to its logical end for who is to decide what is fitness save the fittest One man apparently outlived every one else on the planet and then he also died But here you have gone the limit in the other direction Of course we might have known that you long ago abolished poverty unearned wealth pestilence drunkenness and the other causes of premature death but as for three and a half trillion Nevertheless remarked Myrin every last one of us once born lives to die of old age and in most cases this means several hundred of your years Smith involuntarily rubbed his eyes and they all laughed a nervous sort of a laugh which left the visitors still in doubt as to their senses and their guides sanity Van Emmon s suspicions came back with a rush and he burst out Say you ll excuse me but I can t swallow this Here you ve shown us houses as thick as leaves not a sign of a farm much less an orchard No vegetation at all except for a few flowers Three and a half trillion All right let it go at that Out came his chin and he brought one fist down upon the other as though he were cracking rocks with a hammer and with every blow he uttered a word How do you feed them all X LOAVES AND FISHES Without a word Myrin drove her machine toward the ground and as before Estra followed despite the lack of any visible signal Within a minute the two machines had come to rest softly and without disturbance on the roof of a handsome building much like an apartment house There was the usual transparent elevator and a minute later the four were being introduced to the occupants of a typical Venusian house These two people apparently man and wife did not need to be told why the explorers had been brought there They led the way from the dimly lighted hallway in which the elevator had stopped into a group of brightly decorated rooms Here the four were given seats in the usual saddellike chairs and then Myrin answered Van Emmon s question I knew that this point would arise soon and you will pardon me if I handle it in a prearranged fashion I will admit that it is not an easy question mister Van Emmon has put not because the answer is at all complicated but on the contrary extremely simple The four were listening unanimously Despite himself Van Emmon was highly impressed by the Venusian woman s serious manner Perhaps it was because in her earnestness she was not quite so affable as before She went on From where you are sitting you can see all the rooms in this house You will look in vain for anything even remotely resembling a kitchen There is not even a dining room And yet you must not jump to the conclusion that we all use restaurants We have no such thing as a public eating place Or rather and here she spoke very carefully rather every place is an eating place The doctor looked Myrin over as though she were a patient with a new kind of disease You do not mean that literally of course said he kindly But she nodded gravely You must not misunderstand Remember even on your own planet the distribution of food is becoming more and more extensive until you can now buy something to eat at every crossroads We have merely carried the idea to its logical end so that all Venusians can obtain food at any time and at any spot She turned in her chair all the chairs on Venus were pivoted Estra said and touched a button in the wall at her hand A panel slid noiselessly aside and revealed a tiny buffet At least Billie labeled it a buffet for want of a more accurate term For it consisted of a silver bibb something like the nozzle of a soda water fountain above which was a board containing a large number of tiny numbered push buttons Below the bibb was a space in which a cup might be set and projecting from a tube at one side was a solid block of telescoping transparent cups This said Myrin is the Venusian Nutrition System There is a station like this in every room on the planet And she proceeded to take a cup from the tube filling each from the silver faucet while she pressed a variety of the buttons The four watched in silence and eagerly took what was given to them It comprised liquids entirely liquids of every degree of fluidity from some as thin as water to others as thick as gruel They varied even more as to color ranging from actual transparency to a deep chocolate Now I warn you not to be shocked said Myrin although I fully expect that you will be The fact is that we have no other kind of food than what you see there are thousands upon thousands of different kinds and flavors but they are all fluids We have nothing whatever in solid form You see she explained we have no teeth All they could do was to stare at her as with a return of her smile she made a sudden gesture across the front of her mouth Next instant a set of false teeth lay in her hand Estra spoke up We are both obliged to wear them in order that we might use your language He removed his own to show a mouth as free of teeth as a newborn baby s Both Venusians replaced their sets and smiled afresh at the explorers astonishment Teeth will soon be a thing of the past with you on the Earth too commented Myrin doctor Kinney will surely testify to that Your use of soft cooked foods instead of the coarse hard articles provided by nature is bound to have this effect in time With us it resulted in having teeth reduced to the standing of your appendix and like you we resort to an operation rather than take chances on trouble I may mention that the appendix is totally absent from all Venusians while we are beginning to lose all traces of either the first or second molars just as you are beginning to lose your wisdom teeth However suppose you try our diet while I explain The four once more looked at each other The doctor was the first to take a sip of one of the cups handed to him and Van Emmon was the last the geologist waited to see the effects upon the others before gingerly tasting of the thickest darkest liquid of them all Another taste and he discovered that it was very good and that he was exceedingly hungry Very delicately flavored commented Billie after emptying her fourth glass a golden fluid with a slightly oily appearance Delicately is right said the doctor This stuff is barely flavored at all Estra The Venusian was also eating We much prefer them all that way said he I suppose you would consider our tastes very finicky on Earth but the fact is we are able to distinguish between minute variations in flavoring such as would escape all on earth except a humming bird I suppose remarked the doctor smacking his lips over a reddish solution with a winelike flavor I suppose we can expect something of that sort on the Earth too in time Originally mankind was only able to distinguish fresh from stale and animal from vegetable flavors After a while Myrin went on You know the processes of nutrition as they take place among your people are extremely wasteful You have probably heard it said that the average human is only fifty per cent efficient That simply means that digestion assimilation and excretion require half the energy which they secure from the food Now the articles you have just swallowed require very little work on the part of your digestive apparatus and none at all upon your eliminating tract The food is almost instantly transformed into fresh blood if I am not mistaken you already feel much refreshed This was decidedly true All four felt actually stimulated Van Emmon instantly suspected the food of being alcoholic As he continued to watch its effect however he saw that there was no harmful reaction as in the case of the notorious drug I think I can now tell you how we produce enough food for the three and a half trillion of us despite our lack of farms and orchards said Myrin rising Returning to the air craft the four were taken a short distance in a new direction and again descended this time transferring to an elevator which dropped far below the surface They came to a stop about ten floors down Naturally said Myrin we reserve all the surface for residence purposes although it is possible to live down here in comparative comfort since we have plenty of electrical energy to spare And she operated a switch flooding the place with a brilliant glow Thrown from concealed sources this light was quite as strong as the subdued daylight which they had just left But unless we were free to fly about as much as we do we should feel that life was a bore Nobody stays below any longer than is necessary Now this is where our food comes from Whereupon she showed them a series of automatic machines all working away there in the solid rock of the planet and of such an extraordinary nature that Smith the engineer moved about in an atmosphere of supreme bliss You will understand said Myrin that the usual processes of nutrition on the Earth depend entirely upon plant life We however cannot spare room enough for any such system so we had to devise substitutes for plants In effect that is what these machines are They convert bed rock into loam take the nitrates and other chemicals Footnote The geology of Venus is thoroughly described in mister Van Emmon s reports to the A M E A directly from this artificial soil and by a pseudo osmotic process secure results similar to those produced by roots Likewise we have developed artificial leaves pointing out a huge apparatus which none but a highly trained expert in both botany and mechanics could half understood This machine first manufactures chlorophyl yes it does as the doctor snorted incredulously not an imitation but real chlorophyl and then transforms the various elements into starch sugar and proteids through the agency of the sunlight recovered from the granite In short to answer your question mister Van Emmon as to how we are all fed we do not grow our food at all we go straight to the practically unlimited supply of raw materials under our feet and manufacture our food outright XI THE SUPER AMBITION Billie was very quiet during their return to the surface She said nothing until they had reached the two cars and then pausing as she was about to step in she said Well I never saw our old friend the high cost of living handled quite so easily If that s the way you do things here Estra and the girl did not flinch at the gazes the others turned upon her if that s your way it s good enough for me I m going to stay For the first time Estra looked astonished He and Myrin exchanged lightninglike glances then the Venusian s face warmed with the smile he gave the architect It is very good of you to say that he said impressively I was afraid some of our peculiarities might arouse very different feelings They stared at one another for a second or two long enough for the doctor to notice and to see how Van Emmon took it The geologist however was smiling upon the girl in a big brotherly fashion which indicated that he thought she didn t mean what she had said Had he been looking up at her however instead of down upon her he would have seen that her chin was most resolute Just as they were about to start again both Estra and Myrin stopped short in their tracks with that odd hesitation that had mystified the four all along and after perhaps five seconds of silence turned to one another with grave faces It was Estra who explained It is curious how things do pile up said he a little conscious of having employed an idiom Our planet has gone along for hundreds of generations without anything especially remarkable happening so that recently many prophets have foretold a number of startling events to take place on a single day And this seems to have come true You have been with us scarcely ten hours and the visitors stared at each other in amazement that so much time had passed scarcely ten hours and here comes an announcement which for over a hundred years has been looked forward to with He stopped abruptly The doctor gently took him up Looked forward to with what Estra Estra and Myrin considered this for perhaps three seconds It was the woman who replied The fact is your approach to the planet has stimulated all sorts of research immensely Matters that had been hanging fire indefinitely were revived this is one of them In that sense you are to blame But she smiled as reassuringly as she could allowing for a certain anxiety which had now come to her face Don t you think you could make it clear to us asked Billie encouragingly At the same time all four noted that the air which before had fairly thronged with machines was now simply alive with them People were flitting here and there like swarms of insects and with as little apparent aim Both Estra and Myrin were extra watchful also they displayed a certain eagerness to get away setting their course in still another direction In a minute or two the congestion seemed relieved and Myrin began to talk slowly You have doubtless guessed by this time that we Venusians have crossed what some call the animal divide We are predominatly intellectual while you on the earth are as a race still predominantly animal Excuse me for putting it so bluntly It s all right said the doctor with an effort What you say is true of most of us He added Most thinking people realize that when our civilization reaches the point where the getting of a living becomes secondary instead of primary as at present a great change is bound to come to the race The Venusian nodded Under the conditions which now surround us you can see we have vastly more time for what you would call spiritual matters Only we label them psychological experiences In fact the supernatural is the Venusian s daily business There was another pause during which both Venusians driving at high speed though they were once more closed their eyes for a second or so Estra evidently thought it time to explain For instance telepathy With us it takes the place of wireless for we have developed the power to such a point that any Venusian can call up any other no matter where either may be That is why we need no signs or addresses There are certain restrictions for instance no one can read another s thoughts without his permission Of course we still have speech speech and language are the ABC s of the Venusian and we still keep the telephone for the sake of checking up now and then Just now we are driving for my own house where there is apparatus which will enable you to both hear and understand an announcement which is shortly to be made There was something decidedly satisfying especially to Van Emmon in being taken into the Venusian confidence to this extent When he put his question it was with his former aggressiveness much modified He said I should think that your people have pretty well exhausted the possibilities of the supernatural by this time Progress having come to an end I don t see what you find to interest you Myrin The fact is Billie put in we feel somewhat disappointed that your people have shown so little interest in us And she gave a sidelong glance at Estra who returned the look with a direct smiling gaze which sent a flood of color into the architect s face Look out sharply from Van Emmon and with barely an inch to spare Estra steered his car past another which he had nearly overlooked For another minute or two there was silence then Myrin said You wonder what there is to interest us And yet every time you look up at the stars the answer is before your eyes You see although we cannot read your thoughts without your permission yet you on the earth cannot prevent us from overhearing anything that may be said Under proper conditions our psychic senses are delicate enough to feel the slightest whisper on the earth That is why Estra and I are able to use your language we have learned it together with an understanding of your lives and customs by simply listening in I may add that we are also able to use your eyes we knew directly what you people looked like before you arrived Well it is our ambition to visit in spirit every planet in the universe There are hundreds of millions of stars every one is a sun and each has planets One in a hundred contains life some very elementary others much more advanced than we are So far we have been able to study nearly two thousand worlds besides those in this solar system Do you still think friend we have nothing to interest us She raised a hand in a gesture of emphasis and it was then that Billie her eyes on Myrin s fingers saw another sign of the great advancement these people had made direct proof in fact of what Myrin had just claimed For there must have been a tremendous gain in the intellect to have caused such a drain upon the body as Billie saw In no other way could it be explained the minds of the Venusians had grown at a fearful cost to flesh and blood Not only were the fingernails entirely lacking from Myrin s hand but the lower joints of her four fingers from the palm to the knuckles were grown smoothly together XII THE MENTAL LIMIT Make yourselves at home said Estra as they stepped into his apartment The cars just filled his balcony This is my workshop see if you can guess my occupation from what you see As for Myrin and myself we must make certain preparations before the announcement is made They disappeared and the four inspected the place As in the other house they had entered the room was provided with a double row of small windows some being down near the floor and the others level with the eyes These in addition to two doors all of which were of translucent material On low benches about the room were a number of instruments some of which looked familiar to the doctor He said he had seen something much like them in psychology class during his college days For the most part their appearance defied ordinary description Footnote Physicians biologists and others interested in matters of this nature will find the above fully treated in doctor Kinney s reports to the A M A But one piece of apparatus was given such prominence that it is worth detailing It consisted of a hollow cube shaped metal framework about a foot in either direction upon which was mounted about forty long thumb screws all pointing toward the inside of the frame The inner ends of the screws were provided with small silver pads while the outer ends were so connected each with a tiny dial as to register the amount of motion of the screw Smith turned one of them in and out and said it reminded him of a micrometer gage Then Billie noted that the entire device was so placed upon the bench as to set directly over a hole about ten inches in diameter And under the bench was one of the saddlelike chairs The architect s antiquarian lore came back to her with a rush and she remembered something she had seen in a museum a relic of the inquisition Good Heavens she whispered What is this an instrument of torture It certainly looked mightily like one of the head crushing devices Billie had seen Thumb screws and all this appeared to be only a very elaborate persuader for use upon those who must be made to talk But the doctor was thinking hard A big light flashed into his eyes This he declared positively is something that will become a matter of course in our own educational system as soon as the science of phrenology is better understood And next second he had ducked under the bench and thrust his head through the round hole so that his skull was brought into contact with some of those padded thumb screws Get the idea he finished It s a cranium meter It did not take Smith long to reach the next conclusion Then said he our friend Estra is connected with their school system Can t say what he would be called but I should say his function is to measure the capacity of students for various kinds of knowledge in order that their education may be adapted accordingly Might call him a brain surveyor he concluded Or a noodle smith added the geologist deprecatingly Rather a career appraiser indignantly from Billie People look to him to suggest what they should take up and what they should leave alone Why he s one of the most important men on this whole planet And again the doctor was a witness to a clash of eyes between the girl and the geologist Van Emmon said nothing further however but turned to examine an immense book case on the other side of the room This case had shelves scarcely two inches apart and about half as deep and held perhaps half a million extremely small books Each comprised many hundreds of pages made of a perfectly opaque bluish white material of such incredible thinness that ordinary India paper resembled cardboard by comparison They were printed much the same as any other book except that the characters were of microscopic size and the lines extremely close together Also in some of the books these lines were black and red alternating Billie eagerly examined one of the diminutive volumes under a strong glass and pronounced the black printed characters not unlike ancient Gothic type She guessed that the language was synthetic like Roman or Esperanto and that the alphabet numbered sixty or seventy The red lines she added not so confidently are in a different language Looks wonderfully like Persian By this time the others were doing the same as she and marveling to note that wherever the red and black lines were employed invariably the black were in the same language while the red characters were totally different in each book Suddenly Smith gave a start so vigorously that the other turned in alarm He was holding one of the books as though it were white hot Look he stuttered excitedly Just look at it And no wonder In the book he had chanced to pick up the red lines were printed in ENGLISH Talk about your finds exclaimed Billie in an awe struck tone Why this library is a literal translation of the languages of she fairly gasped as she recalled Myrin s words thousands of planets After that she fell silent Plainly the discovery had profoundly affected and strengthened her notion of remaining on the planet Van Emmon watching her narrowly saw her give the room an appraising glance which meant plain as day I d like to keep this place in spick and span condition And another not so easy to interpret I d like to show these people a thing or two about designing houses And the geologist s heart sank for an instant He turned resolutely to the bookcase and shortly found something which he showed to the doctor It was a book printed all in Venusian They carefully translated the title page using one of the interlinear English books as a guide and saw that it was a complete text book on astral development With these instructions the doctor declared any one could do as the Venusians do visit other worlds in spirit Just then Estra and Myrin returned They were moving at what was for them a rapid pace and to all appearances they were rather excited We were not able to make these records as perfect as we would like said Estra holding up four disks similar to the ones which still lay in the explorers translating machines He proceeded to open the little black cases and make the exchange There will be words used which I did not see fit to incorporate in the original vocabulary but which you will have to understand perfectly if this announcement is to mean anything to you Thank you said the doctor quietly And now don t you think we had best know in advance just what is to be the subject of Hush whispered Estra and next second they were listening to the telephone in amazement XIII THE WAR OF THE SEXES In accordance with my promise stated a high pitched effeminate voice I am going to demonstrate a juvenation method upon which I have worked for the past one hundred and twenty two years There was a brief pause during which Estra hurriedly explained that the man who was making the speech 
6954-76168-0000	train-other-500	was located far on the other side of the planet in a hall like the one the four had first visited and that he was making the demonstration before a great gathering of scientists Too bad you cannot see as we do commented the Venusian However
6954-76168-0001	train-other-500	Savarona may go into the details of If the committeemen are entirely finished with their measurements stated the unseen experimenter I would like to have the results compared with the recorded figures of Pario Camenol
none	none	 who was born on the two hundred and fifteenth day 
6954-76168-0002	train-other-500	of the year twenty one thousand seven hundred and four Another rest and Estra said They are examining a boy who appears to be about twelve years of age Then came other voices
none	none	 As we all know the craniums of us all are absolutely distinct 
6954-76168-0003	train-other-500	as much so as our finger prints The measurements correspond identically with those of Pario Camenol beyond a doubt This boy can be none other than Pario Then the high pitched voice went on
6954-76168-0004	train-other-500	then notice the formula I have written on this blackboard Using this solution I have supplied nourishment to this lad from the hour of his birth Until a few days ago I was not satisfied with the results
6954-76168-0005	train-other-500	the patient showed a tiny variation from the allowable subconscious maximum together with only nine tenths the required motor reaction But I have corrected this Briefly I have incorporated in Pario Camenol s standard diet
none	none	 certain elements which have hitherto been unsafe to combine 
6954-76168-0006	train-other-500	These elements are derivatives of the potash group for the most part together with phosphates which need a new classification Their effect impressively has been to postpone age indefinitely
none	none	 There must have been a tremendous sensation in that hall 
6954-76168-0007	train-other-500	The speaker s voice shook with excitement as he went on We have sought in vain friends for a way to cheat death of his due We have succeeded in postponing his advent
6954-76168-0008	train-other-500	until our average longevity is several times greater than on our neighboring planet But so far it has been a mere reprieve What I have done is to prevent age itself This lad
6954-76168-0009	train-other-500	is a hundred and twenty two years old mentally and still only twelve years old as to body In short I offer you the fountain of youth itself The speaker paused
6954-76168-0010	train-other-500	There was no comment Evidently all had been as greatly impressed as the explorers Then the voice of the man Savarona finished very deliberately I regret to say that my treatment
6954-76168-0011	train-other-500	despite all that I have been able to do cannot be adapted to the female constitution It would be fatal to any but males I repeat I can offer eternal youth absolutely
6954-76168-0012	train-other-500	but only to new born males This time there was a definite response From the telephone came a confused murmuring at which Van Emmon s face lighted up with delight The murmuring had an angry sound
6954-76168-0013	train-other-500	This is outrageous a loud contralto voice was raised above the rest You are unethical Savarona to announce such a thing before adapting it to both sexes The high pitched voice replied shortly
none	none	 and with more than a hint of malice If a woman had discovered this instead of me I dare say you would have no objections The murmuring grew louder angrier more confused The four from the earth looked at each other in some slight uneasiness 
6954-76168-0014	train-other-500	At the same time they noted that Estra his eyes tightly closed and his fists clenched in the intensity of his concentration suddenly gave a sigh of relief Next second he began to speak into the telephone
6954-76168-0015	train-other-500	in a voice so loud as to silence all the clamor Savarona and the people of Venus Listen The prophets were right when they said today would witness many great things I have just learned of another experiment
none	none	 which transcends even that of Savarona An instant s pause then First let me remind you that we have been doing all we could to elevate our spiritual selves We are daily trying to eliminate all that is animal 
6954-76168-0016	train-other-500	all that is gross and bemeaning in us even to the extent of reducing the flavors of our foods to the lowest tolerable point And despite all this we have not been able to get rid of sex jealousy
6954-76168-0017	train-other-500	We still have the beast within us No matter how pure our love may be it is always tainted with rivalry Always the husband and wife are held down by this mutual envy forever dragging at their heels
6954-76168-0018	train-other-500	constantly holding them back from the lofty heights of spiritual power to which they aspire He paused and Savarona s voice broke in triumphantly You are right Estra You are right except you did not mention that this jealousy
6954-76168-0019	train-other-500	becomes less and less as one grows older Now my discovery will put an end to your beast Estra My experiments took this lad before he had become a man and allowed his brain to develop while his body stopped growing
6954-76168-0020	train-other-500	He is a man in mentality and an innocent boy in body Estra I have done the thing you wish This boy will never know jealousy because he will never know love The man in the room with the four answered in a flash
6954-76168-0021	train-other-500	So you have Savarona but only for MEN No female can benefit by what you have done But I tell you that within the past few minutes a child has been born under circumstances which can be repeated at any time
6954-76168-0022	train-other-500	and for any sex In this case the Venusian s voice changed curiously in this case however it was a girl for the mother controlled the sex in the customary manner At this the doctor s interest became acute
none	none	 At the same time the other three felt a tremendous inexplicable thrill Friends and Extra s face shone in his enthusiasm friends for the first time in creation the human male germ has been dispensed with The intellect has done what the laboratory could not do I have the honor to announce that my sister Amra has just given birth his voice fairly rang has just given birth to a girl baby whose only father was her mother s brain XIV ESTRA 
7198-76169-0000	train-other-500	This time there was no drowning the confusion The telephone fairly shook with innumerable cries shouts imprecations The four gave up trying to hear and watched the two Venusians
none	none	 Myrin was facing Estra now 
7198-76169-0001	train-other-500	Her expression had lost a great deal of its good humor and there was a certain sharpness in her voice as she exclaimed Estra if your sister has done this and I see no reason to doubt it then she has made man superfluous If women can produce children mechanically
7198-76169-0002	train-other-500	and govern the sex at will the coming race need be nothing but females
none	none	 Estra nodded gravely That is what it amounts to Myrin 
7198-76169-0003	train-other-500	For a moment the two stared at one another challengingly On the earth their attitude would have indicated some unimportant tiff None would have dreamed that the most momentous question in their lives had come up and had found them at outs
7198-76169-0004	train-other-500	Next instant Myrin turned and without another word walked from the room Estra followed slowly to the door where he stood looking after her with an expression of the keenest concern on his sensitive high strung features The three men from the earth after a glance
7198-76169-0005	train-other-500	studiously avoided looking at him but Billie walked up and laid a hand on his arm Are you really in favor of this scheme she inquired in a curiously tender voice At the same time she gazed intently into Estra s eyes
7198-76169-0006	train-other-500	He turned and the smile came back to his face He took Billie s hand and laid it between both his own His voice was even gentler than before Most certainly I do favor my sister s method Billie It will be the greatest boon the race has ever known
7198-76169-0007	train-other-500	We can look forward now and his face shone again
none	none	 can look forward to generation upon generation of people whose spirituality will be absolute The girl moved closer to him She spoke with feverish earnestness 
7198-76169-0008	train-other-500	There may be some hitch in the idea Estra If God meant for man to become to become obsolete He would not have hidden the method all this time Suppose some flaw should develop later on In the cube Billie Jackson would not have stumbled over such a speech
none	none	 She would have ignored the fact that Estra was holding her hand all this time and gazing deep into her eyes 
7198-76169-0009	train-other-500	she would have been filled with what she was saying and not with what she was seeing On the other side of the room Van Emmon watched and glowered he could not hear The Venusian lifted his head suddenly The voices from the telephone had subsided
7198-76169-0010	train-other-500	only an occasional outburst came from the instrument Estra closed his eyes again for a second and when he opened them again his manner was astonishingly alert and his speech swift and to the point So far as we know Billie the method has no flaws
7198-76169-0011	train-other-500	It gives us the chance to throw off our lower selves and if by so doing we reduce the race to a single sex only He stopped short as though at a sound and with a word of apology stepped from the room He opened another door
7198-76169-0012	train-other-500	far down the corridor and as he passed through the wail of a new born infant came faintly to the four Wonder what s up said Smith
none	none	 Van Emmon who had gone to the window 
7198-76169-0013	train-other-500	whirled upon the engineer and motioned him to his side Look at the people
none	none	 Smith saw that the nearby houses were almost concealed by a throng which had gathered 
7198-76169-0014	train-other-500	silently and without confusion during the past few minutes Their numbers were increasing swiftly fresh arrivals packing the background
none	none	 People filled the streets the space below Estra s balcony was already crowded as closely as it could be 
7198-76169-0015	train-other-500	Except for a low voiced buzzing there was no disturbance Billie came up She seemed to divine the temper of the mob She caught her breath sharply and then said very simply It reminds me of Bethlehem
7198-76169-0016	train-other-500	But the words had scarcely left her mouth before an uproar sounded from one end of the street below A crowd of excited Venusians was pushing its way determinedly toward the house their passage obstructed by shouting protesting individuals
7198-76169-0017	train-other-500	Van Emmon s breast began to heave he fancied he saw blows struck By George he exclaimed next second They re fighting It was true a hand to hand battle was going on less than a block away
7198-76169-0018	train-other-500	The people below the window surged in the direction of the fight all were shouting now the clamor was deafening Live and let live came one of the shouts It was taken up by the group that was doing the attacking and made into a cheer
7198-76169-0019	train-other-500	Then came other cries from them Smith made out something like Down with sex monopoly Don t you see shouted Smith above the din These people below are Estra s friends those newcomers are backing Savarona Get the idea
7198-76169-0020	train-other-500	he repeated If Estra wins out the old boy with the fountain of youth will never get another boy baby to experiment on What The doctor leaped to their sides He took it in at a glance then whirled to the door We ought to warn Estra
7198-76169-0021	train-other-500	He knows it already reminded Billie swiftly A great shout came from below the attackers had forced their way through the crowd of Estra s friends Well Van Emmon stood squarely in the middle of the room
7198-76169-0022	train-other-500	So far as I m concerned Estra and his sister can face that crowd alone I don t approve of the scheme The doctor eyed him thoughtfully I m not so sure Van This is a tremendous thing we ought to Van is right exploded Billie
none	none	 Her voice rose to a shriek as a crash shook the house 
7198-76169-0023	train-other-500	Next instant Myrin for once in a hurry broke into the room She glanced about missed Estra looked slightly puzzled and then frowned angrily as the Venusian himself stepped in You fooled me she shot at him
7198-76169-0024	train-other-500	But he smiled apologetically He was carrying a large package of leaflets closely printed in Venusian there seemed to be several thousand in the lot He said by way of explanation I had to get ready Savarona s people will be here any moment
7198-76169-0025	train-other-500	they have destroyed the elevator and A wave of clamor burst from below They ve broken the barrier remarked Estra calmly he turned to the door then whirled at a crash which sounded from above Through the roof he added
7198-76169-0026	train-other-500	He did not even glance at the balcony where the two cars barred the way against any attack from that direction Next second he again quit the room
none	none	 Myrin hesitated a moment irresolute and then followed him thoughtfully 
7198-76169-0027	train-other-500	They never saw her again As for Estra he came back in a moment carrying a small white bundle which stirred in his arms He unhesitatingly handed the child to Billie His mouth moved soundlessly as a muffled shriek arose from the other end of the corridor
7198-76169-0028	train-other-500	there was a thud a metallic crash and a great roar of voices The mob had broken in and up through the back of the house The first of the attackers thrust his head and shoulders into sight not ten feet away
7198-76169-0029	train-other-500	Estra touched something with his foot and a door shot across the corridor There was an instant s silence then the thunder of the mob hurling itself against the door The people were fairly snarling now Estra closed the inner door
7198-76169-0030	train-other-500	Estra shrilly from Billie She laid the baby down and strode to the Venusian Let s get out of here The car s on the balcony nobody s in the way to interfere Why not A grinding ripping jar from above and Estra shook his head
7198-76169-0031	train-other-500	The smile was gone and his mouth was set and grim They d catch us before we went a mile he said glancing at the infant who had begun to cry in a stifled gasping way that tore at the nerves Estra
7198-76169-0032	train-other-500	Billie pleaded but he turned away The doctor strode up to him and gripped his shoulder What s the good Estra What can you accomplish even if you The Venusian tapped his forehead I can TELL he exclaimed
none	none	 with a return of that exalted flush 
7198-76169-0033	train-other-500	Just give me a chance to offer my sister s discovery to the world and I shall be satisfied He touched the package of leaflets These are not written as clearly as they should be but if I cannot hold them back then these fingering the papers
7198-76169-0034	train-other-500	these go to the friends down below He moved closer to the window but his eyes were on the door A rending crash told that the corridor was now open to the mob There was a rush and then the storm of the people battering the last door
none	none	 Van 
7198-76169-0035	train-other-500	Doc Billie Smith had the window open and was stepping into one of the cars Kinney and the geologist were at his side in an instant The girl held back Estra she begged She picked up the baby and with her free hand tugged at the Venusian s arm
7198-76169-0036	train-other-500	Come on Don t sacrifice yourself The door bulged under the attack The noise was ear splitting Nevertheless Estra heard and shook his head without looking at the woman from the Earth She dashed to the window then came back
7198-76169-0037	train-other-500	Hurry There s a chance He stood unmoved watchful and ready Estra I want you to come Her face flamed Can t you see Can t you see that I I want you She gasped as the door shrieked under the strain
7198-76169-0038	train-other-500	Come if you re a man The Venusian s face changed He turned and stared at the girl with eyes that held nothing but blank amazement The grimness left his mouth his lips partly opened
7198-76169-0039	train-other-500	He took a step forward and threw an arm about her shoulders Billie I m sorry I never thought A crack showed at the edge of the door and a roar smote their ears Estra backed to the window
7198-76169-0040	train-other-500	Go he shouted Go quickly while you can Billie stood stock still gazing at him I m going to stay she screamed I ll take my chances with He thrust her through the window
7198-76169-0041	train-other-500	You don t understand he shouted and took the baby away from her despite all her strength Then a wonderfully tender light came into his eyes He gripped Billie s hands and spoke sorrowfully Billie
none	none	 I m not what you thought I m not a man I m a woman XV BACK By the time Smith had driven the strange craft fifty yards he had it under control Billie glanced back Estra was out on the balcony now and the mob was surging against the windows she had locked against them She shifted the baby to the hollow of one arm while with the other she broke the cord of the packet At the sight the crowd in the street gave voice Let us have it they were crying they drowned out the uproar within the house Estra did not even look at the other car Then the windows gave way Like the breaking of a dam a flood of Venusians poured and tumbled at Estra s feet She raised her hand and shouted something Billie could not hear then scarcely without pause the crowd bore down upon her And even as she was crushed against the railing with one hand she dropped the baby to eager upstretched arms below and with the other she tossed the package high in the air There it broke apart the air caught it and the thousands of leaflets fluttered down upon that street full of sympathizers Leaflets each of which described a discovery which was to give to women the power of abolishing the opposite sex of making Venus a world not only one in country one in industry and one in thought but one in sex The thunderous meaning of Estra s last action almost made Billie forget that it was in truth the woman s last act For next moment her lifeless form was being crushed beneath the feet of that supremely cultured marvelously civilized mob for it was only a mob despite its astounding advancement a mob which had retained all the brute s fanaticism and all the male jealousy of the female For they were all men The four had been on Venus almost twenty four hours when Smith knowing the condition of the machinery in the cube warned the others that they must return Secretly he was tired of the Venusians continual smiling for they had fairly outdone each other to show the visitors all that could be shown But it was Van Emmon who thought to ask for Estra s wonderful library These chemicals and metals you are giving us he said making a regular speech of it are extremely welcome they will enable us to perform experiments otherwise out of our reach But Estra s books will mean still more to the people of the earth If there is no one else with more need for them who is going to put in a claim then why not let us have them Apparently the Venusians did not like the idea very well They must have thought it was like letting a monkey play with a rifle the doctor afterward put it But for lack of a leader with any motive for objecting and because Estra had no living relatives to claim the library somehow that incredible collection of intellectual gems got into the possession of the four Nothing was said about it during the quiet leave taking and when the cube finally rose away from the roof Van Emmon s face beamed with happiness and a great sigh of satisfaction escaped him Well looking at the books they kind of make up for the fact that the folks didn t ask us to call again And he turned and went straight to the kitchenette where he proceeded with great speed and efficiency to set out the following Canned Soup Canned baked beans Fried bacon and egg Coffee Peaches Come and get it he shouted The doctor tore himself away from the books Smith crawled out from the beloved machines Billie came out shortly from her cubby hole and slipped into her seat in a highly excited manner There was a brightness in her cheeks and a noticeable change in her usually assured manner This timidity so utterly new to the girl seemed most pronounced whenever Van Emmon chanced to look at her which was quite often All four were ravenous They had been away from the cube a day and a night and all we had to eat was something to drink as Smith complained Nothing whatever was said except Please pass that and Thanks for fully fifteen minutes At last they were satisfied The doctor went back to the books Smith returned to his oil can and wrench But Billie stood by the table and began helping Van Emmon to clear up In a moment they were face to face Van she said softly and looked up at him wistfully Van do you like me better this way Her eyes were almost piteous Into the man s face there came a look of amazement followed by one of admiration and another of genuine delight He gave a little laugh and unconsciously threw out his hands Much better Billie Neither of them cared a particle whether Smith or the doctor saw that Billie very simply and naturally walked right into Van Emmon s arms Much better Besides you re really too graceful to wear anything else End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life by Homer Eon Flint END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE
