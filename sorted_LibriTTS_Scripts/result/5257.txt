GUTENBERG EBOOK THE BROAD HIGHWAY Produced by Polly Stratton and Andrew Sly The Broad Highway by Jeffery Farnol To Shirley Byron Jevons The friend of my boyish ambitions This book is dedicated As a mark of my gratitude affection and esteem J F ANTE SCRIPTUM As I sat of an early summer morning in the shade of a tree eating fried bacon with a tinker the thought came to me that I might some day write a book of my own a book that should treat of the roads and by roads of trees and wind in lonely places of rapid brooks and lazy streams of the glory of dawn the glow of evening and the purple solitude of night a book of wayside inns and sequestered taverns a book of country things and ways and people And the thought pleased me much But objected the Tinker for I had spoken my thought aloud trees and suchlike don t sound very interestin leastways not in a book for after all a tree s only a tree and an inn an inn no you must tell of other things as well Yes said I a little damped to be sure there is a highwayman Come that s better said the Tinker encouragingly Then I went on ticking off each item on my fingers come Tom Cragg the pugilist Better and better nodded the Tinker a one legged soldier of the Peninsula an adventure at a lonely tavern a flight through woods at midnight pursued by desperate villains and a most extraordinary tinker So far so good I think and it all sounds adventurous enough What cried the Tinker Would you put me in your book then Assuredly Why then said the Tinker it s true I mends kettles sharpens scissors and such but I likewise peddles books an nov els an what s more I reads em so if you must put me in your book you might call me a literary cove A literary cove said I Ah said the Tinker it sounds better a sight better besides I never read a nov el with a tinker in it as I remember they re generally dooks or earls or barronites nobody wants to read about a tinker That all depends said I a tinker may be much more interesting than an earl or even a duke The Tinker examined the piece of bacon upon his knifepoint with a cold and disparaging eye I ve read a good many nov els in my time said he shaking his head and I knows what I m talking of here he bolted the morsel of bacon with much apparent relish I ve made love to duchesses run off with heiresses and fought dooels ah by the hundred all between the covers of some book or other and enjoyed it uncommonly well especially the dooels If you can get a little blood into your book so much the better there s nothing like a little blood in a book not a great deal but just enough to give it a tang so to speak if you could kill your highwayman to start with it would be a very good beginning to your story I could do that certainly said I but it would not be according to fact So much the better said the Tinker who wants facts in a nov el Hum said I And then again What more I inquired Love said the Tinker wiping his knife blade on the leg of his breeches Love I repeated And plenty of it said the Tinker I m afraid that is impossible said I after a moment s thought How impossible Because I know nothing about love That s a pity said the Tinker Under the circumstances it is said I Not a doubt of it said the Tinker beginning to scrub out the frying pan with a handful of grass though to be sure you might learn you re young enough Yes I might learn said I who knows Ah who knows said the Tinker And after he had cleansed the pan to his satisfaction he turned to me with dexter finger upraised and brow of heavy portent Young fellow said he no man can write a good nov el without he knows summat about love it aren t to be expected so the sooner you do learn the better Hum said I And then as I said afore and I say it again they wants love in a book nowadays and wot s more they will have it They said I The folk as will read your book after it is written Ah to be sure said I somewhat taken aback I had forgotten them Forgotten them repeated the Tinker staring Forgotten that people might went to read it after it is written But said the Tinker rubbing his nose hard books are written for people to read aren t they Not always said I Hereupon the Tinker rubbed his nose harder than ever Many of the world s greatest books those masterpieces which have lived and shall live on forever were written as I believe for the pure love of writing them Oh said the Tinker Yes said I warming to my theme and with little or no idea of the eyes of those unborn generations which were to read and marvel at them hence it is we get those sublime thoughts untrammelled by passing tastes and fashions unbounded by narrow creed or popular prejudice Ah said the Tinker Many a great writer has been spoiled by fashion and success for so soon as he begins to think upon his public how best to please and hold their fancy which is ever the most fickle of mundane things straightway Genius spreads abroad his pinions and leaves him in the mire Poor cove said the Tinker Young man you smile I think No said I Well supposing a writer never had no general us how then Why then said I he should never dare to write at all Young fellow said the Tinker glancing at me from the corners of his eyes are you sure you are a general us then Now when my companion said this I fell silent for the very sufficient reason that I found nothing to say Lord love you said he at last seeing me thus hipped don t be downhearted don t be dashed afore you begin we can t all be general uses it aren t to be expected but some on us is a good deal better than most and that s something arter all As for your book wot you have to do is to give em a little blood now and then with plenty of love and you can t go far wrong Now whether the Tinker s theory for the writing of a good novel be right or wrong I will not presume to say But in this book that lies before you though you shall read if you choose of country things and ways and people yet because that part of my life herein recorded was a something hard rough life you shall read also of blood and because I came in the end to love very greatly so shall you read of love Wherefore then I am emboldened to hope that when you shall have turned the last page and closed this book you shall do so with a sigh P V LONDON BOOK ONE CHAPTER I CHIEFLY CONCERNING MY UNCLE S LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT And to my nephew Maurice Vibart I bequeath the sum of twenty thousand pounds in the fervent hope that it may help him to the devil within the year or as soon after as may be Here mister Grainger paused in his reading to glance up over the rim of his spectacles while Sir Richard lay back in his chair and laughed loudly Gad he exclaimed still chuckling I d give a hundred pounds if he could have been present to hear that and the baronet went off into another roar of merriment mister Grainger on the other hand dignified and solemn coughed a short dry cough behind his hand Help him to the devil within the year repeated Sir Richard still chuckling Pray proceed sir said I motioning towards the will But instead of complying mister Grainger laid down the parchment and removing his spectacles began to polish them with a large silk handkerchief You are I believe unacquainted with your cousin Sir Maurice Vibart he inquired I have never seen him said I all my life has been passed either at school or the university but I have frequently heard mention of him nevertheless Egad cried Sir Richard who hasn t heard of Buck Vibart beat Ted Jarraway of Swansea in five rounds drove coach and four down Whitehall on sidewalk ran away with a French marquise while but a boy of twenty and shot her husband into the bargain Devilish celebrated figure in sporting circles friend of the Prince Regent So I understand said I Altogether as complete a young blackguard as ever swaggered down saint James s Having said which Sir Richard crossed his legs and inhaled a pinch of snuff Twenty thousand pounds is a very handsome sum remarked mister Grainger ponderously and as though more with the intention of saying something rather than remain silent just then Indeed it is said I and might help a man to the devil as comfortably as need be but Though pursued mister Grainger much below his expectations and sadly inadequate to his present needs I fear That is most unfortunate said I but His debts said mister Grainger busy at his spectacles again his debts are very heavy I believe Then doubtless some arrangement can be made to but continue your reading I beg said I mister Grainger repeated his short dry cough and taking up the will slowly and almost as though unwillingly cleared his throat and began as follows Furthermore to my nephew Peter Vibart cousin to the above I will and bequeath my blessing and the sum of ten guineas in cash wherewith to purchase a copy of Zeno or any other of the stoic philosophers he may prefer Again mister Grainger laid down the will and again he regarded me over the rim of his spectacles Good God cried Sir Richard leaping to his feet the man must have been mad Ten guineas why it s an insult damme it s an insult you ll never take it of course Peter On the contrary sir said I But ten guineas bellowed the baronet on my soul now George was a cold blooded fish but I didn t think even he was capable of such a despicable trick no curse me if I did Why it would have been kinder to have left you nothing at all but it was like George bitter to the end ten guineas Is ten guineas said I and when one comes to think of it much may be done with ten guineas Sir Richard grew purple in the face but before he could speak mister Grainger began to read again Moreover the sum of five hundred thousand pounds now vested in the funds shall be paid to either Maurice or Peter Vibart aforesaid if either shall within one calendar year become the husband of the Lady Sophia Sefton of Cambourne Good God exclaimed Sir Richard Failing which read mister Grainger the said sum namely five hundred thousand pounds shall be bestowed upon such charity or charities as the trustees shall select Signed by me this tenth day of April eighteen hundred and GEORGE VIBRART Duly witnessed by ADAM PENFLEET MARTHA TRENT Here mister Grainger s voice stopped and I remember in the silence that followed the parchment crackled very loudly as he folded it precisely and laid it on the table before him I remember also that Sir Richard was swearing vehemently under his breath as he paced to and fro between me and the window And that is all I inquired at last That said mister Grainger not looking at me now is all The Lady Sophia murmured Sir Richard as if to himself the Lady Sophia And then stopping suddenly before me in his walk Oh Peter said he clapping his hand down upon my shoulder oh Peter that settles it you re done for boy a crueller will was never made Marriage said I to myself Hum A damnable iniquity exclaimed Sir Richard striding up and down the room again The Lady Sophia Sefton of Cambourne said I rubbing my chin Why that s just it roared the baronet she s a reigning toast most famous beauty in the country London s mad over her she can pick and choose from all the finest gentlemen in England Oh it s good by to all your hopes of the inheritance Peter and that s the devil of it Sir I fail to see your argument said I What cried Sir Richard facing round on me d you think you d have a chance with her then Why not Without friends position of money Pish boy don t I tell you that every buck and dandy every mincing macaroni in the three kingdoms would give his very legs to marry her either for her beauty or her fortune spluttered the baronet And let me inform you further that she s devilish high and haughty with it all they do say she even rebuffed the Prince Regent himself But then sir I consider myself a better man than the Prince Regent said I Sir Richard sank into the nearest chair and stared at me openmouthed Sir I continued you doubtless set me down as an egoist of egoists I freely confess it so are you so is mister Grainger yonder so are we all of us egoists in thinking ourselves as good as some few of our neighbors and better than a great many Deuce take me said Sir Richard Referring to the Lady Sophia I have heard that she once galloped her horse up the steps of saint Paul s Cathedral And down again Peter added Sir Richard Also she is said to be possessed of a temper I continued and is above the average height I believe and I have a natural antipathy to termagants more especially tall ones Termagant cried Sir Richard Why she s the handsomest woman in London boy She s none of your milk and watery meek mouthed misses curse me no She s all fire and blood and high mettle a woman sir glorious divine damme sir a black browed goddess a positive plum Sir Richard said I should I ever contemplate marriage which is most improbable my wife must be sweet and shy gentle eyed and soft of voice instead of your bold strong armed horse galloping creature above all she must be sweet and clinging Sweet and sticky oh the devil Hark to the boy Grainger cried Sir Richard hark to him and one glance of the glorious Sefton s bright eyes one glance only Grainger and he d be at her feet on his knees on his confounded knees sir The question is how do you propose to maintain yourself in the future said mister Grainger at this point life under your altered fortunes must prove necessarily hard mister Peter And yet sir I answered a fortune with a wife tagged on to it must prove a very mixed blessing after all and then again there may be a certain amount of satisfaction in stepping into a dead man s shoes but I very foolishly perhaps have a hankering for shoes of my own Surely there must be some position in life that I am competent to fill some position that would maintain me honorably and well I flatter myself that my years at Oxford were not altogether barren of result By no means put in Sir Richard you won the High Jump I believe Sir I did said I also Throwing the Hammer And spent two thousand pounds per annum said Sir Richard Sir I did but between whiles managed to do fairly well in the Tripos to finish a new and original translation of Quintilian another of Petronius Arbiter and also a literal rendering into the English of the Memoirs of the Sieur de Brantome For none of which you have hitherto found a publisher inquired mister Grainger Not as yet said I but I have great hopes of my Brantome as you are probably aware this is the first time he has ever been translated into the English Hum said Sir Richard ha and in the meantime what do you intend to do On that head I have as yet come to no definite conclusion sir I answered I have been wondering began mister Grainger somewhat diffidently if you would care to accept a position in my office To be sure the remuneration would be small at first and quite insignificant in comparison to the income you have been in the receipt of But it would have been money earned said I which is infinitely preferable to that for which we never turn a hand at least I think so Then you accept No sir said I though I am grateful to you and thank you most sincerely for your offer yet I have never felt the least inclination to the practice of law where there is no interest one s work must necessarily suffer and I have no desire that your business should be injured by any carelessness of mine What do you think of a private tutorship It would suit me above all things were it not for the fact that the genus Boy is the most aggravating of all animals and that I am conscious of a certain shortness of temper at times which might result in pain to my pupil loss of dignity to myself and general unpleasantness to all concerned otherwise a private tutorship would suit most admirably Here Sir Richard took another pinch of snuff and sat frowning up at the ceiling while mister Grainger began tying up that document which had so altered my prospects As for me I crossed to the window and stood staring out at the evening Everywhere were trees tinted by the rosy glow of sunset trees that stirred sleepily in the gentle wind and far away I could see that famous highway built and paved for the march of Roman Legions winding away to where it vanished over distant Shooter s Hill And pray said Sir Richard still frowning at the ceiling what do you propose to do with yourself Now as I looked out upon this fair evening I became of a sudden possessed of an overmastering desire a great longing for field and meadow and hedgerow for wood and coppice and shady stream for sequestered inns and wide wind swept heaths and ever the broad highway in front Thus I answered Sir Richard s question unhesitatingly and without turning from the window I shall go sir on a walking tour through Kent and Surrey into Devonshire and thence probably to Cornwall And with a miserable ten guineas in your pocket Preposterous absurd retorted Sir Richard On the contrary sir said I the more I ponder the project the more enamored of it I become And when your money is all gone how then I shall turn my hand to some useful employment said I digging for instance Digging ejaculated Sir Richard and you a scholar and what is more a gentleman My dear Sir Richard said I that all depends upon how you would define a gentleman To me he would appear of late years to have degenerated into a creature whose chief end in life is to spend money he has never earned to reproduce his species with a deplorable frequency and promiscuity habitually to drink more than is good for him and between whiles to fill in his time hunting cock fighting or watching entranced while two men pound each other unrecognizable in the prize ring Occasionally he has the good taste to break his neck in the hunting field or get himself gloriously shot in a duel but the generality live on to a good old age turn their attention to matters political and following the dictates of their class damn reform with a whole hearted fervor equalled only by their rancor Deuce take me ejaculated Sir Richard feebly while mister Grainger buried his face in his pocket handkerchief To my mind I ended the man who sweats over a spade or follows the tail of a plough is far nobler and higher in the Scheme of Things than any of your young bloods driving his coach and four to Brighton to the danger of all and sundry Sir Richard slowly got up out of his chair staring at me open mouthed Good God he exclaimed at last the boy s a Revolutionary I smiled and shrugged my shoulders but before I could speak mister Grainger interposed sedate and solemn as usual Referring to your proposed tour mister Peter when do you expect to start Early to morrow morning sir I will not attempt to dissuade you well knowing the difficulty said he with a faint smile but a letter addressed to me at Lincoln s Inn will always find me and receive my most earnest attention So saying he rose bowed and having shaken my hand left the room closing the door behind him Peter exclaimed the baronet striding up and down Peter you are a fool sir a hot headed self sufficient pragmatical young fool sir curse me I am sorry you should think so I answered And he continued regarding me with a defiant eye I shall expect you to draw upon me for any sum that that you may require for the present friendship s sake boyhood and and all that sort of thing and er oh damme you understand Peter Sir Richard said I grasping his unwilling hand I I thank you from the bottom of my heart Pooh Peter dammit said he snatching his hand away and thrusting it hurriedly into his pocket out of farther reach Thank you sir I reiterated be sure that should I fall ill or any unforeseen calamity happen to me I will most gladly most gratefully accept your generous aid in the spirit in which it is offered but But exclaimed Sir Richard Until then Oh the devil said Sir Richard and ringing the bell ordered his horse to be brought to the door and thereafter stood with his back to the empty fireplace his fists thrust down into his pockets frowning heavily and with a fixed intentness at the nearest armchair Sir Richard Anstruther is tall and broad ruddy of face with a prominent nose and great square chin whose grimness is offset by a mouth singularly sweet and tender and the kindly light of blue eyes he is in very truth a gentleman Indeed as he stood there in his plain blue coat with its high roll collar and shining silver buttons his spotless moleskins and heavy square toed riding boots he was as fair a type as might be of the English country gentleman It is such men as he who fearless upon the littered quarterdecks of reeling battleships undismayed amid the smoke and death of stricken fields their duty well and nobly done have turned their feet homewards to pass their latter days amid their turnips and cabbages beating their swords into pruning hooks and glad enough to do it Peter said he suddenly Sir said I You never saw your father to remember did you No Sir Richard Nor your mother Nor my mother Poor boy poor boy You knew my mother Yes Peter I knew your mother said Sir Richard staring very hard at the chair again and I saw that his mouth had grown wonderfully tender Yours has been a very secluded life hitherto Peter he went on after a moment Entirely so said I with the exception of my never to be forgotten visits to the Hall Ah yes I taught you to ride remember You are associated with every boyish pleasure I ever knew said I laying my hand upon his arm Sir Richard coughed and grew suddenly red in the face Why ah you see Peter he began picking up his riding whip and staring at it you see your uncle was never very fond of company at any time whereas I Whereas you could always find time to remember the lonely boy left when all his companions were gone on their holidays left to his books and the dreary desolation of the empty schoolhouse and echoing cloisters Pooh exclaimed Sir Richard redder than ever Bosh Do you think I can ever forget the glorious day when you drove over in your coach and four and carried me off in triumph and how we raced the white hatted fellow in the tilbury And beat him added Sir Richard Took off his near wheel on the turn said I The fool s own fault said Sir Richard And left him in the ditch cursing us said I Egad yes Peter Oh but those were fine horses and though I say it no better team in the south country You ll remember the off wheeler broke his leg shortly after and had to be shot poor devil And later at Oxford I began What now Peter said Sir Richard frowning darkly Do you remember the bronze vase that used to stand on the mantelpiece in my study Bronze vase repeated Sir Richard intent upon his whip again I used to find bank notes in it after you had visited me and when I hid the vase they turned up just the same in most unexpected places Young fellow must have money necessary now and then muttered Sir Richard At this juncture with a discreet knock the butler appeared to announce that Sir Richard s horse was waiting Hereupon the baronet somewhat hastily caught up his hat and gloves and I followed him out of the house and down the steps Sir Richard drew on his gloves thrust his toe into the stirrup and then turned to look at me over his arm Peter said he Sir Richard said I Regarding your walking tour Yes I think it s all damned tomfoolery said Sir Richard After saying which he swung himself into the saddle with a lightness and ease that many younger might have envied I m sorry for that sir because my mind is set upon it With ten guineas in your pocket That with due economy should be ample until I can find some means to earn more A fiddlestick sir an accursed fiddlestick snorted Sir Richard How is a boy an unsophisticated hot headed young fool of a boy to earn his own living Others have done it I began Pish said the baronet And been the better for it in the end Tush said the baronet And I have a great desire to see the world from the viewpoint of the multitude Bah said the baronet so forcibly that his mare started this comes of your damnable Revolutionary tendencies Let me tell you Want is a hard master and the world a bad place for one who is moneyless and without friends You forget sir I shall never be without a friend God knows it boy answered Sir Richard and his hand fell and rested for a moment upon my shoulder Peter said he very slowly and heavily I m growing old and I shall never marry and sometimes Peter of an evening I get very lonely and lonely Peter He stopped for a while gazing away towards the green slopes of distant Shooter s Hill Oh boy said he at last won t you come to the Hall and help me to spend my money Without answering I reached up and clasped his hand it was the hand which held his whip and I noticed how tightly he gripped the handle and wondered Sir Richard said I at last wherever I go I shall treasure the recollection of this moment but But Peter But sir Oh dammit he exclaimed and set spurs to his mare Yet once he turned in his saddle to flourish his whip to me ere he galloped out of sight CHAPTER II I SET OUT The clock of the square towered Norman church a mile away was striking the hour of four as I let myself out into the morning It was dark as yet and chilly but in the east was already a faint glimmer of dawn Reaching the stables I paused with my hand on the door hasp listening to the hiss hissing that told me Adam the groom was already at work within As I entered he looked up from the saddle he was polishing and touched his forehead with a grimy forefinger You be early abroad mister Peter Yes said I I wish to be on Shooter s Hill at sunrise but first I came to say good by to Wings To be sure sir nodded Adam picking up his lanthorn Upon the ensuing interview I will not dwell it was affecting both to her and to myself for we were mutually attached Sir said Adam when at last the stable door had closed behind us that there mare knows as you re a leaving her I think she does Adam Osses be wonderful wise sir Yes Adam This is a bad day for Wings sir and all of us for that matter I hope not Adam You be a going away they tell me sir Yes going away I nodded Wonder what ll become o the mare sir Ah yes I wonder said I Everything to be sold under the will I think sir Everything Adam Excuse me sir said he knuckling his forehead you won t be wanting ever a groom will you No Adam I answered shaking my head I sha n t be wanting a groom Nor yet a body servant sir No Adam nor yet a body servant Here there ensued a silence during which Adam knuckled his right temple again and I tightened the buckle of my knapsack I think Adam said I I think it is going to be a fine day Yes sir Good by Adam said I and held out my hand Good by sir And having shaken my hand he turned and went back into the stable So I set off walking beneath an avenue of trees looming up gigantic on either hand At the end was the lodge and ere I opened the gates for John the lodgekeeper was not yet astir ere I opened the gates I say I paused for one last look at the house that had been all the home I had ever known since I could remember As I stood thus with my eyes upon the indistinct mass I presently distinguished a figure running towards me and as he came up recognized Adam It ain t much sir but it s all I ave said he and thrust a short thick well smoked clay pipe into my hand a pipe that was fashioned to the shape of a negro s head It s a good pipe sir he went on a mortal good pipe and as sweet as a nut saying which he turned about and ran off leaving me standing there with his parting gift in my hand And having put the pipe into an inner pocket I opened the gate and started off at a good pace along the broad highway It was a bleak desolate world that lay about me a world of shadows and a white low lying mist that filled every hollow and swathed hedge and tree a lowering earth and a frowning heaven infinitely depressing But the eastern sky was clear with an ever growing brightness hope lay there so as I walked I kept my eyes towards the east Being come at last to that eminence which is called Shooter s Hill I sat down upon a bank beside the way and turned to look back upon the wonderful city And as I watched the pearly east changed little by little to a varying pink which in turn slowly gave place to reds and yellows until up came the sun in all his majesty gilding vane and weathercock upon a hundred spires and steeples and making a glory of the river Far away upon the white riband of road that led across Blackheath a chaise was crawling but save for that the world seemed deserted I sat thus a great while gazing upon the city and marvelling at the greatness of it Truly said I to myself nowhere in the whole world is there such another city as London And presently I sighed and rising set my back to the city and went on down the hill Yes the sun was up at last and at his advent the mists rolled up and vanished the birds awoke in brake and thicket and lifting their voices sang together a song of universal praise Bushes rustled trees whispered while from every leaf and twig from every blade of grass there hung a flashing jewel With the mists my doubts of the future vanished too and I strode upon my way a very god king of my destiny walking through a tribute world where feathered songsters carolled for me and blossoming flowers wafted sweet perfume upon my path So I went on gayly down the hill rejoicing that I was alive In the knapsack at my back I had stowed a few clothes the strongest and plainest I possessed together with a shirt some half dozen favorite books and my translation of Brantome Quintilian and Petronius I had left with mister Grainger who had promised to send them to a publisher a friend of his and in my pocket was my uncle George s legacy namely ten guineas in gold And as I walked I began to compute how long such a sum might be made to last a man By practising the strictest economy I thought I might manage well enough on two shillings a day and this left me some hundred odd days in which to find some means of livelihood and if a man could not suit himself in such time then thought I he must be a fool indeed Thus my thoughts caught something of the glory of the bright sky above and the smiling earth about me as I strode along that Broad Highway which was to lead me I knew not whither yet where disaster was already lying in wait for me as you shall hear CHAPTER III CONCERNS ITSELF MAINLY WITH A HAT As the day advanced the sun beat down with an ever increasing heat and what with this and the dust I presently grew very thirsty wherefore as I went I must needs conjure up tantalizing visions of ale of ale that foamed gloriously in tankards that sparkled in glasses and gurgled deliciously from the spouts of earthen pitchers and I began to look about me for some inn where these visions might be realized and my burning thirst nobly quenched as such a thirst deserved to be On I went through this beautiful land of Kent past tree and hedge and smiling meadow by hill and dale and sloping upland while ever the sun grew hotter the winding road the dustier and my mighty thirst the mightier At length reaching the brow of a hill I espied a small inn or hedge tavern that stood back from the glare of the road seeming to nestle in the shade of a great tree and joyfully I hastened toward it As I approached I heard loud voices raised as though in altercation and a hat came hurtling through the open doorway and bounding into the road rolled over and over to my very feet And looking down at it I saw that it was a very ill used hat frayed and worn dented of crown and broken of brim yet beneath its sordid shabbiness there lurked the dim semblance of what it had once been for in the scratched and tarnished buckle in the jaunty curl of the brim it still preserved a certain pitiful air of rakishness wherefore I stooped and picking it up began to brush the dust from it as well as I might I was thus engaged when there arose a sudden bull like roar and glancing up I beheld a man who reeled backwards out of the inn and who after staggering a yard or so thudded down into the road and so lay staring vacantly up at the sky Before I could reach him however he got upon his legs and crossing unsteadily to the tree I have mentioned leaned there and I saw there was much blood upon his face which he essayed to wipe away with the cuff of his coat Now upon his whole person from the crown of his unkempt head down to his broken dusty boots there yet clung that air of jaunty devil may care rakishness which I had seen and pitied in his hat Observing as I came up how heavily he leaned against the tree and noting the extreme pallor of his face and the blank gaze of his sunken eyes I touched him upon the shoulder Sir I trust you are not hurt said I Thank you he answered his glance still wandering not in the least assure you merely tap on the nose sir unpleasant damnably but no more no more I think said I holding out the battered hat I think this is yours His eye encountering it in due time he reached out his hand somewhat fumblingly and took it from me with a slight movement of the head and shoulders that might have been a bow Thank you yes should know it among a thousand said he dreamily an old friend and a tried a very much tried one many thanks With which words he clapped the much tried friend upon his head and with another movement that might have been a bow turned short round and strode away And as he went despite the careless swing of his shoulder his legs seemed to falter somewhat in their stride and once I thought he staggered yet as I watched half minded to follow after him he settled his hat more firmly with a light tap upon the crown and thrusting his hands into the pockets of his threadbare coat fell to whistling lustily and so turning a bend in the road vanished from my sight And presently my thirst recurring to me I approached the inn and descending three steps entered its cool shade Here I found four men each with his pipe and tankard to whom a large red faced big fisted fellow was holding forth in a high state of heat and indignation Wot s England a comin to that s wot I wants to know he was saying wot s England a comin to when thievin robbers can come a walkin in on you a stealin a pint o your best ale out o your very own tankard under your very own nose wot s it a comin to Ah nodded the others solemnly that s it Joel wot W y growled the red faced innkeeper bringing his big fist down with a bang it s a comin to per dition that s wot it s a comin to And wot inquired a rather long bony man with a face half hidden in sandy whisker wot might per dition be Joel likewise wheer You must be a danged fule Tom my lad retorted he whom they called Joel redder in the face than ever Ay that ye must chorused the others I only axed wot an wheer Only axed did ye repeated Joel scornfully Ah nodded the other that s all But you re always a axin you are said Joel gloomily W ich I notice retorted the man Tom blowing into his tankard w ich I notice as you ain t never over fond o answerin Oh I ain t ain t I No you ain t repeated Tom nohow Here the red faced man grew so very red indeed that the others fell to coughing all together and shuffling their feet and giving divers other evidences of their embarrassment all save the unimpressionable Tom Seizing the occasion that now presented itself I knocked loudly upon the floor with my stick whereupon the red faced man removing his eyes slowly and by degrees from the unconcerned Tom fixed them darkly upon me Supposing said I supposing you are so very obliging as to serve me with a pint of ale Then supposin you show me the color o your money he growled come money fust I aren t takin no more risks For answer I laid the coins before him And having pocketed the money he filled and thrust a foaming tankard towards me which I emptied forthwith and called upon him for another Wheer s your money Here said I tossing a sixpence to him and you can keep the change Why ye see sir he began somewhat mollified it be precious ard to know who s a gentleman an who ain t who s a thief an who ain t these days How so Why only a little while ago just afore you chap comes a walkin in ere no account much to look at but very aughty for all that comes a walkin in ere e do an calls for a pint o ale you eard im all on ye He broke off turning to the others you all eard im call for a pint o ale Ah we eard im they nodded Comes a walkin in ere e do bold as brass calls for a pint o ale drinks it off an ands me is at you all seen im and me is at he inquired once more addressing the others Every man of us the four chimed in with four individual nods Wot s this ere says I turnin it over It s a at or once was says e Well I don t want it says I Since you ve got it you d better keep it says e Wot for says I Why says e it s only fair seein I ve got your ale it s a case of exchange says e Oh is it says I an pitched the thing out into the road an im arter it an so it ended An wot said the red faced man nodding his big head at me wot d ye think o that now Why I think you were perhaps a trifle hasty said I Oh ye do do ye Yes I nodded An for why Well you will probably remember that the hat had a band round it Ay all wore away it were too And that in the band was a buckle Ay all scratched an rusty it were well Well that tarnished buckle was of silver Silver gasped the man his jaw falling And easily worth five shillings perhaps more so that I think you were upon the whole rather hasty Saying which I finished my ale and taking up my staff stepped out into the sunshine CHAPTER IV I MEET WITH A GREAT MISFORTUNE That day I passed through several villages stopping only to eat and drink thus evening was falling as having left fair Sevenoaks behind I came to the brow of a certain hill a long and very steep descent which I think is called the River Hill And here rising stark against the evening sky was a gibbet and standing beneath it a man a short square man in a somewhat shabby coat of a bottle green and with a wide brimmed beaver hat sloped down over his eyes who stood with his feet well apart sucking the knob of a stick he carried while he stared up at that which dangled by a stout chain from the cross beam of the gibbet something black and shrivelled and horrible that had once been human As I came up the man drew the stick from his mouth and touched the brim of his hat with it in salutation An object lesson sir said he and nodded towards the loathsome mass above A very hideous one said I pausing and I think a very useless one He was as fine a fellow as ever thrust toe into stirrup the man went on pointing upwards with his stick though you d never think so to look at him now It s a horrible sight said I It is nodded the man it s a sight to turn a man s stomach that it is You knew him perhaps said I Knew him repeated the man staring at me over his shoulder knew him ah that is I knew of him A highwayman Nick Scrope his name was answered the man with a nod hung at Maidstone assizes last year and a very good end he made of it too and here he be hung up in chains all nat ral and reg lar as a warning to all and sundry The more shame to England said I to my thinking it is a scandal that our highways should be rendered odious by such horrors and as wicked as it is useless Od rot me cried the fellow slapping a cloud of dust from his coat with his stick hark to that now What said I do you think for one moment that such a sight horrible though it is could possibly deter a man from robbery or murder whose mind is already made up to it by reason of circumstances or starvation Well but it s an old custom as old as this here road True said I and that of itself but proves my argument for men have been hanged and gibbeted all these years yet robbery and murder abide with us still and are of daily occurrence Why as to that sir said the man falling into step beside me as I walked on down the hill I won t say yes and I won t say no but what I do say is as many a man might think twice afore running the chance of coming to that look And he stopped to turn and point back at the gibbet with his stick Nick can t last much longer though I ve know d em hang a good time but they made a botch of Nick not enough tar you can see where the sun catches him there Once more though my whole being revolted at the sight I must needs turn to look at the thing the tall black shaft of the gibbet and the grisly horror that dangled beneath with its chains and iron bands and from this back again to my companion to find him regarding me with a curiously twisted smile and a long barrelled pistol held within a foot of my head Well said I staring Sir said he tapping his boot with his stick I must trouble you for the shiner I see a winking at me from your cravat likewise your watch and any small change you may have For a moment I hesitated glancing from his grinning mouth swiftly over the deserted road and back again Likewise said the fellow I must ask you to be sharp about it It was with singularly clumsy fingers that I drew the watch from my fob and the pin from my cravat and passed them to him Now your pockets he suggested turn em out This command I reluctantly obeyed bringing to light my ten guineas which were as yet intact and which he pocketed forthwith and two pennies which he bade me keep For said he t will buy you a draught of ale sir and there s good stuff to be had at The White Hart yonder and there s nothin like a draught of good ale to comfort a man in any such small adversity like this here As to that knapsack now he pursued eyeing it thoughtfully it looks heavy and might hold valleybels but then on the other hand it might not and those there straps takes time to unbuckle and He broke off suddenly for from somewhere on the hill below us came the unmistakable sound of wheels Hereupon the fellow very nimbly ran across the road turned nodded and vanished among the trees and underbrush that clothed the steep slope down to the valley below CHAPTER V THE BAGMAN I was yet standing there half stunned by my loss and the suddenness of it all when a tilbury came slowly round a bend in the road the driver of which nodded lazily in his seat while his horse a sorry jaded animal plodded wearily up the steep slope of the hill As he approached I hailed him loudly upon which he suddenly dived down between his knees and produced a brass bound blunderbuss What s to do cried he a thick set round faced fellow what s to do eh and he covered me with the wide mouth of the blunderbuss Thieves said I I ve been robbed and not three minutes since Ah he exclaimed in a tone of great relief and with the color returning to his plump cheeks is that the way of it It is said I and a very bad way the fellow has left me but twopence in the world Twopence ah Come I went on you are armed I see the thief took to the brushwood here not three minutes ago we may catch him yet Catch him repeated the fellow staring Yes don t I tell you he has stolen all the money I possess Except twopence said the fellow Yes Well twopence ain t to be sneezed at and if I was you Come we re losing time said I cutting him short But my mare what about my mare She ll stand I answered she s tired enough The Bagman for such I took him to be sighed and blunderbuss in hand prepared to alight but in the act of doing so paused Was the rascal armed he inquired over his shoulder To be sure he was said I The Bagman got back into his seat and took up the reins What now I inquired It s this accursed mare of mine he answered she ll bolt again d ye see twice yesterday and once the day before she bolted sir and on a road like this Then lend me your blunderbuss I can t do that he replied shaking his head But why not said I impatiently Because this is a dangerous road and I don t intend to be left unarmed on a dangerous road I never have been and I never will and there s an end of it d ye see Then do you mean to say that you refuse your aid to a fellow traveler that you will sit there and let the rogue get away with all the money I possess in the world Oh no not on no account just you get up here beside me and we ll drive to The White Hart I m well known at The White Hart we ll get a few honest fellows at our heels and have this thieving rascally villain in the twinkling of an He stopped suddenly made a frantic clutch at his blunderbuss and sat staring Turning short round I saw the man in the beaver hat standing within a yard of us fingering his long pistol and with the same twisted smile upon his lips I ve a mind said he nodding his head at the Bagman I ve a great mind to blow your face off The blunderbuss fell to the roadway with a clatter Thievin rascally villain was it Damme I think I will blow your face off No don t do that said the Bagman in a strange jerky voice what ud be the good Why that there poor animal wouldn t have to drag that fat carkiss of yours up and down hills for one thing I ll get out and walk And it might learn ye to keep a civil tongue in your head I I didn t mean any offence Then chuck us your purse growled the other and be quick about it The Bagman obeyed with wonderful celerity and I heard the purse chink as the footpad dropped it into the pocket of his greatcoat As for you said he turning to me you get on your way and never mind me forget you ever had ten guineas and don t go a riskin your vallyble young life come up with you and he motioned me into the tilbury with his pistol What about my blunderbuss expostulated the Bagman faintly as I seated myself beside him you ll give me my blunderbuss cost me five pound it did More fool you said the highwayman and picking up the unwieldy weapon he hove it into the ditch As to our argyment regardin gibbetin sir said he nodding to me I m rayther inclined to think you was in the right on it arter all Then turning towards the Bagman Drive on fat face said he and sharp s the word Whereupon the Bagman whipped up his horse and as the tired animal struggled forward over the crest of the hill I saw the highwayman still watching us Very soon we came in view of The White Hart an inn I remembered to have passed on the right hand side of the road and scarce were we driven up to the door than down jumped the Bagman leaving me to follow at my leisure and running into the tap forthwith began recounting his loss to all and sundry so that I soon found we were become the center of a gaping crowd much to my disgust Indeed I would have slipped away but each time I attempted to do so the Bagman would appeal to me to corroborate some statement Galloping Dick himself or I m a Dutchman he cried for the twentieth time up he comes bold as brass bless you and a horse pistol in each hand Hold hard says I and ups with my blunderbuss you remember as I ups with my blunderbuss he inquired turning to me Quite well said I Ah but you should have seen the fellow s face when he saw my blunderbuss ready at my shoulder green it was green as grass for if ever there was death in a man s face and sudden death at that there was sudden death in mine when all at once my mare my accursed mare jibbed Yes yes cried half a dozen breathless voices what then Why then gentlemen said the Bagman shaking his head and frowning round upon the ring of intent faces why then gentlemen being a resolute determined fellow I did what any other man of spirit would have done I Dropped your blunderbuss said I Ay to be sure I did And he pitched it into the ditch said I Ay nodded the Bagman dubiously while the others crowded nearer And then he took your money and called you Fool and Fatface and so it ended said I With which I pushed my way from the circle and finding a quiet corner beside the chimney sat down and with my last twopence paid for a tankard of ale CHAPTER VI WHAT BEFELL ME AT THE WHITE HART When a man has experienced some great and totally unexpected reverse of fortune has been swept from one plane of existence to another that he should fail at once to recognize the full magnitude of that change is but natural for his faculties must of necessity be numbed more or less by its very suddenness Yesterday I had been reduced from affluence to poverty with an unexpectedness that had dazed me for the time being and from the poverty of an hour ago I now found myself reduced to an utter destitution without the wherewithal to pay for the meanest night s lodging And contrasting the careless ease of a few days since with my present lamentable situation I fell into a gloomy meditation and the longer I thought it over the more dejected I became To be sure I might apply to Sir Richard for assistance but my pride revolted at even the thought more especially at such an early stage moreover I had determined beforehand to walk my appointed road unaided from the first From these depressing thoughts I was presently aroused by a loud rough voice at no great distance to which though I had been dimly conscious of it for some time I had before paid no attention Now however I raised my eyes from the spot upon the floor where they had rested hitherto and fixed them upon the speaker He was a square shouldered bullet headed fellow evidently held in much respect by his companions for he occupied the head of the table and I noticed that when ever he spoke the others held their peace and hung upon the words with an appearance of much respect Yes sirs says I he began louder than before and with a flourish of his long stemmed pipe yes sirs Tom Cragg s my name an craggy s my natur says I I be ard sirs dey vilish ard an uncommon rocky Ere s a face as likes good knocks I says w y when I fought Crib Burke o Bristol e broke is and again my jaw so e did an I scarce knowed e d it me till I see im oppin wi the pain of it Come sirs says I who ll give me a black eye a fiver s all I ask Well up comes a young buck ready an willin Tom says e I ll take two flaps at that figger head o yourn for seven guineas come what d ye say I says done says I So my fine gentleman lays by is at an cane strips off is right and glove an eavin back lets fly at me Bang comes is fist again my jaw an there s my gentleman a dabbin at is broken knuckles wi is ankercher Come my lord says I fair is fair take your other whack Damnation says e take your money an go to the devil says e I thought you was flesh an blood an not cast iron Craggy my lord says I gathering up the rhino Cragg by name an craggy by natur my lord says I Hereupon ensued a roar of laughter with much slapping of thighs and stamping of feet while the bullet headed man solemnly emptied his tankard which was the signal for two or three of those nearest to vie for its possession during which Tom Cragg sucked dreamily at his pipe and stared placidly up at the ceiling Now Tom said a tall bony individual chiefly remarkable in possessing but one eye and that so extremely pale and watery as to give one the idea that it was very much overworked now Tom said he setting down the refilled tankard at the great man s elbow with a triumphant flourish tell us ow you shook ands wi the Prince Regent Ah tell us chimed the rest Well said the bullet headed man stooping to blow the froth from his ale it was arter I beat Jack Nolan of Brummagem The Prince e come a runnin to me e did as I sat in my corner a workin at a loose tusk Tom e says Tom you be a wonder I done Jack Nolan up proper I think your Ighness says I Tom says e wi tears in is eyes you ave an if I ad my way says e I d make you Prime Minister to morrer e says An slapped me on the back e did wi is merry own and an likewise gave me this ere pin saying which he pointed to a flaming diamond horseshoe which he wore stuck through his neckerchief The stones were extremely large and handsome looking very much out of place on the fellow s rough person and seemed in some part to bear out his story Though indeed as regarded his association with the Prince Regent whose tastes were at all times peculiar to say the least and whose love for the fancy was notorious I thought it on the whole very probable for despite Craggy s words foolishly blatant though they sounded there was about him in his low retreating brow his small deep set eyes his great square jowl and heavy chin a certain air there was no mistaking I also noticed that the upper half of one ear was unduly thick and swollen which is a mark I believe of the professional pugilist alone Tom cried the one eyed man wot s all this we heerd of Ted Jarraway of Swansea bein knocked out in five rounds by this ere Lord Vibbot up in London Vibbot repeated Cragg frowning into his tankard I aven t eard of no Vibbot neither lord earl nor dook Come Tom coaxed the other everybody s heerd o Buck Vibbot im they calls the Fightin Barronite If said Cragg rolling his bullet head if you was to ask me who put Ted Jarraway to sleep I should answer you Sir Maurice Vibart commonly called Buck Vibart an it took ten rounds to do it not five As may be expected at this mention of my cousin s name I pricked up my ears And what s all this bout him putting out Tom Cragg in three At this there was a sudden silence and all eyes were turned towards the speaker a small red headed fellow with a truculent eye Come said he blowing out a cloud of tobacco smoke in three rounds What d ye say to that now come Cragg had started up in his chair and now sat scowling at his inquisitor open mouthed and in the hush I could hear the ticking of the clock in the corner and the crackle of the logs upon the hearth Then all at once Cragg s pipe shivered to fragments on the floor and he leapt to his feet In one stride as it seemed he reached the speaker who occupied the corner opposite mine but even as he raised his fist he checked himself before the pocket pistol which the other held levelled across the table Come come none o that said the red headed man his eye more truculent than ever I ain t a fightin cove myself and I don t want no trouble all I asks is what about Buck Vibart putting out Tom Cragg in three rounds That s a civil question ain t it what d ye say now come I says cried Tom Cragg flourishing a great fist in the air I says as e done it on a foul And he smote the table a blow that set the glasses ringing Done it on a foul cried three or four voices On a foul repeated Cragg Think again said the red headed man t were said as it was a werry clean knock out An I say it were done on a foul reiterated Cragg with another blow of his fist an wot s more if Buck Vibart stood afore me ah in this ere very room I d prove my words Humph said the red headed man they do say as he s wonderful quick wi his mauleys an can hit like a sledgehammer Quick wi is ands e may be an able to give a goodish thump but as for beatin me it s all me eye an Betty Martin an you can lay to that my lads I could put im to sleep any time an anywhere an I d like ah I d like to see the chap as says contrairy And here the pugilist scowled round upon his hearers more especially the red headed man so blackly that one or two of them shuffled uneasily and the latter individual appeared to become interested in the lock of his pistol I d like repeated Cragg ah I d like to see the cove as says contrairy No one ain t a goin to Tom said the one eyed man soothingly not a soul Lord bless you I only wish they would growled Cragg Ain t there nobody to obleege the gentleman inquired the red headed man I d fight any man as ever was born wish I may die snorted Cragg You always was so fiery Tom purred the one eyed man blinking his pale orb I were cried the prizefighter working himself into another rage ah an I m proud of it I d fight any man as ever wore breeches why burn me I d give any man ten shillin as could stand up to me for ten minutes Ten shillings said I to myself ten shillings when one comes to think of it is a very handsome sum more especially when one is penniless and destitute Wish I may die roared Cragg smiting his fist down on the table again a guinea a golden guinea to the man as could stand on is pins an fight me for five minutes an as for Buck Vibart curse im I say as e won on a foul A guinea said I to myself is a fortune And setting down my empty tankard I crossed the room and touched Cragg upon the shoulder I will fight you said I for a guinea Now as the fellow s eyes met mine he rose up out of his chair and his mouth opened slowly but he spoke no word backing from me until he was stayed by the table where he stood staring at me And once again there fell a silence in which I heard the tick of the clock in the corner and the crackle of the logs upon the hearth You said he recovering himself with an effort you and as he spoke I saw his left eyelid twitch suddenly Exactly I answered I think I can stand up to even you for five minutes Now as I spoke he winked at me again That it was meant for me was certain seeing that his back was towards the others though what he intended to convey I could form no idea so I assumed as confident an air as possible and waited Hereupon the one eyed man broke into a sudden raucous laugh in which the others joined Ark to im lads he cried pointing to me with the stern of his pipe e be a fine un to stand up to Tom Cragg I don t think Tell un to go an larn hisself to grow whiskers fust cried a second Ay to be sure e aren t got so much as our old cat grinned a third Stay cried the one eyed man peering up at me beneath his hand Is they whiskers a peepin at me over is cravat or do my eyes deceive me Which pleasantry called forth another roar of laughter at my expense Now very foolishly perhaps this nonsense greatly exasperated me for I was at that time painfully conscious of my bare lips and chin It was therefore with an effort that I mastered my quickly rising temper and once more addressed myself to Cragg I am willing said I to accept your conditions and fight you for a guinea or any other man here for that matter except the humorous gentleman with the watery eye who can name his own price The fellow in question stared at me glanced slowly round and sitting down buried his face in his tankard Come Tom Cragg said I a while ago you seemed very anxious for a man to fight well I m your man and with the words I stripped off my coat and laid it across a chairback This apparent willingness on my part was but a cloak for my real feelings for I will not here disguise the fact that the prospect before me was anything but agreeable indeed my heart was thumping in a most unpleasant manner and my tongue and lips had become strangely parched and dry as I fronted Cragg Truly he looked dangerous enough with his beetling brow his great depth of chest and massive shoulders and the possibility of a black eye or so and general pounding from the fellow s knotted fists was daunting in the extreme Still the chance of earning a guinea even under such conditions was not to be lightly thrown away therefore I folded my arms and waited with as much resolution as I could Sir said Cragg speaking in a very altered tone sir you seem oncommon eager for it I shall be glad to get it over said I If he went on slowly if I said anything against you know who I m sorry for it me aving the greatest respec for you know who you understand me I think And herewith he winked three separate and distinct times No I don t understand you in the least said I nor do I think it at all necessary all that I care about is the guinea in question Come Tom cried one of the company knock is ead off to begin with Ay set about m Tom cut your gab an finish im and here came the clatter of chairs as the company rose Can t be done said Cragg shaking his head leastways not ere I m not particular said I if you prefer we might manage it very well in the stable with a couple of lanthorns The barn would be the very place suggested the landlord bustling eagerly forward and wiping his hands on his apron the very place plenty of room and nice and soft to fall on If you would only put off your fightin till to morrow we might cry it through the villages twould be a big draw Ecod we might make a purse o twenty pound if you only would Think it over think it over To morrow I hope to be a good distance from here said I come the sooner it is over the better show us your barn So the landlord called for lanthorns and led the way to a large outbuilding at the back of the inn into which we all trooped It seems to be a good place and very suitable said I You may well say that returned the landlord it s many a fine bout as has been brought off in ere the time Jem Belcher beat The Young Ruffian the Prince o Wales sat in a cheer over in that theer corner ah that was a day if you please If Tom Cragg is ready said I turning up the wristbands of my shirt why so am I Here it was found to every one s surprise and mine in particular that Tom Cragg was not in the barn Surprise gave place to noisy astonishment when after much running to and fro it was further learned that he had vanished altogether The inn itself the stables and even the haylofts were ransacked without avail Tom Cragg was gone as completely as though he had melted into thin air and with him all my hopes of winning the guinea and a comfortable bed It was with all my old dejection upon me therefore that I returned to the tap room and refusing the officious aid of the One Eyed Man put on my coat readjusted my knapsack and crossed to the door On the threshold I paused and looked back If said I glancing round the ring of faces if there is any man here who is at all willing to fight for a guinea ten shillings or even five I should be very glad of the chance to earn it But seeing how each wilfully avoiding my eye held his peace I sighed and turning my back upon them set off along the darkening road CHAPTER VII OF THE FURTHER PUZZLING BEHAVIOR OF TOM CRAGG THE PUGILIST Evening had fallen and I walked along in no very happy frame of mind the more so as the rising wind and flying wrack of clouds above through which a watery moon had peeped at fitful intervals seemed to presage a wild night It needed but this to make my misery the more complete for as far as I could tell if I slept at all and I was already very weary it must of necessity be beneath some hedge or tree As I approached the brow of the hill I suddenly remembered that I must once more pass the gibbet and began to strain my eyes for it Presently I spied it sure enough its grim gaunt outline looming through the murk and instinctively I quickened my stride so as to pass it as soon as might be I was almost abreast of it when a figure rose from beneath it and slouched into the road to meet me I stopped there and then and grasping my heavy staff waited its approach Be that you sir said a voice and I recognized the voice of Tom Cragg What are you doing and there of all places Oh I ain t afeared of im answered Cragg jerking his thumb towards the gibbet I ain t afeard o none as ever drawed breath dead or livin except it be is Ighness the Prince Regent And what do you want with me I opes as theer s no offence my lord said he knuckling his forehead and speaking in a tone that was a strange mixture of would be comradeship and cringing servility Cragg is my name an craggy s my natur but I know when I m beat I knowed ye as soon as I laid my peepers on ye an if I said as it were a foul why when a man s in is cups d ye see e s apt to shoot rayther wide o the gospel d ye see an there was no offence my lord strike me blind I know you an you know me Tom Cragg by name an craggy by But I don t know you said I and for that matter neither do you know me W y you ain t got no whiskers my lord leastways not with you now but And what the devil has that got to do with it said I angrily Disguises p raps said the fellow with a sly leer arter that theer kidnappin an me avin laid out Sir Jarsper Trent in Wych Street accordin to your orders my lord the Prince give me word to clear out cut an run for it till it blow d over an I thought p raps knowin as you an im ad ad words I thought as you ad cut stick too And I think that you are manifestly drunk said I if you still wish to fight for any sum no matter how small put up your hands if not get out of my road The craggy one stepped aside somewhat hastily which done he removed his hat and stood staring and scratching his bullet head as one in sore perplexity I seen a many rum goes in my time said he but I never see so rummy a go as this ere strike me dead So I left him and strode on down the hill As I went the moon shot out a feeble ray through some rift in the rolling clouds and looking back I saw him standing where I had left him beneath the gibbet still scratching his bullethead and staring after me down the hill Now though the whole attitude and behavior of the fellow was puzzling to no small degree my mind was too full of my own concerns to give much thought to him indeed scarce was he out of my sight but I forgot him altogether for what with my weariness the long dark road before and behind me and my empty pockets I became a prey to great dejection So much so that I presently sank wearily beside the way and resting my chin in my hands sat there miserably enough watching the night deepen about me And yet said I to myself if as Epictetus says to despise a thing is to possess it then am I rich for I have always despised money and if weary as I am I can manage to condemn the luxury of a feather bed then tonight lying in this grassy ditch beneath the stars I shall slumber as sweetly as ever I did between the snowy sheets Saying which I rose and began to look about for some likely nook in the hedge where I might pass the night I was thus engaged when I heard the creak of wheels and the pleasant rhythmic jingle of harness on the dark hill above and in a little while a great wagon or wain piled high with hay hove into view the driver of which rolled loosely in his seat with every jolt of the wheels so that it was a wonder he did not roll off altogether As he came level with me I hailed him loudly whereupon he started erect and brought his horses to a stand Hulloa he bellowed in the loud strident tone of one rudely awakened w at do ee want wi I A lift I answered will you give a tired fellow a lift on his way W y I dunno be you a talkin chap I don t think so said I Because if you be a talkin chap I beant a goin to give ee a lift no ow not if I knows it give a chap a lift t other day I did took im up t other side o Sevenoaks an e talked me up ill an down ill e did dang me if I could get a wink o sleep all the way to Tonbridge so if you m a talkin chap you don t get no lift wi I I am generally a very silent chap said I besides I am too tired and sleepy to talk even if I wished Sleepy yawned the man then up you get my chap I m sleepy too I allus am Lord love ye theer s nowt like sleep up wi you my chap Forthwith up I clambered and laying myself down among the fragrant hay stretched out my tired limbs and sighed Never shall I forget the delicious sense of restfulness that stole over me as I lay there upon my back listening to the creak of the wheels the deliberate hoof strokes of the horses muffled in the thick dust of the road and the gentle snore of the driver who had promptly fallen asleep again On we went as in borne on air so soft was my bed now beneath the far flung branches of trees sometimes so low that I could have touched them with my hand now beneath a sky heavy with sombre masses of flying cloud or bright with the soft radience of the moon On I went careless alike of destination of time and of future content to lie there upon the hay and rest And so lulled by the gentle movement by the sound of wheels and harness and the whisper of the soft wind about me I presently fell into a most blessed sleep CHAPTER VIII WHICH CONCERNS ITSELF WITH A FARMER S WHISKERS AND A WAISTCOAT How long I slept I have no idea but when I opened my eyes it was to find the moon shining down on me from a cloudless heaven the wind also had died away it seemed my early fears of a wild night were not to be fulfilled and for this I was sufficiently grateful Now as I lay blinking up to the moon I presently noticed that we had come to a standstill and I listened expectantly for the jingle of harness and creak of the wheels to recommence Strange said I to myself after having waited vainly some little time and wondering what could cause the delay I sat up and looked about me The first object my eyes encountered was a haystack and beyond that another with a little to one side a row of barns and again beyond these a great rambling farmhouse Evidently the wain had reached its destination wherever that might be and the sleepy wagoner forgetful of my presence had tumbled off to bed The which I thought so excellent an example that I lay down again and drawing the loose hay over me closed my eyes and once more fell asleep My second awakening was gradual I at first became conscious of a sound rising and falling with a certain monotonous regularity that my drowsy ears could make nothing of Little by little however the sound developed itself into a somewhat mournful melody or refrain chanted by a not unmusical voice I yawned and having stretched myself sat up to look and listen And the words of the song were these When a man who muffins cries Cries not when his father dies Tis a proof that he would rather Have a muffin than his father The singer was a tall strapping fellow with a good tempered face whose ruddy health was set off by a handsome pair of black whiskers As I watched him he laid aside the pitchfork he had been using and approached the wagon but chancing to look up his eye met mine and he stopped Hulloa he exclaimed breaking short off in the middle of a note hulloa Hallo said I W at be doin up theer I was thinking I returned that under certain circumstances I for one could not blame the individual mentioned in your song for his passionate attachment to muffins At this precise moment a muffin or say five or six would be highly acceptable personally Be you partial to muffins then Yes indeed said I more especially seeing I have not broken my fast since midday yesterday Well an w at be doin in my hay I have been asleep said I Well an what business ave ye got a sleepin an a snorin in my hay I was tired said I and Nature her custom holds let shame say what it will still I do not think I snored Ow do I know that or you for that matter rejoined the farmer stroking his glossy whiskers hows ever if you be quite awake come on down out o my hay As he said this he eyed me with rather a truculent air likewise he clenched his fist Thinking it wisest to appear unconscious of this I nodded affably and letting myself down from the hay was next moment standing beside him Supposin I was to thump ee on the nose he inquired What for For makin so free wi my hay Why then said I I should earnestly endeavor to thump you on yours The farmer looked me slowly over from head to foot with a dawning surprise Thought you was a common tramper I did said he Why so I am I answered brushing the clinging hay from me Trampers o the road don t wear gentlemen s clothes leastways I never see one as did Here his eyes wandered over me again from my boots upward Half way up they stopped evidently arrested by my waistcoat a flowered satin of the very latest cut for which I had paid forty shillings in the Haymarket scarcely a week before and as I looked down at it I would joyfully have given it and every waistcoat that was ever cut to have had that forty shillings safe back in my pocket again That be a mighty fine weskit sir Do you think so said I Ah that I do w at might be the cost of a weskit the like o that now I paid forty shillings for it in the Haymarket in London scarcely a week ago I answered The fellow very slowly closed one eye at the same time striking his nose three successive raps with his forefinger Gammon said he None the less it s true said I Any man as would give forty shillin for a garment as is no mortal good agen the cold not reachin fur enough even if it do be silk an all worked wi little flowers is a dommed fool Assuredly said I with a nod Howsomever he continued it s a handsome weskit there s no denyin an well worth a woman s lookin at a proper man inside of it Not a doubt of it said I I mean said he scratching his ear and staring hard at the handle of the pitchfork a chap wi a fine pair o whiskers say Hum said I Now woman he went on shifting his gaze to the top button of his left gaiter woman is uncommon fond o a good pair o whiskers leastways so I ve heerd Indeed said I few women can look upon such things unmoved I believe and nothing can set off a pair of fine black whiskers better than a flowered satin waistcoat That s so nodded the farmer But unfortunately said I passing my hand over my smooth lips and chin I have no whiskers No returned the farmer with a thoughtful shake of the head leastways none as I can observe Now you have said I So they do tell me he answered modestly And the natural inference is that you ought to have a flowered waistcoat to go with them Why that s true to be sure he nodded The price of this one is fifteen shillings said I That s a lot o money master said he shaking his head It s a great deal less than forty said I An ten is less than fifteen an ten shillin is my price what d ye say come now You drive a hard bargain said I but the waistcoat is yours at your own price So saying I slipped off knapsack and coat and removing the garment in question having first felt through the pockets handed it to him whereupon he slowly counted the ten shillings into my hand which done he sat down upon the shaft of a cart near by and spreading out the waistcoat on his knees looked it over with glistening eyes Forty shillin you paid for un up to Lunnon said he forty shillin it were I think Forty shillings said I Ecod it s a sight o money But it s a grand weskit ah that it is So you believe me now do you said I pocketing the ten shillings Well he answered slowly I won t go so fur as that but tis a mighty fine weskit theer s no denyin an must ha cost a sight o money a powerful sight I picked up my knapsack and slipping it on took my staff and turned to depart Theer s a mug o homebrewed an a slice o fine roast beef up at th ouse if you should be so inclined Why as to that said I over my shoulder I neither eat nor drink with a man who doubts my word Meanin those forty shillin Precisely Well said he twisting his whisker with a thoughtful air if you could manage to mak it twenty or even twenty five I might mak some shift to believe it though twould be a strain but forty no damme I can t swaller that Then neither can I swallow your beef and ale said I Wheer be goin he inquired rising and following as I made for the gate To the end of the road I answered Then you be goin pretty fur that theer road leads to the sea Why then I m going to the sea said I What to do I haven t the ghost of an idea I returned Can you work Yes said I Can ye thatch a rick No said I Shear a sheep No said I Guide a plough No said I Shoe a oss No said I Then ye can t work Lord love me wheer ave e been At a university said I Where master At a place warranted to turn one out a highly educated incompetent I explained Why I don t hold wi eddication nor book larnin myself master Here I

yard I paused There is one favor you might grant me said I As what master Five minutes under the pump yonder and a clean towel The farmer nodded and crossing to one of the outhouses presently returned with a towel And resting the towel upon the pump head he seized the handle and sent a jet of clear cool water over my head and face and hands You ve got a tidy sizeable arm said he as I dried myself vigorously likewise a good strong back an shoulders theer s the makin s of a man in you as might do summat say in the plough or smithin way but it s easy to see as you re a gentleman more s the pity an won t Hows ever sir if you ve a mind to a cut o good beef an a mug o fine ale say the word First said I do you believe it was forty shillings yes or no The farmer twisted his whisker and stared very hard at the spout of the pump Tell ee what said he at length mak it thirty an I give ye my Bible oath to do the best wi it I can Then I must needs seek my breakfast at the nearest inn said I An that is the Old Cock a mile an a half nearer Tonbridge Then the sooner I start the better said I for I m mightily sharp set Why as to that said he busy with his whisker again I might stretch a pint or two an call it thirty five at a pinch what d ye say Why I say good morning and many of them And opening the gate I started off down the road at a brisk pace Now as I went it began to rain CHAPTER IX IN WHICH I STUMBLE UPON AN AFFAIR OF HONOR There are times as I suppose when the most aesthetic of souls will forget the snow of lilies and the down of a butterfly s wing to revel in the grosser joys of say a beefsteak One cannot rhapsodize upon the beauties of a sunset or contemplate the pale witchery of the moon with any real degree of poetic fervor or any degree of comfort while hunger gnaws at one s vitals for comfort is essential to your aesthete and after all soul goes hand in hand with stomach Thus I swung along the road beneath the swaying green of trees past the fragrant blooming hedges paying small heed to the beauties of wooded hill and grassy dale my eyes constantly searching the road before me for some sign of the Old Cock tavern And presently sure enough I espied it an ugly flat fronted building before which stood a dilapidated horse trough and a battered sign Despite its uninviting exterior I hurried forward and mounting the three worn steps pushed open the door I now found myself in a room of somewhat uninviting aspect though upon the hearth a smouldering fire was being kicked into a blaze by a sulky faced fellow to whom I addressed myself Can I have some breakfast here said I Why it s all according master he answered in a surly tone According to what said I According to what you want master Why as to that I began Because he went on administering a particularly vicious kick to the fire if you was to ask me for a French hortolon or even the ump of a cam el being a very truthful man I should say no But I want no such things said I And ow am I to know that ow am I to know as you ain t set your eart on the ump of a cam el I tell you I want nothing of the sort said I a chop would do Chop sighed the man scowling threateningly at the fire chop Or steak I hastened to add Now it s a steak said the man shaking his head ruefully and turning upon me a doleful eye a steak he repeated of course it would be I s pose you d turn up your nose at am and eggs it s only to be expected On the contrary said I ham and eggs will suit me very well why couldn t you have mentioned them before Why you never axed me as I remember growled the fellow Slipping my knapsack from my shoulders I sat down at a small table in a corner while the man with a final kick at the fire went to give my order In a few minutes he reappeared with some billets of wood beneath his arm and followed by a merry eyed rosy cheeked lass who proceeded very deftly to lay a snowy cloth and thereupon in due season a dish of savory ham and golden yolked eggs It s a lovely morning said I lifting my eyes to her comely face It is indeed sir said she setting down the cruet with a turn of her slender wrist Which I make so bold as to deny said the surly man dropping the wood on the hearth with a prodigious clatter ow can any morning be lovely when there ain t no love in it no not so much as would fill a thimble I say it ain t a lovely morning not by no manner o means and what I says I ain t ashamed on being a nat rally truthful man With which words he sighed kicked the fire again and stumped out Our friend would seem somewhat gloomy this morning said I He ve been that way a fortnight now come Satu day replied the slim lass nodding Oh said I Yes she continued checking a smile and sighing instead it s very sad he ve been crossed in love you see sir Poor fellow said I can t you try to console him Me sir oh no And why not I should think you might console a man for a great deal Why you see sir said she blushing and dimpling very prettily it do so happen as I m the one as crossed him Ah I understand said I I m to be married to a farmer down the road yonder leastways I haven t quite made up my mind yet A fine tall fellow I inquired Yes do ee know him sir With a handsome pair of black whiskers said I The very same sir and they do be handsome whiskers though I do say it The finest I ever saw I wish you every happiness said I Thankee sir I m sure said she and dimpling more prettily than ever she tripped away and left me to my repast And when I had assuaged my hunger I took out the pipe of Adam the groom the pipe shaped like a negro s head and calling for a paper of tobacco I filled and lighted the pipe and sat staring dreamily out of the window Happy is that man who by reason of an abundant fortune knows not the meaning of the word hunger but thrice happy is he who when the hand of famine pinches may stay his craving with such a meal as this of mine Never before and never since have I tasted just such eggs and such ham so tender so delicate so full of flavor It is a memory that can never fade Indeed sometimes even now when I grow hungry about dinner time I see once more the surly faced man the rosy cheeked waiting maid and the gloomy chamber of the Old Cock tavern as I saw them upon that early May morning of the year of grace eighteen So I sat with a contented mind smoking my pipe and staring out at the falling summer rain And presently chancing to turn my eyes up the road I beheld a chaise that galloped in a smother of mud As I watched its rapid approach the postilion swung his horses towards the inn and a moment later had pulled up before the door They had evidently travelled fast and far for the chaise was covered with dirt and the poor horses in a lather of foam hung their heads while their flanks heaved distressfully The chaise door was now thrown open and three gentlemen alighted The first was a short plethoric individual bull necked and loud of voice for I could hear him roundly cursing the post boy for some fault the second was a tall languid gentleman who carried a flat oblong box beneath one arm and who paused to fondle his whisker and look up at the inn with an exaggerated air of disgust while the third stood mutely by his hands thrust into the pockets of his greatcoat and stared straight before him The three of them entered the room together and while the languid gentleman paused to survey himself in the small cracked mirror that hung against the wall the plethoric individual bustled to the fire and loosening his coats and neckerchief spread out his hands to the blaze A good half hour before our time said he glancing towards the third gentleman who stood looking out of the window with his hands still deep in his pockets we did the last ten miles well under the hour come what do you say to a glass of brandy At this his languid companion turned from the mirror and I noticed that he too glanced at the silent figure by the window By all means said he though Sir Jasper would hardly seem in a drinking humor and with the very slightest shrug of the shoulders he turned back to the mirror again No mister Chester I am not in a drinking humor answered Sir Jasper without turning round or taking his eyes from the window Sir Jasper said I to myself now where and in what connection have I heard such a name before He was of a slight build and seemingly younger than either of his companions by some years but what struck me particularly about him was the extreme pallor of his face I noticed also a peculiar habit he had of moistening his lips at frequent intervals with the tip of his tongue and there was besides something in the way he stared at the trees the wet road and the gray sky a strange wide eyed intensity that drew and held my attention Devilish weather devilish on my life and soul exclaimed the short red faced man in a loud peevish tone tugging viciously at the bell rope hot one day cold the next now sun now rain Oh damn it Now in France ah what a climate heavenly positively divine say what you will of a Frenchman damn him by all means but the climate the country and the women who would not worship em Exactly said the languid gentleman examining a pimple upon his chin with a high degree of interest always dored a Frenchwoman myself they re so so ah so deuced French though mark you Selby he broke off as the rosy cheeked maid appeared with the brandy and glasses though mark you there s much to be said for your English country wenches after all saying which he slipped his arm about the girl s round waist There was the sound of a kiss a muffled shriek and she had run from the room slamming the door behind her whereupon the languid gentleman went back to his pimple Oh as to that Chester I quarrel only with the climate God made England and the devil sends the weather Selby said Sir Jasper in the same repressed tone that he had used before and still without taking his eyes from the gray prospect of sky and tree and winding road there is no fairer land in all the world than this England of ours it were a good thing to die for England but that is a happiness reserved for comparatively few And with the words he sighed a strange fluttering sigh and thrust his hands deeper into his pockets Die repeated the man Selby in a loud boisterous way Who talks of death Deuced unpleasant subject said the other with a shrug at the cracked mirror Something so infernally cold and clammy about it like the weather And yet it will be a glorious day later The clouds are thinning already Sir Jasper went on strange but I never realized until this morning how green and wonderful everything is The languid mister Chester forgot the mirror and turned to stare at Sir Jasper s back with raised brows while the man Selby shook his head and smiled unpleasantly As he did so his eye encountered me where I sat quietly in my corner smoking my negro head pipe and his thick brows twitched sharply together in a frown In an hour s time gentlemen pursued Sir Jasper we shall write finis to a more or less interesting incident and I beg of you in that hour to remember my prophecy that it would be a glorious day later mister Chester filled a glass and crossing to the speaker tendered it to him without a word as for Selby he stood stolidly enough his hands thrust truculently beneath his coat tails frowning at me Come said mister Chester persuasively Just a bracer Sir Jasper shook his head but next moment reached out a white unsteady hand and raised the brandy to his lips yet as he drank I saw the spirit slop over and trickle from his chin Thanks Chester said he returning the empty glass is it time we started yet It s just half past seven answered mister Chester consulting his watch and I m rather hazy as to the exact place Deepdene Wood said Sir Jasper dreamily You know the place Oh yes Then we may as well start if you are ready Yes it will be cool and fresh outside Settle the bill Selby we ll walk on slowly said mister Chester and with a last glance at the mirror he slipped his arm within Sir Jasper s and they went out together mister Selby meanwhile rang for the bill frowning at me all the time What the devil are you staring at he demanded suddenly in a loud bullying tone If you are pleased to refer to me sir said I I would say that my eyes were given for use and that having used them upon you I have long since arrived at the conclusion that I don t like you Ah said he frowning fiercer than ever Yes said I though whether it is your person your manner or your voice that displeases me most I am unable to say An impertinent young jackanapes said he damnation I think I ll pull your nose Why you may try and welcome sir said I though I should advise you not for should you make the attempt I should be compelled to throw you out of the window At this moment the pretty maid appeared and tendered him the bill with a curtesy He glanced at it tossed some money upon the table and turned to stare at me again If ever I meet you again he began You d probably know me I put in Without a doubt he answered putting on his hat and buttoning his befrogged surtout and should you he continued drawing on his gloves should you stare at me with those damned impertinent fishes eyes of yours I should most certainly pull your nose for you on the spot sir And I should as certainly throw you out of the window I nodded An impertinent young jackanapes said he again and went out banging the door behind him Glancing from the window I saw him catch up with the other two and all three walk on together down the road Sir Jasper was in the middle and I noticed that his hands were still deep in his pockets Now as I watched their forms getting smaller and smaller in the distance there grew upon me a feeling that he who walked between would nevermore come walking back And in a little having knocked out my negro head pipe upon my palm I called for and settled my score As I rose the pretty chambermaid picked up my knapsack from the corner and blushing aided me to put it on My dear thank you said I and kissed her This time she neither shrieked nor ran from the room she merely blushed a trifle rosier Do you think I have fishes eyes my dear La no sir handsome they be I m sure so bright an black an wi little lights a dancing in them there sir do ha done and go along wi you By the way I said pausing upon the worn steps and looking back at her by the way how far is it to Deepdene Wood CHAPTER X WHICH RELATES THE END OF AN HONORABLE AFFAIR Some half mile along the road upon the left hand was a stile and beyond the stile a path a path that led away over field and meadow and winding stream to the blue verge of distant woods Now midway between these woods and the place where I stood there moved three figures and far away though they were I could still make out that the middle one walked with his hands those tremulous betraying hands thrust deep within his pockets And presently I climbed the stile and set off along the path Sir Jasper said I to myself Somewhere in the background of my consciousness I had a vague recollection of having heard mention of such a name before but exactly when and where I could not for the life of me remember Sir Jasper said I to myself again It is a very uncommon name and should be easy to recollect I had often prided myself on possessing a singularly retentive memory more especially for names and faces but upon the present occasion the more I pondered the matter the more hazy I became So I walked on through the sweet wet grass racking my brain for a solution of the problem but finding none When I again looked up the three figures had vanished where the path took a sharp bend round a clump of pollard oaks and determined not to lose them I hurried my steps but when I in turn rounded the corner not a soul was in sight The path sloped up gently before me with a thick hedge upon my right and after crossing a brawling stream lost itself in the small wood or coppice that crowned the ascent Wondering I hastened forward and then happening to look through the hedge which grew very thick and high I stopped all at once On the other side of the hedge was a strip of meadow bounded by the brook I have mentioned now across this stream was a small rustic bridge and on this bridge was a man Midway between this man and myself stood a group of four gentlemen all talking very earnestly together to judge by their actions while somewhat apart from these his head bent his hands still thrust deep in his pockets stood Sir Jasper And from him for no apparent reason my eyes wandered to the man upon the bridge a tall broad shouldered fellow in a buff colored greatcoat who whistled to himself and stared down into the stream swinging his tasselled riding boot to and fro All at once as if in response to some signal he rose and unbuttoning his surtout drew it off and flung it across the handrail of the bridge mister Chester was on his knees before the oblong box and I saw the glint of the pistols as he handed them up The distance had already been paced and marked out and now each man took his ground Sir Jasper still in his greatcoat his hat over his eyes his neckerchief loose and dangling one hand in his pocket the other grasping his weapon his antagonist on the contrary jaunty and debonnair a dandy from the crown of his hat to the soles of his shining boots Their arms were raised almost together The man Selby glanced from one to the other a handkerchief fluttered fell and in that instant came the report of a pistol I saw Sir Jasper reel backward steady himself and fire in return then while the blue smoke yet hung in the still air he staggered blindly and fell mister Chester and two or three more ran forward and knelt beside him while his opponent shrugged his shoulders and taking off his hat pointed out the bullet hole to his white faced second And in a little while they lifted Sir Jasper in their arms but seeing how his head hung a sudden sickness came upon me for I knew indeed that he would go walking back nevermore Yet his eyes were wide and staring staring up at the blue heaven with the same fixed intensity as they had done at the inn Then I too looked up at the cloudless sky and round upon the fair earth and in that moment I for one remembered his prophecy of an hour ago And indeed the day was glorious CHAPTER XI WHICH RELATES A BRIEF PASSAGE AT ARMS AT THE CHEQUERS INN In due season I came into Tonbridge town and following the High Street presently observed a fine inn upon the right hand side of the way which as I remember is called The Chequers And here were divers loiterers lounging round the door or seated upon the benches but the eyes of all were turned the one way And presently as I paused before the inn to look up at its snow white plaster and massive cross beams there issued from the stable yard one in a striped waistcoat with top boots and a red face who took a straw from behind his ear and began to chew it meditatively to whom I now addressed myself Good afternoon said I Arternoon he answered A fine day said I Is it said he Why to be sure it is said I somewhat taken aback by his manner to be sure it is Oh said he and shifted the straw very dexterously from one corner of his mouth to the other by some unseen agency and stared up the road harder than ever What are you looking at I inquired Ill said he And why do you look at the hill Mail said he Oh said I Ah said he Is it the London coach Ah said he Does it stop here Ah said he Do you ever say anything much beside ah I inquired He stopped chewing the straw and with his eyes on the distance seemed to turn this question over in his mind having done which he began to chew again Ah said he Why then you can perhaps tell me how many miles it is Five said he I was about to ask how far it was to The Wells said he Why yes to be sure but how did you know that It s use said he What do you mean They all ask said he Who do Tramps said he Oh so you take me for a tramp Ah said he And you said I put me in mind of a certain Semi quavering Friar Eh said he frowning a little at the hill You ve never heard of Rabelais or Panurge of course said I The Ostler took out his straw eyed it thoughtfully and put it back again No said he More s the pity said I and was about to turn away when he drew the nearest fist abruptly from his pocket and extended it towards me Look at that he commanded Rather dirty I commented but otherwise a good useful member I make no doubt It s a goin said he alternately drawing in and shooting out the fist in question it s a goin to fill your eye up Is it said I Ah said he But what for I aren t a Semmy nor yet a Quaver an as for Friers said he very deliberately why Frier yourself says I Nevertheless said I you are gifted with a certain terse directness of speech that greatly reminds me of Joe he called out suddenly over his shoulder Mail Joe Lifting my eyes to the brow of the hill I could see nothing save a faint haze which however gradually grew denser and thicker and out from this gathering cloud soft and faint with distance stole the silvery notes of a horn Now I saw the coach itself and as I watched it rapidly descending the hill I longed to be upon it with the sun above the smooth road below and the wind rushing through my hair On it came at a gallop rocking and swaying a good fifteen miles an hour on it came plunging into the green shade of trees and out into the sun again with ever the gathering dust cloud behind while clear and high rang the cheery note of the horn And now from the cool shadows of the inn yard there rose a prodigious stamping of hoofs rattling of chains and swearing of oaths and out came four fresh horses led by two men each of whom wore topboots a striped waistcoat and chewed upon straws And now the coach swung round the bend and came thundering down upon The Chequers chains jingling wheels rumbling horn braying and with a stamp and ring of hoof pulled up before the inn And then what a running to and fro what a prodigious unbuckling and buckling of straps while the jovial faced coachman fanned himself with his hat and swore jovially at the ostlers and the ostlers swore back at the coachman and the guard and the coach and the horses individually and collectively in the midst of which confusion down came the window with a bang and out of the window came a flask and a hand and an arm and last of all a great fat face round and mottled and roaring as it came Oho I say damn it damn everybody s eyes and bones brandy O yoho house I say brandy Guard landlord ostlers brandy d ye hear I say what the devil Am I to die for want of a drop of brandy Oho Now little by little I became conscious how I cannot define that I was the object of a close and persistent scrutiny that I was being watched and stared at by some one near by Shifting my eyes therefore from the mottled face at the coach window I cast them swiftly about until they presently met those of one of the four outside passengers a tall roughly clad man who leaned far out from the coach roof watching me intently and his face was thin and very pale and the eyes which stared into mine glowed beneath a jagged prominence of brow At the time though I wondered at the man s expression and the fixity of his gaze I paid him no further heed but turned my attention back to Mottle face who had by this time bellowed himself purple Howbeit in due time the flask having been replenished and handed to him he dived back into the recesses of the coach jerked up the window and vanished as suddenly as he had appeared But now the four fresh horses were in and harnessed capering and dancing with an ostler at the head of each the Driver tossed off his glass of rum and water cast an eye up at the clouds remarked Wind by Gemini settled his feet against the dashboard and gathered up the reins And now too the Guard appeared wiping his lips as he came who also cast an eye up at the heavens remarked Dust by Jingo and swung himself up into the rumble All right behind sang out the Driver over his shoulder All right sang back the guard Then let em go cried the Driver Whereupon the ostlers jumped nimbly back the horses threw up their heads and danced undecidedly for a moment the long whip cracked hoofs clattered sparks flew and rumbling and creaking off went the London Mail with such a flourish of the horn as woke many a sleepy echo near and far As I turned away I noticed that there remained but three outside passengers the pale faced man had evidently alighted yet although I glanced round for him he was nowhere to be seen Hereupon being in no mind to undergo the operation of having my eye filled up and moreover finding myself thirsty I stepped into the Tap And there sure enough was the Outside Passenger staring moodily out of the window and with an untouched mug of ale at his elbow Opposite him sat an old man in a smock frock who leaned upon a holly stick talking to a very short fat man behind the bar who took my twopence with a smile smiled as he drew my ale and smiling watched me drink Be you from Lunnon sir inquired the old man eyeing me beneath his hoary brows as I set down my tankard Yes said I Well think o that now I ve been a goin to Lunnon this five an forty year started out twice I did but I never got no furder nor Sevenoaks How was that I inquired Why theer s The White Hart at Sevenoaks an they brews fine ale at The White Hart d ye see an one glass begets another And they sent ye back in the carrier s cart said the fat man smiling broader than ever Ever see the Lord Mayor a ridin in is goold coach sir pursued the old man Yes said I Ever speak to im Why no Ah well I once knowed a man as spoke to the Lord Mayor o Lunnon s coachman but e s dead took the smallpox the year arterwards an died e did At this juncture the door was thrown noisily open and two gentlemen entered The first was a very tall man with black hair that curled beneath his hat brim and so luxuriant a growth of whisker that it left little of his florid countenance exposed The second was more slightly built with a pale hairless face wherein were set two small very bright eyes rather close together separated by a high thin nose with nostrils that worked and quivered when he spoke a face whose most potent feature was the mouth coarse and red with a somewhat protuberant under lip yet supported by a square determined chin below a sensual mouth with more than a suspicion of cruelty lurking in its full curves and the big teeth which gleamed white and serrated when he laughed Indeed the whole aspect of the man filled me with an instinctive disgust They were dressed in that mixture of ultra fashionable and horsey styles peculiar to the Corinthian or Buck of the period and there was in their air an overbearing yet lazy insolence towards all and sundry that greatly annoyed me Fifteen thousand a year by gad exclaimed the taller of the two giving a supercilious sniff to the brandy he had just poured out Yes ha ha and a damnably pretty filly into the bargain You always were so infernally lucky retorted the first Call it rather the reward of virtue answered his companion with a laugh that showed his big white teeth And what of Beverley poor dey vil inquired the first Beverley repeated the other had he possessed any spirit he would have blown his brains out like a gentleman as it was he preferred merely to disappear and herewith the speaker shrugged his shoulders and drank off his glass with infinite relish and gusto And a pretty filly you say Oh I believe you Country bred but devilish well blooded trust Beverley for that Egad yes Beverley had a true eye for beauty or breed poor dey vil This expression of pity seemed to afford each of them much subtle enjoyment Harking back to this filly said the big man checking his merriment how if she jibs and cuts up rough kicks over the traces devilish awkward eh His companion raised his foot and rested it carelessly upon the settle near by and upon the heel of his slim riding boot I saw a particularly cruel looking long necked spur My dear Mostyn said he his nostrils working for such an emergency there is nothing like a pair of good sharp persuaders here he tapped the spur lightly with the slender gold mounted cane he carried and I rather fancy I know just how and when to use em Mostyn And once again I saw the gleam of his big white teeth All this I heard as they lolled within a yard of me manifesting a lofty and contemptuous disregard for all save themselves waited upon most deferentially by the smiling fat fellow and stared at by the aged man with as much admiring awe as if they had each been nothing less than a lord mayor of London at the very least But now they leaned their heads together and spoke in lowered tones but something in the leering eyes of the one and the smiling lips of the other told me that it was not of horses that they spoke Bring her to reason by gad said the slighter of the two setting down his empty glass with a bang oh trust me to know their pretty skittish ways trust me to manage em I ve never failed yet by gad Curse me that s true enough said the other and here they sank their voices again My ale being finished I took up my staff a heavy knotted affair and turned to go Now as I did so my foot by accident came in contact with the gold mounted cane I have mentioned and sent it clattering to the floor I was on the point of stooping for it when a rough hand gripped my shoulder from behind twisting me savagely about and I thus found myself staring upon two rows of sharp white teeth Pick it up said he motioning imperiously to the cane on the floor between us Heaven forbid sir said I is thy servant a dog that he should do this thing I told you to pick it up he repeated thrusting his head towards me are you going to do so or must I make you and his nostrils worked more than ever For answer I raised my foot and sent the cane spinning across the room Somebody laughed and next moment my hat was knocked from my head Before he could strike again however I raised my staff but suddenly remembering its formidable weight I altered the direction of the blow and thrust it strongly into the very middle of his gayly flowered waistcoat So strongly did I thrust indeed that he would have fallen but for the timely assistance of his companion Come come said I holding him off on the end of my staff be calm now and let us reason together like logical beings I knocked down your cane by accident and you my hat by intent very well then be so good as to return me my property from the corner yonder and we will call quits No by gad gasped my antagonist bending almost double wait only wait until I get my wind I ll choke the infernal life out of you only wait by gad Willingly said I but whatever else you do you will certainly reach me my hat otherwise just so soon as you find yourself sufficiently recovered I shall endeavor to throw you after it Saying which I laid aside my staff and buttoned up my coat Why he began you infernally low dusty ditch trotting blackguard But his companion who had been regarding me very closely twitched him by the sleeve and whispered something in his ear Whatever it was it affected my antagonist strangely for he grew suddenly very red and then very white and abruptly turned his back upon me Are you sure Mostyn said he in an undertone Certain Well I d fight him were he the devil himself Pistols perhaps would be Don t be a fool Harry cried the other and seizing his arm drew him farther away and though they lowered their voices I caught such fragments as What of George changes since your time ruin your chances at the start dead shot Sir said I my hat in the corner yonder Almost to my surprise the taller of the two crossed the room followed by his friend to whom he still spoke in lowered tones stooped picked up my hat and while the other stood scowling approached and handed it to me with a bow That my friend Sir Harry Mortimer lost his temper is regretted both by him and myself said he but is readily explained by the fact that he has been a long time from London while I labored under a a disadvantage sir until your hat was off Now as he spoke his left eyelid flickered twice in rapid succession I beg you won t mention it said I putting on my hat but sir why do you wink at me No no cried he laughing and shaking his head ha ha deyvilish good By the way they tell me George himself is in these parts incog of course George said I staring Cursed rich on my life and soul cried the tall gentleman shaking his head and laughing again Mum s the word of course and I swear a shaven face becomes you most deyvilishly Perhaps you will be so obliging as to tell me what you mean said I frowning Oh by gad he cried fairly hugging himself with delight Oh the devil this is too rich too infernally rich on my life and soul it is Now all at once there recurred to me the memory of Tom Cragg the Pugilist of how he too had winked at me and of his incomprehensible manner afterwards beneath the gibbet on River Hill Sir said I do you happen to know a pugilist Tom Cragg by name Tom Cragg well I should think so who doesn t sir Because I went on he too seems to labor under the delusion that he is acquainted with me and Acquainted repeated the tall gentleman acquainted Oh gad and immediately hugged himself in another ecstasy If said I you will have the goodness to tell me for whom you evidently mistake me Mistake you he gasped throwing himself upon the settle and rocking to and fro ha ha mistake you Seeing I did but waste my breath I turned upon my heel and made for the door As I went my eye by chance lighted upon a cheese that stood at the fat landlord s elbow and upon which he cast amorous glances from time to time That seems a fine cheese said I It is sir if I might make so bold a noble cheese he rejoined and laid his hand upon it with a touch that was a caress Then I will take three pennyworth of your noble cheese said I Cheese faintly echoed the gentleman upon the settle three pennyworth Oh I shall die positively I shall burst Also a loaf said I And when the landlord had cut the cheese with great nicety a generous portion and had wrapped it into a parcel I put it together with the loaf into my knapsack and giving him Good day strode to the door As I reached it the tall gentleman rose from the settle and bowed Referring to George sir George said I shortly to the devil with George Now I could not help being struck by the effect of my words for Sir Harry let fall his cane and stared open mouthed while his companion regarded me with an expression between a frown and wide eyed dismay Now I wonder said I to myself as I descended the steps I wonder who George can be Before the inn there stood a yellow wheeled stanhope with a horse which from his manner of trembling all over for no conceivable reason and manifest desire to stand upon his hind legs I conceived to be a thorough bred and hanging grimly to the bridle now in the air now on terra firma alternately coaxing and cursing was my friend the Semi quavering Ostler He caught sight of me just as a particularly vicious jerk swung him off his legs Damn your liver he cried to the horse and then to me If you ll jest call Joe to old this ere black varmin for me I ll fill yer eye up Thanks said I but I much prefer to keep it as it is really there is no need to trouble Joe and as for you I wish you good morning And when I had gone a little way chancing to glance back over my shoulder I saw that the Outside Passenger stood upon the inn steps and was staring after me CHAPTER XII THE ONE LEGGED SOLDIER Following the high road I came in a little to where the ways divided the one leading straight before me the other turning sharp to the left where as I remember is a very steep hill And at the parting of the ways was a finger post with the words To LONDON To TONBRIDGE WELLS To PEMBRY Now as I stood beneath the finger post debating which road I should take I was aware of the sound of wheels and glancing about saw a carrier s cart approaching The driver was a fine tall ruddy faced fellow very spruce as to his person who held himself with shoulders squared and bolt upright and who shouted a cheery greeting to me If so be you are for Pembry or thereabouts sir said he bringing his horses to a standstill why jump up sir that is if you be so minded My course lies anywhere said I Then if you be so minded I am so minded said I Then sir jump up said he Thanks said I So I climbed upon the seat beside him and then I saw that he had a wooden leg and straightway understood his smart bearing and general neat appearance You have been a soldier said I And my name s Tom and I could tell you a sight about them Spanishers and Frenchies that is if you be so minded I am so minded fire away Tom Well he began fixing his eyes on the wheeler s ears they Frenchies ain t so bad as is thought though they do eat frogs but what I say is if they be so minded why frogs let it be To be sure said I And after all they re well worth fighting and that s more than you can say for a many True said I one generally has a certain respect for the man one fights Then there s Old Bony Have you ever seen him I have sir I were captured outside the Lines of Torres Vedras and I saw Old Bony eating his breakfast off a drum head wi one hand and a writing a dispatch wi the other a little fat man not so high as my shoulder look you There s some as says as Old Bony lives on new born babies but I know different Because why says you Because I ve seen with these ere peepers says I bread it were and cheese and garlic and a uncommon lot at that And where did you lose your leg Tom Vittoria I appened to be carrying my off cer Ensign Standish his name barely eighteen year old Shot through the lung he were and a trying to tell me to put him down and go the fire being uncommonly ot there you ll understand sir and as I say he were trying to tell me to drop him and run for it and blowing blood bubbles wi every word when all at once I feels a sort of a shock and there I was on my back and him atop o me and when I went to get up damme there was my leg gone below the knee and no pleasant sight neither And afterward Arterwards he repeated Why that were the end o my sojerin ye see we lay in the same ospital im an me side by side and he swore as I d saved his life which I adn t look you and likewise swore as he d never forget it And he never as either for here am I wi my own horse and cart Tom Price by name carrier by trade an very much at your service sir I m sure Thus we climbed the hill of Pembry by tree and hedge and lonely cottage by rolling meadow and twilit wood Tom the Soldier and I Much he told me of lonely night watches of death sudden and sharp of long weary marches and stricken fields of the bloody doings of the Spanish Guerrillas of Mina and his deviltries And in my ears was the roar of guns and before my eyes the gleam and twinkle of bayonets By the side of Tom the Soldier I waited the thunderous charge of French Dragoons saw their stern set faces and the flash of their brandished steel as they swept down upon our devoted square swept down to break in red confusion before our bristling bayonets and the air was full of the screams of smitten horses and the deep throated shouts and groans of men By the side of Tom the Soldier I stormed through many a reeking breach swept by fire and slippery with blood and all for love of it the munificent sum of eightpence per day and that which we call Glory Bravo Tom the Soldier And presently I became aware that he had stopped his horses and was regarding me smilingly Tom said I you are a wonderful talker And you sir said he are a better listener and look you a good listener is mighty hard to come by Howsomever here s the end o my journey more s the pity but if you Tom said I suddenly you never heard of Tom Cragg did you Can t say as I have he answered stroking his chin thoughtfully though there was a Dick Snagget in the Thirty Ninth I remember And you don t know who George is of course I continued musingly Why I ve knowed a many Georges in my time said he and then there s George Prince o Wales the Prince Regent as they calls him now George Prince of Wales said I staring by heavens Tom I believe you ve hit it And with the word I sprang down from the cart My cottage is near by sir and I should be proud for you to eat supper wi me that is if you be so minded Many thanks said I but I am not so minded and so good by Tom And with the words I wrung the soldier s honest hand in mine and went upon my way George Prince of Wales said I to myself could this be the George they had meant If so then who and what had they supposed me Hereupon as I walked I fell into a profound meditation in which I presently remembered how that Tom Cragg had also mentioned the Prince giving me to understand that his Highness had actually ordered him Tom Cragg to leave London and why Arter that theer kidnappin an me avin laid out Sir Jarsper Trent accordin to yer order Sir Jasper Trent I stopped stock still in the road Sir Jasper Trent At last I remembered the name that had eluded me so persistently Remembered it Nay indeed it was rather as if the Pugilist had whispered the words into my ear and I glanced round almost expecting to see him Arter that theer kidnappin an me avin laid out Sir Jarsper Trent accordin to yer orders According to my orders or rather the orders of the man for whom he in common with the two gentlemen at The Chequers had mistaken me But who was that man Of him I knew two facts namely that he was much like me in person and had formerly worn or possibly still wore whiskers And beyond these two facts I could get no farther revolve the matter how I might so I presently shrugged my shoulders and banishing it from my thoughts for the time being set forward at a good pace CHAPTER XIII IN WHICH I FIND AN ANSWER TO MY RIDDLE The sun was already westering when I came to a pump beside the way and seizing the handle I worked it vigorously then placing my hollowed hands beneath the gushing spout drank and pumped alternately until I had quenched my thirst I now found myself prodigiously hungry and remembering the bread and cheese in my knapsack looked about for an inviting spot in which to eat On one side of the road was a thick hedge and beneath this hedge a deep dry grassy ditch and here after first slipping off my knapsack I sat down took out the loaf and the cheese and opening my clasp knife prepared to fall to At this moment I was interrupted in a rather singular fashion for hearing a rustling close by I looked up and into a face that was protruded through a gap in the hedge above me It needed but a glance at the battered hat with its jaunty brim and great silver buckle and the haggard devil may care face below to recognize the individual whom I had seen thrown out of the hedge tavern the morning before It was a very thin face as I have said pale and hollow eyed and framed in black curly hair whose very blackness did but accentuate the extreme pallor of the skin which was tight and drawn above the cheek bones and angle of the jaw Yet as I looked at this face worn and cadaverous though it was in the glance of the hollow eyes in the line of the clean cut mouth I saw that mysterious something which marks a man what we call for want of a better word a gentleman Good evening said he and lifted the battered hat Good evening I returned Pardon me said he but I was saluting the bread and cheese Indeed said I Indeed he rejoined it is the first edible I have been on speaking terms with so to speak for rather more than three days sir You are probably hungry said I It would be foolish to deny it sir Then if you care to eat with me in the ditch here you are heartily welcome said I With all the pleasure in life said he vaulting very nimbly through the hedge you shall not ask me twice or the very deuce is in it Believe me I Here he stopped very suddenly and stood looking at me Ah said he gently and with a rising inflection letting the ejaculation escape in a long drawn breath Well I inquired Now as I looked up at him the whole aspect of the man from the toes of his broken boots to the crown of the battered hat seemed to undergo a change as though a sudden fierce anger had leapt into life and been controlled but by a strong effort On my life and soul now said he falling back a step and eyeing me with a vaguely unpleasant smile this is a most unexpected a most unlooked for pleasure it is I vow it is You flatter me said I No sir no to meet you again some day somewhere alone quite alone sir is a pleasure I have frequently dwelt upon but never hoped to realize As it is sir having in my present condition no chance of procuring better weapons than my fists allow me to suggest that they are none the less entirely at your service do me the infinite kindness to stand up Sir I answered cutting a slice from the loaf you are the third person within the last forty eight hours who has mistaken me for another it really gets quite wearisome Mistaken you he broke in and his smile grew suddenly bitter do you think it possible that I could ever mistake you I am sure of it said I Furthermore pray do not disparage your fists sir A bout at fisticuffs never did a man any harm that I ever heard a man s fists are good honest weapons supplied by a beneficent Providence far better than your unnatural swords and murderous hair triggers at least so I think being I trust something of a philosopher Still in this instance never having seen your face or heard your voice until yesterday I shall continue to sit here and eat my bread and cheese and if you are wise you will hasten to follow my so excellent example while there is any left for I warn you I am mightily sharp set Come come said he advancing upon me threateningly enough of this foolery By all means said I sit down like a sensible fellow and tell me for whom you mistake me Sir with all the pleasure in life said he clenching his fists and I saw his nostrils dilate suddenly I take you for the greatest rogue the most gentlemanly rascal but one in all England Yes said I and my name Sir Maurice Vibart Sir Maurice Vibart I sprang to my feet staring at him in amazement Sir Maurice Vibart is my cousin said I And so we stood for a long minute immobile and silent eyeing each other above the bread and cheese CHAPTER XIV FURTHER CONCERNING THE GENTLEMAN IN THE BATTERED HAT Sir said my companion at last lifting the battered hat I tender you my apology and I shall be delighted to eat with you in the ditch if you are in the same mind about it Then you believe me Indubitably sir he answered with a faint smile had you indeed been Sir Maurice either he or I and most probably I would be lying flat in the road by this So without more ado we sat down in the ditch together side by side and began to eat And now I noticed that when he thought my eye was upon him my companion ate with a due deliberation and nicety and when he thought it was off with a voracity that was painful to witness And after we had eaten a while in silence he turned to me with a sigh This is very excellent cheese said he The man from whom I bought it said I called it a noble cheese I remember I never tasted one of a finer flavor said my companion Hunger is a fine sauce said I and you are probably hungry Hungry he repeated bolting a mouthful and knocking his hat over his eyes with a slap on its dusty crown Egad mister Vibart so would you be so would any man be who has lived on anything he could beg borrow or steal with an occasional meal of turnips in the digging of which I am become astonishingly expert and unripe blackberries which latter I have proved to be a very trying diet in many ways hungry oh damme And after a while when there nothing remained of loaf or cheese save a few scattered crumbs my companion leaned back and gave another sigh Sir said he with an airy wave of the hand in me you behold a highly promising young gentleman ruined by a most implacable enemy himself sir In the first place you must know my name is Beverley Beverley I repeated Beverley he nodded Peregrine Beverley very much at your service late of Beverley Place Surrey now of Nowhere in Particular Beverley said I again I have heard that name before It is highly probable mister Vibart a fool of that name fortunate or unfortunate as you choose to classify him lost houses land and money in a single night s play I am that fool sir though you have doubtless heard particulars ere now Not a word said I mister Beverley glanced at me with a faint mingling of pity and surprise My life I explained has been altogether a studious one with the not altogether unnatural result that I also am bound for Nowhere in Particular with just eight shillings and sixpence in my pocket And mine as I tell you said he has been an altogether riotous one Thus each of us though by widely separate roads you by the narrow and difficult path of Virtue and I by the broad and easy road of Folly have managed to find our way into this Howling Destitution which we will call Nowhere in Particular Then how does your path of Virtue better my road of Evil The point to be considered said I is not so much what we now are but rather what we have done and may ultimately be and do Well said he turning to look at me For my own achievements hitherto I continued I have won the High Jump and Throwing the Hammer also translated the works of Quintilian with the Satyricon of Petronius Arbiter and the Life Lives and Memoirs of the Seigneur de Brantome which last as you are probably aware has never before been done into the English Ha exclaimed mister Beverley sitting up suddenly with his ill used hat very much over one eye there we have it Whoever heard of Old Quin What s his name or cared except perhaps a few bald headed bookworms and withered litterateurs While you were dreaming of life and reading the lives of other fellows I was living it In my career episodically brief though it was I have met and talked with all the wits and celebrated men have drunk good wine and worshipped beautiful women mister Vibart And what has it all taught you said I That there are an infernal number of rogues and rascals in the world for one thing and that is worth knowing Yes said I That though money can buy anything from the love of a woman to the death of an enemy it can only be spent once and that is worth knowing also Yes said I And that I am a most preposterous ass and that last look you is more valuable than all the others Solomon I think says something about a wise man being truly wise who knoweth himself a fool doesn t he Something of the sort Then said he flinging his hat down upon the grass beside him what argument can you advance in favor of your Narrow and Thorny The sum of eight shillings and sixpence a loaf of bread and a slice of noble cheese now no more said I Egad said he looking at me from the corners of his blue eyes the argument is unanswerable more especially the cheese part against which I d say nothing even if I could Having remarked which he lay flat on his back again staring up at the leaves and the calm serenity of the sky beyond while I filled my negro head pipe from my paper of tobacco and forthwith began to smoke And presently as I sat alternately watching the blue wreaths of my pipe and the bedraggled figure extended beside me he suddenly rolled over on his arm and so lay watching me On my soul he exclaimed at length it is positively marvellous What is I inquired The resemblance between you and your famous cousin It would appear so said I shrugging my shoulders though personally I was unaware of this fact up till now Do I understand that you have never seen Sir Maurice Vibart never seen Buck Vibart Never said I Too much occupied in keeping to the Narrow and Thorny I suppose Your cousin s is the Broad and Flowery with a vengeance So I understand said I Nevertheless the resemblance between you both in face and figure is positively astounding With the sole exception that he wears hair upon his face and is of a ruddy complexion while you are pale and smooth smooth cheeked as as a boy Or yourself said I Ah exactly he answered and passed his fingers across his chin tentatively and fell again to staring lazily up into the sky Do you happen to know anything about that most remarkable species of the genus homo calling themselves Bucks or Corinthians he inquired after a while Very little said I and that only by hearsay Well up to six months ago I was one of them mister Vibart until Fortune and I think now wisely decreed it otherwise And herewith lying upon his back looking up through the quivering green of leaves he told mad tales of a reckless Prince of the placid Brummel of the Dashing Vibart the brilliant Sheridan of Fox and Grattan and many others whose names are now a byword one way or the other He recounted a story of wild prodigality of drunken midnight orgies of days and nights over the cards of wine women and horses But lastly and very reverently he spoke of a woman of her love and faith and deathless trust Of course he ended I might have starved very comfortably and much quicker in London but when my time comes I prefer to do my dying beneath some green hedge or in the shelter of some friendly rick with the cool clean wind upon my face Besides She loved the country Then there are some women who can t be bought said I looking at his glistening eyes mister Vibart said he so far as I know there are two the Lady Helen Dunstan and the Glorious Sefton The Lady Sophia Sefton of Cambourne said I And the Lady Helen Dunstan he repeated Do you know the Lady Sophia Sefton I have had the honor of dancing with her frequently he answered And is she so beautiful as they say She is the handsomest woman in London one of your black browed deep eyed goddesses tall and gracious and most nobly shaped though sir for my own part I prefer less fire and ice and more gentle beauty As for instance the Lady Helen Dunstan said I Exactly nodded mister Beverley Referring to the Lady Sophia Sefton I pursued she is a reigning toast I believe Gad yes her worshippers are legion and chief among them his Royal Highness and your cousin Sir Maurice who has actually had the temerity to enter the field as the Prince s avowed rival no one but Buck Vibart could be so madly rash A most fortunate lady said I mister Vibart exclaimed my companion cocking his battered hat and regarding me with a smouldering eye mister Vibart I object to your tone the noble Sefton s virtue is proud and high and above even the breath of suspicion And yet my cousin would seem to be no laggard in love and as to the Prince his glance is contamination to a woman Sir returned mister Beverley very earnestly disabuse your mind of all unworthy suspicions I beg your cousin she laughs to scorn and his Royal Highness she had rebuffed as few women have hitherto dared do It would almost seem said I after a pause that from what I have inadvertently learned my cousin has some dirty work afoot though exactly what I cannot imagine My dear mister Vibart your excellent cousin is forever up to something or other and has escaped the well merited consequences more than once owing to his friendship with and the favor of his friend George said I Exactly said my companion raising himself on his elbow and nodding George Have you ever heard mention of Tom Cragg the Pugilist I inquired blowing a cloud of smoke into the warm air I won ten thousand guineas when he knocked out Ted Jarraway of Swansea yawned my companion a good fighter but a rogue like all the rest of em and a creature of your excellent cousin s I guessed as much I nodded and forthwith plunged into an account of my meeting with the craggy one the which seemed to amuse mister Beverley mightily more especially when I related Cragg s mysterious disappearance Oh gad cried Beverley wiping his eyes on the tattered lapel of his coat the resemblance served you luckily there your cousin gave him the thrashing of his life and poor Tom evidently thought he was in for another That was the last you saw of him I ll be bound No I met him afterwards beneath the gibbet on River Hill where among other incomprehensible things he gave me to understand that he recognized me despite my disguise assumed as he supposed on account of his having kidnapped some one or other and laid out a certain Sir Jasper Trent in Wych Street according to my orders or rather it would seem my cousin s orders the author of which outrage Sir Jasper had evidently found out The devil exclaimed mister Beverley and sat up with a jerk And furthermore I went on he informed me that the Prince himself had given him the word to leave London until the affair had blown over Now while I spoke mister Beverley had been regarding me with a very strange expression his cheeks had gone even paler than before his eyes seemed to stare through and beyond me and his hands were tight clenched at his sides mister Beverley said I what ails you For a moment he did not speak then answered with the same strange look Sir Jasper Trent is my cousin sir My negro head pipe slipped suddenly and fell into the grass happily without injury Indeed said I Can you not see what this means sir he went on hurriedly Jasper will fight Indeed said I again I fear so Jasper was always a bit of a fish and with no particular affection for his graceless kinsman but I am his only relative and and he hardly knows one end of a pistol from the other while your cousin is a dead shot My cousin I exclaimed then if was he to be sure I saw only his back Sir Jasper is unmarried has no relations but myself my companion repeated with the same fixed intentness of look can you appreciate I wonder what this would mean to me Rank and fortune and London said I No no He sprang to his feet and threw wide his ragged arms with a swift passionate gesture It means Life and Helen My God he went on speaking almost in a whisper I never knew how much I wanted her how much I had wilfully tossed aside till now I never realized the full misery of it all till now I could have starved very well in time and managed it as quietly as most other ruined fools But now to see the chance of beginning again of coming back to self respect and Helen my God And of a sudden he cast himself upon his face and so lay tearing up the grass by handfuls Then almost as suddenly he was upon his feet again and had caught up his hat Sir said he somewhat shamefacedly smoothing its ruffled nap with fingers that still quivered pray forgive that little ebullition of feeling it is over quite over but your tidings affected me and I am not quite myself at times as I have already said turnips and unripe blackberries are not altogether desirable as a diet Indeed said I you seemed strangely perturbed mister Vibart said he staring very hard at the battered hat and turning it round and round mister Vibart the devil is surprisingly strong in some of us True said I My cousin Sir Jasper is a bookish fellow and as I have said a fool where anything else is in question if this meeting is allowed to take place I feel that he will most certainly be killed and his death would mean a new life more than life to me Yes said I And for a moment mister Vibart I was tempted to sit down in the ditch again and let things take their course The devil I repeat is remarkably strong in some of us Then what is your present intention I am going to London to find Sir Maurice Vibart to stop this duel Impossible said I But you see sir it so happens that I am possessed of certain intelligence which might make Sir Maurice s existence in England positively untenable Nevertheless said I it is impossible That remains to be seen mister Vibart said he and speaking turned upon his heel One moment said I was not your cousin Sir Jasper of the middle height slim built and fair haired with a habit of plucking at his lips when at all nervous or excited Exactly you know him sir No I answered but I have seen him very lately and I say again to stop this duel is an impossibility Do you mean he began and paused Now as his eyes met mine the battered hat escaped his fingers and lay all unheeded Do you mean he began again and again stopped Yes said I I mean that you are too late Sir Jasper was killed at a place called Deepdene Wood no longer since than to day at half past seven in the morning It was raining at the time I remember but the day grew glorious later For a long moment mister Beverley stood silent with bent head then apparently becoming aware of the hat at his feet he sent it flying with a sudden kick and watched it describe a wide parabola ere it disappeared into the ditch some yards away Which done he walked after it and returned brushing it very carefully with his ragged cuff And you are sure quite sure mister Vibart he inquired smoothing the broken brim with the greatest solicitude I stood behind a hedge and watched it done said I Then my God I am Sir Peregrine Beverley I am Sir Peregrine Beverley of Burnham Hall very much at your service Jasper dead A knight banneret of Kent and Justice of the Peace How utterly preposterous it all sounds But to day I begin life anew ah yes a new life a new life To day all things are possible again The fool has learned wisdom and I hope become a man But come said he in a more natural tone let us get back to our ditch and while you tell me the particulars if you don t object I should much like to try a whiff at that pipe of yours So while I recounted the affair as briefly as I might he sat puffing at my pipe and staring away into the distance But gradually his head sank lower and lower until his face was quite hidden from me and for a long moment after I had ended my narration there was silence Poor Jasper said he at last without raising his head poor old Jasper I congratulate you Sir Peregrine said I And I used to pummel him so when we were boys together at Eton poor old Jasper And presently he handed me my pipe and rose mister Vibart said he it would seem that by no effort or virtue of my own I am to win free of this howling desolation of Nowhere in Particular after all believe me I would gladly take you with me Had I not met with you it is rather more than probable that I should never have seen another dawn so if if ever I can be of use to you pray honor me so far you can always hear of me at Burnham Hall Pembry Good by mister Vibart I am going to her in all my rags for I am a man again So I bade him good by and sitting in the ditch watched him stride away to his new life Presently reaching the brow of the hill there are hills everywhere in the South country I saw him turn to flourish the battered hat ere he disappeared from my sight CHAPTER XV IN WHICH I MEET WITH A PEDLER BY THE NAME OF GABBING DICK You won t be wantin ever a broom now I sat up sleepily and rubbed my eyes The sun was gone and the blue sky had changed to a deep purple set here and there with a quivering star Yet the light was still strong enough to enable me to distinguish the speaker a short thick set man Upon his shoulder he carried a bundle of brooms a pack was slung to his back while round his neck there dangled a heterogeneous collection of articles ribbons laces tawdry neck chains and the like indeed so smothered was he in his wares that as he stood there he had more the aspect of some disordered fancy than of a human being You won t be wantin ever a broom now he repeated in a somewhat melancholy tone No said I Nor yet a mop Nor that either said I A belt now he suggested mournfully a fine leather belt wi a steel buckle made in Brummagem as ever was and all for a shillin what d ye say to a fine belt That I have no need of one thank you Ah well said the man spitting dejectedly at a patch of shadow I thought as much you aren t got the look of a buyer Then why ask me Hinstinct said he it s jest hinstinct it comes as nat ral to me as eatin or walkin these ere roads Have you come far to day Twenty mile maybe he answered setting down his bundle of brooms Are you tired Course I m tired Then why not sit down and rest Because I d ave to get up again wouldn t I Are you hungry Ungry aren t the word for it And how is trade Couldn t be worse I perceive you are a pessimist said I No said he I m a pedler baptism l name Richard commonly known as Gabbin Dick At least yours is a fine healthy trade said I Ow so A life of constant exercise and fresh air to day for instance Ot as a hoven said he Yet there was a good cool wind said I Ah an with dust enough to choke a man And then there s the loneliness o these ere roads Loneliness said I That s the word sometimes it gets so bad as I m minded to do away wi myself Strange I began Not a bit said be when you ve been a walkin an a walkin all day past edge and edge and tree and tree it s bad enough but it s worse when the sun s gone out an you foller the glimmer o the road on and on past edges as ain t edges and trees as ain t trees but things as touch you as you pass and reach out arter you in the dark behind Theer s one on em back theer on the Cranbrook road looks like an oak tree in the daytime ah an a big un it s nearly ad me three times a ready once by the leg once by the arm and once by the neck I don t pass it arter dark no more but it ll ave me yet mark my words it ll ave me one o these fine nights and they ll find me a danglin in the gray o the dawn Do you mean that you are afraid I inquired No not afeared exactly it s jest the loneliness the lonely quietness Why Lord you aren t got no notion o the tricks the trees and edges gets up to a nights nobody as but us as tramps the roads Bill Nye knowed same as I know but Bill Nye s dead cut is throat e did wi one o is own razors under a edge And what for I inquired as the Pedler paused to spit lugubriously into the road again Nobody knowed but me William Nye e were a tinker and a rare merry un e were a little man always up to is jinkin and jokin and laughin Dick e used to say but Richard I were baptized though they calls me Dick for short Dick e used to say d ye know that theer big oak tree the big oller oak as stands at the crossroads a mile and a alf out o Cranbrook A man might do for isself very nice and quiet tucked away inside of it Dick says e it s such a nice quiet place so snug and dark I wonder as nobody does I never pass by says e but I takes a peep inside jest to make sure as theer aren t no legs a danglin nor nobody unched up dead in the dark It s such a nice quiet place e used to say shakin is lead and smilin sad like I wonder as nobody s never thought of it afore Well one day sure enough poor Bill Nye disappeared nobody knowed wheer Bill as I say was a merry sort always ready wi a joke and that s apt to get a man friends and they searched for im igh and low but neither ide nor air o poor Bill did they find At last one evenin I appened to pass the big oak the oller oak and mindin Bill s words thinks I ere s to see if tis empty as Bill said Goin up to it I got down on my ands and knees and strikin a light looked inside and there sure enough was poor Bill Nye hunched up inside of it wi a razor in is and and is ead nigh cut off and what wi one thing and another a very unpleasant sight he were And why why did he do it I asked Because e ad to o course it s jest the loneliness They ll find me some day danglin I never could abide blood myself danglin to the thing as looks like a oak tree in the daytime What do you mean said I The Pedler sighed shook his head and shouldered his brooms It s jest the loneliness said he and spitting over this shoulder trudged upon his way CHAPTER XVI HOW I HEARD THE STEPS OF ONE WHO DOGGED ME IN THE SHADOWS And in a little while I rose and buckled on my knapsack The shadows were creeping on apace but the sky was wonderfully clear while low down upon the horizon I saw the full orbed moon very broad and big It would be a brilliant night later and this knowledge rejoiced me not a little Before me stretched a succession of hills that chain of hills which I believe is called the Weald and over which the dim road dipped and wound with on either hand a rolling country dark with wood and coppice full of mystery The wind had quite fallen but from the hedges came sudden rustlings and soft unaccountable noises Once something small and dark scuttered across the road before me and once a bird hidden near by set up a loud complaint while from the deeps of a neighboring wood came the mournful note of a night jar And as I walked I bethought me of poor Bill Nye the Tinker I could picture him tramping upon this very road his jingling load upon his back and the loneliness upon and around him A small man he would be with a peaked face little round twinkling eyes grizzled hair and a long blue chin How I came to know all this I cannot tell only it seemed he must be so On he went his chin first upon one shoulder and now upon the other shooting furtive glances at hedges which were not hedges and trees which were not trees Somewhere there was a thing that looked like a big oak tree in the daytime a hollow oak On he went through the shadows on and on Presently he turned out of the road and there sure enough was the oak itself Kneeling down he slipped off his burden and pushed it through a jagged hole at the root Then he glanced round him a long stealthy look down at the earth and up at the sky and crept into the tree In the dimness I could see him fumble for the thing he wanted pause to thumb its edge and throwing up his chin raise his hand Folly said I aloud and stopped suddenly in my stride The moon s rim was just topping the trees to my left and its light feeble though it was as yet served to show that I had reached a place where four roads met Now casting my eyes about me they were attracted by a great tree that grew near by a tree of vast girth and bigness And as I looked I saw that it was an oak tree near the root of which there was a jagged black hole How long I stood staring at this I cannot say but all at once the leaves of the tree were agitated as by a breath of wind and rustled with a sound indescribably desolate and from the dark mass rose the long drawn mournful cry of some night bird Heedless of my direction I hurried away yet ever when I had left it far behind I glanced back more than once ere its towering branches were lost to my view So I walked on through the shadows past trees that were not trees and hedges that were not hedges but frightful phantoms rather lifting menacing arms above my head and reaching after me with clutching fingers Time and again ashamed of such weakness I cursed myself for an imaginative fool but kept well in the middle of the road and grasped my staff firmly notwithstanding I had gone perhaps some mile or so in this way alternately rating and reasoning with myself when I suddenly fancied I heard a step behind me and swung round upon my heel with ready stick but the road stretched away empty as far as I could see Having looked about me on all sides I presently went on again yet immediately it seemed that the steps began also keeping time with my own now slow now fast now slow again but whenever I turned the road behind was apparently as empty and desolate as ever I can conceive of few things more nerve racking than the knowledge that we are being dogged by something which we can only guess at and that all our actions are watched by eyes which we cannot see Thus with every step I found the situation grow more intolerable for though I kept a close watch behind me and upon the black gloom of the hedges I could see nothing At length however I came upon a gap in the hedge where was a gate and beyond this vaguely outlined against a glimmer of sky I saw a dim figure Hereupon running forward I set my hand upon the gate and leaping over found myself face to face with a man who carried a gun across his arm If I was startled at this sudden encounter he was no less so and thus we stood eyeing each other as well as we might in the half light Well I demanded at last what do you mean by following me like this I aren t follered ye retorted the man But I heard your steps behind me Not mine master I ve sat and waited ere arf a hour or more for a poachin cove But some one was following me Well it weren t I A keeper I be a lookin for a poachin cove just about your size and it s precious lucky for you as you are a wearin that there bell crowned at Why so Because if you adn t appened to be a wearin that there bell crowner and I adn t appened to be of a argifyin and inquirin turn o mind I should ha filled you full o buckshot Oh said I Yes said he nodding while I experienced a series of cold chills up my spine not a blessed doubt of it Poachers he went on don t wear bell crowned ats as a rule I never seed one as did and so while I was a watchin of you be ind this ere edge I argies the matter in my mind Robert I says to meself Robert I sez did you ever appen to see a poachin cove in a bell crowner afore No you never did sez I But on the other and this ere cove is the very spit o the poachin cove as I m a lookin for True sez I to meself but this ere cove is a wearin of a bell crowner at but the poachin cove never wore a bell crowner nor never will Still I must say I come very near pullin trigger on ye just to make sure So ye see it were precious lucky for you as you was a wearin o that there It certainly was said I turning away that there bell crowner and likewise as I m a man of a nat ral gift for argiment and of a inquirin Without doubt said I vaulting over the gate into the road once more turn o mind because if I adn t a been and you adn t a wore that there bell crowner The consequences are unpleasantly obvious said I over my shoulder as I walked on down the road I should ha shot ye like a dog he shouted hanging over the gate to do so And when I had gone on some distance I took off that which the man had called a bell crowner and bestowed upon it a touch and looked at it as I had never done before and there was gratitude in look and touch for tonight it had indeed stood my friend Slowly slowly the moon at whose advent the starry host paled their ineffectual fires mounted into a cloudless heaven higher and higher in queenly majesty until the dark world was filled with her glory and the road before me became transformed into a silver track splashed here and there with the inky shadow of hedge and trees and leading away into a land of Faerie Indeed to my mind there is nothing more delightful than to walk upon a country road beneath a midsummer moon when there is no sound to break the stillness save perhaps the murmur of wind in trees or the throbbing melody of some hidden brook At such times the world of every day the world of Things Material the hard hard world of Common sense seems to vanish quite and we walk within the fair haven of our dreams where Imagination meets and kisses us upon the brow And at his touch the Impossible straightway becomes the Possible the Abstract becomes the Concrete our fondest hopes are realized our most cherished visions take form and stand before us surely at such an hour the gods come down to walk with us awhile From this ecstasy I was suddenly aroused by hearing once more the sound of a footstep upon the road behind me So distinct and unmistakable was it that I turned sharp about and though the road seemed as deserted as ever I walked back looking into every patch of shadow and even thrust into the denser parts of the hedges with my staff but still I found no one And yet I knew that I was being followed persistently step by step but by whom and for what reason A little farther on upon one side of the way was a small wood or coppice and now I made towards this keeping well in the shadow of the hedge The trees were somewhat scattered but the underbrush was very dense and amongst this I hid myself where I could watch the road and waited Minute after minute elapsed and losing patience I was about to give up all hope of thus discovering my unknown pursuer when a stick snapped sharply near by and glancing round I thought I saw a head vanish behind the bole of an adjacent tree wherefore I made quickly towards that tree but ere I reached it a man stepped out A tall loose limbed fellow he was clad in rough clothes that somehow had about them a vague suggestion of ships and the sea and with a moth eaten fur cap crushed down upon his head His face gleamed pale and his eyes were deep sunken and very bright also I noticed that one hand was hidden in the pocket of his coat But most of all I was struck by the extreme pallor of his face and the burning brilliancy of his eyes And with the glance that showed me all this I recognized the Outside Passenger CHAPTER XVII HOW I TALKED WITH A MADMAN IN A WOOD BY MOONLIGHT Good evening sir he said in a strange hurried sort of way the moon you will perceive is very nearly at the full to night And his voice immediately struck me as being at odds with his clothes Why do you stand and peer at me said I sharply Peer at you sir Yes from behind the tree yonder As I spoke he craned his head towards me and I saw his pale lips twitch suddenly And why have you dogged me why have you followed me all the way from Tonbridge Why sir surely there is nothing so strange in that I am a shadow What do you mean by a shadow Sir I am a shadow cast by neither sun nor moon nor star that moves on unceasingly in dark as in light Sir it is my fate in common with my kind to be ever upon the move a stranger everywhere without friends or kindred I have been during the past year all over England east and west and north and south within the past week for instance I have travelled from London to Epsom from Epsom to Brighton from Brighton back again to London and from London here And I peer at you sir because I wished to make certain what manner of man you were before I spoke and though the moon is bright yet your hat brim left your face in shade Well are you satisfied So much so sir so very much so that I should like to talk with you to to ask you a question he answered passing his hand a thin white hand across his brow and up over the fur cap that was so out of keeping with the pale face below A question If you will be so obliging as to listen sir let us sit awhile for I am very weary And with the words he sank down upon the grass After a momentary hesitation I followed his example for my curiosity was piqued by the fellow s strange manner yet when we were sitting opposite each other I saw that his hand was still hidden in the pocket of his coat Perhaps sir said he in his nervous hurried manner perhaps you would be better able to answer my question were I first to tell you a story an ordinary a very commonplace one I fear but with the virtue that it is short and soon told My time is entirely my own said I leaning with my shoulders against the tree behind me proceed with your story First then my name is Strickland John Strickland Here he paused and though his head was bent I saw him watching me beneath his brows Well said I I am a supercargo Again he paused expectantly but seeing I merely nodded he continued Upon one of my voyages our vessel was wrecked and so far as I know all save myself and six others four seamen and two passengers were drowned The passengers I speak of were an old merchant and his daughter a very beautiful girl her name was Angela sir Once again he paused and again he eyed me narrowly Well said I Well sir he resumed speaking in a low repressed voice we seven after two miserable days in a drifting boat reached an island where that same night the old merchant died Sir the sailors were wild rough men the island was a desolate one from whence there was seemingly no chance of escape it lying out of the usual track of ships and this girl was as I have said very beautiful Under such conditions her fate would have been unspeakable degradation and probably death but sir I fought and bled for her not once but many times and eventually I killed one of them with my sheath knife and I remember to this hour how his blood gushed over my hands and arms and sickened me After that they waited hourly to avenge his death and get me out of their way once and for all but I had my long knife and they but such rude weapons as they could devise Day after day and night after night I watched for an opportunity to escape with the boat until at last one day while they were all three gone inland not dreaming of any such attempt for the sea was very dangerous and high with the girl s help I managed to launch the boat and so stood out to sea And I remember those three sailors came running with great shouts and cries and flung themselves down upon the beach and crawled upon their knees praying to be taken off along with us and begging us not to leave them to perish After three days buffeting at the mercy of the seas we were picked up by a brig bound for Portsmouth and six months later were in England Sir it is impossible for a man to have lived beside a beautiful woman day by day to have fought for and suffered with her not to love her also Thus seeing her friendless and penniless I wooed and won her to wife We came to London and for a year our life was perfect until through stress of circumstances I was forced to take another position aboard ship Well sir I bade farewell to my wife and we set sail The voyage which was to have lasted but three months was lengthened out through one misadventure after another so that it was a year before I saw my wife again At first I noticed little difference in her save that she was paler but gradually I came to see that she was unhappy Often I have wakened in the night to find her weeping silently Oh sir he broke out I do not think there is anything more terrible than to witness in one we love a sorrow we are unable to reach Here he paused and I saw that the sweat stood out upon his brow and that his hand was tight clenched as he drew it across his temples At last sir he went on speaking once more in a low repressed tone returning home one day I found her gone Gone said I Gone sir And she left no trace no letter No she left no letter sir but I did find something a something that had rolled into a corner of the room And what was that This sir As he spoke his burning eyes never leaving mine he thrust a hand into his bosom his left hand for his right was where it had been all along hidden in his pocket and held out to me a gold seal such as gentlemen wear at their fobs Ah I exclaimed Take it said the man thrusting it towards me look at it Obediently I took the trinket from him and examining it as well as I might saw that a letter was engraved upon it one of those ornamental initials surrounded by rococo scrolls and flourishes What letter does it bear asked the man in a strangled voice It looks very like the letter Y I answered The letter Y cried the man and then with a gesture sudden and fierce he snatched the seal from me and thrusting it back into his bosom laughed strangely Why do you laugh said I To be sure said he harshly the light might be better and yet well well my story is nearly done I lived on in my lonely house from day to day and month to month hoping and waiting for her to come back to me And one day she did come back to me just about this hour it was sir and on just such another evening and that same night she died Good God I exclaimed Poor fellow And leaning forward I laid my hand upon his knee but at my touch he drew back so quickly and with a look so evil that I was startled Hands off said he and so sat staring at me with his smouldering eyes Are you mad said I and sprang to my feet Not yet he answered and once again he passed his hand up and over his face and brow no not yet sir Here he rose and stood facing me and I noticed that one hand was still hidden in his pocket and thereafter while I listened to him I kept my eyes directed thither That night before she died sir he continued she told me the name of the man who had destroyed her and killed my soul and I have been searching for him ever since east and west and north and south Now sir here is my question If I should ever meet that man face to face as I now see you should I not be justified in killing him For a moment I stood with bent head yet conscious all the while of the burning eyes that scanned my face then Yes said I The man stood utterly still his mouth opened as if he would have spoken but no word came All at once he turned about and walked unsteadily five or six paces Now as I looked I saw him suddenly draw his hand from his pocket then as he wheeled I knew and hurled myself face downward as the pistol flashed Madman I cried and next moment was on my feet but with a sound that was neither a groan nor a scream and yet something of both he leapt into the thickest part of the underbrush and made off And standing there dazed by the suddenness of it all I heard the snapping of twigs grow fainter and fainter as he crashed through in headlong flight CHAPTER XVIII THE HEDGE TAVERN Twigs whipped my face thorns and brambles dragged at my clothes hidden obstacles lay in wait for my feet for the wood grew denser as I advanced but I pushed on heedless alike of these and of what direction I took But as luck would have it I presently blundered upon a path which in a short time brought me out very suddenly into what appeared to be a small tavern yard for on either hand was a row of tumble down stables and barns while before me was a low rambling structure which I judged was the tavern itself I was yet standing looking about me when a man issued from the stables upon my right bearing a hammer in one hand and a lanthorn in the other Hallo said he staring at me Hallo said I staring at him You don t chance to ave a axle bolt about you I suppose No said I Humph he grunted and lowering his lanthorn began searching among the cobblestones Is this it I inquired picking up a rusty screw bolt at my feet Ah said he taking it from me with a nod know d I dropped it ere some eres Ye see he went on couldn t get another round ere to night and that cussed axle s got to be in place to morra Yes said I Ah nodded the man chaise come in ere arf an hour ago wi two gentlemen and a lady in the Lord s own urry too Mend this axle me man says one on em a top sawyer be the looks on im mend this axle and quick about it Can t be done my lord says I W y not says e showin is teeth savage like Because it can t says I not no ow me lord says I Well after cussin isself well nigh black in the face e orders me to have it ready fust thing to morra and if you adn t found that there bolt for me it wouldn t have been ready fust thing to morra which would ha been mighty bad for me for this ere gentleman s a fire and fury out and outer and no error Can I have a bed here do you think I inquired Ah said he I think you can For how much do you suppose To you sixpence Why that seems reasonable said I It are nodded the man and a fine feather bed too But then Lord one good turn deserves another Meaning This ere bolt Are you the landlord then I be and if you feel inclined for a mug o good ale say the word Most willingly said I but what of the axle Plenty o time for th axle nodded the landlord and setting down his hammer upon a bench hard by he led the way into the tap The ale was very strong and good indeed this lovely county of Kent is justly famous for such Finding myself very hungry the landlord forthwith produced a mighty round of beef upon which we both fell to and ate with a will Which done I pulled out my negro head pipe and the landlord fetching himself another we sat awhile smoking And presently learning I was from London he began plying me with all manner of questions concerning the great city of which it seemed he could not hear enough and I to describe its wonders as well as I might At length bethinking him of his axle he rose with a sigh Upon my requesting to be shown my room he lighted a candle and led the way up a somewhat rickety stair along a narrow passage and throwing open a door at the end I found myself in a fair sized chamber with a decent white bed which he introduced to my notice by the one word feathers Hereupon he pinched off the snuff of the candle with an expression of ponderous thought And so the Tower o London ain t a tower he inquired at last No I answered it is composed of several towers surrounded by very strong battlemented walls Ah to be sure said he ah to be sure And me ave allus thought on it like it was a great big tower standin in the midst o the city as igh as a mountain Humph not a tower ha disapp inted I be Humph Good night master Disapp inted I be yes And having nodded his head ponderously several times he turned and went ponderously along the passage and down the stair At the end of my chamber was a long low casement and drawn thither by the beauty of the night I flung open the lattice and leaned out I looked down upon a narrow deeply rutted lane one of those winding inconsequent byways which it seems out of all possibility can ever lead the traveler anywhere and I was idly wondering what fool had troubled to build a tavern in such a remote out of the way spot when my ears were saluted by the sound of voices Now immediately beneath my window there was a heavy porch low and squat from which jutted a beam with a broken sign board and it was from beneath this porch that the voices proceeded the one loud and hectoring the other gruff and sullen I was about to turn away when a man stepped out into the moonlight His face was hidden in the shadow of his hat brim but from his general air and appearance I judged him to be one of the gentlemen whose chaise had broken down As I watched him he walked slowly round the angle of the house and disappeared In a little while I drew in my head from the casement and having removed my dusty boots together with my knapsack and coat blew out the candle and composed myself to sleep Now it seemed to me that I was back upon the road standing once more beside the great oak tree And as I watched a small hunched figure crept from the jagged opening in the trunk a figure with a jingling pack upon its back at sight of which I turned and ran filled with an indescribable terror But as I went the Tinker s pack jingled loud behind me and when I glanced back I saw that he ran with head dangling in most hideous fashion and that his right hand grasped a razor On I sped faster and faster but with the Tinker ever at my heels until I had reached this tavern the door crashed to behind me only just in time and I knew as I lay there that he was standing outside in the moonlight staring up at my casement with his horrible dead face Here I very mercifully awoke and lay for a while blinking in the ghostly radiance of the moon which was flooding in at the window directly upon me Now whether it was owing to the vividness of my dream I know not but as I lay there leapt up within me a sudden conviction that somebody was indeed standing outside in the lane staring up at my window So firmly was I convinced of this that moved by a sudden impulse I rose and cautiously approaching the window peered out And there sure enough his feet planted wide apart his hands behind his back stood a man staring up at my window His head was thrown back so that I could see his face distinctly a fleshy face with small close set eyes and thick lips behind which I caught the gleam of big white teeth This was no tinker but as I looked I recognized him as the slenderer of the two Corinthians with whom I had fallen out at The Chequers Hereupon I got me back to bed drowsily wondering what should bring the fellow hanging about a dilapidated hedge tavern at such an hour But gradually my thoughts grew less coherent my eyes closed and in another moment I should have been asleep when I suddenly came to my elbow broad awake and listening for I had heard two sounds the soft creak of a window opened cautiously near by and a stealthy footstep outside my door CHAPTER XIX IN WHICH I BECOME A SQUIRE OF DAMES Who does not recognize the solemn majesty of Night that season of awesome stillness when tired mankind lies supine in that strange inertia so like death when the soul quitting the wearied body for a space flies hence but whither What wonder is it if at such an hour as this we are prone to magnify trifles or that the most insignificant thing becomes an omen full of ghastly meaning and possibilities The creak of a door in the silence a rustle in the dark become to us of infinitely greater moment than the crash of falling empires Thus for a space I lay with ears on the stretch and every nerve tingling waiting for I knew not what In a little I became conscious of yet another sound indescribably desolate the low repressed sound of a woman s sobbing Once more I rose and looking down into the lane found it deserted the watcher had vanished I also noticed that the casement next to mine had been opened wide and it was from here as it seemed that the weeping proceeded After some little hesitation I knocked softly upon the wall at which the weeping was checked abruptly save for an occasional sob whereupon I presently rapped again At this after a moment or so I saw a very small white hand appear at the neighboring window and next moment was looking into a lovely flushed face framed in bright hair with eyes woefully swelled by tears but a glance showed me that she was young and of a rare and gentle beauty Before I could speak she laid her finger upon her lip with a warning gesture Help me oh help me she whispered hurriedly they have locked me in here and I dare not go to bed and and oh what shall I do Locked you in I exclaimed Oh what shall I do she sobbed I tell you I am afraid of him his hateful wicked eyes Here a tremor seemed to shake her and she covered her face with her hands To night when I found the key gone from the door and remembered his look as he bade me Good night I thought I should have died I waited here close beside the window listening listening Once I thought I heard a step outside my door and opened the casement to throw myself out he shall not find me here when he comes No said I he shall not find you here when he comes All this she had imparted to me in broken whispers and with her face still hidden but at my words she peeped at me through her fingers You mean You must run away But the door is locked There remains the window The window she repeated trembling You would find it easy enough with my help Quick then she exclaimed and held out her hand Wait said I and turned back into my room Hereupon having locked the door I got into my boots slipped on my coat and knapsack and last of all threw my blackthorn staff out of the window where I was sure of finding it and climbed out after it The porch I have mentioned upon which I now stood sloped steeply down upon two sides so that I had no little difficulty in maintaining my foothold on the other hand it was no great distance from the ground and I thought that it would be easy enough of descent At this moment the lady reappeared at the lattice What is it I whispered struck by the terror in her face Quick she cried forgetting all prudence in her fear quick they are coming I hear some one upon the stair Oh you are too late and sinking upon her knees she covered her face with her hands Without more ado I swung myself up and clambered over the sill into the room beside her I was looking round for something that might serve me for a weapon when my eye encountered a tall oak press a heavy cumbersome affair but save the bed the only furniture the room possessed Setting my shoulder to it therefore I began to urge it towards the door But it was soon apparent that I could not get it there in time for the creeping footstep was already close outside and next moment a key was softly inserted in the lock Quick hide yourself I whispered over my shoulder and stepping back from the door to give myself room I clenched my fists There was a faint creak as the key turned the door was opened cautiously and a man s dim figure loomed upon the threshold He had advanced two or three paces on tiptoe before he discovered my presence for the room was in shadow and I heard his breath catch suddenly and hiss between his teeth then without a word he sprang at me But as he came I leapt aside and my fist took him full and squarely beneath the ear He pitched sideways and falling heavily rolled over upon his back and lay still As I leaned above him however for the blow had been a heavy one he uttered a groaning oath whereupon pinning him forthwith by the collar I dragged him out into the passage and whipping the key from the lock transferred it to the inside and locked the door Waiting for no more I scrambled back through the casement and reached up my hand to the lady Come said I and almost as quickly as it takes to set it down here she was beside me upon the roof of the porch clinging to my arm Exactly how it was managed I am unable to say all that I remember being the vision of a slender foot and ankle and an excellently shaped leg Our farther descent to the ground proved much more difficult than I had supposed but though I could feel her trembling my companion obeyed my whispered instructions and yielded herself implicitly to my guidance so that we were soon standing in the lane before the house safe and sound except for a few rents to our garments What is it she whispered seeing me searching about in the grass My staff said I a faithful friend I would not lose it But they will be here in a minute we shall be seen I cannot lose my staff said I Oh hurry hurry she cried wringing her hands And in a little while having found my staff we turned our backs upon the tavern and began to run up the lane side by side As we went came the slam of a door behind us a sudden clamor of voices followed a moment later by the sharp report of a pistol and in that same fraction of time I stumbled over some unseen obstacle and my hat was whisked from my head Are you hurt panted my companion No said I but it was a very excellent shot nevertheless For as I picked up my hat I saw a small round hole that pierced it through and through midway between crown and brim The lane wound away between high hedges which rendered our going very dark for the moon was getting low and difficult by reason of the deep wheel ruts but we hurried forward notwithstanding urged on by the noise of the chase We had traversed some half mile thus when my ears warned me that our pursuers were gaining upon us and I was inwardly congratulating myself that I had stopped to find my staff and wondering how much execution such a weapon might reasonably be capable of when I found that my companion was no longer at my side As I paused irresolute her voice reached me from the shadow of the hedge This way she panted Where said I Here and as she spoke her hand slipped into mine and so she led me through a small gate into a broad open meadow beyond But to attempt crossing this would be little short of madness for as I pointed out we could not go a yard without being seen No no she returned her breath still laboring wait wait till they are past And so hand in hand we stood there in the shadow screened very effectively from the lane by the thick hedge while the rush of our pursuers feet drew nearer and nearer until we could hear a voice that panted out curses upon the dark lane ourselves and everything concerned at sound of which my companion seemed to fall into a shivering fit her clasp tightened upon my hand and she drew closer to me Thus we remained until voices and footsteps had grown faint with distance but even then I could feel that she was trembling still Suddenly she drew her fingers from mine and covered her face with her hands Oh that man she exclaimed in a whisper I didn t quite realize till now what I have escaped Oh that beast Sir Harry Mortimer said I You know him she cried Heaven forbid I answered but I have seen him once before at The Chequers inn at Tonbridge and I never forget names or faces especially such as his How I hate him she whispered An unpleasant animal to be sure said I But come it were wiser to get as far from here as possible they will doubtless be returning soon So we started off again running in the shadow of the hedge We had thus doubled back upon our pursuers and leaving the tavern upon our left soon gained the kindly shadow of those woods through which I had passed in the early evening Borne to us upon the gentle wind was the haunting perfume of hidden flowers and the sinking moon sent long shafts of silvery light to pierce the leafy gloom and make the shadows more mysterious The path we followed was very narrow so that sometimes my companion s knee touched mine or her long silken hair brushed my brow or cheek as I stooped to lift some trailing branch that barred her way or open a path for her through the leaves So we journeyed on through the mysteries of the woods together CHAPTER XX CONCERNING DAEMONS IN GENERAL AND ONE IN PARTICULAR In certain old books you shall find strange mention of witches warlocks succubae spirits daemons and a thousand other powers of darkness whose pronounced vocation was the plague of poor humanity Within these books you may read if you will divers wondrous accounts together with many learned disquisitions upon the same and most minute and particular descriptions of witch marks and the like Aforetime when a man committed some great offence against laws human or divine he was said to be possessed of a daemon that is to say he became the medium and instrument through and by which the evil was wrought thus when in due season he came to be hanged tortured or burned it was inflicted not so much as a punishment upon him the man as to exorcise once and for all the devil which possessed him In these material common sense days we are wont to smile the superior smile at the dark superstitions and deplorable ignorance of our forefathers yet life is much the same now as then the devil goeth up and down in the world spirits daemons and the thousand powers of darkness abide with us still though to day they go by different names for there is no man in this smug complacent age of ours but carries within him a power of evil greater or less according to his intellect Scratch off the social veneer lift but a corner of the very decent cloak of our civilization and behold there stands the Primal Man in all his old wild savagery and with the devil leering upon his shoulder Indeed to day as surely as in the dim past we are all possessed of a devil great or small weaker or stronger as the case may be a demon which though he sometimes seems to slumber is yet watchful and ever ready to spring up and possess us to the undoing of ourselves and others Thus as I followed my companion through the wood I was conscious of a Daemon that ran beside me leaping and gambolling at my elbow though I kept my eyes straight before me Anon his clutching fingers were upon my arm and fain I would have shaken him off but could not while as I watched the swing and grace of the lithe feminine body before me from the little foot to the crowning glory of her hair she seemed a thousand times more beautiful than I had supposed And I had saved her tonight from what There had been the fear of worse than death in her eyes when that step had sounded outside her chamber door Hereupon as I walked I began to recall much that I had read in the old romances of the gratitude of rescued ladies Truly said I to myself in olden days a lady well knew how to reward her rescuer Woman is woman the same to day as then try her try her chuckled the Daemon And now as I looked more fully at this Damon he seemed no daemon at all but rather a jovial companion who nodded and winked and nudged me slyly with his elbow What are pretty faces for but to be admired said he in my ear what are slender waists for but to be pressed and as for a kiss or two in a dark wood with no one to spy they like it you dog they like it So we traversed the alleys of the wood now in shadow now in moonlight the Lady the Daemon and I and always the perfume of hidden flowers seemed sweeter and stronger the gleam of her hair and the sway of her body the more alluring and always the voice at my ear whispered Try her you dog try her At last being come to a broad grassy glade the lady paused and standing in the full radiance of the dying moon looked up at me with a smile on her red lips They can never find us now she said No they can never find us now I repeated while the Daemon at my elbow chuckled again And oh sir I can never never thank you she began Don t said I not looking at her don t thank me till we are out of the wood I think she went on slowly that you can guess from from what you saved me and can understand something of my gratitude for I can never express it all Indeed said I indeed you overestimate my service You risked your life for me sir said she her eyes glistening surely my thanks are due to you for that And I do thank you from my heart And with a swift impulsive gesture she stretched out her hands to me For a brief moment I hesitated then seized them and drew her close But even as I stooped above her she repulsed me desperately her loosened hair brushed my eyes and lips blinded maddened me my hat fell off and all at once her struggles ceased Sir Maurice Vibart she panted and I saw a hopeless terror in her face But the Daemon s jovial voice chuckled in my ear Ho Peter Vibart act up to your cousin s reputation who s to know the difference My arms tightened about her then I loosed her suddenly and turning smote my clenched fist against a tree which done I stooped and picked up my hat and blackthorn staff Madam said I looking down upon my bleeding knuckles I am not Sir Maurice Vibart It seems my fate to be mistaken for him wherever I go My name is Peter plain and unvarnished and I am very humbly your servant Now as I spoke it seemed that the Daemon no longer the jovial companion was himself again horns hoof and tail nay indeed he seemed a thousand times more foul and hideous than before as he mouthed and jibed at me in baffled fury wherefore I smiled and turned my back upon him Come said I extending my hand to the trembling girl let us get out of these dismal woods For a space she hesitated looking up at me beneath her lashes then reached out and laid her fingers in mine and as we turned away I knew that the Daemon had cast himself upon the ground and was tearing at the grass in a paroxysm of rage and bafflement It is strange said I after we had gone some little distance very strange that you should only have discovered this resemblance here and now for surely you saw my face plainly enough at the inn No you see I hardly looked at you And now that you do look at me am I so very much like Sir Maurice Not now she answered shaking her head for though you are of his height and though your features are much the same as his your expression is different But a moment ago when your hat fell off Yes said I Your expression your face looked Demoniac I suggested Yes she answered Yes said I So we went upon our way nor paused until we had left the Daemon and the dark woods behind us Then I looked from the beauty of the sweet pure earth to the beauty of her who stood beside me and I saw that her glance rested upon the broken knuckles of my right hand Meeting my eyes her own drooped and a flush crept into her cheeks and though of course she could not have seen the Daemon yet I think that she understood CHAPTER XXI JOURNEYS END IN LOVERS MEETINGS The moon was fast sinking below the treetops to our left what time we reached a road or rather cart track that wound away up a hill Faint and far a church clock slowly chimed the hour of three the solemn notes coming sweet and silvery with distance What chimes are those I inquired Cranbrook Church Is it far to Cranbrook One mile this way but two by the road yonder You seem very well acquainted with these parts said I I have lived here all my life those are the Cambourne Woods over there Cambourne Woods said I Part of the Sefton estates she continued Cambourne village lies to the right beyond The Lady Sophia Sefton of Cambourne said I thoughtfully My dearest friend nodded my companion They say she is very handsome said I Then they speak truth sir She has been described to me I went on as a Peach a Goddess and a Plum which should you consider the most proper term My companion shot an arch glance at me from the corners of her eyes and I saw a dimple come and go beside the curve of her mouth Goddess to be sure said she peaches have such rough skins and plums are apt to be sticky And goddesses I added were all very well upon Olympus but in this matter of fact age must be sadly out of place Speaking for myself Have you ever seen this particular Goddess inquired my companion Never Then wait until you have sir The moon was down now yet the summer sky was wonderfully luminous and in the east I almost fancied I could detect the first faint gleam of day And after we had traversed some distance in silence my companion suddenly spoke but without looking at me You have never once asked who I am she said almost reproachfully I thought nor how I came to be shut up in such a place with such a man Why as to that I answered I make it a general rule to avoid awkward subjects when I can and never to ask questions that it will be difficult to answer I should find not the least difficulty in answering either said she Besides I continued it is no affair of mine after all Oh said she turning away from me and then very slowly No I suppose not Certainly not I added how should it be How indeed said she over her shoulder And then I saw that she was angry and wondered And yet I went on after a lapse of silence I think I could have answered both questions the moment I saw you at your casement Oh said she this time in a tone of surprise and her anger all gone again for I saw that she was smiling and again I wondered Yes I nodded Then said she seeing I was silent whom do you suppose me You are to the best of my belief the Lady Helen Dunstan My companion stood still and regarded me for a moment in wide eyed astonishment And how air pray did you learn all this she demanded with the dimple once more peeping at me slyly from the corner of her pretty mouth By the very simple method of adding two and two together I answered moreover no longer ago than yesterday I broke bread with a certain mister Beverley I heard her breath come in a sudden gasp and next moment she was peering up into my face while her hands beat upon my breast with soft quick little taps Beverley she whispered Beverley no no why they told me Sir Harry told me that Peregrine lay dying at Tonbridge Then Sir Harry Mortimer lied to you said I for no longer ago than yesterday afternoon I sat in a ditch eating bread and cheese with a mister Peregrine Beverley Oh are you sure are you sure Quite sure And as we ate he told me many things and among them of a life of wasted opportunities of foolish riot and prodigal extravagance and of its logical consequence want My poor Perry she murmured He spoke also of his love for a very beautiful and good woman and its hopelessness My dear dear Perry said she again And yet said I all this is admittedly his own fault and as I think Heraclitus says Suffering is the inevitable consequence of Sin or Folly And he is well she asked quite quite well He is said I Thank God she whispered Tell me she went on is he so very very poor is he much altered I have not seen him for a whole long year Why a year is apt to change a man I answered Adversity is a hard school but sometimes a very good one Were he changed no matter how were he a beggar upon the roads I should love him always said she speaking in that soft caressing voice which only the best of women possess Yes I had guessed as much said I and found myself sighing A year is a long long time and we were to have been married this month but my father quarrelled with him and forbade him the house so poor Perry went back to London Then we heard he was ruined and I almost died with grief you see his very poverty only made me love him the more Yesterday that man Sir Harry Mortimer said I Yes he was a friend of whom I had often heard Perry speak and he told me that my Perry lay at Tonbridge dying and begging to see me before the end He offered to escort me to him assuring me that I could reach home again long before dusk My father who I knew would never permit me to go was absent and so I ran away Sir Harry had a carriage waiting but almost as soon as the door was closed upon us and we had started I began to be afraid of him and and Sir Harry as I said before is an unpleasant animal I nodded Thank Heaven she pursued we had not gone very far before the chaise broke down And the rest you know The footpath we had been following now led over a stile into a narrow lane or byway Very soon we came to a high stone wall wherein was set a small wicket Through this she led me and we entered a broad park where was an avenue of fine old trees beyond which I saw the gables of a house for the stars had long since paled to the dawn and there was a glory in the east Your father will be rejoiced to have you safe back again said I Yes she nodded but he will be very angry And hereupon she stopped and began to pull and twist and pat her shining hair with dexterous white fingers talking thus the while My mother died at my birth and since then father has worshipped her memory and his face always grows wonderfully gentle when he looks upon her portrait They say I m greatly like her though she was a famous beauty in her day And indeed I think there must be some truth in it for no matter how I may put him out my father can never be very angry when my hair is dressed so With the word she turned and truly I thought the face peeping out from its clustered curls even more lovely and bewitching than before I very much doubt if any man could said I As we approached the house I saw that the smooth gravel was much cut up as though by the coming and going of many wheels and horses and also that one of the windows still shone with a bright light and it was towards this window that my companion led me In a while having climbed the terrace steps I noticed that this was one of those French windows opening to the ground Now looking through into the room beyond I beheld an old man who sat bowed down at a table with his white head pillowed upon his arms sitting so very still that he might have been asleep but for the fierce grip of his twitching hands Now upon the table at no great distance from him between the guttering candles lay a hat a very ill used battered looking object which I thought I recognized wherefore looking about I presently espied its owner leaning against the mantel He was powdered with dust from head to foot and his worn garments looked more ragged than ever and as he stood there in the droop of his head and the listless set of his shoulders there was an air of the most utter dejection and hopelessness while upon his thin cheek I saw the glisten of a great solitary tear But as I looked the window was burst suddenly open Perry Love surprise joy pity all were summed up in that one short word yet deeper than all was love And at that cry the white head was raised raised in time to see a vision of loveliness caught up in two ragged arms Father And now the three heads the white the golden and the black were drawn down together drawn and held close in an embrace that was indeed reunion Then seeing my presence was become wholly unnecessary I turned away and was soon once more deep among the trees Yet as I went I suddenly heard voices that called upon my name but I kept on and in due season came out upon the broad highway And in a little as I went very full of thought the sun rose up So I walked along through a world all glorious with morning CHAPTER XXII IN WHICH I MEET WITH A LITERARY TINKER Even in that drowsy semi conscious state that most delightful borderland which lies midway between sleeping and waking I knew it could not be the woodpecker who as I judged from sundry manifest signs lodged in the tree above me No woodpecker that ever pecked could originate such sounds as these two quick light strokes followed by another and heavier thus Tap tap TAP a pause and then tap tap TAP again and so on Whatever doubts I may have yet harbored on the subject however were presently dispelled by a fragrance sweeter to the nostrils of a hungry man than the breath of flowers the spices of the East or all the vaunted perfumes of Arabia in a word the odor of frying bacon Hereupon I suddenly realized how exceedingly keen was my appetite and sighed bethinking me that I must first find a tavern before I could satisfy my craving when a voice reached me from no great distance a full rich sonorous voice singing a song And the words of the song were these A tinker I am O a tinker am I A tinker I ll live and a tinker I ll die If the King in his crown would change places wi me I d laugh so I would and I d say unto he A tinker I am O a tinker am I A tinker I ll live and a tinker I ll die It was a quaint air with a shake at the end of the first two and last two lines which altogether I thought very pleasing I advanced guided by the voice until I came out into a grassy lane Seated upon an artfully contrived folding stool was a man He was a very small man despite his great voice who held a kettle between his knees and a light hammer in his hand while a little to one side of him there blazed a crackling fire of twigs upon which a hissing frying pan was balanced But what chiefly drew and held my attention was the man s face narrow and peaked with little round twinkling eyes set deep in his head close black hair grizzled at the temples and a long blue chin And presently as I stood staring at him he finished his song and chancing to raise his eyes stared back at me Good morning said he at last with a bright nod So then you didn t cut your throat in the Hollow Oak after all said I Nor likely to either master he answered shaking his head Lord love your eyes and limbs no But said I some day or so ago I met a man Ah nodded the Tinker to be sure you did A pedler of brooms and ribands Gabbing Dick nodded the Tinker Who told me very seriously That I d been found in the big holler oak wi my throat cut nodded the Tinker But what did he mean by it Why y see explained the Tinker leaning over to turn a frizzling bacon rasher very dexterously with the blade of a jack knife y see Gabbing Dick is oncommon fond of murders hangings sooicides and such like it s just a way he s got A very unpleasant way said I But very harmless when all s done and said added the Tinker You mean A leetle weak up here explained the Tinker tapping his forehead with the handle of the jack knife His father was murdered the day afore he were born d ye see which druv his poor mother out of her mind which conditions is apt to make a man a leetle strange Poor fellow said I while the Tinker began his tap tapping again Are you hungry he inquired suddenly glancing up at me with his hammer poised Very hungry said I Hereupon he set down his hammer and turning to a pack at his side proceeded to extract therefrom a loaf of bread a small tin of butter and a piece of bacon from which last he cut sundry slices with the jack knife He now lifted the hissing rashers from the pan to a tin plate which he set upon the grass at my feet together with the bread and the butter and having produced a somewhat battered knife and fork handed them to me with another bright nod You are very kind said I Why I m a man as is fond o company y see especially of one who can think and talk and you have the face of both I am as you might say a literary cove being fond o books nov els and such like And in a little while the bacon being done to his liking we sat down together and began to eat That was a strange song of yours said I after a while Did you like it he inquired with a quick tilt of his head Both words and tune I answered I made the words myself said the Tinker And do you mean it Mean what asked the Tinker That you would rather be a tinker than a king Why to be sure I would he rejoined Bein a literary cove I know summat o history and a king s life weren t all lavender not by no manner o means nor yet a bed o roses Yet there s much to be said for a king Very little I think said the Tinker A king has great advantages Which he generally abuses said the Tinker There have been some great and noble kings But a great many more bad uns said the Tinker And then look how often they got theirselves pisoned or stabbed or ad their eads chopped off No if you axes me I prefer to tinker a kettle under a hedge Then you are contented Not quite he answered his face falling me being a literary cove as I think I ve mentioned afore it has always been my wish to be a scholar Far better be a tinker said I Young fellow said the Tinker shaking his head reprovingly you re off the mark there knowledge is power why Lord love my eyes and limbs what s finer than to be able to read in the Greek and Latin To possess the capacity of earning an honest livelihood said I Why I tell you continued the Tinker unheeding my remark I d give this here left hand o mine to be able to read the very words of such men as Plato Aristotle Epictetus Xenophon and all the rest of em There are numerous translations said I Ah to be sure sighed the Tinker but then they are translations There are good translations as well as bad said I Maybe returned the Tinker maybe but a translation s only a echo after all however good it be As he spoke he dived into his pack and brought forth a book which he handed to me It was a smallish volume in battered leathern covers and had evidently seen much long and hard service Opening it at the title page I read Epictetus his ENCHIRIDION with Simplicius his COMMENT Made English from the Greek By George Stanhope late Fellow Of King s College in Camb LONDON Printed for Richard Sare at Gray s Inn Gate in Holborn And Joseph Hindmarsh against the Exchange in Cornhill sixteen forty nine You ve read Epictetus perhaps inquired the Tinker I have Not in the Greek of course Yes said I smiling though by dint of much labor The Tinker stopped chewing to stare at me wide eyed then swallowed his mouthful at one gulp Lord love me he exclaimed and you so young too No said I I m twenty five And Latin now don t tell me you can read the Latin But I can t make a kettle or even mend one for that matter said I But you are a scholar and it s a fine thing to be a scholar And I tell you again it is better to be a tinker said I How so It is a healthier life in the first place said I That I can believe nodded the Tinker It is a happier life in the second place That I doubt returned the Tinker And in the third place it pays much better That I don t believe said the Tinker Nevertheless said I speaking for myself I have in the course of my twenty five years earned but ten shillings and that but by the sale of my waistcoat Lord love me exclaimed the Tinker staring A man I pursued may be a far better scholar than I may be full of the wisdom of the Ancients and the teachings of all the great thinkers and philosophers and yet starve to death indeed frequently does but who ever heard of a starving Tinker But a scholar may write great books said the Tinker A scholar rarely writes a great book said I shaking my head probably for the good and sufficient reason that great books never are written Young fellow said the Tinker staring what do you mean by that I mean that truly great books only happen and very rarely But a scholar may happen to write a great book said the Tinker To be sure he may a book that nobody will risk publishing and if so a book that nobody will trouble to read nowadays Why so Because this is an eminently unliterary age incapable of thought and therefore seeking to be amused Whereas the writing of books was once a painful art it has of late become a trick very easy of accomplishment requiring no regard for probability and little thought so long as it is packed sufficiently full of impossible incidents through which a ridiculous heroine and a more absurd hero duly sigh their appointed way to the last chapter Whereas books were once a power they are of late degenerated into things of amusement with which to kill an idle hour and be promptly forgotten the next Yet the great books remain said the Tinker Yes said I but who troubles their head over Homer or Virgil these days who cares to open Steele s Tatler or Addison s Spectator while there is the latest novel to be had or Bell s Life to be found on any coffee house table And why said the Tinker looking at me over a piece of bacon skewered upon the point of his jack knife why don t you write a book I probably shall some day I answered And supposing said the Tinker eyeing the piece of bacon thoughtfully supposing nobody ever reads it The worse for them said I Thus we talked of books and the making of books something of which I have already set down in another place until our meal was at an end You are a rather strange young man I think said the Tinker as having duly wiped knife and fork and plate upon a handful of grass I handed them back Yet you are a stranger tinker How so Why who ever heard of a tinker who wrote verses and worked with a copy of Epictetus at his elbow Which I don t deny as I m a great thinker nodded the Tinker to be sure I think a powerful lot A dangerous habit said I shaking my head and a most unwise one Eh cried the Tinker staring Your serious thinking man I explained is seldom happy as a rule has few friends being generally regarded askance and is always misunderstood by his fellows All the world s great thinkers from Christ down were generally misunderstood looked at askance and had very few friends But these were all great men said the Tinker We think so now but in their day they were very much despised and who was more hated by the very people He sought to aid than Christ By the evil doers yes nodded the Tinker On the contrary said I his worst enemies were men of learning good citizens and patterns of morality who looked upon him as a dangerous zealot threatening the destruction of the old order of things hence they killed him as an agitator Things are much the same to day History tells us that Christ or the spirit of Christ has entered into many men who have striven to enlighten and better the conditions of their kind and they have generally met with violent deaths for Humanity is very gross and blind The Tinker slowly wiped his clasp knife upon the leg of his breeches closed it and slipped it into his pocket Nevertheless said he at last I am convinced that you are a very strange young man Be that as it may said I the bacon was delicious I have never enjoyed a meal so much except once at an inn called The Old Cock I know it nodded the Tinker a very poor house But the ham and eggs are beyond praise said I still my meal here under the trees with you will long remain a pleasant memory Good by then said the Tinker Good by young man and I wish you happiness What is happiness said I The Tinker removed his hat and having scratched his head put it on again Happiness said he happiness is the state of being content with one s self the world and everything in general Then said I I fear I can never be happy And why not Because supposing I ever became contented with the world and everything in general which is highly improbable I shall never never be contented with myself CHAPTER XXIII CONCERNING HAPPINESS A PLOUGHMAN AND SILVER BUTTONS Now as I went pondering on true happiness and the nature of it I beheld a man ploughing in a field hard by and as he ploughed he whistled lustily And drawing near to the field I sat down upon a gate and watched for there are few sights and sounds I am fonder of than the gleam of the ploughshare and the sighing whisper it makes as it turns the fragrant loam A truly noble occupation said I to myself dignified by the ages ay old well nigh as the green earth itself no man need be ashamed to guide a plough And indeed a fine sight it made the straining horses the stalwart figure of the Ploughman with the blue sky the long brown furrows and away and beyond the tender green of leaves while the jingle of the harness the clear merry whistled notes and the song of a skylark high above our heads all blended into a chorus it was good to hear As he came up to where I sat upon the gate the Ploughman stopped and wiping the glistening moisture from his brow nodded good humoredly A fine morning said I So it be sir now you come to mention it it do be a fine day surely You at least seem happy said I Happy he exclaimed staring Yes said I Well I bean t And why not The Ploughman scratched his ear and carried his glance from my face up to the sky and down again I dunno he answered but I bean t Yet you whistle gayly enough Why a man must do summat Then you seem strong and healthy Yes I do be fine an hearty And sleep well Like a blessed log And eat well Eat he exclaimed with a mighty laugh Lord I should think so why I m always eatin or thinkin of it Oh I m a fine eater I am an I bean t no chicken at drinkin neither Then you ought to be happy Ah but I bean t he repeated shaking his head Have you any troubles None as I can think on You earn good money every week Ten shillin You are not married Not me Then said I you must be happy The Ploughman pulled at his ear again looked slowly all round the field and finally shook his head Well said he I bean t But why not His eye roved slowly up from my boots to the buttons on my coat Them be fine buttons said he Do you think so Look like silver They are silver said I Lord he exclaimed you wouldn t part wi they buttons I suppose That depends On what On how much you would give for them The Ploughman thrust a hand into a deep pocket and brought up five shillings I were a goin to buy a pair o boots on my way ome he explained but I d rayther ave they buttons if five shillin ll buy em The boots would be more serviceable said I Maybe sir but then everybody wears boots but there bean t many as can show buttons the like o them so if you re willin Lend me your knife said I And forthwith I sawed off the eight silver buttons and dropped them into his palm whereupon he handed me the money with great alacrity And now said I tell me why you are not happy Well returned the Ploughman back at his ear again ye see it bein as you ask so sudden like I can t zack ly say but if you was to pass by in a day or two why maybe I could tell ye So pocketing the buttons he whooped cheerily to his horses and plodded off whistling more merrily than ever CHAPTER XXIV WHICH INTRODUCES THE READER TO THE ANCIENT The sun was high when I came to a place where the ways divided and while I stood hesitating which road to take I heard the cool plash and murmur of a brook at no great distance Wherefore being hot and thirsty I scrambled through the hedge and coming to the brook threw myself face down beside it and catching up the sweet pure water in my hands drank my fill which done I bathed my feet and hands and face and became much heartened and refreshed thereby Now because I have ever loved the noise of running waters in a little while I rose and walked on beside the stream listening to its blithesome melody So by devious ways for the brook wound prodigiously I came at length to a sudden declivity down which the water plunged in a miniature cascade sparkling in the sun and gleaming with a thousand rainbow hues On I went climbing down as best I might until I found myself in a sort of green basin very cool after the heat and glare of the roads for the high tree clad sides afforded much shade On I went past fragrant thickets and bending willows with soft lush grass underfoot and leafy arches overhead and the brook singing and chattering at my side albeit a brook of changeful mood now laughing and dimpling in some fugitive ray of sunshine now sighing and whispering in the shadows but ever moving upon its appointed way and never quite silent So I walked on beside the brook watching the fish that showed like darting shadows on the bottom until chancing to raise my eyes I stopped And there screened by leaves shut in among the green stood a small cottage or hut My second glance showed it to be tenantless for the thatch was partly gone the windows were broken and the door had long since fallen from its hinges Yet despite its forlornness and desolation despite the dilapidation of broken door and fallen chimney there was something in the air of the place that drew me strangely It was somewhat roughly put together but still very strong and seemed save for the roof weatherfast A man might do worse than live here thought I with the birds for neighbors and the brook to sing him to sleep at night Indeed a man might live very happily in such a place I was still looking at the hut with this in my mind when I was startled by hearing a thin quavering voice behind me Be you m a lookin at t cottage master Turning sharp round I beheld a very ancient man in a smock frock who carried a basket on one arm and leaned upon a stick Yes I answered I was wondering how it came to be built in such an out of the world spot Why t were built by a wanderin man o the roads It s very lonely said I Ye may well say so sir haunted it be tu Haunted said I Haunted as ever was answered the old man with a sprightly nod strangely contrasting with his wrinkled face and tremulous limbs No one ventur s nigh the place arter dark an few enough in the daytime for that matter On account of the ghost Ah nodded the Ancient moans e du an likewise groans Theer s some as says e twitters tu an shakes chains Then nobody has lived here of late Bless ee no nor wouldn t no not if ye paid em tu Nobody s come a nigh the place you may say since t were built by the wanderin man Lived ere all alone e did killed isself ere likewise Killed himself said I Ah ung isself be ind th door yonder sixty an six year ago come August an t were me as found im Ye see said the old man setting down his basket and seating himself with great nicety on the moss grown doorstep ye see t were a tur ble storm that night rain and wind wi every now an then a gert cracklin flame o lightnin I mind I d been up to th farm a courtin o Nancy Brent she m dead now poor lass years an years ago but she were a fine buxom maid in those days d ye see Well I were comin ome and what wi one thing an another I lost my way An presently as I were stumblin along in the dark comes another crackle o lightnin an lookin up what should I see but this ere cottage T were newer lookin then wi a door an winders but the door was shut an the winders was dark so theer I stood in the rain not likin to disturb the stranger for e were a gert fierce unfriendly kind o chap an uncommon fond o bein left alone Hows ever arter a while up I goes to th door an knocks for I were a gert strong strappin well lookin figure o a man myself in those days d ye see an could give a good buffet an tak one tu so up I goes to th door an knocks wi my fist clenched all ready an a tidy sizable fist it were in those days but Lord nobody answered so at last I lifted the latch Here the Ancient paused to draw a snuff box from his pocket with great deliberation noting my awakened interest with a twinkling eye Well I inquired Well he continued slowly I lifted th latch an give a push to the door but it would only open a little way an inch p r aps an stuck Here he tapped and opened his snuff box Well I inquired again Well he went on I give it a gert big push wi my shoulder I were a fine strong chap in those days an just as it flew open comes another flash o lightnin an the fust thing I seen was a boot A boot I exclaimed A boot as ever was nodded the Ancient and took a pinch of snuff with great apparent gusto Go on said I go on Oh it s a fine story a fine story he chuckled Theer bean t many men o my age as as fund a ung man in a thunderstorm Well as I tell ye I seen a boot likewise a leg an theer were this ere wanderin man o the roads a danglin be ind th door from a stapil look ye he exclaimed rising with some little difficulty and hobbling into the hut theer be th very stapil so it be and he pointed up to a rusty iron staple that had been driven deep into the beam above the door And why said I why did he hang himself Seein e ad no friends and never told nobody nobody never knowed answered the old man shaking his head but on that theer stapil e ung isself an on that theer stapil I fund im on a stormy night sixty and six year ago come August You have a wonderful memory said I Ay to be sure a wunnerful mem ry a wunnerful mem ry Sixty and six years is an age said I So it be nodded the Ancient I were a fine young chap in those days tall I were an straight as a arrer I be a bit different now Why you are getting old said I So s t stapil yonder but t stapil looks nigh as good as ever Iron generally wears better than flesh and blood said I it s only natural Ay but e can t last forever said the Ancient frowning and shaking his head at the rusty staple I ve watched un month in an month out all these years an seen un growin rustier an rustier I ll last ee out yet I ve said to un e knows it e ve heerd me many an many a time I ll last ee out yet I ve said an so I will to e can t last forever an I be a vig rus man a mortal vig rus man bean t I Wonderfully said I An so strong as a bull To be sure An t stapil can t last much longer eh maister so old an rusty as e be One would hardly think so Not so long as a tur ble vig rus man like I be he inquired with a certain wistful appeal in his eyes No I answered impulsively I knowed it I knowed it he chuckled feebly brandishing his stick such a poor old stapil as tis all eat up wi rust Every time I come ere a gatherin watercress I come in an give un a look an watch un rustin away an rustin away I ll see un go fust arter all so I will and with another nod at the staple he turned and hobbled out into the sunshine And seeing how despite his brave showing he labored to carry the heavy basket I presently took it from him disregarding his protests and set off by his side yet as we went I turned once to look back at the deserted hut You m thinkin tis a tur ble bad place at night said the old man On the contrary I answered I was thinking it might suit a homeless man like me very well indeed D ye mean to live there exclaimed the Ancient Yes said I Then you bean t afraid o the ghost No I answered P r aps you be one o they fules as think theer bean t no ghosts As to that I answered I don t know but I don t think I should be much afraid and it is a great blessing to have some spot on this unfriendly world that we can call home even though it be but a hut and haunted In a little while the path we followed led up a somewhat steep ascent which though not so precipitous as the place where I had entered the hollow was a difficult climb notwithstanding seeing which I put out a hand to aid my aged companion But he repulsed me almost sharply Let be he panted let be nobody s never elped me up this ere path an nobody never shall So up we went the Ancient and I side by side and very slowly until the summit being reached he seated himself spent and breathless upon a fallen tree which had doubtless served this purpose many times before and mopped at his wrinkled brow with a trembling hand Ye see he cried as soon as he had recovered his breath sufficiently ye see I be wunnerful spry an active could dance ye a hornpipe any day if I was so minded On my word said I I believe you could But where are you going now To Siss n urst How far is that Bout a mile acrost t fields you can see the pint o Joel Amos s oast ouse above the trees yonder Is there a good inn at Sissinghurst Ay theer s The Bull comfortable an draws fine ale Then I will go to Sissinghurst Ay ay nodded the old man if it be good ale an a comfortable inn you want you need seek no further nor Siss n urst ninety an one years I ve lived there an I know Ninety one years I repeated As ever was returned the Ancient with another nod I be the oldest man in these parts cept David Relf an e died last year Why then if he s dead you must be the oldest said I No said the Ancient shaking his head ye see it be this way David were my brother an uncommon proud e were o bein the oldest man in these parts an now that e be dead an gone it du seem a poor thing ah a very poor thing to tak vantage of a dead man an him my own brother Saying which the Ancient rose and we went on together side by side towards Sissinghurst village CHAPTER XXV OF BLACK GEORGE THE SMITH AND HOW WE THREW THE HAMMER The Bull is a plain square whitewashed building with a sloping roof and before the door an open portico wherein are set two seats on which one may sit of a sunny afternoon with a mug of ale at one s elbow and watch the winding road the thatched cottages bowered in roses or the quiver of distant trees where the red conical roof of some oast house makes a vivid note of color amid the green Or one may close one s eyes and hark to the chirp of the swallows under the eaves the distant lowing of cows or the clink of hammers from the smithy across the way And presently as we sat there drowsing in the sun to us came one from the tap a bullet headed fellow small of eye and nose but great of jaw albeit he was become somewhat fat and fleshy who having nodded to me sat him down beside the Ancient and addressed him as follows Black Jarge be took again Gaffer Ah I knowed twould come soon or late Simon said the Ancient shaking his head I knowed as e d never last the month out Seemed goin on all quiet and reg lar though said the bullet headed man whom I discovered to be the landlord of The Bull seemed nice and quiet and nothin out o the way when bout an hour ago it were e ups and heaves Sam out into the road Ah said the old man nodding his head again to be sure I ve noticed Simon as tis generally about the twentieth o the month as Jarge gets took E ve got a wonderful ead ave the Gaffer said Simon turning to me Yes said I but who is Black George how comes he to be taken and by what Gaffer said the Innkeeper you tell un Why then began the Ancient nothing loth Black Jarge be a gert big strong man the biggest gertest and strongest in the South Country d ye see a most as fine a man as I were in my time and off and on gets took wi tearin s and rages at which times e don t mind who e its No nor Wheer added the Innkeeper Oh e be a bad man be Black Jarge when e s took for e ave a knack d ye see of takin old o the one nighest to un and a heavin of un over is ead Extremely unpleasant said I Just what he done this marnin wi Sam nodded the Innkeeper hove un out into the road e did And what did Sam do I inquired Oh Sam were mighty glad to get off so easy Sam must be a very remarkable fellow undoubtedly a philosopher said I E be nowt to look at said the Ancient Now at this moment there came a sudden deep bellow a hoarse bull like roar from somewhere near by and looking round in some perplexity through the wide doorway of the smithy opposite I saw a man come tumbling all arms and legs who having described a somersault fell rolled over once or twice and sitting up in the middle of the road stared about him in a dazed sort of fashion That s Job nodded the Ancient Poor fellow said I and rose to go to his assistance Oh that weren t nothin said the Ancient laying a restraining hand upon my arm nothin at all Job bean t urt why I ve seen em fall further nor that afore now but y see Job be pretty heavy handlin even for Black Jarge And in a little while Job arose from where he sat in the dust and limping up sat himself down on the opposite bench very black of brow and fierce of eye And after he had sat there silent for maybe five minutes I said that I hoped he wasn t hurt Urt he repeated with a blank stare Ow should I be urt Why you seemed to fall rather heavily said I At this Job regarded me with a look half resentful half reproachful and immediately turned his back upon me from which and sundry winks and nods and shakes of the head from the others it seemed that my remark had been ill judged And after we had sat silent for maybe another five minutes the Ancient appeared to notice Job s presence for the first time Why you bean t workin s arternoon then Job he inquired solemnly Noa Goin to tak a olleyday p r aps Ah I m done wi smithin leastways for Black Jarge And him wi all that raft o work in Job Pretty fix e ll be in wi no one to strike for im said Simon Sarves un right tu retorted Job furtively rubbing his left knee But what ll e do wi out a elper persisted Simon Lord knows returned the Ancient unless Job thinks better of it Not me said that individual feeling his right elbow with tender solicitude I m done wi Black Jarge I am E nigh broke my back for me once afore but this is the last time I never swing a sledge for Black Jarge again danged if I du And im to mend th owd church screen up to Cranbrook Church sighed the Ancient a wunnerful screen a wunnerful screen older nor me ah a sight older hunneds and hunneds o years older they wouldn t let nobody touch it but Black Jarge E be the best smith in the South Country nodded Simon Ay an a bad man to work for as ever was growled Job I ll work for e no more my mind s made up an when my mind s made up theer bean t no movin me like a rock I be Twould ha been a fine thing for a Siss n urst man to ha mended t owd screen said the Ancient Twould that nodded Simon a shame it is as it should go to others Hereupon having finished my ale I rose Be you m a goin young maister inquired the Ancient Why that depends said I I understand that this man Black George needs a helper so I have decided to go and offer my services You exclaimed Job staring in open mouthed amazement as did also the other two Why not I rejoined Black George needs a helper and I need money My chap said Job warningly don t ye do it You be a tidy sizable chap but Black Jarge ud mak no more o you than I should of a babby don t ye do it Better not said Simon On the contrary I returned better run a little bodily risk and satisfy one s hunger rather than lie safe but famishing beneath some hedge or rick what do you think Ancient The old man leaned forward and peered up at me sharply beneath his hanging brows Well said I You m right he nodded and a man wi eyes the like o yourn bean t one as tis easy to turn aside even though it do be Black Jarge as tries Then said Job as I took up my staff if your back s broke my chap why don t go for to blame me that s all You be a sight too cocksure ah that you be I m thinkin Black Jarge would find this chap a bit different to Job remarked the Ancient What do ee think Simon Looks as if e might take a good blow ah and give one for that matter returned the Innkeeper studying me with half closed eyes and his head to one side as I have seen artists look at pictures He be pretty wide in the shoulders and full in the chest and by the look of him quick on is pins You ve been a fightin man Simon and you ought to know but he ve got summat better still And what might that be Gaffer inquired the Innkeeper A good straight bright eye Simon wi a look in it as says I will Ah but what o Jarge cried Job Black Jarge don t mind a man s eyes cept to black frequent e don t mind nothin nor nobody Job said the Ancient tapping his snuff box theer s some things as is better nor gert big muscles and gert strong fists if you wasn t a danged fule you d know what I mean Young man he went on turning to me you puts me in mind o what I were at your age though to be sure I were taller n you by about five or six inches maybe more but don t go for to be too cock sure for all that Black Jarge aren t to be sneezed at And if you must it un added the Innkeeper why go for the chin theer aren t a better place to it a man than on the chin if so be you can thump it right and ard enough I mind t was so I put out Tom Brock o Bedford a sweet pretty blow it were too though I do say it Thank you said I should it come to fighting which Heaven forfend I shall certainly remember your advice Saying which I turned away and crossed the road to the open door of the smithy very conscious of the three pairs of eyes that watched me as I went Upon the threshold of the forge I paused to look about me and there sure enough was the smith Indeed a fine big fellow he was with great shoulders and a mighty chest and arms whose bulging muscles showed to advantage in the red glow of the fire In his left hand he grasped a pair of tongs wherein was set a glowing iron scroll upon which he beat with the hammer in his right I stood watching until having beaten out the glow from the iron he plunged the scroll back into the fire and fell to blowing with the bellows But now as I looked more closely at him I almost doubted if this could be Black George after all for this man s hair was of a bright gold and curled in tight rings upon his brow while instead of the black scowling visage I had expected I beheld a ruddy open well featured face out of which looked a pair of eyes of a blue you may sometimes see in a summer sky at evening And yet again his massive size would seem to proclaim him the famous Black George and no other It was with something of doubt in my mind nevertheless that I presently stepped into the smithy and accosted him Are you Black George I inquired At the sound of my voice he let go the handle of the bellows and turned as I watched I saw his brows draw suddenly together while the golden hairs of his beard seemed to curl upward Suppose I be Then I wish to speak with you Be that what you m come for Yes Be you come far Yes That s a pity Why Cause you ll ave a good way to go back again What do you mean Well for one thing I means as I don t like your looks my chap And why don t you like my looks Lord exclaimed the smith ow should I know but I don t of that I m sartin sure Which reminds me said I of a certain unpopular gentleman of the name of Fell or Pell or Snell Eh said the smith staring There is a verse I remember which runs I think in this wise I do not love thee Doctor Fell or Pell or Snell For reasons which I cannot tell But this I know and know full well I do not love thee Doctor Fell or Pell or Snell So you m a poet eh No said I shaking my head Then I m sorry for it a man don t meet wi poets every day saying which he drew the scroll from the fire and laid it glowing upon the anvil You was wishful to speak wi me I think he inquired Yes I answered Ah nodded the smith to be sure and forthwith began to sing most lustily marking the time very cleverly with his ponderous hand hammer If I began a little put out at this if you will listen to what I have to say But he only hammered away harder than ever and roared his song the louder and though it sounded ill enough at the time it was a song I came to know well later the words of which are these Strike ding ding Strike ding ding The iron glows And loveth good blows As fire doth bellows Strike ding ding Now seeing he was determined to give me no chance to speak I presently seated myself close by and fell to singing likewise Oddly enough the only thing I could recall on the moment was the Tinker s song and that but very imperfectly yet it served my purpose well enough Thus we fell to it with a will the different notes clashing and filling the air with a most vile discord and the words all jumbled up together something in this wise Strike ding ding A tinker I am O Strike ding ding A tinker am I The iron it glows A tinker I ll live And loveth good blows And a tinker I ll die As fire doth bellows If the King in his crown Strike ding ding Would change places with me Strike ding ding And so forth The louder he roared the louder roared I until the place fairly rang with the din in so much that chancing to look through the open doorway I saw the Ancient with Simon Job and several others on the opposite side of the way staring open mouthed as well they might But still the smith and I continued to howl at each other with unabated vigor until he stopped all at once and threw down his hammer with a clang Dang me if I like that voice o yourn he exclaimed Why to be sure I don t sing very often I answered Which I mean to say is a very good thing ah a very good thing Nor do I pretend to sing Then why do ee try now For company s sake Well I don t like it I ve ad enough of it Then said I suppose you listen to what I have to say Not by no manner o means Then what do you propose to do Why said the smith rising and stretching himself since you ax me I m a goin to pitch you out o yon door You may try of course said I measuring the distance between us with my eye but if you do seeing you are so much the bigger and stronger man I shall certainly fetch you a knock with this staff of mine which I think you will remember for many a day So saying I rose and stepped out into the middle of the floor Black George eyed me slowly up from the soles of my boots to the crown of my hat and down again picked up his hammer in an undecided fashion looked it over as if he had never seen such a thing before tossed it into a corner and seating himself on the anvil folded his arms All at once a merry twinkle leapt into the blue depths of his eyes and I saw the swift gleam of a smile What do ee want man said he Now hereupon with a sudden gesture I pitched my staff out through the open doorway into the road and folded my arms across my chest even as he Why did ee do that he inquired staring Because I don t think I shall need it after all But suppose I was to come for ee now But you won t You be a strange sort o chap said he shaking his head So they tell me And what does the likes o you want wi the likes o me Work Know anythin about smithin Not a thing Then why do ee come ere To learn More fool you said the smith Why Because smithin is ard work and dirty work and hot work and work as is badly paid nowadays Then why are you a smith My feyther was a smith afore me And is that your only reason My only reason Then you are the greater fool You think so do ye Certainly Supposin said Black George stroking his golden beard reflectively supposin I was to get up and break your neck for that Then you would at least save me from the folly of becoming a smith I don t said Black George shaking his head no I do not like you I am sorry for that Because he went on you ve got the gift o the gab and a gabbing man is worse than a gabbing woman You can gab your share if it comes to that said I Can I You can My chap he growled holding up a warning hand go easy now go easy don t get me took again Not if I can help it I returned I be a quiet soul till I gets took a very quiet soul lambs bean t quieter but I won t answer for that neck o yourn if I do get took so look out I understand you have an important piece of work on hand said I changing the subject Th owd church screen yes And are in need of a helper Ah to be sure but you aren t got the look o a workin cove I never see a workin cove wi ands the like o yourn so white as a woman s they be I have worked hard enough in my time nevertheless said I What might you ave done now I have translated Petronius Arbiter also Quintilian with a literal rendering into the English of the Memoires of the Sieur de Brantome Oh exclaimed the smith that sounds a lot anything more Yes I answered I won the High Jump and Throwing the Hammer Throwin th ammer repeated Black George musingly was it anything like that theer And he pointed to a sledge near by Something I answered And you want work I do Tell ee what my fellow if you can throw that theer ammer further nor me then I ll say Done and you can name your own wages but if I beat you and I m fair sure I can then you must stand up to me for ten minutes and I ll give ee a good trouncin to ease my mind what d ye say After a momentary hesitation I nodded my head Done said I More fool you grinned the smith and catching up his sledge hammer he strode out into the road Before The Bull a small crowd had gathered all newly come from field or farmyard for most of them carried rake or pitchfork having doubtless been drawn thither by the hellish outcry of Black George and myself Now I noticed that while they listened to the Ancient who was holding forth snuff box in hand yet every eye was turned towards the smithy and in every eye was expectation At our appearance however I thought they seemed one and all vastly surprised and taken aback for heads were shaken and glances wandered from the smith and myself to the Ancient and back again Well I ll be danged exclaimed Job I knowed it I knowed it cried the Ancient rubbing his hands and chuckling Knowed what Gaffer inquired Black George as we came up Why I knowed as this young chap would come out a walkin pon his own two legs and not like Job a rollin and a wallerin in the dust o th road like a hog Why y see Gaffer began the smith almost apologetically it seemed to me it do come sort o nat ral to heave the likes o Job about a bit Job s made for it y might say but this chap s different So e be Jarge so e be nodded the Ancient Though mark me Gaffer I aren t nohow in love wi this chap neither e gabs too much to suit me by a long sight E do that chimed in Job edging nearer what I sez is if e do get is back broke e aren t got nobody to blame but isself so cocksure as e be Job said the Ancient hold thee tongue I sez e s a cocksure cove repeated Job doggedly an a cocksure cove e be what do ee think Jarge Job returned the smith I don t chuck a man into t road and talk wi im both in the same day In this conversation I bore no part busying myself in drawing out a wide circle in the dust a proceeding watched by the others with much interest and not a few wondering comments What be goin to du wi ammer Jarge inquired the Ancient Why explained the smith this chap thinks e can throw it further nor me At this there was a general laugh If so be e can pursued Black George then e comes to work for me at is own price but if I beat im then e must stand up to me wi is fists for ten minutes Ten minutes cried a voice e won t last five see if e do Feel sorry for un said a second e do be so pale as a sheet a ready So would you be if you was in is shoes chimed in a third whereat there was a general laugh Indeed as I looked round the ring of grinning unresponsive faces it was plain to see that all sympathy was against the stranger as is the way of bird beast fish but especially man the world over and I experienced a sudden sense of loneliness which was I think only natural Yet as I put up my hand to loose the strap of my knapsack I encountered another already there and turning beheld Simon the Innkeeper If it do come to fightin he whispered close in my ear if it do come to fightin and I m fair sure it will keep away as much as you can you look quick on your pins Moreover whatever you do watch is right and when you do see a chance to strike go for is chin a little to one side and strike danged ard Many thanks for your friendly advice said I with a grateful nod and slipping off my coat would have handed it to him but that the Ancient hobbled up and taking it from me folded it ostentatiously across his arm Mark my words Simon said he this young chap is as like what I were at his age as one pea is to another I says so and I means so Come said Black George at this juncture I ve work waitin to be done and my forge fire will be out I m quite ready said I stepping forward It was now arranged that standing alternately within the circle we should each have three throws whoever should make the two best throws to win Hereupon the smith took his place within the circle hammer in hand Wait said I the advantage usually lies with the last thrower it would be fairer to you were we to toss for it No answered Black George motioning the onlookers to stand back I ve got th ammer and I ll throw first Now as probably every one knows it is one thing to swing a sledge hammer in the ordinary way but quite another to throw it any distance for there is required beside the bodily strength a certain amount of knowledge without which a man is necessarily handicapped Thus despite my opponent s great strength of arm I was fairly sanguine of the result Black George took a fresh grip upon the hammer shaft twirled it lightly above his head swung it once twice thrice and let it go With a shout Job and two or three others ran down the road to mark where it had fallen and presently returned pacing out the distance Fifty nine they announced Can ee beat that inquired Black George complacently I think I can I answered as taking up the hammer I in turn stepped into the ring Gripping the shaft firmly I whirled it aloft and began to swing it swifter and swifter gaining greater impetus every moment till like a flash it flew from my grasp Panting I watched it rise rise rise and then plunge down to earth in a smother of dust E ve beat it cried the Ancient flourishing his stick excitedly Lord love me e ve beat it Ay e ve beat it sure ly said a man who carried a rake that was forever getting in everybody s way An by a goodish bit to shouted another Ah but Jarge aren t got is arm in yet retorted a third Jarge can do better nor that by a long sight But now all voices were hushed as Job paced up Eighty two he announced Black George looked hard at me but without speaking stepped sulkily into the ring moistened his palms looked at me again and seizing the hammer began to whirl it as he had seen me Round and round it went faster and faster till with a sudden lurch he hurled it up and away Indeed it was a mighty throw Straight and strong it flew describing a wide parabola ere it thudded into the road The excitement now waxed high and many started off to measure the distance for themselves shouting one to another as they went As for the smith he stood beside me whistling and I saw that the twinkle was back in his eyes again One hunner and twenty cried half a dozen voices And a half corrected Job thrusting the hammer into my hand and grinning Can ee beat that inquired Black George again Ay can ee beat that echoed the crowd It was a marvellous throw said I shaking my head And indeed in my heart I knew I could never hope to equal much less beat such a mighty cast I therefore decided on strategy and with this in mind proceeded in a leisurely fashion once more to mark out the circle which was obliterated in places to flatten the surface underfoot to roll up my sleeves and tighten my belt in fine I observed all such precautions as a man might be expected to take before some supreme effort At length having done everything I could think of to impress this idea upon the onlookers I took up the hammer Means to do it this time cried the man with the rake knocking off Job s hat in his excitement as with a tremendous swing I made my second throw There was a moment s breathless silence as the hammer hurtled through the air then like an echo to its fall came a shout of laughter for the distance was palpably far short of the giant smith s last A moment later Job came pacing up and announced Eighty seven Hereupon arose a very babel of voices You ve got un beat a ready Jarge Well I knowed it from the start Let un alone cried Simon e ve got another chance yet Much good it ll do im Ah might as well give in now and take is thrashin and ha done wi it That my ruse had succeeded with the crowd was evident they to a man believed I had done my best and already regarded me as hopelessly beaten My chance of winning depended upon whether the smith deluded into a like belief should content himself with just beating my last throw for should he again exert his mighty strength to the uttermost I felt that my case was indeed hopeless It was with a beating heart therefore that I watched him take his place for the last throw His face wore a confident smile but nevertheless he took up the hammer with such a businesslike air that my heart sank and feeling a touch upon my arm I was glad to turn away I be goin to fetch a sponge and water said Simon A sponge and water Ah Likewise some vinegar theer s nothin like vinegar and remember the chin a little to one side preferred So then you think I shall be beaten Why I don t say that but it s best to be prepared aren t it now And with a friendly nod the Innkeeper turned away In that same minute there arose another shout from the crowd as they greeted Black George s last throw and Job striding up announced Ninety eight Then while the air still echoed with their plaudits I stepped into the ring and catching up the hammer swung it high above my head and at the full length of my arms began to wheel it The iron spun faster and faster till setting my teeth with the whole force of every fibre every nerve and muscle of my body I let it fly The blood was throbbing at my temples and my breath coming fast as I watched its curving flight And now all voices were hushed so that the ring of the iron could be plainly heard as it struck the hard road and all eyes watched Job as he began pacing towards us As he drew nearer I could hear him counting to himself thus Ninety one ninety two ninety three ninety four ninety five ninety six ninety seven ninety eight ninety nine one hundred one hundred and one one hundred and two one hundred and two Next moment as it seemed to me an inarticulate Ancient was desperately trying to force me into my coat wrong side first and Simon was shaking my hand You tricked me cried a voice and turning I found Black George confronting me with clenched fists And how did I trick you I could ha chucked farther nor that Then why didn t you Because I thought you was beat I say you tricked me And I tell you the match was a fair one from start to finish Put up your hands said the smith advancing in a threatening manner No said I a bargain is a bargain and turning my back upon him I fell to watching the man with the rake who not content with Job s word was busily pacing out the distance for himself Put up your hands repeated Black George hoarsely For the last time no said I over my shoulder Strike me if you will I went on seeing him raise his fist I shall not defend myself but I tell you this Black George the first blow you strike will brand you coward and no honest man Coward is it cried he and with the word had seized me in a grip that crushed my flesh and nigh swung me off my feet coward is it he repeated Yes said I none but a coward would attack an unresisting man So for a full minute we stood thus staring into each other s eyes and once again I saw the hairs of his golden beard curl up and outwards What would have been the end I cannot say but there came upon the stillness the sound of flying footsteps the crowd was burst asunder and a girl stood before us a tall handsome girl with raven hair and great flashing black eyes Oh you Jarge think shame on yourself think shame on yourself Black Jarge Look she cried pointing a finger at him look at the great strong man as is a coward I felt the smith s grip relax his arms dropped to his sides while a deep red glow crept up his cheeks till it was lost in the clustering curls of gleaming yellow hair Why Prue he began in a strangely altered voice and stopped The fire was gone from his eyes as they rested upon her and he made a movement as though he would have reached out his hand to her but checked himself Why Prue he said again but choked suddenly and turning away strode back towards his forge without another word On he went looking neither to right nor left and I thought there was something infinitely woebegone and pitiful in the droop of his head Now as I looked from his forlorn figure to the beautiful flushed face of the girl I saw her eyes grow wonderfully soft and sweet and brim over with tears And when Black George had betaken himself back to his smithy she also turned and crossing swiftly to the inn vanished through its open doorway She ve a fine sperrit ave that darter o yourn Simon a fine sperrit Oh a fine sperrit as ever was chuckled the Ancient Prue aren t afeard o Black Jarge never was returned Simon she can manage un allus could you ll mind she could allus tame Black Jarge wi a look Gaffer Ah she m a gran darter to be proud on be Prue nodded the Ancient an proud I be to What said I is she your daughter Simon Ay for sure And your granddaughter Ancient Ay that she be that she be Why then Simon must be your son Son as ever was nodded the old man and a goodish son e be to oh I ve seen worse And now added Simon come in and you shall taste as fine a jug of ale as there be in all Kent Wait said the old man laying his hand upon my arm I ve took to you young chap took to you amazin what might your name be Peter I answered A good name a fine name nodded the old man Peter Simon said he glancing from one to the other of us Simon Peter minds me o the disciple of our blessed Lord it du a fine name be Peter So Peter I became to him thenceforth and to the whole village CHAPTER XXVI WHEREIN I LEARN MORE CONCERNING THE GHOST OF THE RUINED HUT And after the Ancient and Simon and I had very creditably emptied the jug between us I rose to depart Peter said the Ancient wheer be goin Home said I And wheer be that The cottage in the Hollow said I What th aunted cottage he cried staring Yes I nodded from what I saw of it I think with a little repairing it might suit me very well But the ghost cried the old man have ye forgot the ghost Why I never heard of a ghost really harming any one yet I answered Peter said Simon quietly I wouldn t be too sure o that I wouldn t go a nigh the place myself once is enough for me Simon said I what do you mean by once Now when I asked him this Simon breathed hard and shuffled uneasily in his chair I mean Peter as I ve heerd un he replied slowly Heard him I repeated incredulously you Are you sure Sure as death Peter I ve heerd un a shriekin and a groanin to isself same as Gaffer as and lots of others Why Lord bless ee theer be scarce a man in these parts but as eerd um one time or another Ay I ve eerd un and seen un tu croaked the Ancient excitedly A gert tall think e be wi a orn on is ead and likewise a tail some might ha thought t was the Wanderin Man o the Roads as I found angin on t stapil some on em du but I knowed better I knowed t were Old Nick isself all flame and brimstone an wi a babby under is arm A baby I repeated A babby as ever was nodded the Ancient And you say you have heard it too Simon said I Ay nodded the Innkeeper I went down into th Oller one evenin bout six months ago wi Black Jarge for we ad a mind to knock th owd place to pieces and get rid o the ghost that way Well Jarge ups wi is ammer and down comes the rotten old door wi a crash Jarge ad strung up is ammer for another blow when all at once theer comes a scream Here Simon shivered involuntarily and glanced uneasily over his shoulder and round the room A scream said I Ah nodded Simon but twere worse nor that Here he paused again and looking closer at him I was surprised to see that his broad strong hands were shaking and that his brow glistened with moisture What was it like I inquired struck by this apparent weakness in one so hardy and full of health Twere a scream wi a bubble in it he answered speaking with an effort twere like somebody shriekin out wi is throat choked up wi blood Jarge and me didn t wait for no more we run And as we run it follered groanin arter us till we was out upon the road and then it shrieked at us from the bushes Ecod it do make me cold to talk of it even now Jarge left is best sledge be ind im and I my crowbar and we never went back for them nor never shall no Here Simon paused to mop the grizzled hair at his temples I tell ee Peter that place aren t fit for no man at night If so be you m lookin for a bed my chap theer s one you can are at The Bull ready and willin An gratus added the Ancient tapping his snuffbox Thank you said I both of you for the offer but I have a strange fancy to hear and if possible see this ghost for myself Don t ee du it admonished the Ancient so dark an lonesome as it be don t ee du it Peter Why Ancient said I it isn t that I doubt your word but my mind is set on the adventure So if Simon will let me have threepenny worth of candles and some bread and meat no matter what I ll be off for I should like to get there before dusk Nodding gloomily Simon rose and went out whereupon the Ancient leaned over and laid a yellow clawlike hand upon my arm Peter said he Peter I ve took to you amazin just a few inches taller say a couple an you d be the very spit o what I were at your age the very spit Thank you Ancient said I laying my hand on his Now Peter twould be a hijious thing a very hijious thing if when I come a gatherin watercress in the marnin I should find you a danglin on t stapil cold and stiff like t other or lyin a corp wi your throat cut twould be a hijious hijious thing Peter but oh twould mak a fine story in the tellin In a little while Simon returned with the candles a tinder box and a parcel of bread and meat for which be gloomily but persistently refused payment Last of all he produced a small brass bound pistol which he insisted on my taking Not as it ll be much use again a ghost said he with a gloomy shake of the head but a pistol s a comfortable thing to ave in a lonely place specially if that place be very dark Which last if something illogical may be none the less true So having shaken each by the hand I bade them good night and set off along the darkening road CHAPTER XXVII WHICH TELLS HOW AND IN WHAT MANNER I SAW THE GHOST Now as I went my mind was greatly exercised as to a feasible explanation of what I had just heard That a man so old as the Ancient should see things I could readily believe by reason of his years for great age is often subject to such hallucinations but with Simon a man in the prime of his life it was a different matter altogether That he had been absolutely sincere in his story I had read in his dilating eye and the involuntary shiver that had passed over him while he spoke Here indeed though I scouted all idea of supernatural agency there lay a mystery that piqued my curiosity not a little Ghosts pshaw What being endowed with a reasoning mind could allow himself to think let alone believe in such folly Ghosts fiddle de dee Sir Yet here and all at once like an enemy from the dark old stories leaped at and seized me by the throat old tales of spectres grim and bloody of goblins and haunted houses from whose dim desolation strange sounds would come tales long since heard and forgot till now Ghosts Why the road was full of them they crowded upon my heels they peered over my shoulders I felt them brush my elbows and heard them gibbering at me from the shadows And the sun was setting already Ghosts And why not There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in your philosophy Involuntarily I hastened my steps but the sun had set ere I reached the Hollow Yes the sun had set and the great basin below me was already brimful of shadows which as I watched seemed to assume shapes vast nebulous and constantly changing down there amid the purple gloom of the trees Indeed it looked an unholy place in the half light a pit framed for murders and the safe hiding of tell tale corpses the very haunt of horrid goblins and spectres grim and ghastly So evilly did the place impress me that it needed an effort of will ere I could bring myself to descend the precipitous slope Bats flitted to and fro across my path now and then emitting their sharp needlelike note while from somewhere in the dimness beyond an owl hooted By the time I reached the cottage it had fallen quite dark here in the Hollow though the light still lingered in the world above So I took out my tinder box and one of the candles which after several failures I succeeded in lighting and stepping into the cottage began to look about me The place was small as I think I have before said and comprised two rooms shut off from each other by a strong partition with a door midway Lifting the candle I glanced at the staple on which the builder of the cottage had choked out his life so many years ago and calling to mind the Ancient s fierce desire to outlast it I even reached up my hand and gave it a shake But despite the rust of years the iron felt as strong and rigid as ever so that it seemed the old man s innocent wish must go unsatisfied after all The second room appeared much the same size as the first and like it in all respects till looking upwards I noticed a square trap door in a corner while underneath against the wall hung a rough ladder This I proceeded to lift down and mounting cautiously lifted the trap Holding the candle above my head to survey this chamber or rather garret the first object my eye encountered was a small tin pannikin and beyond that a stone jar or demijohn Upon closer inspection I found this last to be nearly full of water quite sweet and fresh to the taste which of itself was sufficient evidence that some one had been here very lately I now observed a bundle of hay in one corner which had clearly served for a bed beside which were a cracked mug a tin plate a pair of shoes and an object I took to be part of a flute or wind instrument of some kind But what particularly excited my interest were the shoes which had evidently seen long and hard service for they were much worn and had been roughly patched here and there Very big they were and somewhat clumsy thick soled and square of toe and with a pair of enormous silver buckles These evidences led me to believe that whoever had been here before was likely to return and not doubting that this must be he who had played the part of ghost so well I determined to be ready for him So leaving all things as I found them I descended and having closed the trap hung up the ladder as I had found it In the first of the rooms there was a rough fireplace built into one corner and as the air struck somewhat damp and chill I went out and gathered a quantity of twigs and dry wood and had soon built a cheerful crackling fire I now set about collecting armfuls of dry leaves which I piled against the wall for a bed By the time this was completed to my satisfaction the moon was peeping above the treetops filling the Hollow with far flung shadows I now lay down upon my leafy couch and fell to watching the fire and listening to the small soft song of the brook outside In the opposite wall was a window the glass of which was long since gone through which I could see a square of sky and the glittering belt of Orion My eyes wandered from this to the glow of the fire many times but gradually my head grew heavier and heavier until at length the stars became confused with the winking sparks upon the hearth and the last that I remember was that the crackle of the fire sounded strangely like the voice of the Ancient croaking A hijious thing Peter a hijious thing I must have slept for an hour or nearer two for the room was dark save for a few glowing embers on the hearth and the faint light of the stars at the window when I suddenly sat bolt upright with every tingling nerve straining as if to catch something which had but that very moment eluded me I was yet wondering what this could be when from somewhere close outside the cottage there rose a sudden cry hideous and appalling a long drawn out bubbling scream no other words can describe it that died slowly down to a wail only to rise again higher and higher till it seemed to pierce my very brain Then all at once it was gone and silence rushed in upon me a silence fraught with fear and horror unimaginable I lay rigid the blood in my veins jumping with every throb of my heart till it seemed to shake me from head to foot And then the cry began again deep and hoarse at first but rising rising until the air thrilled with a scream such as no earthly lips could utter Now the light at the window grew stronger and stronger and all at once a feeble shaft of moonlight crept across the floor I was watching this most welcome beam when it was again obscured by a something indefinable at first but which I gradually made out to be very like a human head peering in at me but if this was so it seemed a head hideously misshapen and there sure enough rising from the brow was a long pointed horn As I lay motionless staring at this thing my hand by some most fortunate chance encountered the pistol in my pocket and from the very depths of my soul I poured benedictions upon the honest head of Simon the Innkeeper for its very contact seemed to restore my benumbed faculties With a single bound I was upon my feet and had the weapon levelled at the window Speak said I speak or I ll shoot There was a moment of tingling suspense and then Oh man dinna do that said a voice Then come in and show yourself Herewith the head incontinently disappeared there was the sound of a heavy step and a tall figure loomed in the doorway Wait said I as fumbling about I presently found tinder box and candle having lighted which I turned and beheld a man an exceedingly tall man clad in the full habit of a Scottish Highlander By his side hung a long straight basket hilted sword beneath one arm he carried a bagpipe while upon his head was not a horn but a Scot s bonnet with a long eagle s feather Oh man said he eyeing me with a somewhat wry smile I m juist thinkin ye re no afeared o bogles whateffer CHAPTER XXVIII THE HIGHLAND PIPER Who are you said I in no very gentle tone Donal s my name sir an if ye had an e e for the tartan ye d ken

future said I Hoot toot ye ll be no meanin it But I do mean it said I Eh man but ye maun ken the place is no canny what wi pixies an warlocks an kelpies forbye Indeed they told me it was haunted but I determined to see for myself Weel Well I am glad to find it haunted by nothing worse than a wandering Scots piper The Highlander smiled his wry smile and taking out a snuff box inhaled a pinch regarding me the while Ye re the first as ever stayed after they d heard the first bit squeakie tae find out if t were a real bogle or no But how in the world did you make such awful sounds I m thinkin it s the bit squeakie ye ll be meanin he inquired Yes how did you do it Oh it s juist the pipes he answered patting them affectionately will I show ye the noo Pray do said I Hereupon he set the mouthpiece to his lips inflated the bag stopped the vents with his fingers and immediately the air vibrated with the bubbling scream I have already attempted to describe Oh man he exclaimed laying the still groaning instrument gently aside oh man is it no juist won erful But what has been your object in terrifying people out of their wits in this manner Sir it s a on account o the snuff Snuff I repeated Juist that he nodded Snuff said I again what do you mean The Piper smiled again a slow smile that seemingly dawned only to vanish again it was indeed if I may so express it a grave and solemn smile and his nearest approach to mirth for not once in the days which followed did I ever see him give vent to a laugh I here also take the opportunity to say that I have greatly modified his speech in the writing for it was so broad that I had much ado to grasp his meaning at times The Piper smiled then and unwinding the plaid from his shoulder spread it upon the floor and sat down Ye maun ken he began that I hae muckle love for the snuff an snuff is unco expenseeve in these parts Well said I Ye maun ken in the second place that ma brither Alan canna abide the snuff Your brother Alan said I wondering Ma brither Alan he nodded gravely But what of him what has he to do with Man bide a wee I m comin tae that Go on then said I I m listening Weel I d hae ye tae ken I m a braw bonnie piper an ma brither Alan he s a bonnie piper too no sic a fair graund piper as me bein somewhat uncertain wi his warblers ye ken but a bonnie piper whateffer Aweel mebbe a year syne I fell in love wi a lassie which wad ha been a richt if ma brither Alan hadna fallen in love wi her too so that she puir lassie didna ken which tae tak Donal says Alan can ye no love anither lassie she can no marry the twa o us that s sure Then Alan says I we ll juist play for her Which I think ye ll own was a graund idee only the lassie couldna juist mak up her mind which o us piped the best So the end of it was we agreed ma brither Alan an I to pipe oor way through England for a year an the man wha came back wi the maist siller should wed the lassie And a very fair proposal said I but Wheest man juist here s where we come to the snuff for look ye every time I bought a paper o snuff I minded me that ma brither Alan not takkin it himself was so much siller tae the gude an oh man it used tae grieve me sair till one day I lighted on this bit hoosie Well said I What d ye no see it No indeed I answered Eh man ma brither Alan doesna buy the snuff but he must hae a roof tae shelter him an a bed tae lie in o nights an pay for it too ye ken fourpence or a bawbee or a shillin as the case may be whiles here I hae baith for the takkin An oh man many s the nicht I ve slept the sweeter for thinkin o that saxpence or shillin that Alan s apartin wi for a bed little better than mine So wishfu tae keep this bit hoosie tae mysel seein t was haunted as they ca it I juist kep up the illusion on account o trampers wanderin gypsies an sic like dirty tykes Eh but twas fair graund tae see em rinnin awa as if the de il were after them spierin back o er their shoulders an a by reason of a bit squeakie o the pipes here An so sir ye hae it I now proceeded to build and relight the fire during which the Scot drew a packet of bread and cheese from his sporran together with a flask which having uncorked he held out to me with the one word Whuskey Thank you Donald but I rarely drink anything stronger than ale said I Aweel said he if ye winna ye winna an there s but a wee drappie left tae be sure Whereupon after two or three generous gulps he addressed himself to his bread and cheese and I following his example took out the edibles Simon had provided An ye re minded tae bide here ye tell me he inquired after a while Yes I nodded but that need not interfere with you two can live here as easily as one and now that I have had a good look at you I think we might get along very well together Sir said he solemnly my race is royal I am a Stuart here s a Stuart s hand and he reached out his hand to me across the hearth with a gesture that was full of a reposeful dignity Indeed I never remember to have seen Donald anything but dignified How do you find life in these parts I inquired Indeefferent sir vera indeefferent Tae be sure at fairs an sic like I ve often had as much as ten shillin in ma bonnet at a time but it s juist the kilties that draw em they hae no real love for the pipes whateffer A rantin reel pleases em well eneugh but eh they hae no hankerin for the gude music That is a question open to argument Donald said I can any one play real music on a bagpipe think you Sir returned the Scot setting down the empty flask and frowning darkly at the fire the pipes is the king of a instruments tis the sweetest the truest the oldest whateffer True it is very old said I thoughtfully it was known I believe to the Greeks and we find mention of it in the Latin as tibia utricularia Suetonius tells us that Nero promised to appear publicly as a bagpiper Then too Chaucer s Miller played a bagpipe and Shakespeare frequently mentions the drone of a Lincolnshire Bagpipe Yes it is certainly a very old and I think a very barbarous instrument Hoot toot the man talks like a muckle fule said Donald nodding to the fire For instance I continued there can be no comparison between a bagpipe and a fiddle say A fiddle exclaimed Donald in accents of withering scorn and still addressing the fire Ye can juist tell him tae gang tae the de il wi his fiddle Music is I take it the expression of one s mood or thought a dream translated into sound said I thoughtfully therefore Hae ye ever heard the pipes Why yes but long ago Then said Donald ye shall juist hear em again So saying he wiped his mouth took up his instrument and began slowly inflating it Then all at once from drones and chanter there rushed forth such a flood of melody as seemed to sweep me away upon its tide First I seemed to hear a roar of wind through desolate glens a moan of trees and a rush of sounding waters yet softly softly there rises above the flood of sound a little rippling melody which comes and goes and comes again growing ever sweeter with repetition And now the roar of wind is changed to the swing of marching feet the tread of a mighty host whose step is strong and free and lo they are singing as they march and the song is bold and wild wild wild Again and again beneath the song beneath the rhythm of marching feet the melody rises very sweet but infinitely sad like a silver pipe or an angel s voice tremulous with tears Once again the theme changes and it is battle and death sudden and sharp there is the rush and shock of charging ranks and the surge and tumult of conflict above whose thunder loud and clear and shrill like some battle cry the melody swells one moment triumphant and the next lost again But the thunder rolls away distant and more distant the day is lost and won but sudden and clear the melody rings out once more fuller now richer and complete the silver pipe has become a golden trumpet And yet what sorrow what anguish unspeakable rings through it the weeping and wailing of a nation So the melody sinks slowly to die away in one long drawn minor note and Donald is looking across at me with his grave smile and I will admit both his face and figure are sadly blurred Donald said I after a little Donald I will never speak against the pipes again they are indeed the king of all instruments played as you play them Ou ay I m a bonnie piper I ll no deny it he answered I m glad ye like it for Sassenach though ye be it proves ye hae the music Tis a bit pibroch I made tae Wullie Wallace him as the damned Sassenach murtiered black be their fa Aweel twas done afore your time or mine so gude nict tae ye Southeron Saying which he rose saluted me stiffly and stalked majestically to bed CHAPTER XXIX HOW BLACK GEORGE AND I SHOOK HANDS The world was full of sunshine the blithe song of birds and the sweet pure breath of waking flowers as I rose next morning and coming to the stream threw myself down beside it and plunged my hands and arms and head into the limpid water whose contact seemed to fill me with a wondrous gladness in keeping with the world about me In a little while I rose with the water dripping from me and having made shift to dry myself upon my neckcloth nothing else being available returned to the cottage Above my head I could hear a gentle sound rising and falling with a rhythmic measure that told me Donald still slept so clapping on my hat and coat I started out to my first day s work at the forge breakfastless for the good and sufficient reason that there was none to be had but full of the glad pure beauty of the morning And I bethought me of the old Psalmist s deathless words Though sorrow endure for a night yet joy cometh in the morning brave true words which shall go ringing down the ages to bear hope and consolation to many a wearied troubled soul for now as I climbed the steep path where bats had hovered last night and turned to look back at the pit which had seemed a place of horror behold it was become a very paradise of quivering green spangled with myriad jewels where the dew yet clung Indeed if any man would experience the full ecstasy of being alive the joi de vivre as the French have it let him go out into the early morning when the sun is young and look about him with a seeing eye So in a little while with the golden song of a blackbird in my ears I turned village wards very hungry yet nevertheless content Long before I reached the smithy I could hear the ring of Black George s hammer though the village was not yet astir and it was with some trepidation as to my reception that I approached the open doorway There he stood busy at his anvil goodly to look upon in his bare armed might and with the sun shining in his yellow hair a veritable son of Anak He might have been some hero or demigod come back from that dim age when angels wooed the daughters of men rather than a village blacksmith and a very sulky one at that for though he must have been aware of my presence he never glanced up or gave the slightest sign of welcome or the reverse Now as I watched I noticed a certain slowness a heaviness in all his movements together with a listless slipshod air which I judged was very foreign to him moreover as he worked I thought he hung his head lower than was quite necessary George George went on hammering George said I again He raised the hammer for another stroke hesitated then lifted his head with a jerk and immediately I knew why he had avoided my eye What do ee want wi me I have come for two reasons said I one is to begin work Then ye d best go away again he broke in ye ll get no work here And the second I went on is to offer you my hand Will you take it George and let bygones be bygones No he burst out vehemently No I tell ee Ye think to come ere an crow o er me because ye beat me by a trick and because ye heerd her His voice broke and dropping his hammer he turned his back upon me Called me coward she did he went on after a little while You heerd her they all heerd her I ve been a danged fule he said more as if speaking his thoughts aloud than addressing me but a man can t help lovin a lass like Prue and when e loves e can t elp hopin I ve hoped these three years an more and last night she called me coward Something bright and glistening splashed down upon the anvil and there ensued a silence broken only by the piping of the birds and the stirring of the leaves outside A fule I be said Black George at last shaking his head no kind o man for the likes o her too big I be and rough And yet if she d only given me the chance Again there fell a silence wherein mingled with the bird chorus came the tap tapping of a stick upon the hard road and the sound of approaching footsteps whereupon George seized the handle of the bellows and fell to blowing the fire vigorously yet once I saw him draw the back of his hand across his eyes with a quick furtive gesture A moment after the Ancient appeared a quaint befrocked figure framed in the yawning doorway and backed by the glory of the morning He stood awhile to lean upon his stick and peer about his old eyes still dazzled by the sunlight he had just left owing to which he failed to see me where I sat in the shadow of the forge Marnin Jarge said he with his quick bright nod The smith s scowl was blacker and his deep voice gruffer than usual as he returned the greeting but the old man seemed to heed it not at all but taking his snuff box from the lining of his tall broad brimmed hat its usual abiding place he opened it with his most important air Jarge said he I m thinkin ye d better tak Job back to strike for ye again if you m goin to mend t owd screen What d ye mean growled Black George Because continued the old man gathering a pinch of snuff with great deliberation because Jarge the young feller as beat ye at the throwin im as was to ave worked for ye at is own price be dead What cried Black George starting Dead nodded the old man a corp e be eh such a fine promisin young chap an now a corp Here the Ancient nodded solemnly again three times and inhaled his pinch of snuff with great apparent zest and enjoyment Why began the amazed George what and broke off to stare open mouthed Last night as ever was continued the old man e went down to th aunted cottage t weren t no manner o use tryin to turn im no not if I d gone down to im on my marrer bones e were that set on it so off he goes bout sundown to sleep in th aunted cottage I knows Jarge cause I follered un an seen for myself so now I m a goin down to find is corp He had reached thus far when his eye accustomed to the shadows chancing to meet mine he uttered a gasp and stood staring at me with dropped jaw Peter he stammered at last Peter be that you Peter To be sure it is said I Bean t ye dead then I never felt more full of life But ye slep in th aunted cottage last night Yes But but the ghost Peter Is a wandering Scotsman Why then I can t go down and find ye corp arter all I fear not Ancient The old man slowly closed his snuff box shaking his head as he did so Ah well I won t blame ye Peter said he magnanunously it bean t your fault lad no but what s come to the ghost The ghost I answered is nothing more dreadful than a wandering Scotsman Scotsman exclaimed the Ancient sharply Scotsman Yes Ancient You m mazed Peter ah mazed ye be What aren t I heerd un moanin an groanin to isself ah an twitterin to As to that said I those shrieks and howls he made with his bagpipe very easy for a skilled player such as he Some one was drawing water from a well across the road for I heard the rattle of the bucket and the creak of the winch in the pause which now ensued during which the Ancient propped upon his stick surveyed me with an expression that was not exactly anger nor contempt nor sorrow and yet something of all three At length he sighed and shook his head at me mournfully Peter said he Peter I didn t think as you d try to tak vantage of a old man wi a tale the like o that such a very very old man Peter such a old old man But I assure you it s the truth said I earnestly Peter I seen Scotchmen afore now said he with a reproachful look ah that I ave many s the time an Scotchmen don t go about wi tails nor yet wi orns on their eads leastways I ve never seen one as did An Peter I know what a bagpipe is I ve heerd em often an often squeak they do yes but a squeak bean t a scream Peter nor yet a groan no Having delivered himself of which the Ancient shook his head at me again and turning his back hobbled away When I turned to look at George it was to find him regarding me with a very strange expression Sir said he ponderously did you sleep in th aunted cottage last night Yes though as I have tried to explain and unsuccessfully it seems it is haunted by nothing more alarming than a Scots Piper Sir said George in the same slow heavy way I couldn t go a nigh the place myself specially arter dark I d be ah I d be afeard to I did go once and then not alone and I ran away Sir you m a better man nor me you done what I durstn t do Sir if so be as you m in the same mind about it I should like to to shake your hand So there across the anvil which was to link our lives together thenceforth Black George and I clasped hands looking into each other s eyes George said I at last I ve had no breakfast Nor I said George And I m mightily hungry So am I said George Then come and let us eat and I turned to the door Why so we will but not at The Bull she be theer Come to my cottage it be close by that is if you care to sir With all my heart said I and my name is Peter What do you say to am and eggs Peter Ham and eggs will be most excellent said I CHAPTER XXX IN WHICH I FORSWEAR MYSELF AND AM ACCUSED OF POSSESSING THE EVIL EYE Smithing is a sturdy albeit a very black art yet its black is a good honest black very easily washed off which is more than can be said for many other trades arts and professions Yes a fine free manly art is smithing and those who labor at the forge would seem necessarily to reflect these virtues Since old Tubal Cain first taught man how to work in brass and iron who ever heard of a sneaking mean spirited cowardly blacksmith To find such an one were as hard a matter as to discover the Fourth Dimension methinks or the carcass of a dead donkey Your true blacksmith is usually a strong man something bowed of shoulder perhaps a man slow of speech bold of eye kindly of thought and lastly simple hearted Riches Genius Power all are fair things yet Riches is never satisfied Power is ever upon the wing and when was Genius ever happy But as for this divine gift of Simpleness of Heart who shall say it is not the best of all Black George himself was no exception to his kind what wonder was it then that as the days lengthened into weeks my liking for him ripened into friendship To us sometimes lonely voyagers upon this Broad Highway of life journeying on perchance through desolate places yet hoping and dreaming ever of a glorious beyond how sweet and how blessed a thing it is to meet some fellow wayfarer and find in him a friend honest and loyal and brave to walk with us in the sun whose voice may comfort us in the shadow whose hand is stretched out to us in the difficult places to aid us or be aided Indeed I say again it is a blessed thing for though the way is sometimes very long such meetings and friendships be very few and far between So as I say there came such friendship between Black George and myself and I found him a man strong simple and lovable and as such I honor him to this day The Ancient on the contrary seemed to have set me in his black books he would no longer sit with me over a tankard outside The Bull of an evening nor look in at the forge with a cheery nod and word as had been his wont he seemed rather to shun my society and if I did meet him by chance would treat me with the frigid dignity of a Grand Seigneur Indeed the haughtiest duke that ever rolled in his chariot is far less proud than your plain English rustic and far less difficult to propitiate Thus though I had once had the temerity to question him as to his altered treatment of me the once had sufficed He was sitting I remember on the bench before The Bull his hands crossed upon his stick and his chin resting upon his hands Peter he had answered regarding me with a terrible eye Peter I be disapp inted in ye Hereupon rising he had rapped loudly upon his snuff box and hobbled stiffly away And that ended the matter so far as I was concerned though to be sure Simon had interceded in my behalf with no better success and thus I was still left wondering One day however as George and I were hard at work I became aware of some one standing in the doorway behind me but at first paid no heed for it was become the custom for folk to come to look at the man who lived all alone in the haunted cottage so as I say I worked on heedlessly Peter said a voice at last and turning I beheld the old man leaning upon his stick and regarding me beneath his lowered brows Why Ancient I exclaimed and held out my hand But he checked me with a gesture and fumblingly took out his snuff box Peter said he fixing me with his eye were it a Scotchman or were it not Why to be sure it was I answered a Scotch piper as I told you and Peter said the Ancient tapping his snuff box it weren t no ghost then ay or no No said I nothing but a Peter said the Ancient nodding solemnly Peter I ates ye and turning sharp about he tottered away upon his stick So that s it said I staring after the old man s retreating figure Why ye see said George somewhat diffidently ye see Peter Gaffer be so old and all is friends be dead and he ve come to look on this ere ghost as belongin to im a most Loves to sit an tell about it e do it be all e ve got left to live for as ve might say and now you ve been and gone and said as theer bean t no ghost arter all d ye see Ah yes I see I nodded I see But you don t still believe in this ghost do you George N o o o not xactly answered George hesitating upon the word can t say as I believe xactly and yet Lord ow should I know Then you do still believe in the ghost Why y see Peter we do know as a man ung isself theer cause Gaffer found un likewise I ve heerd it scream but as for believin in it since you say contrarywise why ow should I know But why should I deny it George why should I tell you all of a Scotsman Why y see Peter said George in his heavy way you be such a strange sort o chap George said I let us get back to work Yet in a little while I set aside the hammer and turned to the door Peter wheer be goin To try and make my peace with the Ancient I answered and forthwith crossed the road to The Bull But with my foot on the step I paused arrested by the sound of voices and laughter within the tap and loudest of all was the voice of the pseudo blacksmith Job If I were only a bit younger the Ancient was saying Now peeping in through the casement a glance at his dejected attitude and the blatant bearing of the others explained to me the situation then and there Ah but you ain t retorted old Amos you m a old old man an gettin older wi every tick o the clock you be an gettin mazed like wi years Haw haw laughed Job and the five or six others Oh you Job if my b y Simon was ere e d pitch ee out into the road so e would same as Black Jarge done quavered the Ancient P r aps Gaffer p r aps returned Job but I sez again I believe what Peter sez an I don t believe there never was no ghost at all Ay lad but I tell ee theer was I seed un cried the old man eagerly seed un wi these two eyes many s the time You Joel Amos you ve eerd un a moanin an a groanin you believe as I seed un don t ee now come He he chuckled Old Amos I don t know if I du Gaffer ye see you m gettin that old But I did I did oh you chaps I tell ee I did You m gettin old Gaffer repeated Amos dwelling upon the theme with great unction very very old But so strong as a bull I be added the Ancient trying manfully to steady the quaver in his voice Haw haw laughed Job and the others while Old Amos chuckled shrilly again But I tell ee I did see un I I see d un plain as plain quavered the Ancient in sudden distress Old Nick it were wi orns an a tail Why Peter told us twere only a Scottish man wi a bagpipe returned Job Ay for sure nodded Old Amos so e did A lie it be a lie a lie cried the Ancient twere Old Nick I see un plain as I see you Why ye see you m gettin dre fful old an elpless Gaffer chuckled Old Amos again an your eyes plays tricks wi you Ah to be sure they do added Job whereupon Old Amos chuckled so much that he was taken by a violent fit of coughing Oh you chaps you as I ve seen grow up from babbies aren t theer one o ye to tak the old man s word an believe as I seen un The cracked old voice sounded more broken than usual and I saw a tear crawling slowly down the Ancient s furrowed cheek Nobody answered and there fell a silence broken only by the shuffle and scrape of heavy boots and the setting down of tankards Why ye see Gaffer said Job at last theer s been a lot o talk o this ere ghost an some as even said as they eerd it but come to think on it nobody s never laid eyes on it but you so There you are wrong my fellow said I stepping into the room I also have seen it You exclaimed Job while half a dozen pairs of eyes stared at me in slow wonderment Certainly I have But you said as it were a Scotchman wi a bagpipe I heerd ye we all did And believed it like fools Peter cried the Ancient rising up out of his chair Peter do ee mean it To be sure I do Do ee mean it were a ghost Peter do ee Why of course it was I nodded a ghost or the devil himself hoof horns tail and all to say nothing of the fire and brimstone Peter said the Ancient straightening his bent old back proudly oh Peter tell em I m a man o truth an no liar tell em Peter They know that said I they know it without my telling them Ancient But said Job staring at me aghast do ee mean to say as you live in a place as is aunted by the devil isself Oh Lord bless ee cried the old man laying his hand upon my arm Peter don t mind Old Nick no more n I do Peter aren t afeard of im Cause why Cause e ave a clean eart ave Peter You don t mind Old Nick do ee lad Not in the least said I whereupon those nearest instinctively shrank farther from me while Old Amos rose and shuffled towards the door I ve heerd o folk sellin theirselves to the devil afore now said he You be a danged fule Joel Amos exclaimed the Ancient angrily Fule or no I never see a chap wi such a tur ble dark lookin face afore an wi such eyes so black an sharp an piercin as needles they be ah goes through a man like two gimblets they do Now as he spoke Old Amos stretched out one arm towards me with his first and second fingers crossed which fingers he now opened wide apart making what I believe is called the horns and an infallible safeguard against this particular form of evil It s the Evil Eye said he in a half whisper the Evil Eye and turning about betook himself away One by one the others followed and as they passed me each man averted his eyes and I saw that each had his fingers crossed So it came to pass that I was thenceforward regarded askance if not openly avoided by the whole village with the exception of Simon and the Ancient as one in league with the devil and possessed of the Evil Eye CHAPTER XXXI IN WHICH DONALD BIDS ME FAREWELL Halcyon days my masters happy care free halcyon days To waken to the glory of a summer s morning and shaking off dull sleep like a mantle to stride out into a world all green and gold breathing a fragrant air laden with sweet earthy smells To plunge within the clear cool waters of the brook whose magic seemed to fill one s blood with added life and lust of living Anon with Gargantuan appetite to sit and eat until even Donald would fall a marvelling and so through shady coppice and sunny meadow betimes to work Halcyon days my masters happy care free halcyon days with the ringing hammers the dancing sparks mounting upon the smoke the sweat the toil yet all lightened with laugh and song and good fellowship And then the labor done the fire dead Black George to his lonely cottage and I to The Bull there to sit between Simon and the Ancient waited upon by the dexterous hands of sweet eyed Prudence What mighty rounds of juicy beef washed down by draughts of good brown ale What pies and puddings prepared by those same slender dexterous hands And later pipe in mouth what grave discussions upon men and things peace and war the dead and the living the rise and fall of nations and Simon s new litter of pigs At last the Good nights being said homeward through the twilit lanes often pausing to look upon the shadowy woods to watch some star or hearken to the mournful note of a night jar soft with distance What wonder if at this time my earlier dreams and ambitions faded from my ken what wonder that Petronius Arbiter and the jolly Sieur de Brantome lay neglected in my dusty knapsack Go to Petronius go to How stale flat and unprofitable were all thy vaunted pleasures compared with mine Alas for thy noble intellect draggled in the mire to pander to an Imperial Swine and for all thy power and wise statecraft which yet could not save thee from untimely death And thou Brantome old gossip with all thy scandalous stories of ladies always and ever tres belle et fort honnete couldst not find time among them all to note the glories of the world wherein they lived and moved and had their fort honnete being But let it not be thought my leisure hours were passed in idle dreaming and luxurious ease on the contrary I had with much ado rethatched the broken roof of my cottage as well as I might mended the chimney fitted glass to the casements and a new door upon its hinges This last was somewhat clumsily contrived I grant you and of a vasty strength quite unnecessary yet a very excellent door I considered it nevertheless Having thus rendered my cottage weather proof I next turned my attention to furnishing it To which end I in turn and with infinite labor constructed a bedstead two elbow chairs and a table all to the profound disgust of Donald who could by no means abide the rasp of my saw so that reaching for his pipes he would fill the air with eldrich shrieks and groans or drown me in a torrent of martial melody It was about this time that is to say my second bedstead was nearing completion and I was seriously considering the building of a press with cupboards to hold my crockery also a shelf for my books when chancing to return home somewhat earlier than usual I was surprised to see Donald sitting upon the bench I had set up beside the door polishing the buckles of that identical pair of square toed shoes that had once so piqued my curiosity As I approached he rose and came to meet me with the brogues in his hand Man Peter said he I maun juist be gangin Going I repeated going where Back tae Glenure the year is a most up ye ken an I wadna hae ma brither Alan afore me wi the lassie forbye he s an unco braw an sonsy man ye ken an a lassie s mind is aye a kittle thing True I answered what little I know of woman would lead me to suppose so and yet Heaven knows I shall be sorry to lose you Donald Ay I ken that fine an ye ll be unco lonesome wi out me an the pipes I m thinkin Very Eh Peter man if it wasna for the lassie I d no hae the heart tae leave ye Ye ll no be forgettin the Wullie Wallace Lament Never said I Oh man Peter it s in my mind ye ll no hear sic pipin again forbye there s nae man Hielander nor Lowlander has juist the trick o the warblers like me an it s no vera like we shall e er meet again i this warld man Peter But I ll aye think o ye away there in Glenure when I play the Wullie Wallace bit tune I ll aye think o ye Peter man After this we stood awhile staring past each other into the deepening shadows Peter said he at last it s no a vera genteel present tae be makin ye I doot and he held up the battered shoes They re unco worn an wi a clout here an there ye ll notice but the buckles are guid siller an I hae naething else to gi e ye Ay man but it s many a weary mile I ve marched in these at the head o the Ninety Second an it s mony a stark fecht they ve been through Vittoria Salamanca Talavera tae Quatre Bras an Waterloo tak em Peter tak em tae mind ye sometimes o Donal Stuart An now gi e us a grup o ye hand Gude keep ye Peter man So saying he thrust the brogues upon me caught and squeezed my hand and turning sharp about strode away through the shadows his kilt swaying and tartans streaming gallantly And presently I went and sat me down upon the bench beside the door with the war worn shoes upon my knee Suddenly as I sat there faint and fainter with distance and unutterably sad came the slow sweet music of Donald s pipes playing the Wallace Lament Softly the melody rose and fell until it died away in one long drawn wailing note Now as it ended I rose and uncovered my head for I knew this was Donald s last farewell Much more I might have told of this strange yet lovable man who was by turns the scarred soldier full of stirring tales of camp and battlefield the mischievous child delighting in tricks and rogueries of all sorts and the stately Hieland gentleman Many wild legends he told me of his native glens with strange tales of the second sight but here perforce must be no place for such So here then I leave Donald and hurry on with my narrative CHAPTER XXXII IN WHICH THIS FIRST BOOK BEGINS TO DRAW TO A CLOSE Strike ding ding Strike ding ding The iron glows And loveth good blows As fire doth bellows Strike ding ding Out beyond the smithy door a solitary star twinkles low down in the night sky like some great jewel but we have no time for star gazing Black George and I for to night we are at work on the old church screen which must be finished to morrow And so the bellows roar hoarsely the hammers clang and the sparks fly while the sooty face of Black George now in shadow now illumed by the fire seems like the face of some Fire god or Salamander In the corner perched securely out of reach of stray sparks sits the Ancient snuff box in hand as usual To my mind a forge is at its best by night for in the red fiery glow the blackened walls the shining anvil and the smith himself bare armed and bare of chest are all magically transfigured while in the hush of night the drone of the bellows sounds more impressive the stroke of the hammers more sonorous and musical and the flying sparks mark plainly their individual courses ere they vanish I stand feet well apart and swing the great sledge to whose diapason George s hand hammer beats a tinkling melody coming in after each stroke with a ring and clash exact and true as is and has been the way of masters of the smithing craft all the world over from time immemorial George said I during a momentary lull leaning my hands upon the long hammer shaft you don t sing No No Peter And why not I think Peter But surely you can both think and sing George Not always Peter What s your trouble George No trouble Peter said he above the roar of the bellows Then sing George Ay Jarge sing nodded the Ancient tis a poor eart as never rejices an that s in the Scripters so sing Jarge George did not answer but with a turn of his mighty wrist drew the glowing iron from the fire And once more the sparks fly the air is full of the clink of hammers and the deep throated Song of the Anvil in which even the Ancient joins in a voice somewhat quavery and generally a note or two behind but with great gusto and goodwill notwithstanding Strike ding ding Strike ding ding in the middle of which I was aware of one entering to us and presently turning round espied Prudence with a great basket on her arm Hereupon hammers were thrown aside and we straightened our backs for in that basket was our supper Very fair and sweet Prudence looked lithe and vigorous and straight as a young poplar with her shining black hair curling into little tight rings about her ears and with great shy eyes and red red mouth Surely a man might seek very far ere he found such another maid as this brown cheeked black eyed village beauty Good evening mister Peter said she dropping me a curtesy with a grace that could not have been surpassed by any duchess in the land but as for poor George she did not even notice him neither did he raise his curly head nor glance toward her You come just when you are most needed Prudence said I relieving her of the heavy basket for here be two hungry men Three broke in the Ancient so ungry as a lion I be Three hungry men Prudence who have been hearkening for your step this half hour and more Quoth Prudence shyly For the sake of my basket Ay for sure croaked the Ancient so ravenous as a tiger I be No said I shaking my head basket or no basket you are equally welcome Prudence how say you George But George only mumbled in his beard The Ancient and I now set to work putting up an extemporized table but as for George he stood staring down moodily into the yet glowing embers of the forge Having put up the table I crossed to where Prudence was busy unpacking her basket Prudence said I are you still at odds with George Prudence nodded But said I he is such a splendid fellow His outburst the other day was quite natural under the circumstances surely you can forgive him Prudence There be more nor that betwixt us mister Peter sighed Prue Tis his drinkin six months ago he promised me never to touch another drop an he broke his word wi me But surely good ale in moderation will harm no man nay on the contrary But Jarge bean t like other men mister Peter No he is much bigger and stronger said I and I never saw a handsomer fellow Yes nodded the girl so strong as a giant an so weak as a little child Indeed Prudence said I leaning nearer to her in my earnestness I think you are a little unjust to him So far as I know him George is anything but weak minded or liable to be led into anything Hearing the Ancient chuckle gleefully I glanced up to find him nodding and winking to Black George who stood with folded arms and bent head watching us from beneath his brows and as his eyes met mine I thought they gleamed strangely in the firelight Come Prue said the Ancient bustling forward table s ready let s sit down an eat faintin an famishin away I be So we presently sat down all three of us while Prudence carved and supplied our wants as only Prudence could And after a while our hunger being appeased I took out my pipe as did the Ancient and George theirs likewise and together we filled them slowly and carefully as pipes should be filled while Prudence folded a long paper spill wherewith to light them the which she proceeded to do beginning at her grandfather s churchwarden Now while she was lighting mine Black George suddenly rose and crossing to the forge took thence a glowing coal with the tongs thus doing the office for himself All at once I saw Prue s hand was trembling and the spill was dropped or ever my tobacco was well alight then she turned swiftly away and began replacing the plates and knives and forks in her basket Be you m a goin Prue inquired the Ancient mumblingly for his pipe was in full blast Yes gran fer Then tell Simon as I ll be along in arf an hour or so will ee lass Yes gran fer Always with her back to us Then kiss ye old grandfeyther as loves ee an means for to see ee well bestowed an wed one o these fine days Prudence stooped and pressed her fresh red lips to his wrinkled old cheek and catching up her basket turned to the door yet not so quickly but that I had caught the gleam of tears beneath her lashes Black George half rose from his seat and stretched out his hand towards her burden then sat down again as with a hasty Good night she vanished through the yawning doorway And sitting there we listened to her quick light footstep cross the road to The Bull She ll make some man a fine wife some day exclaimed the Ancient blowing out a cloud of smoke ay she ll mak some man as fine a wife as ever was some day You speak my very thought Ancient said I she will indeed what do you think George But George s answer was to choke suddenly and thereafter to fall a coughing Smoke go t wrong way Jarge inquired the Ancient fixing him with his bright eye Ay nodded George Ha said the old man and we smoked for a time in silence So andsome as a picter she be said the Ancient suddenly She is fairer than any picture said I impulsively and what is better still her nature is as sweet and beautiful as her face Ow do ee know that said George turning sharply upon me My eyes and ears tell me so as yours surely must have done long ago I answered Ye do think as she be a purty lass then Peter inquired the Ancient I think said I that she is the prettiest lass I ever saw don t you think so George But again George s only answer was to choke Smoke again Jarge inquired the Ancient Ay said George as before Tis a fine thing to be young said the Ancient after a somewhat lengthy pause and with a wave of his long pipe stem a very fine thing It is said I though we generally realize it all too late As for George he went on smoking When you are young pursued the Ancient you eats well an enjys it you sleeps well an enjys it your legs is strong your arms is strong an you bean t afeard o nothin nor nobody Oh life s a very fine thing when you re young but youth s tur ble quick agoin the years roll slow at first but gets quicker n quicker till one day you wakes to find you m an old man an when you m old the way gets very ard an toilsome an lonely But there is always memory said I You m right theer Peter so theer be so theer be why I be a old old man wi more years than airs on my ead an yet it seems but yesterday as I were a holdin on to my mother s skirt an wonderin ow the moon got lighted Life be very short Peter an while we ave it tis well to get all the appiness out of it we can The wisest men of all ages preached the same said I only they all disagreed as to how happiness was to be gained More fules they said the Ancient Eh I exclaimed sitting up More fules they repeated the old man with a solemn nod Why then do you know how true happiness may be found To be sure I du Peter How By marriage Peter an ard work an they allus goes together Marriage said I Marriage as ever was Peter There I don t agree with you said I That retorted the Ancient stabbing at me with his pipe stem that s because you never was married Peter Marriage said I marriage brings care and great responsibility and trouble for one s self means trouble for others What o that exclaimed the Ancient Tis care and sponsibility as mak the man an if you marry a good wife she ll share the burden wi ye an ye ll find what seemed your troubles is a blessin arter all When sorrer comes tis a sweet thing oh a very sweet thing to ave a woman to comfort ye an old your and in the dark hour an theer s no sympathy so tender as a woman s Peter Then when ye be old like me an full o years tis a fine thing to ave a son o your own like Simon an a granddarter like my Prue tis worth aving lived for Peter ay well worth it It s a man s dooty to marry Peter is dooty to isself an the world Don t the Bible say summat about it not bein good for a man to live alone Every man as is a man should marry the sooner the better But said I to every happy marriage there are scores of miserable ones Cause why Peter Cause people is in too much o a hurry to marry as a rule If a man marries a lass arter knowin er a week ow is e goin to know if she ll suit im all is days Nohow Peter it aren t natral woman tak s a lot o knowin Marry in aste an repent in leisure That aren t in the Bible but it ought to be And your own marriage was a truly happy one Ancient Ah that it were Peter appy as ever was but then ye see there was a Providence in it I were a fine young chap in them days summat o your figure only bigger ah a sight bigger an I were sweet on several lassies an won t say as they wer n t sweet on me three on em most especially so One was a tall bouncin wench wi blue eyes an golden air like sunshine it were but it wer n t meant as I should buckle up wi er Why not Cause it so appened as she married summun else And the second The second were a fine pretty maid tu but I couldn t marry she Why Cause Peter she went an took an died afore I could ax er And the third you married No Peter though it come to the same thing in the end she married I Ye see though I were allus at er beck an call I could never pluck the courage to up an ax er right out So things went on for a year or so maybe till one day she were makin apple dumplings Peter Martin says she lookin at me sideways out of er black eyes just like Prue s they were Martin says she you m uncommon fond o apple dumplings For sure says I which I were Peter Martin says she shouldn t ee like to eat of em whenever you wanted to at your very own table in a cottage o your own Ah if you d mak em says I sharp like I would if you d ax me Martin says she An so we was married Peter an as you see theer was a Providence in it for if the first one adn t married some un else an the second adn t died I might ha married one o they an repented it all my days for I were young then an fulish Peter fulish So saying the Ancient rose sighing and knocked the ashes from his pipe Talkin bout Prue said he taking up his hat and removing his snuff box therefrom ere he set it upon his head talkin bout Prue he repeated with a pinch of snuff at his nostrils Well The word seemed shot out of George involuntarily Talkin bout Prue said the Ancient again glancing at each of us in turn theer was some folks as used to think she were sweet on Jarge theer but I bein er lawful gran feyther knowed different didn t I Jarge Ay nodded the smith Many s the time I ve said to you a sittin in this very corner Jarge I ve said mark my words Jarge if ever my Prue does marry some un which she will that there some un won t be you Them be my very words bean t they Jarge Your very words Gaffer nodded George Well then continued the old man ere s what I was a comin to Prue s been an fell in love wi some un at last Black George s pipe shivered to fragments on the floor and as he leaned forward I saw that his great hands were tightly clenched Gaffer said he in a strangled voice what do ee mean I means what I says Jarge How do ee know Bean t I the lass s gran feyther Be ye sure Gaffer quite sure Ay sartin sure twice this week an once the week afore she forgot to put any salt in the soup an that speaks wollums Jarge wollums Here having replaced his snuff box the Ancient put on his hat nodded and bobbled away As for Black George he sat there staring blindly before him long after the tapping of the Ancient s stick had died away nor did he heed me when I spoke wherefore I laid my hand upon his shoulder Come George said I another hour and the screen will be finished He started and drawing from my hand looked up at me very strangely No Peter he mumbled I aren t a goin to work no more tonight and as he spoke he rose to his feet What are you going said I as he crossed to the door Ay I m a goin Now as he went towards his cottage I saw him reel and stagger like a drunken man CHAPTER XXXIII IN WHICH WE DRAW YET NEARER TO THE END OF THIS FIRST BOOK It is not my intention to chronicle all those minor happenings that befell me now or afterward lest this history prove wearisome to the reader on the which head I begin to entertain grave doubts already Suffice it then that as the days grew into weeks and the weeks into months by perseverance I became reasonably expert at my trade so that some two months after my meeting with Black George I could shoe a horse with any smith in the country But more than this the people with whom I associated day by day honest loyal and simple hearted as they were contented with their lot and receiving all things so unquestioningly and thankfully filled my life and brought a great calm to a mind that had hitherto been somewhat self centred and troubled by pessimistic doubts and fantastic dreams culled from musty pages What book is there to compare with the great Book of Life whose pages are forever a turning wherein are marvels and wonders undreamed things to weep over and some few to laugh at if one but has eyes in one s head to see withal To walk through the whispering cornfields or the long green alleys of the hop gardens with Simon who combines innkeeping with farming to hear him tell of fruit and flower of bird and beast is better than to read the Georgics of Virgil To sit in the sunshine and watch the Ancient pipe in mouth to hearken to his animadversions upon Life and Death and Humanity is better than the cynical wit of Rochefoucauld or a page out of honest old Montaigne To see the proud poise of sweet Prue s averted head and the tender look in her eyes when George is near and the surge of the mighty chest and the tremble of the strong man s hand at the sound of her light footfall is more enthralling than any written romance old or new In regard to these latter I began at this time to contrive schemes and to plot plots for bringing them together to bridge over the difficulty which separated them for being happy I would fain see them happy also Now how I succeeded in this self imposed task the reader if he trouble to read far enough shall see for himself George said I on a certain Saturday morning as I washed the grime from my face and hands are you going to the Fair this afternoon No Peter I aren t But Prudence is going said I drying myself vigorously upon the towel And how inquired the smith bending in turn above the bucket in which we performed our ablutions and how might you know that Peter Because she told me so Told you so did she said George and immediately plunged his head into the bucket She did I answered And supposin said George coming up very red in the face and with the water streaming from his sodden curls supposin she is goin to the Fair what s that to me I don t care wheer she comes no nor wheer she goes neither and he shook the water from him as a dog might Are you quite sure George Ah sartin sure I ve been sure of it now ever since she called me Pooh nonsense man she didn t mean it women especially young ones often say things they do not mean at least so I am given to understand Ay but she did mean it said George frowning and nodding his head but it ain t that Peter no it aren t that it s the knowin as she spoke truth when she called me coward and despisin me for it in er heart that s wheer it is Peter Nevertheless I m sure she never meant it George Then let er come and tell me so I don t think she ll do that said I No more do I Peter Saying which he fell to work with the towel even as I had done George said I after a silence Well Peter Has it ever struck you that Prudence is an uncommonly handsome girl To be sure it as Peter I were blind else And that other men may see this too Well Peter And some one even tell her so His answer was a long time coming but come it did at last Well Peter And ask her to marry him George This time he was silent so long that I had tied my neckerchief and drawn on my coat ere he spoke very heavily and slowly and without looking at me Why then Peter let im I ve told ee afore I don t care wheer she comes nor wheer she goes she bean t nothin to me no more nor I to she If so be some man as a mind to ax er for isself all open an aboveboard I say again let im And now let s talk o summat else Willingly There s to be boxing and single stick and wrestling at the Fair I understand Ay And they tell me there is a famous wrestler coming all the way from Cornwall to wrestle the best man for ten guineas Ay so there be Well Well Peter They were talking about it at The Bull last night The Bull to be sure you was at The Bull last night well They were saying that you were a mighty wrestler George that you were the only man in these parts who could stand up to this Cornishman Ay I can wrastle a bit Peter he replied speaking in the same heavy listless manner what then Why then George get into your coat and let s be off Wheer to The Fair Black George shook his head What you won t No Peter And why not Because I aren t got the mind to because I aren t never goin to wrastle no more Peter so theer s an end on t Yet in the doorway I paused and looked back George Peter Won t you come for friendship s sake Black George picked up his coat looked at it and put it down again No Peter CHAPTER XXXIV WHICH DESCRIBES SUNDRY HAPPENINGS AT THE FAIR AND ENDS THIS FIRST BOOK I say young cove where are you a pushing of The speaker was a very tall individual whose sharp pointed elbow had more than once obtruded itself into my ribs He was extremely thin and bony with a long drooping nose set very much to one side and was possessed of a remarkable pair of eyes that is to say one eyelid hung continually lower than the other thus lending to his otherwise sinister face an air of droll and unexpected waggery that was quite startling to behold All about us were jostling throngs of men and women in snowy smock frocks and holiday gowns who pushed or were pushed laughed or frowned according to their several natures while above the merry hubbub rose the blare of trumpets the braying of horns and the crash and rattle of drums in a word I was in the middle of an English Country Fair Now then young cove repeated the man I have alluded to where are you a pushing of Don t do it again or mind your eye And saying this he glared balefully at me with one eye and leered jocosely with the other and into my ribs came his elbow again You seem to be able to do something in that way yourself I retorted Oh do I Yes said I suppose you take your elbow out of my waistcoat Elber repeated the man what d ye mean by elber This said I catching his arm in no very gentle grip If it s a fight you re wantin began the man It isn t said I Then leggo my arm Then keep your elbow to yourself Cod I never see such a hot headed cove Nor I a more bad tempered one This altercation had taken place as we swayed to and fro in the crowd from which we now slowly won free owing chiefly to the dexterous use of the man s bony elbows until we presently found ourselves in a veritable jungle of carts and wagons of all kinds and sorts where we stopped facing each other I m inclined to think young cove as you d be short tempered if you been shied at by your feller man from your youth up said the man What do you mean by shied at What I sez some perfessions is easy and some is ard like mine And what is yours I m a perfessional Sambo A what Well a Nigger head then blacks my face sticks my ead through a ole and lets em shy at me three shies a penny them as its me gets a cigar a big un them as don t don t Yours is a very unpleasant profession said I A man must live But said I supposing you get hit Them as its me gets a cigar Doesn t it hurt you Oh you gets used to it though to be sure they don t it me very often or it would be a loss cigars is expensive leastways they costs money But surely a wooden image would serve your turn just as well A wooden image exclaimed the man disgustedly James you must be a fool you must Who wants to throw at a wooden image you can t urt a wooden image can you if you throwed eavens ard at a wooden image that there wooden image wouldn t flinch would it When a man throws at anything e likes to it it that s uman and when e its it e likes to see it flinch that s uman too and when it flinches why e rubs is ands and takes another shot and that s the umanest of all So you see young cove you re a fool with your wooden image Now as he ended I stooped very suddenly and caught hold of his wrist and then I saw that he held my purse in his hand It was a large hand with bony knuckles and very long fingers upon one of which was a battered ring He attempted at first to free himself of my grip but finding this useless stood glowering at me with one eye and leering with the other Ha said I Hallo said he A purse said I Why so it is he nodded leastways it looks uncommonly like one don t it What s more it looks like mine Does it I could swear to it anywhere Could you I could Then p r aps you d better take it young cove and very welcome I m sure So you ve been picking my pocket said I Never picked a pocket in my life should scorn to I put away my recovered property and straightway shifted my grip to the fellow s collar Now said I come on Why what are you a doing of What does one generally do with a pickpocket But I had hardly uttered the words when with a sudden cunning twist he broke my hold and my foot catching in a guy rope I tripped and fell heavily and ere I could rise he had made good his escape I got to my feet somewhat shaken by the fall yet congratulating myself on the recovery of my purse and threading my way among the tents was soon back among the crowd Here were circuses and shows of all kinds where one might behold divers strange beasts the usual Fat Women and Skeleton Men who ever heard of the order being reversed and before the shows were fellows variously attired but each being purplish of visage and each possessing the lungs of a Stentor more especially one a round bellied bottle nosed fellow in a white hat who alternately roared and beat upon a drum a red haired man he was with a fiery eye which eye chancing to single me out in the crowd fixed itself pertinaciously upon me thenceforth so that he seemed to address himself exclusively to me thus O my stars young man Bang goes the drum The wonderful wild airy and savage man from Bonhoola as eats snakes alive and dresses hisself in sheeny serpents O my eye step up young man Bang Likewise the ass tonishin and beautiful Lady Paulinolotti as will swaller swords sabres bay nets also chewin up glass and bottles quicker than you can wink young man Bang Not to mention Catamaplasus the Fire Fiend what burns hisself with red hot irons and likes it drinks liquid fire with gusto playfully spittin forth the same together with flame and sulphurous smoke and all for sixpence young man Bang O my stars step up young man and all for a tanner Bang Presently his eye being off me for the moment I edged my way out of the throng and so came to where a man stood mounted upon a cart Beside him was a fellow in a clown s habit who blew loudly three times upon a trumpet which done the man took off his hat and began to harangue the crowd something in this wise I come before you ladies and gentlemen not for vulgar gain or as I might say kudos which is Eyetalian for the same not to put my hands into your pockets and rifle em of your honestly earned money no I come before you for the good of each one of you for the easing of suffering mankind as I might say the ha melioration of stricken humanity In a word I am here to introduce to you what I call my Elixir Anthropos Anthropos ladies and gentlemen is an old and very ancient Egyptian word meaning man or woman for that matter et cetera During this exordium I had noticed a venerable man in a fine blue surtout and a wide brimmed hat who sat upon the shaft of a cart and puffed slowly at a great pipe And as he puffed he listened intently to the quack salver s address and from time to time his eyes would twinkle and his lips curve in an ironic smile The cart upon the shaft of which he sat stood close to a very small dirty and disreputable looking tent towards which the old gentleman s back was turned Now as I watched I saw the point of a knife gleam through the dirty canvas which vanishing gave place to a hand protruded through the slit thus made a very large hand with bony knuckles and long fingers upon one of which was a battered ring For an instant the hand hovered undecidedly then darted forward the long skirts of the old gentleman s coat hardly stirred yet even as I watched I saw the hand vanish with a fat purse in its clutches Skirting the tent I came round to the opening and stooping peered cautiously inside There sure enough was my pickpocket gazing intently into the open purse and chuckling as he gazed Then he slipped it into his pocket and out he came where I immediately pinned him by the neckerchief And after a while finding he could not again break my hold he lay still beneath me panting and as he lay his one eye glared more balefully and his other leered more waggishly than ever as I thrusting my hand into his pocket took thence the purse and transferred it to my own Halves mate he panted halves and we ll cry quits By no means said I rising to my feet but keeping my grip upon him Then what s your game I intend to hand you over as a pickpocket That means Transportation said he wiping the blood from his face for the struggle though short had been sharp enough Well said I It ll go ard with the babby Baby I exclaimed Ah or the hinfant if you like it better one as I found in a shawl a laying on the steps o my van one night sleeping like a alderman and it were snowing too Yet you are a thief We calls it faking And ought to be given up to the authorities And who s to look arter the babby Are you married No Where is the baby In my van And where is that Yonder and he pointed to a gayly painted caravan that stood near by e s asleep now but if you d like to take a peep at im I should said I Whereupon the fellow led me to his van and following him up the steps I entered a place which though confined was wonderfully neat and clean with curtains at the open windows a rug upon the floor and an ornamental brass lamp pendent from the roof At the far end was a bed or rather berth curtained with chintz and upon this bed his chubby face pillowed upon a dimpled fist lay a very small man indeed And looking up from him to the very large bony man bending over him I surprised a look upon the hardened face a tenderness that seemed very much out of place Nice and fat ain t e said the man touching the baby s applelike cheek with a grimy finger Yes Ah and so e should be James But you should see im eat a alderman s nothing to Lewis I calls im Lewis for twere at Lewisham I found im on a Christmas Eve snowing it was but by James it didn t bother im not a bit And why did you keep him there was the parish Parish repeated the man bitterly I were brought up by the parish myself and a nice job they made o me Don t you find him a great trouble Trouble exclaimed the man Lewis ain t no trouble not a bit never was and he s great company when I m on the move from one town to another larning to talk a ready Now said I when we had descended from the van I propose to return this purse to the owner if he is to be found if not I shall hand it to the proper authorities Walker exclaimed the man You shall yourself witness the restitution said I unheeding his remark after which Well said he glancing back toward his caravan and moistening his lips as I tightened my grip upon his arm what about me You can go for Lewis s sake if you will give me your word to live honestly henceforth You have it sir I swear it on the Bible if you like Then let us seek the owner of this purse So coming in a while to where the quack doctor was still holding forth there yet seated upon the shaft of the cart puffing at his great pipe was the venerable man At sight of him the pickpocket stopped and caught my arm Come master said he come you never mean to give up all that good money there s fifty guineas and more in that purse All the more reason to return it said I No don t don t go a wasting good money like that it s like throwing it away But shaking off the fellow s importunate hand I approached and saluted the venerable man Sir said I you have had your pocket picked He turned and regarded me with a pair of deep set very bright eyes and blew a whiff of smoke slowly into the air Sir he replied I found that out five minutes ago The fact seems to trouble you very little said I There sir being young and judging exteriorly you are wrong There is recounted somewhere in the classics an altogether incredible story of a Spartan youth and a fox the boy with the animal hid beneath his cloak preserved an unruffled demeanor despite the animal s tearing teeth until he fell down and died In the same way young sir no man can lose fifty odd guineas from his pocket and remain unaffected by the loss Then sir said I I am happy to be able to return your purse to you He took it opened it glanced over its contents looked at me took out two guineas looked at me again put the money back closed the purse and dropping it into his pocket bowed his acknowledgment Having done which he made room for me to sit beside him Sir said he chuckling hark to that lovely rascal in the cart yonder hark to him Galen was an ass and Hippocrates a dunce beside this fellow hark to him There s nothing like pills the Quack salver was saying at the top of his voice place one upon the tip o the tongue in this fashion take a drink o water beer or wine as the case may be give a couple o swallers and there you are Oh there s nothing in the world like pills and there s nothing like my Elixir Anthropos for coughs colds and the rheumatics for sore throats sore eyes sore backs good for the croup measles and chicken pox a certain cure for dropsy scurvy and the king s evil there s no disease or ailment discovered or invented as my pills won t soothe heal ha meliorate and charm away and all I charge is one shilling a box Hand em round Jonas Whereupon the fellow in the clown s dress stepping down from the cart began handing out the boxes of pills and taking in the shillings as fast as he conveniently could A thriving trade said my venerable companion it always has been and always will for Humanity is a many headed fool and loves to be bamboozled These honest folk are probably paying for bread pellets compounded with a little soap yet will go home swallow them in all good faith and think themselves a great deal better for them And therefore said I probably derive as much benefit from them as from any drug yet discovered Young man said my companion giving me a sharp glance what do you mean Plainly sir that a man who believes himself cured of a disease is surely on the high road to recovery But a belief in the efficacy of that rascal s bread pellets cannot make them anything but bread pellets No said I but it may effect great things with the disease Young man don t tell me that you are a believer in Faith Healing and such like tomfoolery disease is a great and terrible reality and must be met and overcome by a real means On the contrary sir may it not be rather the outcome of a preconceived idea of a belief that has been held universally for many ages and generations of men I do not deny disease who could but suffering and disease have been looked upon from the earliest days as punishments wrought out upon a man for his sins Now may not the haunting fear of this retributive justice be greatly responsible for suffering and disease of all kinds since the mind unquestionably reacts upon the body Probably sir probably but since disease is with us how would you propose to remedy it By disbelieving in it by regarding it as something abnormal and utterly foreign to the divine order of things Pooh exclaimed my venerable companion Bah quite quite impracticable They say the same of The Sermon on the Mount sir I retorted Can a man wasting away in a decline discredit the fact that he is dying with every breath he draws Had you or I or any man the Christ power to teach him a disbelief in his sickness then would he be hale and well The Great Physician healed all diseases thus without the aid of drugs seeking only to implant in the mind of each sufferer the knowledge that he was whole and sound that is to say a total disbelief in his malady How many times do we read the words Thy faith hath made thee whole All He demanded of them was faith or as I say a disbelief in their disease Then the cures of Christ were not miracles No more so than any great and noble work is a miracle And do you inquired my companion removing his pipe from his lips and staring at me very hard do you believe that Jesus Christ was the Son of God Yes said I in the same way that you and I are and the Quack salver yonder But was He divine Surely a mighty thinker a great teacher whose hand points the higher way whose words inspire Humanity to nobler ends and aims is of necessity divine You are a very bold young man and talk I think a little wildly Heterodoxy has been styled so before sir And a very young young man That sir will be amended by time Here puffing at his pipe and finding it gone out he looked at me in surprise Remarkable said he What is sir While I listened to you I have actually let my pipe go out a thing which rarely happens with me As he spoke he thrust one hand into his pocket when he glance slowly all round and back once more to me Remarkable said he again What now sir My purse has gone again What gone I ejaculated Vanished said he and to prove his words turned inside out first one pocket and then the other Come with me said I springing up there is yet a chance that we may possibly recover it Forthwith I led him to where had stood a certain gayly painted caravan but it was gone vanished as utterly as my companion s purse Most annoying said he shaking his venerable head really most exasperating I particularly wished to secure a sample of that fellow s pills the collection of quack remedies is a fad of mine as it is My purse is entirely at your disposal sir said I though to be sure a very But there I stopped staring in my turn blankly at him Ha he exclaimed his eyes twinkling Yes I nodded the rascal made off with my purse also we are companions in misfortune Then as such young sir come and dine with me my habitation is but a little way off Thank you sir but I am half expecting to meet with certain good friends of mine though I am none the less honored by your offer So be it young sir then permit me to wish you a very Good day and touching the brim of his hat with the long stem of his pipe the Venerable Man turned and left me Howbeit though I looked diligently on all hands I saw nothing of Simon or the Ancient thus evening was falling as bending my steps homeward I came to a part of the Fair where drinking booths had been set up and where they were preparing to roast an ox whole as is the immemorial custom Drinking was going on with its usual accompaniment of boisterous merriment and rough horseplay the vulgarity of which ever annoys me Two or three times I was rudely jostled as I made my way along so that my temper was already something the worse when turning aside to avoid all this I came full upon two fellows well to do farmers by their look who held a struggling girl between them to each of whom I reached out a hand and gripping them firmly by their collars brought their two heads together with a sounding crack and then I saw that the girl was Prudence Next moment we were running hand in hand with the two fellows roaring in pursuit But Prudence was wonderfully fleet and light of foot wherefore doubling and turning among carts tents and booths we had soon outstripped our pursuers and rid ourselves of them altogether In spite of which Prudence still ran on till catching her foot in some obstacle she tripped and would have fallen but for my arm And looking down into her flushed face glowing through the sweet disorder of her glossy curls I could not but think how lovely she was But as I watched the color fled from her cheeks her eyes dilated and she started away from me Now turning hastily I saw that we were standing close by a certain small dirty and disreputable looking tent the canvas of which had been slit with a knife and my movement had been quick enough to enable me to see a face vanish through the canvas And fleeting though the glimpse had been yet in the lowering brow the baleful glare of the eye and the set of the great jaw I had seen Death And after we had walked on a while together looking at Prue I noticed that she trembled Oh mister Peter she whispered glancing back over her shoulder did ye see Yes Prudence I saw And speaking I also glanced back towards the villainous little tent and though the face appeared no more I was aware nevertheless of a sudden misgiving that was almost like a foreboding of evil to come for in those features disfigured though they were with black rage and passion I had recognized the face of Black George A WORD TO THE READER Remembering the very excellent advice of my friend the Tinker as to the writing of a good nov el I am perturbed and not a little discouraged upon looking over these pages to find that I have as yet described no desperate hand to hand encounters no hairbreadth escapes unless a bullet through one s hat may be justly so regarded and above all not one word of LOVE You sir who have expectantly borne with me thus far may be tempted to close the book in a huff and hurling it from you with a deep voiced anathema clap on your hat and sally forth into the sunshine Or you madam breathing a sigh o er hopes deferred may take up needle and silk and turn you once again to that embroidery which has engaged your dainty fingers this twelvemonth and more yet which like Penelope s web would seem no nearer completion Ah well sir exercise especially walking is highly beneficial to the liver they tell me and nothing madam believe me unless it be playing the harp can show off a pretty hand or the delicate curves of a shapely wrist and arm to such advantage as that selfsame embroidery But since needlework like books and all sublunary things is apt to grow monotonous you may perchance for lack of better occupation be driven to address yourself once more to this my Narrative And since you sir no matter how far you walk must of necessity return to your chair and chimney corner it is possible that having dined adequately and lighted your pipe and being therefore in a more charitable and temperate frame of mind you may lift my volume from the dusty corner where it has lain all this while and though probably with sundry grunts and snorts indicative that the thing is done under protest as it were reopen these pages In the which hope dear madam and you noble sir I here commence this my Second Book which as you see is headed thus THE WOMAN BOOK TWO THE WOMAN CHAPTER I OF STORM AND TEMPEST AND OF THE COMING OF CHARMIAN I was at sea in an open boat Out of the pitch black heaven there rushed a mighty wind and the pitch black seas above me rose high and ever higher flecked with hissing white wherefore I cast me face downwards in my little boat that I might not behold the horror of the waters and above their ceaseless surging thunder there rose a long drawn cry Charmian I stood upon a desolate moor and the pitiless rain lashed me and the fierce wind buffeted me and out of the gloom where frowning earth and heaven met there rose a long drawn cry Charmian I started up in bed broad awake and listening yet the tumult was all about me still the hiss and beat of rain and the sound of a rushing mighty wind a wind that seemed to fill the earth a wind that screamed about me that howled above me and filled the woods near and far with a deep booming pierced now and then by the splintering crash of snapping bough or falling tree And yet somewhere in this frightful pandemonium of sound blended in with it yet not of it it seemed to me that the cry still faintly echoed Charmian So appalling was all this to my newly awakened senses that I remained for a time staring into the darkness as one dazed Presently however I rose and donning some clothes mended the fire which still smouldered upon the hearth and having filled and lighted my pipe sat down to listen to the awful voices of the storm What brain could conceive what pen describe that elemental chorus like the mighty voice of persecuted Humanity past and present crying the woes and ills the sorrows and torments endured of all the ages To night surely the souls of the unnumbered dead rode within the storm and this was the voice of their lamentation From the red mire of battlefields are they come from the flame and ravishment of fair cities from dim and reeking dungeons from the rack the stake and the gibbet to pierce the heavens once more with the voice of their agony Since the world was made how many have lived and suffered and died unlettered and unsung snatched by a tyrant s whim from life to death in the glory of the sun in the gloom of night in blood and flame and torment Indeed their name is Legion But there is a great and awful Book whose leaves are countless yet every leaf of which is smirched with blood and fouled with nameless sins a record howsoever brief and inadequate of human suffering wherein as through a glass darkly we may behold horrors unimagined where Murder stalks and rampant Lust where Treachery creeps with curving back smiling mouth and sudden deadly hand where Tyranny fierce eyed and iron lipped grinds the nations beneath a bloody heel Truly man hath no enemy like man And Christ is there and Socrates and Savonarola and there too is a cross of agony a bowl of hemlock and a consuming fire Oh noble martyrs by whose blood and agony the world is become a purer and better place for us and those who shall come after us Oh glorious innumerable host thy poor maimed bodies were dust ages since but thy souls live on in paradise and thy memory abides and shall abide in the earth forever Ye purblind ye pessimists existing with no hope of a resurrection bethink you of these matters go open the great and awful Book and read and behold these things for yourselves for what student of history is there but must be persuaded of man s immortality that though this poor flesh be mangled torn asunder burned to ashes yet the soul rising beyond the tyrant s reach soars triumphant above death and this sorry world to the refuge of the everlasting arms for God is a just God Now in a while becoming conscious that my pipe was smoked out and cold I reached up my hand to my tobacco box upon the mantelshelf Yet I did not reach it down for even as my fingers closed upon it above the wailing of the storm above the hiss and patter of driven rain there rose a long drawn cry Charmian So remembering the voice I had seemed to hear calling in my dream I sat there with my hand stretched up to my tobacco box and my face screwed round to the casement behind me that as I watched shook and rattled beneath each wind gust as if some hand strove to pluck it open How long I remained thus with my hand stretched up to my tobacco box and my eyes upon this window I am unable to say but all at once the door of the cottage burst open with a crash and immediately the quiet room was full of rioting wind and tempest such a wind as stopped my breath and sent up a swirl of smoke and sparks from the fire And borne upon this wind like some spirit of the storm was a woman with flying draperies and long streaming hair who turned and with knee and shoulder forced to the door and so leaned there panting Tall she was and nobly shaped for her wet gown clung disclosing the sinuous lines of her waist and the bold full curves of hip and thigh Her dress too had been wrenched and torn at the neck and through the shadow of her fallen hair I caught the ivory gleam of her shoulder and the heave and tumult of her bosom Here I reached down my tobacco box and mechanically began to fill my pipe watching her the while Suddenly she started and seemed to listen Then with a swift stealthy movement she slipped from before the door and I noticed that she hid one hand behind her Charmian The woman crouched back against the wall with her eyes towards the door and always her right hand was hidden in the folds of her petticoat So we remained she watching the door and I her Charmian The voice was very near now and almost immediately after there came a loud view hallo and a heavy fist pounded upon the door Oh Charmian you re there yes yes inside I know you are I swore you should never escape me and you sha n t by God A hand fumbled upon the latch the door swung open and a man entered As he did so I leapt forward and caught the woman s wrist There was a blinding flash a loud report and a bullet buried itself somewhere in the rafters overhead With a strange repressed cry she turned upon me so fiercely that I fell back before her The newcomer meantime had closed the door latching it very carefully and now standing before it folded his arms staring at her with bent head He was a very tall man with a rain sodden bell crowned hat crushed low upon his brows and wrapped in a long many caged overcoat the skirts of which were woefully mired and torn All at once he laughed very softly and musically So you would have killed me would you Charmian shot me like a dog His tone was soft as his laugh and equally musical and yet neither was good to hear So you thought you had lost me did you when you gave me the slip a while ago Lose me Escape me Why I tell you I would search for you day and night hunt the world over until I found you Charmian until I found you said he nodding his head and speaking almost in a whisper I would by God The woman neither moved nor uttered a word only her breath came thick and fast and her eyes gleamed in the shadow of her hair They stood facing each other like two adversaries each measuring the other s strength without appearing to be conscious of my presence indeed the man had not so much as looked toward me even when I had struck up the pistol Now with every minute I was becoming more curious to see this man s face hidden as it was in the shadow of his dripping hat brim Yet the fire had burned low You always were a spitfire weren t you Charmian he went on in the same gentle voice hot and fierce and proud the flame beneath the ice I knew that and loved you the better for it and so I determined to win you Charmian to win you whether you would or no And you are so strong so tall and glorious and strong Charmian His voice had sunk to a murmur again and he drew a slow step nearer to her How wonderful you are Charmian I always loved your shoulders and that round white throat Loved Worshipped them worshipped them And to night He paused and I felt rather than saw that he was smiling And to night you would have killed me Charmian shot me like a dog But I would not have it different You have flouted coquetted scorned and mocked me for three years Charmian and to night you would have killed me and I would not have it otherwise for surely you can see that this of itself must make your final surrender even sweeter With a gesture utterly at variance with his voice so sudden fierce and passionate was it he sprang toward her with outstretched arms But quick as he she eluded him and before he could reach her I stepped between them Sir said I a word with you Out of my way bumpkin he retorted and brushing one aside made after her I caught him by the skirts of his long loose coat but with a dexterous twist he had left it in my grasp Yet the check momentary though it was enabled her to slip through the door of that room which had once been Donald s and before he could reach it I stood upon the threshold He regarded me for a moment beneath his hat brim and seemed undecided how to act My good fellow said he at last I will buy your cottage of you for to night name your price I shook my head Hereupon he drew a thick purse from his pocket and tossed it chinking to my feet There are two hundred guineas bumpkin maybe more pick them up and go and turning he flung open the door Obediently I stooped and taking up the purse rolled it in the coat which I still held and tossed both out of the cottage Sir said I be so very obliging as to follow your property Ah he murmured very pretty on my soul And in that same moment his knuckles caught me fairly between the eyes and he was upon me swift and fierce and lithe as a panther I remember the glint of his eyes and the flash of his bared teeth now to one side of me now to the other as we swayed to and fro overturning the chairs and crashing into unseen obstacles In that dim and narrow place small chance was there for feint or parry it was blind brutal work fierce and grim and silent Once he staggered and fell heavily carrying the table crashing with him and I saw him wipe blood from his face as he rose and once I was beaten to my knees but was up before he could reach me again though the fire upon the hearth spun giddily round and round and the floor heaved oddly beneath my feet Then suddenly hands were upon my throat and I could feel the hot pant of his breath in my face breath that hissed and whistled between clenched teeth Desperately I strove to break his hold to tear his hands asunder and could not only the fingers tightened and tightened Up and down the room we staggered grim and voiceless out through the open door out into the whirling blackness of the storm And there amid the tempest lashed by driving rain and deafened by the roaring rush of wind we fought as our savage forefathers may have done breast to breast and knee to knee stubborn and wild and merciless the old old struggle for supremacy and life I beat him with my fists but his head was down between his arms I tore at his wrists but he gripped my throat the tighter and now we were down rolling upon the sodden grass and now we were up stumbling and slipping but ever the gripping fingers sank the deeper choking the strength and life out of me My eyes stared up into a heaven streaked with blood and fire there was the taste of sulphur in my mouth my arms grew weak and nerveless and the roar of wind seemed a thousand times more loud Then something clutched and dragged us by the feet we tottered swayed helplessly and plunged down together But as we fell the deadly gripping fingers slackened for a moment and in that moment I had broken free and rolling clear stumbled up to my feet Yet even then I was sill encumbered and stooping down found the skirts of the overcoat twisted tightly about my foot and ankle Now as I loosed it I inwardly blessed that tattered garment for it seemed that to it I owed my life So I stood panting and waited for the end I remember a blind groping in the dark a wild hurly burly of random blows a sudden sharp pain in my right hand a groan and I was standing with the swish of the rain about me and the moaning of the wind in the woods beyond How long I remained thus I cannot tell for I was as one in a dream but the cool rain upon my face refreshed me and the strong clean wind in my nostrils was wonderfully grateful Presently raising my arm stiffly I brushed the wet hair from my eyes and stared round me into the pitchy darkness in quest of my opponent Where are you said I at last and this was the first word uttered during the struggle where are you Receiving no answer I advanced cautiously for it was as I have said black dark and so presently touched something yielding with my foot Come get up said I stooping to lay a hand upon him get up I say But he never moved he was lying upon his face and as I raised his head my fingers encountered a smooth round stone buried in the grass and the touch of that stone thrilled me from head to foot with sudden dread Hastily I tore open waistcoat and shirt and pressed nay hand above his heart In that one moment I lived an age of harrowing suspense then breathed a sigh of relief and rising took him beneath the arms and began to half drag half carry him towards the cottage I had proceeded thus but some dozen yards or so when during a momentary lull in the storm I thought I heard a faint Hallo and looking about saw a twinkling light that hovered to and fro coming and going yet growing brighter each moment Setting down my burden therefore I hollowed my hands about my mouth and shouted This way I called this way Be that you sir cried a man s voice at no great distance This way I called again this way The words seemed to reassure the fellow for the light advanced once more and as he came up I made him out to be a postilion by his dress and the light he carried was the lanthorn of a chaise Why sir he began looking me up and down by the light of his lanthorn strike me lucky if I d ha knowed ye you looks as if oh Lord What is it said I wiping the rain from my eyes again The Postilion s answer was to lower his lanthorn towards the face of him who lay on the ground between us and point Now looking where he pointed I started suddenly backwards and shivered with a strange stirring of the flesh For I saw a pale face with a streak of blood upon the cheek there was blood upon my own a face framed in lank hair thick and black as was my own a pale aquiline face with a prominent nose and long cleft chin even as my own So as I stood looking down upon this face my breath caught and my flesh crept for indeed I might have been looking into a mirror the face was the face of myself CHAPTER II THE POSTILION Good Lord exclaimed the Postilion and fell back a step Well said I meeting his astonished look as carelessly as I might Lord love me said the Postilion What now I inquired I never see such a thing as this ere said he alternately glancing from me down to the outstretched figure at my feet if it s bewitchments or only enchantments I don t like it strike me pink if I do What do you mean Eyes continued the Postilion slowly and heavily and with his glance wandering still eyes same nose identical mouth when not bloody same hair same figure same no I don t like it it s onnat ral tha s what it is Come come I broke in somewhat testily don t stand there staring like a fool you see this gentleman is hurt Onnat ral s the word went on the Postilion more as though speaking his thoughts aloud than addressing me it s a onnat ral night to begin with seed a many bad uns in my time but nothing to ekal this ere that I lost my way aren t to be wondered at then him and her a jumping out o the chaise and a running off into the thick o the storm that s onnat ral in the second place and then his face and your face that s the most onnat rallest part of it all likewise I never see one man in two suits o clothes afore nor yet a standing up and a laying down both at the same i dentical minute onnat ral s the word and I m a going Stop said I as he began to move away Not on no account Then I must make you said I and doubled my fists The Postilion eyed me over from head to foot and paused irresolute What might you be wanting with a peaceable civil spoke cove like me he inquired Where is your chaise Up in the lane som eres over yonder answered he with a vague jerk of his thumb over his shoulder Then if you will take this gentleman s heels we can carry him well enough between us it s no great distance Easy said the Postilion backing away again easy now what might be the matter with him if I might make so bold ain t dead is he Dead no fool I rejoined angrily Voice like his too muttered the Postilion backing away still farther yes onnat ral s the word strike me dumb if it ain t Come will you do as I ask or must I make you Why I ain t got no objection to taking the gent s eels if that s all you ask though mind ye if ever I see such damned onnat ralness as this ere in all my days why drownd me So after some delay I found the overcoat and purse which latter I thrust into the pocket ere wrapping the garment about him and lifting my still unconscious antagonist between us we started for the lane which we eventually reached with no little labor and difficulty Here more by good fortune than anything else we presently stumbled upon a chaise and horses drawn up in the gloom of sheltering trees in which we deposited our limp burden as comfortably as might be and where I made some shift to tie up the gash in his brow It would be a fine thing said the Postilion moodily as I at length closed the chaise door it would be a nice thing if e was to go a dying By the looks of him said I he will be swearing your head off in the next ten minutes or so Without another word the Postilion set the lanthorn back in its socket and swung himself into the saddle Your best course would be to make for Tonbridge bearing to the right when you strike the high road The Postilion nodded and gathering up the reins turned to stare at me once more while I stood in the gleam of the lanthorn Well I inquired Eyes said he rubbing his chin very hard as one at a loss eyes i dentical nose same mouth when not bloody same air same everything same Lord love me Pembry would be nearer said I and the sooner he is between the sheets the better Ah exclaimed the Postilion with a slow nod and drawing out the word unduly and talking o sheets and beds what about my second passenger I started wi two and ere s only one what about Number Two what about er Her I repeated Er as was with im Number One er what was a quarrelling wi Number One all the way from London er as run away from Number One into the wood yonder what about Number Two er Why to be sure I had forgotten her Forgotten repeated the Postilion Oh Lord yes and leaning over he winked one eye very deliberately forgotten er ah to be sure of course and he winked again What do you mean I demanded nettled by the fellow s manner Mean said he I means as of all the damned onnat ralness as come on a honest well meaning civil spoke cove why I m that there cove so elp me Saying which he cracked his whip the horses plunged forward and almost immediately as it seemed horses chaise and Postilion had lurched into the black murk of the night and vanished CHAPTER III WHICH BEARS AMPLE TESTIMONY TO THE STRENGTH OF THE GENTLEMAN S FISTS Considering all that had befallen during the last half hour or so it was not very surprising I think that I should have forgotten the very existence of this woman Charmian even though she had been chiefly instrumental in bringing it all about and to have her recalled to my recollection thus suddenly and moreover the possibility that I must meet with and talk to her perturbed me greatly and I remained for some time quite oblivious to wind and rain all engrossed by the thought of this woman A dark fierce Amazonian creature I told myself who had abhorrent thought already attempted one man s life to night furthermore a tall woman and strong therefore unmaidenly with eyes that gleamed wild in the shadow of her hair And yet my dismay arose not so much from any of these as from the fact that she was a woman and consequently beyond my ken Hitherto I had regarded the sex very much from a distance and a little askance as creatures naturally illogical and given to unreasoning impulse delicate ethereal beings whose lives were made up of petty trifles and vanities who were sent into this gross world to be admired petted occasionally worshipped and frequently married Indeed my education in this direction had been shockingly neglected thus far not so much from lack of inclination for who can deny the fascination of the Sex as for lack of time and opportunity for when as a young gentleman of means and great expectations I should have been writing sonnets to the eyebrow of some ladye fayre or surreptitiously wooing some farmer s daughter in common with my kind I was hearkening to the plaint of some Greek or Roman lover or chuckling over old Brantome Thus women were to me practically an unknown quantity as yet and hence it was with no little trepidation that I now started out for the cottage and this truly Amazonian Charmian unless she had disappeared as suddenly as she had come which I found myself devoutly hoping As I went I became conscious that I was bleeding copiously above the brow that my throat was much swollen and that the thumb of my right hand pained exceedingly at the least touch added to which was a dizziness of the head and a general soreness of body that testified to the strength of my opponent s fists On I stumbled my head bent low against the stinging rain and with uncertain clumsy feet for reaction had come and with it a deadly faintness Twigs swung out of the darkness to lash at and catch me as I passed invisible trees creaked and groaned above and around me and once as I paused to make more certain of my direction a dim vague mass plunged down athwart my path with a rending crash On I went wearily enough and with the faintness growing upon me a sickness that would not be fought down guiding my course by touch rather than sight until finding myself at fault I stopped again staring about me beneath my hand Yet feeling the faintness increase with inaction I started forward groping before me as I went I had gone but a few paces however when I tripped over some obstacle and fell heavily It wanted but this to complete my misery and I lay where I was overcome by a deadly nausea Now presently as I lay thus spent and sick I became aware of a soft glow a brightness that seemingly played all around me wherefore lifting my heavy head I beheld a ray of light that pierced the gloom a long gleaming vista jewelled by falling raindrops whose brilliance was blurred now and then by the flitting shapes of wind tossed branches At sight of this my strength revived and rising I staggered on towards this welcome light and thus I saw that it streamed from the window of my cottage Even then it seemed I journeyed miles before I felt the latch beneath my fingers and fumbling opened the door stumbled in and closed it after me For a space I stood dazed by the sudden light and then little by little noticed that the table and chairs had been righted that the fire had been mended and that candles burned brightly upon the mantel All this I saw but dimly for there was a mist before my eyes yet I was conscious that the girl had leapt up on my entrance and now stood fronting me across the table You said she in a low repressed voice you Now as she spoke I saw the glitter of steel in her hand Keep back she said in the same subdued tone keep back I warn you But I only leaned there against the door even as she had done indeed I doubt if I could have moved just then had I tried And as I stood thus hanging my head and not answering her she stamped her foot suddenly and laughed a short fierce laugh So he has hurt you she cried you are all blood it is running down your face the Country Bumpkin has hurt you Oh I am glad glad glad and she laughed again I might have run away she went on mockingly but you see I was prepared for you and she held up the knife prepared for you and now you are pale and hurt and faint yes you are faint the Country Bumpkin has done his work well I shall not need this after all see And she flung the knife upon the table Yes it is better there said I and I think madam is mistaken Mistaken she cried with a sudden catch in her voice what what do you mean That I am the Bumpkin said I Now as I spoke a black mist enveloped all things my knees loosened suddenly and stumbling forward I sank into a chair I am very tired I sighed and so as it seemed fell asleep CHAPTER IV WHICH AMONG OTHER MATTERS HAS TO DO WITH BRUISES AND BANDAGES She was on her knees beside me bathing my battered face talking all the while in a soft voice that I thought wonderfully sweet to hear Poor boy she was saying over and over again poor boy And after she had said it perhaps a dozen times I opened my eyes and looked at her Madam I am twenty five said I Hereupon sponge in hand she drew back and looked at me A wonderful face low browed deep eyed full lipped The eyes were dark and swiftly changeful and there was a subtle witchery in the slanting shadow of their lashes Twenty five she repeated can it really be Why not madam So very young Why I began greatly taken aback Indeed I that is But here she laughed and then she sighed and sighing shook her head Poor boy said she poor boy And when I would have retorted she stopped me with the sponge Your mouth is cut said she after a while and there is a great gash in your brow But the water feels delicious said I And your throat is all scratched and swollen But your hands are very gentle and soothing I don t hurt you then On the contrary the the pain is very trifling thank you Yet you fainted a little while ago Then it was very foolish of me Poor she hesitated and looking up at her through the trickling water I saw that she was smiling fellow said she And her lips were very sweet and her eyes very soft and tender for an Amazon And when she had washed the blood from my face she went to fetch clean water from where I kept it in a bucket in the corner Now at my elbow upon the table lay the knife a heavy clumsy contrivance I had bought to use in my carpentry and I now mechanically picked it up As I did so the light gleamed evilly upon its long blade Put it down she commanded put it away it is a hateful thing For a woman s hand I added so hideously unfeminine Some men are so hatefully hideously masculine she retorted her lip curling I expected him and you are terribly like him As to that said I I may have the same colored eyes and hair and be something of the same build Yes she nodded it was your build and the color of your eyes and hair that startled me But after all said I the similarity is only skin deep and goes no farther No she answered kneeling beside me again no you are only twenty five And as she said this her eyes were hidden by her lashes Twenty five is twenty five said I more sharply than before Why do you smile The water is all dripping from your nose and chin stoop lower over the basin And yet said I as well as I could on account of the trickling water for she was bathing my face again and yet you must be years younger than I But then some women always feel older than a man more especially if he is hurt Thank you said I thank you with the exception of a scratch or so I am very well But as I moved I caught my thumb clumsily against the table edge and winced with the sudden pain of it What is it your hand My thumb Let me see Obediently I stretched out my hand to her Is it broken Dislocated I think It is greatly swollen Yes said I and taking firm hold of it with my left hand I gave it a sudden pull which started the sweat upon my temples but sent it back into joint Poor Well said I as she hesitated man said she and touched the swollen hand very tenderly with her fingers You do not fear me any longer No In spite of my eyes and hair In spite of your eyes and hair you see a woman knows instinctively whom she must fear and whom not to fear Well And you are one I do not fear and I think never should Hum said I rubbing my chin I am only twenty five Twenty five is twenty five said she demurely And yet I am very like him you said so yourself Him she exclaimed starting I had forgotten all about him Where is he what has become of him and she glanced apprehensively towards the door Half way to Tonbridge or should be by now Tonbridge said she in a tone of amazement and turned to look at me again Tonbridge I repeated But he is not the man to to run away said she doubtfully even from you No indeed said I shaking my head he certainly did not run away but circumstances and a stone were too much even for him A stone Upon which he happened to fall and strike his head very fortunately for me Was he much hurt Stunned only I answered She was still kneeling beside my chair but now she sat back and turned to stare into the fire And as she sat I noticed how full and round and white her arms were for her sleeves were rolled high and that the hand which yet held the sponge was likewise very white neither big nor little a trifle wide perhaps but with long slender fingers Presently with a sudden gesture she raised her head and looked at me again a long searching look Who are you she asked suddenly My name said I is Peter Yes she nodded with her eyes still on mine Peter Smith I went on and by that same token I am a blacksmith very humbly at your service Peter Smith she repeated as though trying the sound of it hesitating at the surname exactly as I had done Peter Smith and mine is Charmian Charmian Brown And here again was a pause between the two names Yours is a very beautiful name said I especially the Charmian And yours she retorted is a beautifully ugly one Yes Especially the Peter Indeed I quite agree with you said I rising and now if I may trouble you for the towel thank you Forthwith I began to dry my face as well as I might on account of my injured thumb while she watched me with a certain elusive merriment peeping from her eyes and quivering at me round her lips an expression half mocking half amused that I had seen there more than once already Wherefore to hide from her my consciousness of this I fell to towelling myself vigorously so much so that forgetting the cut in my brow I set it bleeding faster than ever Oh you are very clumsy she cried springing up and snatching the towel from me she began to stanch the blood with it If you will sit down I will bind it up for you Really it is quite unnecessary I demurred Quite said she is there anything will serve as a bandage There is the towel I suggested Not to be thought of Then you might tear a strip off the sheet said I nodding towards the bed Ridiculous said she and proceeded to draw a handkerchief from the bosom of her dress and having folded it with great nicety and moistened it in the bowl she tied it about my temples Now to do this she had perforce to pass her arms about my neck and this brought her so near that I could feel her breath upon my lips and there stole to me out of her hair or out of her bosom a perfume very sweet that was like the fragrance of violets at evening But her hands were all too dexterous and quicker than it takes to write the bandage was tied and she was standing before me straight and tall There that is more comfortable isn t it she inquired and with the words she bestowed a final little pat to the bandage a touch so light so ineffably gentle that it might almost have been the hand of that long dead mother whom I had never known That is better isn t it she demanded Thank you yes very comfortable said I But as the word left me my glance by accident encountered the pistol near by and at sight of it a sudden anger came upon me for I remembered that but for my intervention this girl was a murderess wherefore I would fain have destroyed the vile thing and reached for it impulsively but she was before me and snatching up the weapon hid it behind her as she had done once before Give it to me said I frowning it is an accursed thing Yet it has been my friend to night she answered Give it to me I repeated She threw up her head and regarded me with a disdainful air for my tone had been imperative Come said I and held out my hand So for a while we looked into each other s eyes then all at once she dropped the weapon on the table before me and turned her back to me I think she began speaking with her back still turned to me Well said I that you have Yes said I very unpleasant eyes I am very sorry for that said I dropping the weapon out of sight behind my row of books having done which I drew both chairs nearer the fire and invited her to sit down Thank you I prefer to stand said she loftily As you will I answered but even while I spoke she seemed to change her mind for she sank into the nearest chair and chin in hand stared into the fire And so said she as I sat down opposite her and so your name is Peter Smith and you are a blacksmith Yes a blacksmith And make horseshoes Naturally yes And do you live here Yes Alone Quite alone And how long have you lived here alone Not so long that I am tired of it And is this cottage yours Yes that is it stands on the Sefton estates I believe but nobody hereabouts would seem anxious to dispute my right of occupying the place Why not Because it is generally supposed to be haunted Oh It was built by some wanderer of the roads I explained a stranger to these parts who lived alone here and eventually died alone here Died here Hanged himself on the staple above the door yonder Oh said she again and cast a fearful glance towards the deep driven rusty staple The country folk believe his spirit still haunts the place I went on and seldom or never venture foot within the Hollow And are you not afraid of this ghost No said I It must be very lonely here Delightfully so Are you so fond of solitude Yes for solitude is thought and to think is to live And what did you do with the pistol I dropped it out of sight behind my books yonder I wonder why I gave it to you Because if you remember I asked you for it But I usually dislike doing what I am asked and your manner was scarcely courteous You also objected to my eyes I think Yes she nodded Hum said I The dark night outside was filled with malignant demons now who tore at the rattling casements who roared and bellowed down the chimney or screamed furiously round the cottage but here in the warm firelight I heeded them not at all watching rather this woman where she sat leaned forward gazing deep into the glow And where the light touched her hair it woke strange fires red and bronze And it was very rebellious hair with little tendrils that gleamed here and there against her temples and small defiant curls that seemed to strive to hide behind her ear or bold and wanton to kiss her snowy neck out of sheer bravado As to her dress I little by little became aware of two facts for whereas her gown was of a rough coarse material such as domestic servants wear the stockinged foot that peeped at me beneath its hem her shoes were drying on the hearth was clad in a silk so fine that I could catch through it the gleam of the white flesh beneath From this apparent inconsistency I deduced that she was of educated tastes but poor probably a governess or more likely still taking her hands into consideration with their long prehensile fingers a teacher of music and was going on to explain to myself her present situation as the outcome of Beauty Poverty and the Devil when she sighed glanced toward the door shivered slightly and reaching her shoes from the hearth prepared to slip them on They are still very wet said I deprecatingly Yes she answered Listen to the wind said I It is terribly high And it rains very hard said I Yes and she shivered again It will be bad travelling for any one to night said I Charmian stared into the fire Indeed it would be madness for the strongest to stir abroad on such a night Charmian stared into the fire What with the wind and the rain the roads would be utterly impassable not to mention the risks of falling trees or shattered boughs Charmian shivered again And the inns are all shut long ago to stir out therefore would be the purest folly Charmian stared into the fire On the other hand here are a warm room a good fire and a very excellent bed She neither spoke nor moved only her eyes were raised suddenly and swiftly to mine Also I continued returning her look here most convenient to your hand is a fine sharp knife in case you are afraid of the ghost or any other midnight visitant and so good night madam Saying which I took up one of the candles and crossed to the door of that room which had once been Donald s but here I paused to glance back at her Furthermore said I snuffing my candle with great nicety madam need have no further qualms regarding the color of my hair and eyes none whatever Whereupon I bowed somewhat stiffly on account of my bruises and going into my chamber closed the door behind me Having made the bed for since Donald s departure I had occupied my two beds alternately I undressed slowly for my thumb was very painful also I paused frequently to catch the sound of the light quick footstep beyond the door and the whisper of her garments as she walked Charmian said I to myself when at length all was still Charmian And I blew out my candle Outside the souls of the unnumbered dead still rode the storm and the world was filled with their woeful lamentation But as I lay in the dark there came to me a faint perfume as of violets at evening time elusive and very sweet breathing of Charmian herself and putting up my hand I touched the handkerchief that bound my brow Charmian said I to myself again and so fell asleep CHAPTER V IN WHICH I HEAR ILL NEWS OF GEORGE The sun was pouring in at my lattice when I awoke next morning to a general soreness of body that at first puzzled me to account for But as I lay in that delicious state between sleeping and waking I became aware of a faint sweet perfume and turning my head espied a handkerchief upon the pillow beside me And immediately I came to my elbow with my eyes directed to the door for now indeed I remembered all and beyond that door sleeping or waking lay a woman In the early morning things are apt to lose something of the glamour that was theirs over night thus I remained propped upon my elbow gazing apprehensively at the door and with my ears on the stretch hearkening for any movement from the room beyond that should tell me she was up But I heard only the early chorus of the birds and the gurgle of the brook swollen with last night s rain In a while I rose and began to dress somewhat awkwardly on account of my thumb yet with rather more than my usual care stopping occasionally to hear if she was yet astir Being at last fully dressed I sat down to wait until I should hear her footstep But I listened vainly for minute after minute elapsed until rising at length I knocked softly And having knocked thrice each time louder than before without effect I lifted the latch and opened the door My first glance showed me that the bed had never even been slept in and that save for myself the place was empty And yet the breakfast table had been neatly set though with but one cup and saucer Now beside this cup and saucer was one of my few books and picking it up I saw that it was my Virgil Upon the fly leaf at which it was open I had years ago scrawled my name thus PETER VIBART But lo close under this written in a fine Italian hand were the following words To Peter Smith esquire the Smith underlined Blacksmith Charmian Brown Brown likewise underlined desires to thank mister Smith yet because thanks are so poor and small and his service so great needs must she remember him as a gentleman yet oftener as a blacksmith and most of all as a man Charmian Brown begs him to accept this little trinket in memory of her it is all she has to offer him He may also keep her handkerchief Upon the table on the very spot where the book had lain was a gold heart shaped locket very quaint and old fashioned upon one side of which was engraved the following posy Hee who myne heart would keepe for long Shall be a gentil man and strong Attached to the locket was a narrow blue riband wherefore passing this riband over my head I hung the locket about my neck And having read through the message once more I closed the Virgil and replacing it on the shelf set about brewing a cup of tea and so presently sat down to breakfast I had scarcely done so however when there came a timid knock at the door whereat I rose expectantly and immediately sat down again Come in said I The latch was slowly raised the door swung open and the Ancient appeared If I was surprised to see him at such an hour he was even more so for at sight of me his mouth opened and he stood staring speechlessly leaning upon his stick Why Ancient said I you are early abroad this morning Lord he exclaimed scarcely above a whisper Come in and sit down said I Lord Lord he murmured an a satin is breakfus tu Lordy Lord Yes I nodded and such as it is you are heartily welcome to share it sit down and I drew up my other chair A eatin is breakfus as ever was repeated the old man without moving And why not Ancient Why not he repeated disdainfully Cause breakfus can t be ate by a corp can it A corpse Ancient what do you mean I means as a corp aren t got no right to eat a breakfus no Why I no certainly not Consequently you aren t a corp you ll be tellin me I no not yet God be thanked Peter said the Ancient shaking his head and mopping his brow with a corner of his neckerchief you du be forever a givin of me turns that ye du Do I Ancient Ay that ye du an me such a aged man tu such a very aged man I wonders at ye Peter an me wi my white airs oh I wonders at ye said he sinking into the chair I had placed for him and regarding me with a stern reproving eye If you will tell me what I have been guilty of I began I come down ere Peter so early as it be to I come down ere to look for your corp arter the storm an what appened last night I comes down ere and what does I find I finds ye a eatin your breakfus just as if theer never adn t been no storm at all no nor nothin else I m sure said I pouring out a second cup of tea I m sure I would sooner you should find my corpse than any one else and am sorry to have disappointed you again but

been no storm no nor yet no devil wi orns an a tail a runnin up an down in the Oller ere an a roarin an a bellerin as John Pringle said last night Ah and what else did John Pringle say I inquired

sparks an brimston a floatin an a flyin an draggin a body through the tops o the trees Lord says everybody an well they might Peter an nobody says nothin for a while I wonder says Joel Amos at last I wonder who e was a draggin through the tops o the trees an why That ll be poor Peter bein took away says I I ll go an find the poor lad s corp in the mornin an ere I be And you find me not dead after all your trouble said I If said the Ancient sighing if your arms was broke or your legs was broke now or if your air was singed or your face all burned an blackened wi sulphur I could ha took it kinder but to find ye a sittin eatin an drinkin it aren t what I expected of ye Peter no Shaking his head moodily he took from his hat his neverfailing snuff box but having extracted a pinch paused suddenly in the act of inhaling it to stare at me very hard But said he in a more hopeful tone but your face be all bruised an swole up to be sure Peter Is it Ancient Ah that it be that it be he cried his eyes brightening an your thumb all bandaged tu Why so it is Ancient An Peter The pinch of snuff fell and made a little brown cloud on the snow of his smock frock as he rose trembling and leaned towards me across the table Well Ancient Your throat Yes what of it It be all marked scratched it be tore as if as if claws ad been at it Peter long sharp claws Is it Ancient Peter oh Peter said he with a sudden quaver in his voice who was it what was it Peter and he laid a beseeching hand upon mine Peter His voice had sunk almost to a whisper and the hand plucked tremulously at my sleeve while in the wrinkled old face was a look of pitiful entreaty Oh Peter oh lad twere Old Nick as done it twere the devil as done it weren t it oh say twere the devil Peter And seeing that hoary head all a twitch with eagerness as he waited my answer how could I do other than nod Yes it was the devil Ancient The old man subsided into his chair embracing himself exultantly I knowed it I knowed it he quavered Twere the devil flyin off wi Peter says I an they fules laughed at me Peter ay laughed at me they did but they won t laugh at the old man no more not they old I be but they won t laugh at me no more not when they see your face an I tell em Here he paused to fumble for his snuff box and opening it held it towards me Tak a pinch wi me Peter No thank you Ancient Come twould be a wonnerful thing to tell as I d took snuff out o my very own box wi a man as ad fou t wi the devil come tak a pinch Peter he pleaded Whereupon to please him I did so and immediately fell most violently a sneezing And pursued the old man when the paroxysm was over did ye see is orns Peter an is Why no Ancient you see he happened to be wearing a bell crowned hat and a long coat A at an coat said the old man in a disappointed tone a at Peter Yes I nodded To be sure the Scripters say as e goeth up an down like a ravening lion seekin whom e may devour Yes said I but more often I think like a fine gentleman I never heerd tell o the devil in a bell crowned at afore but p r aps you m right Peter tak another pinch o snuff No more said I shaking my head Why it s apt to ketch you a bit at first but Lord Peter for a man as as fou t wi the devil One pinch is more than enough Ancient Oh Peter tis a wonnerful thing as you should be alive this day And yet Ancient many a man has fought the devil before now and lived nay has been the better for it Maybe Peter maybe but not on sech a tur ble wild night as last night was Saying which the old man nodded emphatically and rising hobbled to the door yet there he turned and came back again I nigh forgot Peter I have noos for ye News Noos as ever was noos as ll surprise ye Peter Well I inquired Well Peter Black Jarge be took again What I exclaimed Oh I knowed twould come I knowed e couldn t last much longer I says to Simon day afore yesterday it were Simon I says mark my words e ll never last the month out no How did it happen Ancient Got tur ble drunk e did over to Cranbrook throwed mister Scrope the Beadle over the churchyard wall knocked down Jeremy Tullinger the Watchman an then went to sleep While e were asleep they managed cautious like to tie is legs an arms an locked im up mighty secure in the vestry Ows ever when e woke up e broke the door open an walked out an nobody tried to stop im not a soul Peter And when was all this Why that s the very p int chuckled the Ancient that s the wonnerful part of it Peter It all appened on Sat day night day afore yesterday as ever was the very same day as I says to Simon mark my words e won t last the month out And where is he now Nobody knows but theer s them as says they see im makin for Sefton Woods Hereupon breakfast done I rose and took my hat Wheer away Peter To the forge there is much work to be done Ancient But Jarge bean t theer to elp ye Yet the work remains Ancient Why then if you m goin I ll go wi ye Peter So we presently set out together All about us as we walked were mute evidences of the fury of last night s storm trees had been uprooted and great branches torn from others as if by the hands of angry giants and the brook was a raging torrent Down here in the Hollow the destruction had been less but in the woods above the giants had worked their will and many an empty gap showed where erstwhile had stood a tall and stately tree Trees be very like men said the Ancient nodding to one that lay prone beside the path ere to day an gone to morrer Peter gone to morrer The man in the Bible im as was cured of is blindness by our blessed Lord e said as men was like trees walkin but to my mind Peter trees is much more like men a standin still Ye see Peter trees be such companionable things it s very seldom as you see a tree growin all by itself an when you do if you look at it you can t elp but notice ow lonely it do look Ay its very leaves seem to ave a down earted sort o drop I knowed three on em once elm trees they was growin all close together so close that their branches used to touch each other when the wind blew jest as if they was a shakin ands wi one another Peter You could see as they was uncommon fond of each other wi half an eye Well one day along comes a storm and blows one on em down kills it dead Peter an a little while later they cuts down another Lord knows why an theer was the last one all alone an solitary Now I used to watch that theer tree an here s the cur us thing Peter day by day I see that tree a droopin an droopin a witherin an a pinin for them other two brothers you might say till one day I come by an theer it were Peter a standin up so big an tall as ever but dead Ay Peter dead it were an never put forth another leaf an never will Peter never An if you was to ax me I should say as it died because its eart were broke Peter Yes trees is very like men an the older you grow the more you ll see it I listened It was thus we talked or rather the Ancient talked and I listened until we reached Sissinghurst At the door of the smithy we stopped Peter said the old man staring very hard at a button on my coat Well Ancient What about that theer poor old rusty stapil Why it is still above the door Ancient you must have seen it this morning Oh ah I seed it Peter I seed it answered the old man shifting his gaze to a rolling white cloud above I give it a glimp over Peter but what do ee think of it Well said I aware of the fixity of his gaze and the wistful note in his voice it is certainly older and rustier than it was Rustier Peter Much rustier Very slowly a smile dawned on the wrinkled old face and very slowly the eyes were lowered till they met mine Eh lad but I be glad o that we be all growin older Peter an though I be a wonnerful man for my age an so strong as a cart orse Peter still I du sometimes feel like I be growin rustier wi length o days an tis a comfort to know as that theer stapil s a growin rustier along wi me Old I be but t stapil s old too Peter an I be waitin for the day when it shall rust itself away altogether an when that day comes Peter then I ll say like the patriach in the Bible Lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace Amen Peter Amen said I And so having watched the old man totter across to The Bull I turned into the smithy and set about lighting the fire CHAPTER VI IN WHICH I LEARN OF AN IMPENDING DANGER I am at the forge watching the deepening glow of the coals as I ply the bellows and listening to their hoarse not unmusical drone it seems like a familiar voice or the voice of a familiar albeit a somewhat wheezy one speaking to me in stertorous gasps something in this wise Charmian Brown desires to thank mister Smith but because thanks are so poor and small and his service so great needs must she remember him Remember me said I aloud and letting go the shaft of the bellows the better to think this over it naturally followed that the bellows grew suddenly dumb whereupon I seized the handle and recommenced blowing with a will remember him as a gentleman wheezed the familiar Psha I exclaimed yet oftener as a smith Hum said I and most of all as a man As a man said I and turning my back upon the bellows I sat down upon the anvil and taking my chin in my hand stared away to where the red roof of old Amos s oast house peeped through the swaying green of leaves As a man said I to myself again and so fell a dreaming of this Charmian And in my mind I saw her not as she had first appeared tall and fierce and wild but as she had been when she stooped to bind up the hurt in my brow with her deep eyes brimful of tenderness and her mouth sweet and compassionate Beautiful eyes she had though whether they were blue or brown or black I could not for the life of me remember only I knew I could never forget the look they had held when she gave that final pat to the bandage And here I found that I was turning a little locket round and round in my fingers a little old fashioned heart shaped locket with its quaint inscription Hee who myne heart would keepe for long Shall be a gentil man and strong I was sitting thus plunged in a reverie when a shadow fell across the floor and looking up I beheld Prudence and straightway slipping the locket back into the bosom of my shirt I rose to my feet somewhat shamefaced to be caught thus idle Her face was troubled and her eyes red as from recent tears while in her hand she held a crumpled paper mister Peter she began and then stopped staring at me Well Prudence You you ve seen him Him whom do you mean Black Jarge No what should make you think so Your face be all cut you ve been fightin And supposing I have that is none of George s doing he and I are very good friends why should we quarrel Then then it weren t Jarge No I have not seen him since Saturday Thank God she exclaimed pressing her hand to her bosom as if to stay its heaving But you must go she went on breathlessly Oh mister Peter I ve been so fearful for ee and and you might meet each other any time so so you must go away Prudence said I Prudence what do you mean For answer she held out the crumpled paper and scrawled in great straggling characters I read these words PRUDENCE I m going away I shall kill him else but I shall come back Tell him not to cross my path or God help him and you and me GEORGE What does it all mean Prudence said I like a fool Now as I spoke glancing at her I saw her cheeks that had seemed hitherto more pale than usual grow suddenly scarlet and meeting my eyes she hid her face in her two hands Then seeing her distress in that same instant I found the answer to my question and so stood turning poor George s letter over and over more like a fool than ever You must go away you must go away she repeated Hum said I You must go soon he means it I I ve seen death in his face she said shuddering go to day the longer you stay here the worse for all of us go now Prudence said I Yes mister Peter from behind her hands You always loved Black George didn t you Yes mister Peter And you love him still don t you A moment s silence then Yes mister Peter Excellent said I Her head was raised a trifle and one tearful eye looked at me over her fingers I had always hoped you did I continued for his sake and for yours and in my way a very blundering way as it seems now I have tried to bring you two together Prudence only sobbed But things are not hopeless yet I think I can see a means of straightening out this tangle Oh if we only could sobbed Prudence Ye see I were very cruel to him mister Peter Just a little perhaps said I and while she dabbed at her pretty eyes with her snowy apron I took pen and ink from the shelf where I kept them which together with George s letter I set upon the anvil Now said I in answer to her questioning look write down just here below where George signed his name what you told me a moment ago You mean that I That you love him yes Oh mister Peter Prudence said I it is the only way so far as I can see of saving George from himself and no sweet pure maid need be ashamed to tell her love especially to such a man as this who worships the very ground that little shoe of yours has once pressed She glanced up at me under her wet lashes as I said this and a soft light beamed in her eyes and a smile hovered upon her red lips Do he really mister Peter Indeed he does Prudence though I think you must know that without my telling you So she stooped above the anvil blushing a little and sighing a little and crying a little and with fingers that trembled somewhat to be sure wrote these four words George I love you What now mister Peter she inquired seeing me begin to unbuckle my leather apron Now I answered I am going to look for Black George No no she cried laying her hands upon my arm no no if ee do meet him he he ll kill ee I don t think he will said I shaking my head Oh don t go don t go she pleaded shaking my arm in her eagerness he be so strong and wild and quick he ll give ee no chance to speak twill be murder Prudence said I my mind is set on it I am going for your sake for his sake and my own saying which I loosed her hands gently and took down my coat from its peg Dear God she exclaimed staring down at the floor with wide eyes if he were to kill ee Well said I my search would be ended and I should be a deal wiser in all things than I am to day And he would be hanged said Prudence shuddering Probably poor fellow said I At this she glanced quickly up and once again the crimson dyed her cheeks Oh mister Peter forgive me I I were only thinkin of Jarge and And quite right too Prudence I nodded he is indeed worth any good woman s thoughts let it be your duty to think of him and for him henceforth Wait said she wait And turning she fled through the doorway and across the road swift and graceful as any bird and presently was back again with something hidden in her apron He be a strong man and terrible in his wrath said she and I love him but take this wi you and if it must be use it because I do love him Now as she said this she drew from her apron that same brass bound pistol that had served me so well against the ghost and thrust it into my hand Take it mister Peter take it but oh here a great sob choked her voice don t don t use it if if you can help it for my sake Why Prue said I touching her bowed head very tenderly how can you think I would go up against my friend with death in my hand Heaven forbid So I laid aside the weapon and clapping on my hat strode out into the glory of the summer morning but left her weeping in the shadows CHAPTER VII WHICH NARRATES A SOMEWHAT REMARKABLE CONVERSATION To find a man in Cambourne Woods even so big a man as Black George would seem as hard a matter as to find the needle in the proverbial bottle of hay the sun crept westward the day declined into evening yet hungry though I was I persevered in my search not so much in the hope of finding him in the which I knew I must be guided altogether by chance as from a disinclination to return just yet to the cottage It would be miserable there at this hour I told myself miserable and lonely Yet why should I be lonely I who had gloried in my solitude hitherto Whence then had come this change While I stood thus seeking an answer to this self imposed question and finding none I heard some one approach whistling and looking about beheld a fellow with an axe upon his shoulder who strode along at a good pace keeping time to his whistle He gave me a cheery greeting as he came up but without stopping You seem in a hurry said I Ah grinned the man over his shoulder cause why cause I be goin ome Home said I To supper he nodded and forthwith began to whistle again while I stood listening till the clear notes had died away Home said I for the second time and there came upon me a feeling of desolation such as I had never known even in my neglected boyhood s days Home truly a sweet word a comfortable word the memory of which has been as oil and wine to many a sick and weary traveler upon this Broad Highway of life a little word and yet one which may come betwixt a man and temptation covering him like a shield Roof and walls be they cottage or mansion do not make home thought I rather is it the atmosphere of mutual love the intimacies of thought the joys and sorrows endured together and the never failing sympathy that bond invisible yet stronger than death And because I had hitherto known nothing of this I was possessed of a great envy for this axe fellow as I walked on through the wood Now as I went it was as if there were two voices arguing together within me whereof ensued the following triangular conversation MYSELF Yet I have my books I will go to my lonely cottage and bury myself among my books FIRST VOICE Assuredly Is it for a philosopher to envy a whistling axe fellow go to SECOND VOICE Far better a home and loving companionship than all the philosophy of all the schools surely Happiness is greater than Learning and more to be desired than Wisdom FIRST VOICE Better rather that Destiny had never sent her to you MYSELF rubbing my chin very hard and staring at nothing in particular Her SECOND VOICE Her to be sure she who has been in your thoughts all day long FIRST VOICE with lofty disdain Crass folly a woman utterly unknown who came heralded by the roar of wind and the rush of rain a creature born of the tempest with flame in her eyes and hair and fire in the scarlet of her mouth a fierce passionate being given to hot impulse even to the taking of a man s life But said I somewhat diffidently the fellow was a proved scoundrel FIRST VOICE bellowing Sophistry sophistry even supposing he was the greatest of villains does that make her less a murderess in intent MYSELF Hum FIRST VOICE roaring Of course not Again can this woman even faintly compare with your ideal of what a woman should be this shrew this termagant Can a woman whose hand has the strength to level a pistol and whose mind the will to use it be of a nature gentle clinging sweet SECOND VOICE sotto And sticky FIRST VOICE howling Of course not preposterous Hereupon finding no answer I strode on through the alleys of the wood but when I had gone some distance I stopped again for there rushed over me the recollection of the tender pity of her eyes and the gentle touch of her hand as when she had bound up my hurts Nevertheless said I doggedly her face can grow more beautiful with pity and surely no woman s hand could be lighter or more gentle FIRST VOICE with withering contempt Our Peter fellow is like to become a preposterous ass But unheeding I thrust my hand into my breast and drew out a small handful of cambric whence came a faint perfume of violets And closing my eyes it seemed that she was kneeling before me her arms about my neck as when she had bound this handkerchief about my bleeding temples Truly said I for that one sweet act alone a woman might be worth dying for SECOND VOICE Or better still living for FIRST VOICE in high indignation Balderdash Sir sentimental balderdash SECOND VOICE A truth incontrovertible Folly said I and threw the handkerchief from me But next moment moved by a sudden impulse I stooped and picked it up again FIRST VOICE Our Peter fellow is becoming the fool of fools MYSELF No of that there is not the slightest fear because she is gone And thus I remained staring at the handkerchief for a great while CHAPTER VIII IN WHICH I SEE A VISION IN THE GLORY OF THE MOON AND EAT OF A POACHED RABBIT The moon was rising as hungry and weary I came to that steep descent I have mentioned more than once which leads down into the Hollow and her pale radiance was already upon the world a sleeping world wherein I seemed alone And as I stood to gaze upon the wonder of the heavens and the serene beauty of the earth the clock in Cranbrook Church chimed nine All about me was a soft stirring of leaves and the rustle of things unseen which was as the breathing of a sleeping host Borne to my nostrils came the scent of wood and herb and dewy earth while upstealing from the shadow of the trees below the voice of the brook reached me singing its never ending song now loud and clear now sinking to a rippling murmur a melody of joy and sorrow of laughter and tears like the greater melody of Life And presently I descended into the shadows and walking on beside the brook sat me down upon a great boulder and straightway my weariness and hunger were forgotten and I fell a dreaming Truly it was a night to dream in a white night full of the moon and the magic of the moon Slowly she mounted upwards peeping down at me through whispering leaves checkering the shadows with silver and turning the brook into a path of silver for the feet of fairies Yes indeed the very air seemed fraught with a magic whereby the unreal became the real and things impossible the manifestly possible And so staring up at the moon s pale loveliness I dreamed the deathless dreams of long dead poets and romancers wherein were the notes of dreamy lutes the soft whisper of trailing garments and sighing voices that called beneath the breath Between Petrarch s Laura and Dante s Beatrice came one as proud and gracious and beautiful as they deep bosomed broad hipped with a red red mouth and a subtle witchery of the eyes I dreamed of nymphs and satyrs of fauns and dryads and of the young Endymion who on just such another night in just such another leafy bower waited the coming of his goddess Now as I sat thus chin in hand I heard a little sound behind me the rustling of leaves and turning my head beheld one who stood half in shadow half in moonlight looking down at me beneath a shy languor of drooping lids with eyes hidden by their lashes a woman tall and fair and strong as Dian s self Very still she stood and half wistful as if waiting for me to speak and very silent I sat staring up at her as she had been the embodiment of my dreams conjured tip by the magic of the night while from the mysteries of the woods stole the soft sweet song of a nightingale Charmian said I at last speaking almost in a whisper Surely this was the sweet goddess herself and I the wondering shepherd on Mount Ida s solitude Charmian said I again you have come then With the words I rose You have come then I repeated But now she sighed a little and turning her head away laughed very sweet and low and sighed again Were you expecting me I I think I was that is I I don t know I stammered Then you were not very surprised to see me No And you are not very sorry to see me No And are you not very glad to see me Yes Here there fell a silence between us yet a silence that was full of leafy stirrings soft night noises and the languorous murmur of the brook Presently Charmian reached out a hand broke off a twig of willow and began to turn it round and round in her white fingers while I sought vainly for something to say When I went away this morning she began at last looking down at the twig I didn t think I should ever come back again No I I supposed not said I awkwardly But you see I had no money No money Not a penny It was not until I had walked a long long way and was very tired and terribly hungry that I found I hadn t enough to buy even a crust of bread And there was three pounds fifteen shillings and sixpence in Donald s old shoe said I Sevenpence she corrected Sevenpence said I in some surprise Three pounds fifteen shillings and sevenpence I counted it Oh said I She nodded And in the other I found a small very curiously shaped piece of wood Ah yes I ve been looking for that all the week You see when I made my table by some miscalculation one leg persisted in coming out shorter than the others which necessitated its being shored up by a book until I made that block mister Peter Vibart s Virgil book she said nodding to the twig Y e s said I somewhat disconcerted It was a pity to use a book she went on still very intent upon the twig even if that book does belong to a man with such a name as Peter Vibart Now presently seeing I was silent she stole a glance at me and looking laughed But she continued more seriously this has nothing to do with you of course nor me for that matter and I was trying to tell you how hungry how hatefully hungry I was and I couldn t beg could I and so and so I I You came back said I I came back Being hungry Famishing Three pounds fifteen shillings and sevenpence is not a great sum said I but perhaps it will enable you to reach your family I m afraid not you see I have no family Your friends then I have no friends I am alone in the world Oh said I and turned to stare down into the brook for I could think only that she was alone and solitary even as I which seemed like an invisible bond between us drawing us each nearer the other whereat I felt ridiculously pleased that this should be so No said Charmian still intent upon the twig I have neither friends nor family nor money and so being hungry I came back here and ate up all the bacon Why I hadn t left much if I remember Six slices Now as she stood half in shadow half in moonlight I could not help but be conscious of her loveliness She was no pretty woman beneath the high beauty of her face lay a dormant power that is ever at odds with prettiness and before which I felt vaguely at a loss And yet because of her warm beauty because of the elusive witchery of her eyes the soft sweet column of the neck and the sway of the figure in the moonlight because she was no goddess and I no shepherd in Arcadia I clasped my hands behind me and turned to look down into the stream Indeed said I speaking my thought aloud this is no place for a woman after all No said she very softly No although to be sure there are worse places Yes said she I suppose so Then again it is very far removed from the world so that a woman must needs be cut off from all those little delicacies and refinements that are supposed to be essential to her existence Yes she sighed Though what I continued what on earth would be the use of a harp let us say or a pair of curling irons in this wilderness I don t know One could play upon the one and curl one s hair with the other and there is a deal of pleasure to be had from both said she Then also I pursued this place as I told you is said to be haunted not I went on seeing that she was silent not that you believe in such things of course But the cottage is very rough and ill and clumsily furnished though to be sure it might be made comfortable enough and Well she inquired as I paused Then said I and was silent for a long time watching the play of the moonbeams on the rippling water Well said she again at last Then said I if you are friendless God forbid that I should refuse you the shelter of even such a place as this so if you are homeless and without money stay here if you will so long as it pleases you I kept my eyes directed to the running water at my feet as I waited her answer and it seemed a very long time before she spoke Are you fond of stewed rabbit Rabbit said I staring With onions Onions Oh I can cook a little and supper is waiting Supper So if you are hungry I am ravenous Then why not come home and eat it Home Instead of echoing my words and staring the poor moon out of countenance Come and with the word she turned and led the way to the cottage And behold the candles were lighted the table was spread with a snowy cloth and a pot simmered upon the hob a pot that gave forth an odor delectable and over which Charmian bent forthwith and into which she gazed with an anxious brow and thrust an inquiring fork I think it s all right I m sure of it said I inhaling the appetizing aroma but pray where did you get it A man sold it to me he had a lot of them Hum said I probably poached I bought this for sixpence out of the old shoe Sixpence then they certainly were poached These are the Cambourne Woods and everything upon them fish flesh or fowl living or dead belongs to the Lady Sophia Sefton of Cambourne Then perhaps we had better not eat it said she glancing at me over her shoulder but meeting my eye she laughed And so we presently sat down to supper and poached though it may have been that rabbit made a truly noble end notwithstanding CHAPTER IX WHICH RELATES SOMEWHAT OF CHARMIAN BROWN We were sitting in the moonlight Now said Charmian staring up at the luminous heaven let us talk Willingly I answered let us talk of stars No let us talk of ourselves As you please Very well you begin Well I am a blacksmith Yes you told me so before And I make horseshoes He is a blacksmith and makes horseshoes said Charmian nodding at the moon And I live here in this solitude very contentedly so that it is only reasonable to suppose that I shall continue to live here and make horseshoes though really I broke off letting my eyes wander from my companion s upturned face back to the glowing sky once more there is little I could tell you about so commonplace a person as myself that is likely to interest you No said Charmian evidently not Here my gaze came down to her face again so quickly that I fancied I detected the ghost of a smile upon her lips Then said I by all means let us talk of something else Yes she agreed let us talk of the woman Charmian Charmian Brown A tress of hair had come loose and hung low above her brow and in its shadow her eyes seemed more elusive more mocking than ever and while our glances met she put up a hand and began to wind this glossy tress round and round her finger Well said she Well said I supposing you begin But is she likely to interest you I think so yes Aren t you sure then Quite sure certainly Then why don t you say so I thought you would take that for granted A woman should take nothing for granted sir Then said I supposing you begin I ve half a mind not to she retorted curling the tress of hair again and then suddenly What do you think of Charmian Brown I think of her as little as I can Indeed sir Indeed said I And why pray Because said I knocking the ashes from my pipe because the more I think about her the more incomprehensible she becomes Have you known many women Very few I confessed but But I am not altogether unfamiliar with the sex for I have known a great number in books Our blacksmith said Charmian addressing the moon again has known many women in books His knowledge is therefore profound and she laughed May I ask why you laugh at me Oh said she don t you know that women in books and women out of books are no more the same than day and night or summer and winter And yet there are thousands of women who exist for us in books only Laura Beatrice Trojan Helen Aspasia the glorious Phryne and hosts of others I demurred Yes but they exist for us only as their historians permit them as their biographers saw or imagined them Would Petrarch ever have permitted Laura to do an ungracious act or anything which to his masculine understanding seemed unfeminine and would Dante have mentioned it had Beatrice been guilty of one A man can no more understand a woman from the reading of books than he can learn Latin or Greek from staring at the sky Of that said I shaking my head of that I am not so sure Then personally you know very little concerning women she inquired I have always been too busy said I Here Charmian turned to look at me again Too busy she repeated as though she had not heard aright too busy Much too busy Now when I said this she laughed and then she frowned and then she laughed again You would much rather make a horseshoe than talk with a woman perhaps Yes I think I would Oh said Charmian frowning again but this time she did not look at me You see I explained turning my empty pipe over and over rather aimlessly when I make a horseshoe I take a piece of iron and having heated it I bend and shape it and with every hammer stroke I see it growing into what I would have it I am sure of it from start to finish now with a woman it is different You mean that you cannot bend and shape her like your horseshoe still without looking towards me I mean that that I fear I should never be quite sure of a woman as I am of my horseshoe Why you see said Charmian beginning to braid the tress of hair a woman cannot at any time be said to resemble a horseshoe very much can she Surely said I surely you know what I mean There are Laura and Beatrice and Helen and Aspasia and Phryne and hosts of others said Charmian nodding to the moon again Oh yes our blacksmith has read of so many women in books that he has no more idea of women out of books than I of Sanscrit And in a little while seeing I was silent she condescended to glance towards me Then I suppose under the circumstances you have never been in love In love I repeated and dropped my pipe In love The Lord forbid Why pray Because Love is a disease a madness coming between a man and his life s work Love said I it is a calamity Never having been in love himself our blacksmith very naturally knows all about it said Charmian to the moon I speak only of such things as I have read I began More books she sighed words of men much wiser than I poets and philosophers written When they were old and gray headed Charmian broke in when they were quite incapable of judging the matter though many a grave philosopher loved now didn t he To be sure said I rather hipped Dionysius Lambienus I think says somewhere that a woman with a big mouth is infinitely sweeter in the kissing and Do you suppose he read that in a book she inquired glancing at me sideways Why as to that I answered a philosopher may love but not for the mere sake of loving For whose sake then I wonder A man who esteems trifles for their own sake is a trifler but one who values them rather for the deductions that may be drawn from them he is a philosopher Charmian rose and stood looking down at me very strangely So said she throwing back her head so throned in lofty might superior mister Smith thinks Love a trifle does he My name is Vibart as I think you know said I stung by her look or her tone or both Yes she answered seeming to look down at me from an immeasurable attitude but I prefer to know him just now as Superior mister Smith As you will said I and rose also but even then though she had to look up to me I had the same inward conviction that her eyes were regarding me from a great height wherefore I attempted quite unsuccessfully to light my pipe And after I had struck flint and steel vainly perhaps a dozen times Charmian took the box from me and igniting the tinder held it for me while I lighted my tobacco Thank you said I as she returned the box and then I saw that she was smiling Talking of Charmian Brown I began But we are not Then suppose you begin Do you really wish to hear about that humble person Very much Then you must know in the first place that she is old sir dreadfully old But said I she really cannot be more than twenty three or four at the most She is just twenty one returned Charmian rather hastily I thought Quite a child No indeed it is experience that ages one and by experience she is quite two hundred The wonder is that she still lives Indeed it is And being of such a ripe age it is probable that she at any rate has been in love Scores of times Oh said I puffing very hard at my pipe Or fancied so said Charmian That I replied that is a very different thing Do you think so Well isn t it Perhaps Very well then continue I beg Now this woman Charmian went on beginning to curl the tress of hair again hating the world about her with its shams its hypocrisy and cruelty ran away from it all one day with a villain And why with a villain Because he was a villain That said I turning to look at her that I do not understand No I didn t suppose you would she answered Hum said I rubbing my chin And why did you run away from him Because he was a villain That was very illogical said I But very sensible sir Here there fell a silence between us and as we walked now and then her gown would brush my knee or her shoulder touch mine for the path was very narrow And did you I began suddenly and stopped Did I what sir Did you love him said I staring straight in front of me I ran away from him And do you love him I suppose said Charmian speaking very slowly I suppose you cannot understand a woman hating and loving a man admiring and despising him both at the same time No I can t Can you understand one glorying in the tempest that may destroy her riding a fierce horse that may crush her or being attracted by a will strong and masterful before which all must yield or break I think I can Then said Charmian this man is strong and wild and very masterful and so I ran away with him And do you love him We walked on some distance ere she answered I don t know Not sure then No After this we fell silent altogether yet once when I happened to glance at her I saw that her eyes were very bright beneath the shadow of her drooping lashes and that her lips were smiling and I pondered very deeply as to why this should be Re entering the cottage I closed the door and waited the while she lighted my candle And having taken the candle from her hand I bade her Good night but paused at the door of my chamber You feel quite safe here Quite safe Despite the color of my hair and eyes you have no fear of Peter Smith None Because he is neither fierce nor wild nor masterful Because he is neither fierce nor wild she echoed Nor masterful said I Nor masterful said Charmian with averted head So I opened the door but even then must needs turn back again Do you think I am so very different from him As different as day from night as the lamb from the wolf said she without looking at me Good night Peter Good night said I and so going into my room I closed the door behind me A lamb said I tearing off my neckcloth and sat for some time listening to her footstep and the soft rustle of her petticoats going to and fro A lamb said I again and slowly drew off my coat As I did so a little cambric handkerchief fell to the floor and I kicked it forthwith into a corner A lamb said I for the third time but at this moment came a light tap upon the door Yes said I without moving Oh how is your injured thumb Thank you it is as well as can be expected Does it pain you very much It is not unbearable said I Good night Peter and I heard her move away But presently she was back again Oh Peter Well Are you frowning I I think I was why When you frown you are very like him and have the same square set of the mouth and chin when you are angry so don t please don t frown Peter Good night Good night Charmian said I and stooping I picked up the little handkerchief and thrust it under my pillow CHAPTER X I AM SUSPECTED OF THE BLACK ART Vibart The word had been uttered close behind me and very softly yet I started at this sudden mention of my name and stood for a moment with my hammer poised above the anvil ere I turned and faced the speaker He was a tall man with a stubbly growth of grizzled hair about his lank jaws and he was leaning in at that window of the smithy which gave upon a certain grassy back lane You spoke I think said I I said Vibart Well Well And why should you say Vibart And why should you start Beneath the broad flapping hat his eyes glowed with a sudden intensity as he waited my answer It is familiar said I Ha familiar he repeated and his features were suddenly contorted as with a strong convulsion and his teeth gleamed between his pallid lips My hammer was yet in my grasp and as I met this baleful look my fingers tightened instinctively about the shaft Familiar said he again Yes I nodded like your face for it would almost seem that I have seen you somewhere before and I seldom forget faces Nor do I said the man Now while we thus fronted each other there came the sound of approaching footsteps and John Pringle the Carrier appeared followed by the pessimistic Job Marnin Peter them orseshoes began John pausing just outside the smithy door you was to finish em s arternoon if so be as they bean t done you bein short anded wi out Jarge why I can wait Now during this speech I was aware that both his and Job s eyes had wandered from my bandaged thumb to my bare throat and become fixed there Come in and sit down said I nodding to each as I blew up the fire come in For a moment they hesitated then John stepped gingerly into the smithy closely followed by Job and watching them beneath my brows as I stooped above the shaft of the bellows I saw each of them furtively cross his fingers Why do you do that John Pringle said I Do what Peter Cross your fingers Why ye see Peter said John glancing in turn at the floor the rafters the fire and the anvil but never at me ye see it be just a kind o way o mine But why does Job do the same An why do ee look at a man so sharp an sudden like retorted Job sullenly dang me if it aren t enough to send cold shivers up a chap s spine I never see such a pair o eyes afore no nor don t want to again Nonsense said I my eyes can t hurt you An ow am I to know that ow am I to be sure o that an you wi your throat all torn wi devil s claws an demon s clutches it bean t nat ral Old Amos says so an I sez so Pure folly said I plucking the iron from the fire and beginning to beat and shape it with my hammer but presently remembering the strange man who had spoken my name I looked up and then I saw that he was gone Where is he said I involuntarily Where s who inquired John Pringle glancing about uneasily The fellow who was talking to me as you came up I didn t see no fellow said Job looking at John and edging nearer the door Nor me neither chimed in John Pringle looking at Job Why he was leaning in at the window here not a minute ago said I and plunging the half finished horseshoe back into the fire I stepped out into the road but the man was nowhere to be seen Very strange said I What might e ave been like now inquired John He was tall and thin and wore a big flapping hat John Pringle coughed scratched his chin and coughed again What is it John I inquired Why then you couldn t appen to notice im wearin is at you couldn t appen to notice if e ad ever a pair o orns Peter Horns I exclaimed Or a tail Peter Or even a oof now suggested Job Come said I looking from one to the other what might you be driving at Why ye see Peter answered John coughing again and scratching his chin harder than ever ye see Peter it aren t nat ral for a uman bein to go a vanishin away like this ere if twere a man as you was a talkin to Which I doubts muttered Job If twere a man Peter then I axes you where is that man Before I could answer this pointed question old Joel Amos hobbled up who paused on the threshold to address some one over his shoulder Come on James ere e be come for ard James like a man Thus adjured another individual appeared a somewhat flaccid looking individual with colorless hair and eyes one who seemed to exhale an air of apology as it were from the hobnailed boot upon the floor to the grimy forefinger that touched the strawlike hair in salutation Marnin Peter said Old Amos this yere is Dutton How do you do said I acknowledging the introduction and what can I do for mister Dutton The latter instead of replying took out a vivid belcher handkerchief and apologetically mopped his face Speak up James Dutton said Old Amos Lord exclaimed Dutton Lord I du be that ot you speak for I Amos du Well began Old Amos not ill pleased this ere Dutton wants to ax ee a question e du Peter I shall be glad to answer it if I can I returned You ear that well ax your question James Dutton commanded the old man W y ye see Amos began Dutton positively reeking apology I du be that on common ot you ax un W y then Peter began Amos with great unction it s is pigs Pigs I exclaimed staring Ah pigs Peter nodded Old Amos Dutton s pigs is sow farrowed last week at three in the marnin nine of em Well said I wondering more and more Well Peter they was a fine earty lot an all a doin well till last Monday Indeed said I Last Monday night four on em sickened an died Most unfortunate said I An the rest as never been the same since Probably ate something that disagreed with them said I picking up my hammer and laying it down again Old Amos smiled and shook his head You know James Dutton s pigsty don t ye Peter I really can t say that I do Yet you pass it every day on your way to the Oller it lays just be ind Simon s oast ouse as James isself will tell ee So it du interpolated Dutton with an apologetic nod which leastways if it don t can t be no ow having delivered himself of which he buried his face in the belcher handkerchief Now one evenin Peter continued Old Amos one evenin you leaned over the fence o that theer pigsty an stood a lookin at they pigs for p r aps ten minutes Did I Ay that ye did James Dutton see ye an is wife she see ye tu and I see ye Then said I probably I did Well Well said the old man looking round upon his hearers and bringing out each word with the greatest unction that theer evenin were last Monday evenin as ever was the very same hour as Dutton s pigs sickened an died Hereupon John Pringle and Job rose simultaneously from where they had been sitting and retreated precipitately to the door Lord exclaimed John I might ha knowed it said Job drawing a cross in the air with his finger An so James Dutton wants to ax ye to tak it off Peter said Old Amos To take what off Why the spell for sure Hereupon I gave free play to my amusement and laughed and laughed while the others watched me with varying expressions And so you think that I bewitched Dutton s pigs do you said I at last glancing from Old Amos to the perspiring Apology who immediately began to mop at his face and neck again And why I continued seeing that nobody appeared willing to speak why should you think it of me W y Peter ye bean t like ordinary folk your eyes goes through an through a man An then Peter I mind as you come a walkin into Siss n urst one night from Lord knows wheer all covered wi dust an wi a pack on your back You are wrong there Amos said I it was afternoon when I came and the Ancient was with me Ah an wheer did e find ye Peter come speak up an tell us In the Hollow I answered Ay e found ee in the very spot wheer the Wanderer o the Roads ung isself sixty an six years ago There is nothing very strange in that said I What s more you come into the village an beat Black Jarge throwin th ammer an im the strongest man in all the South Country I beat him because he did not do his best so there is nothing strange in that either An then you lives all alone in that theer ghashly Oller an you fights an struggles wi devils an demons all in the wind an rain an tearin tempest an what s most of all you comes back alive an what s more yet wi devil marks upon ye an your throat all tore wi claws Old Gaffer be over proud o findin ye but old Gaffer be dodderin dodderin e be an fulish wi years e d ha done much better to ha left ye alone I ve heerd o folk sellin theirselves to the devil afore now I ve likewise heerd o the Evil Eye afore now ah an knows one when I sees it Nonsense said I sternly nonsense This talk of ghosts and devils is sheer folly I am a man like the rest of you and could not wish you ill even if I would come let us all shake hands and forget this folly and I extended my hand to Old Amos He glanced from it to my face and immediately lowering his eyes shook his head Tis the Evil Eye said he and drew across upon the floor with his stick the Evil Eye Nonsense said I again my eye is no more evil than yours or Job s I never wished any man harm yet nor wronged one and I hope I never may As for mister Dutton s pigs if he take better care of them and keep them out of the damp they will probably thrive better than ever come shake hands But one by one they edged their way to the door after Old Amos until only John Pringle was left he for a moment stood hesitating then suddenly reaching out he seized my hand and shook it twice I ll call for they orseshoes in the marnin Peter said he and vanished Arter all I heard him say as he joined the others tis summat to ha shook ands wi a chap as fights wi demons CHAPTER XI A SHADOW IN THE HEDGE Over the uplands to my left the moon was peeping at me very broad and yellow as yet casting long shadows athwart my way The air was heavy with the perfume of honeysuckle abloom in the hedges a warm still air wherein a deep silence brooded and in which leaf fluttered not and twig stirred not but it was none of this I held in my thoughts as I strode along whistling softly as I went Yet in a while chancing to lift my eyes I beheld the object of my reverie coming towards me through the shadows Why Charmian said I uncovering my head Why Peter Did you come to meet me It must be nearly nine o clock sir Yes I had to finish some work Did any one pass you on the road Not a soul Peter have you an enemy Not that I know of unless it be myself Epictetus says somewhere that Oh Peter how dreadfully quiet everything is said she and shivered Are you cold No but it is so dreadfully still Now in one place the lane narrowing suddenly led between high banks crowned with bushes so that it was very dark there As we entered this gloom Charmian suddenly drew closer to my side and slipped her hand beneath my arm and into my clasp and the touch of her fingers was like ice Your hand is very cold said I But she only laughed yet I felt her shiver as she pressed herself close against me And now it was she who talked and I who walked in silence or answered at random for I was conscious only of the clasp of her fingers and the soft pressure of hip and shoulder So we passed through this place of shadows walking neither fast nor slow and ever her cold fingers clasped my fingers and her shoulder pressed my arm while she talked and laughed but of what I know not until we had left the dark place behind Then she sighed deeply and turned and drew her arm from mine almost sharply and stood looking back with her two hands pressed upon her bosom What is it Look she whispered pointing there where it is darkest look Now following the direction of her finger I saw something that skulked amid the shadows something that slunk away and vanished as I watched A man I exclaimed and would have started in pursuit but Charmian s hands were upon my arm strong and compelling Are you mad cried she angrily would you give him the opportunity I prevented He was waiting there to to shoot you I think And after we had gone on some little way I spoke Was that why you came to meet me Yes And kept so close beside me Yes Ah yes to be sure said I and walked on in silence and now I noticed that she kept as far from me as the path would allow Are you thinking me very unmaidenly again sir No I answered no You see I had no other way Had I told you that there was a man hidden in the hedge you would have gone to look and then something dreadful would have happened How came you to know he was there Why after I had prepared supper I climbed that steep path which leads to the road and sat down upon the fallen tree that lies there to watch for you and as I sat there I saw a man come hurrying down the road A very big man Yes very tall he seemed and as I watched he crept in behind the hedge While I was wondering at this I heard your step on the road and you were whistling And yet I seldom whistle It was you I knew your step Did you Charmian I do wish you would not interrupt sir I beg your pardon said I humbly And then I saw you coming and the man saw you too for he crouched suddenly I could only see him dimly in the shadow of the hedge but he looked murderous and it seemed to me that if you reached his hiding place before I did something terrible would happen and so You came to meet me Yes And walked close beside me so that you were between me and the shadow in the hedge Yes And I thought I began and stopped Well Peter Here she turned and gave me a swift glance beneath her lashes that it was because you were perhaps rather glad to see me Charmian did not speak indeed she was so very silent that I would have given much to have seen her face just then but the light was very dim as I have said moreover she had turned her shoulder towards me But I am grateful to you I went on very grateful and it was very brave of you Thank you sir she answered in a very small voice and I more than suspected that she was laughing at me Not I therefore continued that there was any real danger What do you mean she asked quickly I mean that in all probability the man you saw was Black George a very good friend of mine who though he may imagine he has a grudge against me is too much of a man to lie in wait to do me hurt Then why should he hide in the hedge Because he committed the mistake of throwing the town Beadle over the churchyard wall and is consequently in hiding for the present He has an ill sounding name And is the manliest gentlest truest and worthiest fellow that ever wore the leather apron Seeing how perseveringly she kept the whole breadth of the path between us I presently fell back and walked behind her now her head was bent and thus I could not but remark the little curls and tendrils of hair upon her neck whose sole object seemed to be to make the white skin more white by contrast Peter said she suddenly speaking over her shoulder of what are you thinking Of a certain steak pasty that was promised for my supper I answered immediately mendacious Oh And what I inquired what were you thinking I was thinking Peter that the shadow in the hedge may not have been Black George after all CHAPTER XII WHO COMES This table wobbles said Charmian It does said I but then I notice that the block is misplaced again Then why use a block A book is so clumsy I began Or a book Why not cut down the long legs to match the short one That is really an excellent idea Then why didn t you before Because to be frank with you it never occurred to me I suppose you are better as a blacksmith than a carpenter aren t you Peter And seeing I could find no answer worthy of retort she laughed and sitting down watched me while I took my saw forthwith and shortened the three long legs as she had suggested Having done which to our common satisfaction seeing the moon was rising we went and sat down on the bench beside the cottage door And are you a very good blacksmith she pursued turning to regard me chin in hand I can swing a hammer or shoe a horse with any smith in Kent except Black George and he is the best in all the South Country And is that a very great achievement Peter It is not a despicable one Are you quite satisfied to be able to shoe horses well sir It is far better to be a good blacksmith than a bad poet or an incompetent prime minister Meaning that you would rather succeed in the little thing than fail in the great With your permission I will smoke said I Surely she went on nodding her permission surely it is nobler to be a great failure rather than a mean success Success is very sweet Charmian even in the smallest thing for instance said I pointing to the cottage door that stood open beside her when I built that door and saw it swing on its hinges I was as proud of it as though it had been A really good door interpolated Charmian instead of a bad one A bad one Charmian It is a very clumsy door and has neither bolt nor lock There are no thieves hereabouts and even if there were they would not dare to set foot in the Hollow after dark And then unless one close it with great care it sticks very tight That obviating the necessity of a latch is rather to be commended said I Besides it is a very ill fitting door Peter I have seen worse And will be very draughty in cold weather A blanket hung across will remedy that Still it can hardly be called a very good door can it Peter Here I lighted my pipe without answering I suppose you make horseshoes much better than you make doors I puffed at my pipe in silence You are not angry because I found fault with your door are you Peter Angry said I not in the least I am sorry for that Why sorry Are you never angry Peter Seldom I hope I should like to see you so just once Finding nothing to say in answer to this I smoked my negro head pipe and stared at the moon which was looking down at us through a maze of tree trunks and branches Referring to horseshoes said Charmian at last are you content to be a blacksmith all your days Yes I think I am Were you never ambitious then Ambition is like rain breaking itself upon what it falls on at least so Bacon says and Oh bother Bacon Were you never ambitious Peter I was a great dreamer A dreamer she exclaimed with fine scorn are dreamers ever ambitious Indeed they are the most truly ambitious I retorted their dreams are so vast so infinite so far beyond all puny human strength and capacity that they perforce must remain dreamers always Epictetus himself I wish sighed Charmian I do wish What do you wish That you were not That I was not Such a pedant Pedant said I somewhat disconcerted And you have a way of echoing my words that is very irritating I beg your pardon said I feeling much like a chidden schoolboy and I am sorry you should think me a pedant And you are so dreadfully precise and serious she continued Am I Charmian And so very solemn and austere and so ponderous and egotistical and calm yes you are hatefully calm and placid aren t you Peter And after I had smoked thoughtfully awhile I sighed Yes I fear I may seem so Oh I forgive you Thank you Though you needn t be so annoyingly humble about it said she and frowned and even while she frowned laughed and shook her head And pray why do you laugh Because oh Peter you are such a boy So you told me once before said I biting my pipe stem viciously Did I Peter You also called me a lamb I remember at least you suggested it Did I Peter and she began to laugh again but stopped all at once and rose to her feet Peter said she with a startled note in her voice don t you hear something Yes said I Some one is coming Yes And they are coming this way Yes Oh how can you sit there so quietly Do you think she began and stopped staring into the shadows with wide eyes I think said I knocking the ashes from my pipe and laying it on the bench beside me that all things considered you were wiser to go into the cottage for a while No oh I couldn t do that You would be safer perhaps I am not a coward I shall remain here of course But I had rather you went inside And I much prefer staying where I am Then I must ask you to go inside Charmian No indeed my mind is made up Then I insist Charmian mister Vibart she exclaimed throwing up her head you forget yourself I think I permit no one to order my going and coming and I obey no man s command Then I beg of you And I refuse sir my mind is made up And mine also said I rising Why what what are you going to do she cried retreating as I advanced towards her I am going to carry you into the cottage You would not dare If you refuse to walk how else can you get there said I Anger amazement indignation all these I saw in her eyes as she faced me but anger most of all Oh you would not dare she said again and with a stamp of her foot Indeed yes I nodded And now her glance wavered beneath mine her head drooped and with a strange little sound that was neither a laugh nor a sob and yet something of each she turned upon her heel ran into the cottage and slammed the door behind her CHAPTER XIII A PEDLER IN ARCADIA The cottage as I have said was entirely hidden from the chance observer by reason of the foliage ash alder and bramble flourished luxuriantly growing very thick and high with here and there a great tree but upon one side there was a little grassy glade or clearing rather some ten yards square and it was towards this that my eyes were directed as I reseated myself upon the settle beside the door and waited the coming of the unknown Though the shadows were too deep for my eyes to serve me yet I could follow the newcomer s approach quite easily by the sound he made indeed I was particularly struck by the prodigious rustling of leaves Whoever it was must be big and bulky I thought and clad probably in a long trailing garment All at once I knew I was observed for the sounds ceased and I heard nothing save the distant bark of a dog and the ripple of the brook near by I remained there for maybe a full minute very still only my fists clenched themselves as I sat listening and waiting and that minute was an hour You won t be wantin ever a broom now The relief was so sudden and intense that I had much ado to keep from laughing outright You won t be wantin ever a broom now inquired the voice again No I answered nor yet a fine leather belt with a steel buckle made in Brummagem as ever was Oh it s you is it said the Pedler and forthwith Gabbing Dick stepped out of the shadows brooms on shoulder and bulging pack upon his back at sight of which the leafy tumult of his approach was immediately accounted for So it s you is it he repeated setting down his brooms and spitting lugubriously at the nearest patch of shadow Yes I answered but what brings you here I be goin to sleep ere my chap Oh you don t mind the ghost then Oh Lord no Theer be only two things as I can t abide trees as ain t trees is one on em an women s t other Women Come didn t I once tell you I were married You did Very well then Trees as ain t trees is bad enough Lord knows but women s worse ah said the Pedler shaking his head a sight worse Ye see trees ain t got tongues leastways not as I ever heerd tell on an a tree never told a lie or ate a apple did it What do you mean by ate an apple I means as a tree can t tell a lie or eat a apple but a woman can tell a lie which she does frequent an as for apples But I began Eve ate a apple didn t she The Scriptures say so I nodded An told a lie arterwards didn t she So we are given to understand Very well then said the Pedler there y are and he turned to spit into the shadow again Wot s more he continued twere a woman as done me out o my birthright How so Why twere Eve as got us druv out o the Gardin o Eden weren t it If it adn t been for Eve I might ha been livin on milk an oney ah an playin wi butterflies stead o bein married an peddlin these ere brooms Don t talk to me o women my chap I can t abide em bah if theer s any trouble afoot you may take your Bible oath as theer s a woman about some eres theer allus is Do you think so I knows so ain t I a earin an a seein such all day an every day theer s Black Jarge for one What about him What about im repeated the Pedler w y ain t is life been ruined broke wore away by one o them Eves very well then What do you mean how has his life been ruined Oh the usual way of it Jarge loves a gell gell loves Jarge sugar ain t sweeter very well then Along comes another cove a strange cove a cove wi nice white ands an soft takin ways e talks wi er walks wi er smiles at er an pore Jarge ain t nowheeres pore Jarge s cake is dough ah an doughy dough at that How do you come to know all

thoughtfully into the shadow again You won t be wantin ever a broom I think you said No said I Very well then he nodded and lifting his brooms made towards the cottage door Where are you going To sleep in this ere empty ut But it isn t empty So much the better nodded the Pedler good night and with the words he laid his hand upon the door but as he did so it opened and Charmian appeared The Pedler fell back three or four paces staring with round eyes By Goles he exclaimed So you are married then Now when he said this I felt suddenly hot all over even to the very tips of my ears and for the life of me I could not have looked at Charmian Why why I began but her smooth soft voice came to my rescue No he is not married said she far from it Not said the Pedler so much the better marriage ain t love no nor love ain t marriage I m a married cove myself so I know what I m a sayin if folk do talk an shake their eads over ye w y let em only don t don t go a spilin things by gettin churched You re a woman but you re a fine un a dasher by Goles nice an straight backed an round an plump if I was this ere cove now I know what Here said I hastily here sell me a broom The Pedler drew a broom from his bundle and passed it to me One shillin and sixpence said he which sum I duly paid over Don t he continued pocketing the money and turning to Charmian don t go spilin things by lettin this young cove go a marryin an a churchin ye nobody never got married as didn t repent it some time or other an wot s more when Marriage comes in at the door Love flies out up the chimbley an there y are Now if you loves this young cove w y very good if this ere young cove loves you which ain t to be wondered at so much the better but don t don t go a marryin each other an as for the children Come I ll take a belt give me a belt said I more hastily than before A belt said the Pedler A belt yes Wi a fine steel buckle made in Yes yes said I Two shillin an sixpence said the Pedler When I saw you last time you offered much the same belt for a shilling I demurred Ah nodded the Pedler but belts is riz arf a crown s the price take it or leave it It s getting late said I slipping the money into his hand and I ll wish you good night You re in a urry about it ain t you Yes Ah to be sure nodded the fellow looking from me to Charmian with an evil leer early to bed an Come get off said I angrily Wot are ye goin to turn me away at this time o night It is not so far to Sissinghurst said I But Lord I wouldn t disturb ye an there s two rooms ain t there There are plenty of comfortable beds to be had at The Bull So you won t gi e me a night s shelter eh No I answered greatly annoyed by the fellow s persistence An you don t want to buy nothin for the young woman a necklace or say a pair o garters But here meeting my eye he shouldered his brooms hastily and moved off And after he had gone some dozen yards or so he paused and turned Very well then he shouted I opes as you gets your ead knocked off ah an gets it knocked off soon Having said which he spat up into the air towards me and trudged off CHAPTER XIV CONCERNING BLACK GEORGE S LETTER It was with a feeling of great relief that I watched the fellow out of sight nevertheless his very presence seemed to have left a blight upon all things for he viewing matters with the material eye of Common sense had thereby contaminated them even the air seemed less pure and sweet than it had been heretofore so that glancing over my shoulder I was glad to see that Charmian had re entered the cottage Here said I to myself here is Common sense in the shape of a half witted peddling fellow blundering into Arcadia in the shape of a haunted cottage a woman and a man Straightway our Pedler being Common sense misjudges us as indeed would every other common sense individual the world over for Arcadia being of itself abstract and immaterial is opposed to and incapable of being understood by concrete common sense and always will be and there s the rub And yet said I thanks to the Wanderer of the Roads who built this cottage and hanged himself here and thanks to a Highland Scot who performed wonderfully on the bagpipes there is little chance of any common sense vagrant venturing near Arcadia again at least until the woman is gone or the man is gone or Here going to rub my chin being somewhat at a loss I found that I had been standing all this while the broom in one hand and the belt in the other and now hearing a laugh behind me I turned and saw Charmian was leaning in the open doorway watching me And so you are the the cove with the white hands and the taking ways are you Peter Why you were actually listening then Why of course I was That said I that was very undignified But very feminine Peter Hereupon I threw the belt from me one way and the broom the other and sitting down upon the bench began to fill any pipe rather awkwardly being conscious of Charmian s mocking scrutiny Poor poor Black George she sighed What do you mean by that said I quickly Really I can almost understand his being angry with you Why You walked with her and talked with her Peter like Caesar you came you saw you conquered Here I dragged my tinder box from my pocket so awkwardly as to bring the lining with it And even smiled at her Peter and you so rarely smile Having struck flint and steel several times without success I thrust the tinder box back into my pocket and fixed my gaze upon the moon Is she so very pretty Peter I stared up at the moon without answering I wonder if you bother her with your Epictetus and and dry as dust quotations I bit my lips and stared up at the moon Or perhaps she likes your musty books and philosophy But presently finding that I would not speak Charmian began to sing very sweet and low as if to herself yet when I chanced to glance towards her I found her mocking eyes still watching me Now the words of her song were these O my luve s like a red red rose That s newly sprung in June O my luve s like the melodie That s sweetly played in tune And so at last unable to bear it any longer I rose and taking my candle went into my room and closed the door But I had been there scarcely five minutes when Charmian knocked Oh Peter I wish to speak to you please Obediently I opened the door What is it Charmian You dropped this from your pocket when you took out your tinder box so clumsily said she holding towards me a crumpled paper And looking down at it I saw that it was Black George s letter to Prudence Now as I took it from her I noticed that her hand trembled while in her eyes I read fear and trouble and seeing this I was for a moment unwontedly glad and then wondered at myself You did not read it of course said I well knowing that she had Yes Peter it lay open and Then said I speaking my thought aloud you know that she loves George He means you harm said she speaking with her head averted and if he killed you I should be spared a deal of sorrow and and mortification and other people would be no longer bothered by Epictetus and dry as dust quotations She turned suddenly and crossing to the open doorway stood leaning there But indeed I went on hurriedly there is no chance of such a thing happening not the remotest Black George s bark is a thousand times worse than his bite this letter means nothing and er nothing at all I ended somewhat lamely for she had turned and was looking at me over her shoulder If he has to wait and wait and follow you and follow you said she in the same low tone Those are merely the words of a half mad pedler said I And your blood will go soaking and soaking into the grass Our Pedler has a vivid imagination said I lightly But she shook her head and turned to look out upon the beauty of the night once more while I watched her chin in hand I was angry with you to night Peter said she at length because you ordered me to do something against my will and I did it and so I tried to torment you you will forgive me for that won t you There is nothing to forgive nothing and good night Charmian Here she turned and coming to me gave me her hand Charmian Brown will always think of you as a Blacksmith said I As a blacksmith she repeated looking at me with a gleam in her eyes but oftener as a Pedant said I As a pedant she repeated obediently but most of all as a Well said I As a man she ended speaking with bent head And here again I was possessed of a sudden gladness that was out of all reason as I immediately told myself Your hand is very small said I finding nothing better to say smaller even than I thought Is it and she smiled and glanced up at me beneath her lashes for her head was still bent And wonderfully smooth and soft Is it said she again but this time she did not look up at me Now another man might have stooped and kissed those slender shapely fingers but as for me I loosed them rather suddenly and once more bidding her good night re entered my own chamber and closed the door But to night lying upon my bed I could not sleep and fell to watching the luminous patch of sky framed in my open casement I thought of Charmian of her beauty of her strange whims and fancies her swift changing moods and her contrariness comparing her in turn to all those fair women I had ever read of or dreamed over in my books Little by little however my thoughts drifted to Gabbing Dick and Black George and with my mind s eye I could see him as he was perhaps at this very moment fierce eyed and grim of mouth sitting beneath some hedgerow while knife in hand he trimmed and trimmed his two bludgeons one of which was to batter the life out of me From such disquieting reflections I would turn my mind to sweet eyed Prudence to the Ancient the forge and the thousand and one duties of the morrow I bethought me once more of the storm of the coming of Charmian of the fierce struggle in the dark of the Postilion and of Charmian again And yet in despite of me my thoughts would revert to George and I would see myself even as the Pedler pictured me out in some secluded corner of the woods lying stiffly upon my back with glassy eyes staring up sightlessly through the whispering leaves above while my blood soaked and soaked into the green and with a blackbird singing gloriously upon my motionless breast CHAPTER XV WHICH BEING IN PARENTHESIS MAY BE SKIPPED IF THE READER SO DESIRE As this life is a Broad Highway along which we must all of us pass whether we will or no as it is a thoroughfare sometimes very hard and cruel in the going and beset by many hardships sometimes desolate and hatefully monotonous so also must its aspect sooner or later change for the better and the stony track overpassed the choking heat and dust left behind we may reach some green refreshing haven shady with trees and full of the cool sweet sound of running waters Then who shall blame us if we pause unduly in this grateful shade and lying upon our backs a while gaze up through the swaying green of trees to the infinite blue beyond ere we journey on once more as soon we must to front whatsoever of good or evil lies waiting for us in the hazy distance To just such a place am I now come in this my history the record of a period which I afterwards remembered as the happiest I had ever known the memory of which must remain with me green and fragrant everlastingly If in the forthcoming pages you shall find over much of Charmian I would say in the first place that it is by her and upon her that this narrative hangs and in the second place that in this part of my story I find my greatest pleasure though here indeed I am faced with a great difficulty seeing that I must depict as faithfully as may be that most difficult that most elusive of all created things to wit a woman Truly I begin to fear lest my pen fail me altogether for the very reason that it is of Charmian that I would tell and of Charmian I understand little more than nothing for what rule has ever been devised whereby a woman s mind may be accurately gauged and who of all those wise ones who have written hitherto poets romancers or historians has ever fathomed the why and wherefore of the Mind Feminine A fool indeed were I to attempt a thing impossible I do but seek to show her to you as I saw her and to describe her in so far as I learned to know her And yet how may I begin I might tell you that her nose was neither arched nor straight but perfect none the less I might tell you of her brows straight and low of her eyes long and heavy lashed of her chin firm and round and dimpled and yet that would not be Charmian For I could not paint you the scarlet witchery of her mouth with its sudden bewildering changes nor show you how sweetly the lower lip curved up to meet its mate I might tell you that to look into her eyes was like gazing down into very deep water but I could never give you their varying beauty nor the way she had with her lashes nor can I ever describe her rich warm coloring nor the lithe grace of her body Thus it is that I misdoubt my pen of its task and fear that when you shall have read these pages you shall at best have caught but a very imperfect reflection of Charmian as she really is Wherefore I will waste no more time or paper upon so unprofitable a task but hurry on with my narrative leaving you to find her out as best you may CHAPTER XVI CONCERNING AMONG OTHER MATTERS THE PRICE OF BEEF AND THE LADY SOPHIA SEFTON OF CAMBOURNE Charmian sighed bit the end of her pen and sighed again She was deep in her housekeeping accounts adding and subtracting and between whiles regarding the result with a rueful frown Her sleeves were rolled up over her round white arms and I inwardly wondered if the much vaunted Phryne s were ever more perfect in their modelling or of a fairer texture Had I possessed the genius of a Praxiteles I might have given to the world a masterpiece of beauty to replace his vanished Venus of Cnidus but as it happened I was only a humble blacksmith and she a fair woman who sighed and nibbled her pen and sighed again What is it Charmian Compound addition Peter and I hate figures I detest loathe and abominate them especially when they won t balance Then never mind them said I Never mind them indeed the idea Sir How can I help minding them when living costs so much and we so poor Are we said I Why of course we are Yes to be sure I suppose we are said I dreamily Lais was beautiful Thais was alluring and Berenice was famous for her beauty but then could either of them have shown such arms so long so graceful in their every movement so subtly rounded in their lines arms which for all their seeming firmness must I thought be wonderfully soft to the touch and smooth as ivory and which found a delicate sheen where the light kissed them We have spent four shillings for meat this week Peter said Charmian glancing up suddenly Good said I Nonsense sir four shillings is most extravagant Oh is it Charmian Why of course it is Oh said I yes perhaps it is Perhaps said she curling her lip at me perhaps indeed Having said which Charmian became absorbed in her accounts again and I in Charmian In Homer we may read that the loveliness of Briseis caused Achilles much sorrow Ovid tells us that Chione was beautiful enough to inflame two gods and that Antiope s beauty drew down from heaven the mighty Jove himself and yet was either of them formed and shaped more splendidly than she who sat so near me frowning at what she had written and petulantly biting her pen Impossible said I so suddenly that Charmian started and dropped her pen which I picked up feeling very like a fool What did you mean by impossible Peter I was thinking merely Then I wish you wouldn t think so suddenly next time I beg your pardon Nor be so very emphatic about it No said I er no Hereupon deigning to receive her pen back again she recommenced her figuring while I began to fill my pipe Two shillings for tea Excellent said I I do wish she sighed raising her head to shake it reproachfully at me that you would be a little more sensible I ll try Tea at twelve shillings a pound is a luxury Undoubtedly And to pay two shillings for a luxury when we are so poor is sinful Is it Charmian Of course it is Oh said I and yet life without tea more especially as you brew it would be very stale flat and unprofitable and Bacon and eggs one shilling and fourpence she went on consulting her accounts Ah said I not venturing on good this time Butter one shilling Hum said I cautiously and with the air of turning this over in my mind Vegetables tenpence To be sure said I nodding my head tenpence certainly And bread Peter this in a voice of tragedy eightpence Excellent said I recklessly whereat Charmian immediately frowned at me Oh Peter said she with a sigh of resignation you possess absolutely no idea of proportion Here we pay four shillings for meat and only eightpence for bread had we spent less on luxuries and more on necessaries we should have had money in hand instead of let me see and she began adding up the various items before her with soft quick little pats of her fingers on the table Presently having found the total she leaned back in her chair and summoning my attention with a tap of her pen announced We have spent nine shillings and tenpence Peter Good indeed said I Leaving exactly twopence over A penny for you and a penny for me I fear I am a very bad housekeeper Peter On the contrary You earn ten shillings a week Well And here is exactly twopence left oh Peter You are forgetting the tea and the beef and and the other luxuries said I struck by the droop of her mouth But you work so very very hard and earn so little and that little I work that I may live Charmian and lo I am alive And dreadfully poor And ridiculously happy I wonder why said she beginning to draw designs on the page before her Indeed though I have asked myself that question frequently of late I have as yet found no answer unless it be my busy care free life with the warm sun about me and the voice of the wind in the trees Yes perhaps that is it And yet I don t know I went on thoughtfully for now I come to think of it my life has always been busy and care free and I have always loved the sun and the sound of wind in trees yet like Horace have asked What is Happiness and looked for it in vain and now here in this out of the world spot working as a village smith it has come to me all unbidden and unsought which is very strange Yes Peter said Charmian still busy with her pen Upon consideration I think my thanks are due to my uncle for dying and leaving me penniless Do you mean that he disinherited you In a way yes he left me his whole fortune provided that I married a certain lady within the year A certain lady The Lady Sophia Sefton of Cambourne said I Charmian s pen stopped in the very middle of a letter and she bent down to examine what she had been writing Oh said she very softly the Lady Sophia Sefton of Cambourne Yes said I And your cousin Sir Maurice were the conditions the same in his case Precisely Oh said Charmian just as softly as before and this lady she will not marry you No I answered Are you quite sure Certain you see I never intend to ask her Charmian suddenly raised her head and looked at me Why not Peter Because should I ever marry a remote contingency and most improbable I am sufficiently self willed to prefer to exert my own choice in the matter moreover this lady is a celebrated toast and it would be most repugnant to me that my wife s name should ever have been bandied from mouth to mouth and hiccoughed out over slopping wineglasses The pen slipped from Charmian s fingers to the floor and before I could pick it up she had forestalled me so that when she raised her head she was flushed with stooping Have you ever seen this lady Peter Never but I have heard of her who has not What have you heard That she galloped her horse up and down the steps of saint Paul s Cathedral for one thing What more That she is proud and passionate and sudden of temper in a word a virago Virago said Charmian flinging up her head Virago I nodded though she is handsome I understand in a strapping way and I have it on very excellent authority that she is a black browed goddess a peach and a veritable plum Strapping is a hateful word Peter But very descriptive And doesn t she interest you a little Peter Not in the least said I And pray why not Because I care very little for either peaches or plums Or black browed goddesses Peter Not if she is big and strapping and possesses a temper I suppose to such a philosopher as you a woman or a goddess black browed or not can scarcely compare with or hope to rival an old book can she sir Why that depends Charmian On what On the book said I Charmian rested her round elbows upon the table and setting her chin in her hands stared squarely at me Peter said she Yes Charmian If ever you did meet this lady I think Well I know What That you would fall a very easy victim I think not said I You would be her slave in a month three weeks or much less Preposterous I exclaimed If she set herself to make you That would be very immodest said I besides no woman can make a man love her Do your books teach you that Peter Here finding I did not answer she laughed and nodded her head at me You would be head over ears in love before you knew it I think not said I smiling You are the kind of man who would grow sick with love and never know what ailed him Any man in such a condition would be a pitiful ass said I Charmian only laughed at me again and went back to her scribbling Then if this lady married you said she suddenly you would be a gentleman of good position and standing Yes I suppose so and probably miserable And rich Peter I should have more than enough Instead of being a village blacksmith With just enough and absurdly happy and content I added which is far more desirable at least I think so Do you mean to say that you would rather exist here and make horseshoes all your life than live respected and rich And married to And married to the Lady Sophia Infinitely said I Then your cousin so far as you are concerned is free to woo and win her and your uncle s fortune And I wish him well of his bargain I nodded As for me I shall probably continue to live here and make horseshoes wifeless and content Is marriage so hateful to you In the abstract no for in my mind there exists a woman whom I think I could love very greatly but in the actual yes because there is no woman in all the world that is like this woman of my mind Is she so flawlessly perfect this imaginary woman She is one whom I would respect for her intellect Yes Whom I would honor for her proud virtue Yes Peter Whom I would worship for her broad charity her gentleness and spotless purity Yes Peter And love with all my strength for her warm sweet womanhood in a word she is the epitome of all that is true and womanly That is to say as you understand such things sir and all your knowledge of woman and her virtues and failings you have learned from your books therefore misrepresented by history and distorted by romance it is utterly false and unreal And of course this imaginary creature of yours is ethereal bloodless sexless unnatural and quite impossible Now when she spoke thus I laid down my pipe and stared but before I could get my breath she began again with curling lip and lashes that drooped disdainfully I quite understand that there can be no woman worthy of mister Peter Vibart she whom he would honor with marriage must be specially created for him Ah but some day a woman a real live woman will come into his life and the touch of her hand the glance of her eyes the warmth of her breath will dispel this poor flaccid misty creature of his imagination who will fade and fade and vanish into nothingness And when the real woman has shown him how utterly false and impossible this dream woman was then mister Peter Vibart I hope she will laugh at you as I do and turn her back upon you as I do and leave you for the very superior very pedantic pedant that you are and scorn you as I do most of all because you are merely a creature With the word she flung up her head and stamped her foot at me and turning swept out through the open door into the moonlight Creature said I and so sat staring at the table and the walls and the floor and the rafters in a blank amazement But in a while my amazement growing I went and stood in the doorway looking at Charmian but saying nothing And as I watched she began to sing softly to herself and putting up her hand drew the comb from her hair so that it fell down rippling about her neck and shoulders And singing softly thus she shook her hair about her so that I saw it curled far below her waist stooped her head and parting it upon her neck drew it over either shoulder whence it flowed far down over her bosom in two glorious waves for the moon peeping through the rift in the leaves above sent down her beams to wake small fires in it that came and went and winked with her breathing Charmian you have glorious hair said I speaking on the impulse a thing I rarely do But Charmian only combed her tresses and went on singing to herself Charmian said I again what did you mean when you called me a creature Charmian went on singing You called me a pedant once before to be told that I am superior also is most disquieting I fear my manner must be very unfortunate to afford you such an opinion of me Charmian went on singing Naturally I am much perturbed and doubly anxious to know what you wish me to understand by the epithet creature Charmian went on singing Wherefore seeing she did not intend to answer me I presently re entered the cottage Now it is ever my custom when at all troubled or put out in any way to seek consolation in my books hence I now took up my Homer and trimming the candles sat down at the table In a little while Charmian came in still humming the air of her song and not troubling even to glance in my direction Some days before at her request I had brought her linen and lace and ribands from Cranbrook and these she now took out together with needle and cotton and sitting down at the opposite side of the table began to sew She was still humming and this of itself distracted my mind from the lines before me moreover my eye was fascinated by the gleam of her flying needle and I began to debate within myself what she was making It whatever it might be was ruffled and edged with lace and caught here and there with little bows of blue riband and from these and divers other evidences I had concluded it to be a garment of some sort and was casting about in my mind to account for these bows of riband when glancing up suddenly she caught my eye whereupon for no reason in the world I felt suddenly guilty to hide which I began to search through my pockets for my pipe On the mantelshelf said she What is Your pipe Thank you said I and reached it down What are you reading she inquired is it of Helen or Aspasia or Phryne Neither it is the parting of Hector and Andromache I answered Is it very interesting Yes Then why do your eyes wander so often from the page I know many of the lines by heart said I And having lighted my pipe I took up the book and once more began to read Yet I was conscious all the time of Charmian s flashing needle also she had begun to hum again And after I had endeavored to read and Charmian had hummed for perhaps five minutes I lowered my book and sighing glanced at her I am trying to read Charmian So I see And your humming confuses me It is very quiet outside Peter But I cannot read by moonlight Charmian Then don t read Peter Here she nibbled her thread with white teeth and held up what she had been sewing to view the effect of a bow of riband with her head very much on one side And I inwardly wondered that she should spend so much care upon such frippery all senseless bows and laces To hum is a very disturbing habit said I To smoke an evil smelling pipe is worse much worse Peter I beg your pardon said I and laid the offending object back upon the mantel Are you angry Peter Not in the least I am only sorry that my smoking annoyed you had I known before It didn t annoy me in the least But from what you said I understood No Peter you did not understand you never understand and I don t think you ever will understand anything but your Helens and Phrynes and your Latin and Greek philosophies and that is what makes you so very annoying and so so quaintly original But you certainly found fault with my pipe Naturally didn t you find fault with my humming Really said I really I fail to see Of course you do sighed Charmian Whereupon there fell a silence between us during which she sewed industriously and I went forth with brave Hector to face the mighty Achilles But my eye had traversed barely twenty lines when Peter Yes Do you remember my giving you a locket Yes Where is it Oh I have it still somewhere Somewhere sir she repeated glancing at me with raised brows Somewhere safe said I fixing my eyes upon my book It had a riband attached hadn t it Yes A pink riband if I remember yes pink No it was blue said I unguardedly Are you sure Peter And here glancing up I save that she was watching me beneath her lashes Yes I answered that is I think so Then you are not sure Yes I am said I it was a blue riband and I turned over a page very ostentatiously Oh said Charmian and there was another pause during which I construed probably fifty lines or so Peter Well Where did you say it was now my locket I didn t say it was anywhere No you said it was somewhere in a rather vague sort of way Peter Well perhaps I did said I frowning at my book It is not very valuable but I prized it for association s sake Peter Ah yes to be sure said I feigning to be wholly absorbed I was wondering if you ever wear it Peter Wear it I exclaimed and glancing furtively down at myself I was relieved to see that there were no signs of a betraying blue riband wear it said I again why should I wear it Why indeed Peter unless it was because it was there to wear Suddenly she uttered an exclamation of annoyance and taking up a candle began looking about the floor What have you lost My needle I think it must have fallen under the table and needles are precious in this wilderness won t you please help me to find it With pleasure said I getting down upon my hands and knees and together we began to hunt for the lost needle Now in our search it chanced that we drew near together and once her hand touched mine and once her soft hair brushed my cheek and there stole over me a perfume like the breath of violets the fragrance that I always associated with her faint and sweet and alluring so much so that I drew back from further chance of contact and kept my eyes directed to the floor And after I had sought vainly for some time I raised my head and looked at Charmian to find her regarding me with a very strange expression What is it I inquired Have you found the needle Charmian sat back on her heels and laughed softly Oh yes I ve found the needle Peter that is I never lost it Why then what what did you mean For answer she raised her hand and pointed to my breast Then glancing hurriedly down I saw that the locket had slipped forward through the bosom of my shirt and hung in plain view I made an instinctive movement to hide it but hearing her laugh looked at her instead So this was why you asked me to stoop to find your needle Yes Peter Then you knew Of course I knew Hum said I A distant clock chimed eleven and Charmian began to fold away her work seeing which I rose and took up my candle And pray Well And pray said I staring hard at the flame of my candle how did you happen to find out Very simply I saw the riband round your neck days ago Good night Peter Oh said I Good night CHAPTER XVII THE OMEN 
8625-211892-0000	train-other-500	My lady sweet arise My lady sweet arise With everything that pretty is My lady sweet arise Arise arise It was morning and Charmian was singing The pure rich notes floated in at my open lattice
8625-211892-0001	train-other-500	and I heard the clatter of her pail as she went to fetch water from the brook Wherefore I presently stepped out into the sunshine my coat and neckcloth across my arm to plunge my head and face into the brook and carry back the heavy bucket for her as was my custom
none	none	 Being come to the brook I found the brimming bucket sure enough but no Charmian I was looking about wonderingly when she began to sing again and guided by this I espied her kneeling beside the stream 
8625-211892-0002	train-other-500	The water ran deep and very still just here overhung by ash and alder and willow whose slender curving branches formed a leafy bower wherein she half knelt half sat bending over to regard herself in the placid water
8625-211892-0003	train-other-500	For a long moment she remained thus
none	none	 studying her reflection intently in this crystal mirror and little by little her song died away Then she put up her hands and began to rearrange her hair with swift dexterous fingers apostrophizing her watery image the while in this wise My dear you are growing positively apple cheeked 
8625-211892-0004	train-other-500	I vow you are your enemies might almost call you strapping alack And then your complexion my dear your adorable complexion she went on with a rueful shake of her head
none	none	 you are as brown as a gipsy 
8625-211892-0005	train-other-500	not that you need go breaking your heart over it for between you and me my dear I think it rather improves you the pity of it is that you have no one to appreciate you properly to render to your charms the homage they deserve no one not a soul my dear
8625-211892-0006	train-other-500	your hermit bless you can see or think of nothing that exists out of a book which between you and me and the bucket yonder is perhaps just as well and yet heigho To be so lovely and so forlorn
8625-211892-0007	train-other-500	indeed I could shed tears for you if it would not make your eyelids swell and your classic nose turn red Here she sighed again and taking a tendril of hair between her fingers transformed it very cleverly into a small curl
8625-211892-0008	train-other-500	Yes your tan certainly becomes you my dear she went on nodding to her reflection not that he will ever notice dear heart no were you suddenly to turn as black as a Hottentot before his very eyes he would go on serenely smoking his pipe and talk to you of Epictetus
8625-211892-0009	train-other-500	heighho Sighing thus she broke off a spray of leaves and proceeded to twine them in among the lustrous coils of her hair bending over her reflection meanwhile and turning her head this way and that to note the effect
none	none	 Yes said she at last 
8625-211892-0010	train-other-500	nodding at her image with a satisfied air that touch of green sets off your gipsy complexion admirably my dear I could positively kiss you I vow I could and I am hard to please saint Anthony himself meeting you alone in the desert would at least have run away from you
none	none	 and that would have been some tribute to your charms 
8625-211892-0011	train-other-500	but our philosopher will just glance at you with his slow grave smile and tell you in his solemn affable way that it is a very fine morning heigho Here somewhat late in the day perhaps perceiving that I was playing eavesdropper
8625-211892-0012	train-other-500	I moved cautiously away and taking up the pail returned to the cottage I now filled the kettle and set it upon the fire and proceeded to spread the cloth a luxurious institution of Charmian s on which she insisted and to lay out the breakfast things
8625-211892-0013	train-other-500	In the midst of which however chancing to fall into a reverie I became oblivious of all things till roused by a step behind me and turning beheld Charmian standing with the glory of the sun about her like the Spirit of Summer herself
8625-211892-0014	train-other-500	broad of hip and shoulder yet slender and long of limb all warmth and life and long soft curves from throat to ankle perfect with vigorous youth from the leaves that crowned her beauty to the foot that showed beneath her gown And as I gazed upon her silent and wondering lo
8625-211892-0015	train-other-500	though her mouth was solemn yet there was laughter in her eyes as she spoke Well sir have you no greeting for me It is a very fine morning said I And now the merriment overflowed her eyes and she laughed yet blushed a little too and
8625-211892-0016	train-other-500	lowered her eyes from mine and said still laughing Oh Peter the teapot do mind the teapot Teapot I repeated and then I saw that I still held it in my hand Pray sir what might you be going to do with the teapot in one hand and that fork in the other
none	none	 I was going to make the tea I remember said I 
8625-211892-0017	train-other-500	Is that why you were standing there staring at the kettle while it boiled over I forgot all about the kettle said I So Charmian took the teapot from me and set about brewing the tea singing merrily the while
8625-211892-0018	train-other-500	Anon she began to fry the bacon giving each individual slice its due amount of care and attention but her eyes chancing to meet mine the song died upon her lip her lashes flickered and fell while up from throat to brow there crept a slow hot wave of crimson
8625-211892-0019	train-other-500	And in that moment I turned away and strode down to the brook Now it happened that I came to that same spot where she had leaned and flinging myself down I fell to studying my reflection in the water even as she had done Heretofore though I had paid scant heed to my appearance
8625-211892-0020	train-other-500	I had been content in a certain impersonal sort of way had dressed in the fashion and taken advantage of such adornments as were in favor as much from habit as from any set design but now lying beside the brook with my chin propped in my hands
8625-211892-0021	train-other-500	I began to study myself critically feature by feature as I had never dreamed of doing before Mirrored in the clear waters I beheld a face lean and brown and with lank black hair eyes dark and of a strange brilliance looked at me from beneath a steep prominence of brow
8625-211892-0022	train-other-500	I saw a somewhat high bridged nose with thin nervous nostrils a long cleft chin and a disdainful mouth Truly a saturnine face cold and dark and unlovely and thus even as I gazed
none	none	 the mouth grew still more disdainful and the heavy brow lowered blacker and more forbidding 
8625-211892-0023	train-other-500	And yet in that same moment I found myself sighing while I strove to lend some order to the wildness of my hair Fool said I and plunged my head beneath the water
none	none	 and held it there so long that I came up puffing and blowing whereupon I caught up the towel and fell to rubbing myself vigorously so that presently looking down into the water again 
8625-211892-0024	train-other-500	I saw that my hair was wilder than ever all rubbed into long elf locks Straightway I lifted my hands and would have smoothed it somewhat but checked the impulse Let be said I to myself turning away let be
8625-211892-0025	train-other-500	I am as I am and shall be henceforth in very truth a village blacksmith and content so to be absolutely content At sight of me Charmian burst out laughing the which though I had expected it angered me nevertheless
8625-211892-0026	train-other-500	Why Peter she exclaimed you look like A very low fellow said I say a village blacksmith who has been at his ablutions If you only had rings in your ears and a scarf round your head
none	none	 you would be the image of a Spanish brigand 
8625-211892-0027	train-other-500	or like the man Mina whose exploits The Gazette is full of a Spanish general I think A guerrilla leader said I taking my place at the table and a singularly cold blooded villain indeed I think it probable that we much resemble one another
none	none	 is it any wonder that I am shunned by my kind 
8625-211892-0028	train-other-500	avoided by the ignorant and regarded askance by the rest Why Peter said Charmian regarding me with grave eyes what do you mean I mean that the country folk hereabout go out of their way to avoid crossing my path not that I suppose they ever heard of Mina
8625-211892-0029	train-other-500	but because of my looks Your looks They think me possessed of the Evil Eye or some such folly may I cut you a piece of bread Oh Peter Already by divers honest hearted rustics I am credited with having cast a deadly spell upon certain unfortunate pigs
8625-211892-0030	train-other-500	with having fought hand to hand with the hosts of the nethermost pit and with having sold my soul to the devil may I trouble you to pass the butter Oh Peter how foolish of them And how excusable considering their ignorance and superstition said I
8625-211892-0031	train-other-500	Mine I am well aware is not a face to win me the heart of man woman or child they especially women and children share in common with dogs and horses
none	none	 that divine attribute which for want of a better name we call instinct 
8625-211892-0032	train-other-500	whereby they love or hate for the mere tone of a voice the glance of an eye
none	none	 the motion of a hand and the 
8625-211892-0033	train-other-500	love or hate once given the prejudice for or against is seldom wholly overcome Indeed said Charmian I believe in first impressions Being a woman said I Being a woman she nodded and the instinct of dog and child and woman has often proved true in the end
8625-211892-0034	train-other-500	Surely instinct is always true said I I d thank you for another cup of tea yet strangely enough dogs generally make friends with me very readily and the few children to whom I ve spoken have neither screamed nor run away from me
8625-211892-0035	train-other-500	Still as I said before I am aware that my looks are scarcely calculated to gain the love of man woman or child not that it matters greatly seeing that I am likely to hold very little converse with either There is one woman Peter
none	none	 to whom you have talked by the hour together 
8625-211892-0036	train-other-500	And who is doubtless weary enough of it all more especially of Epictetus and Trojan Helen Two lumps of sugar Peter Thank you Women are very like flowers I began That is a very profound remark sir more especially coming from one who has studied and knows
8625-211892-0037	train-other-500	womankind so deeply and it is a pity that they should be allowed to waste their sweetness on the desert air And philosophical blacksmiths Peter More so if they be poor blacksmiths I said philosophical Peter
8625-211892-0038	train-other-500	You probably find your situation horribly lonely here I went on after a pause Yes it s nice and lonely Peter And undoubtedly this cottage is very poor and mean and er humble Charmian smiled and shook her head
none	none	 But then Charmian Brown is a very humble person sir And you haven t even the luxury of a mirror to dress your hair by 
8625-211892-0039	train-other-500	Is it so very clumsily dressed sir No no said I hastily indeed I was thinking Well Peter That it was very beautiful Why you told me that last night come what do you think of it this morning With those leaves in it it is
8625-211892-0040	train-other-500	even more so Charmian laughed and rising swept me a stately curtesy After all sir we find there be exceptions to every rule You mean Even blacksmiths And in a while having finished my breakfast I rose
8625-211892-0041	train-other-500	and taking my hat bade Charmian Good morning and so came to the door But on the threshold I turned and looked back at her She had risen and stood leaning with one hand on the table now in the other she held the breadknife and her eyes were upon mine And lo wonder of wonders
8625-211892-0042	train-other-500	once again but this time sudden and swift up from the round full column of her throat up over cheek and brow there rushed that vivid tide of color her eyes grew suddenly deep and soft and then were hidden neath her lashes
8625-211892-0043	train-other-500	and in that same moment the knife slipped from her grasp and falling point downwards stood quivering in the floor between us an ugly thing that gleamed evilly Was this an omen a sign vouchsafed of that which dark and terrible
none	none	 was even then marching to meet us upon this Broad Highway 
8625-211892-0044	train-other-500	O Blind and more than blind Almost before it had ceased to quiver I stooped and plucking it from the floor gave it into her hand Now as I did so her fingers touched mine
none	none	 and moved by a sudden mad impulse I stooped and pressed my lips upon them 
8625-211892-0045	train-other-500	kissed them quick and fierce and so turned and hurried upon my way Yet as I went I found that the knife had cut my chin and that I was bleeding
none	none	 O Blind and more than blind 
8625-211892-0046	train-other-500	Surely this was a warning an omen to heed to shiver over despite the warm sun
none	none	 But seeing the blood I laughed and strode villagewards blithe of heart and light of foot O Blind and more than blind CHAPTER XVIII IN WHICH I HEAR NEWS OF SIR MAURICE VIBART Which I says Lord love me I plunged the iron back into the fire and turning my head espied a figure standing in the doorway and though the leather hat and short round jacket had been superseded by a smart groom s livery I recognized the Postilion So elp me Bob if this ain t a piece o luck he exclaimed and with the words he removed his hat and fell to combing his short thick hair with the handle of his whip I m glad you think so said I You can drownd me if it ain t said he And pray how is the gentleman who happened to fall and hurt himself if you remember in the storm Appened to fall an urt isself repeated

folks might take you for a gentleman meetin you off and like but I knows different As how Well I never eard of a gentleman turnin isself into a blacksmith afore for one thing Still one might I ventured No answered the Postilion with a decisive shake of the head it s ag in natur when a gentleman gets down in the world an as to do summ at for a livin e generally shoots isself ah an I ve knowed em do it too An then I ve noticed as you don t swear nor yet curse not even a damn Seldom said I but what of that I ve seed a deal o the quality in my time one way or another many s the fine gentleman as I ve druv or groomed for an never a one on em as didn t curse me ah said the Postilion sighing and shaking his head ow they did curse me specially one a young lord oncommon fond o me e

to strip me as naked as the palm o your and an to strip a lord or a earl or a gentleman as naked as the palm o your and an was to place us side by side where d be the difference We re both men both flesh and blood a n t we then where d be the difference Oo s to tell which is the lord an which is the postilion Who indeed said I setting down my hammer Jack is often as good as his master and a great deal better Why nobody nodded the Postilion not a soul till we opened our mouths an then twould be easy enough for my lord or earl or gentleman bein naked an not likin it which would only be nat ral would fall a swearin eavens ard damning everybody an cursin everything an never stop to think while I not bein born to it should stand there a shiverin an tryin a curse or two myself maybe but Lord mine wouldn t amount to nothin at all me not bein nat rally gifted nor yet born to it an this brings me round to er Her Ah er Number Two er as quarrelled wi Number One all the way from London er as run away from Number One wot about er Here he fell to combing his hair again with his whip handle while his quick bright eyes dodged from my face to the glowing forge and back again and his clean shaven lips pursed themselves in a soundless whistle And as I watched him it seemed to me that this was the question that had been in his mind all along Seeing she did manage to run away from him Number One she is probably very well I answered Ah to be sure very well you say ah to be sure said the Postilion apparently lost in contemplation of the bellows an where might she be now That I am unable to tell you said I and began to blow up the fire while the Postilion watched me sucking the handle of his whip reflectively You work oncommon ard drownd me if you don t Pretty hard I nodded An gets well paid for it p r aps Not so well as I could wish said I Not so well as e could wish nodded the Postilion apparently addressing the sledge hammer for his gaze was fixed upon it Of course not the arder a man works the wuss e gets paid ow much did you say you got a week I named no sum I replied Well ow much might you be gettin a week Ten shillings Gets ten shillin a week he nodded to the sledgehammer that ain t much for a chap like im kick me if it is Yet I make it do very well The Postilion became again absorbed in contemplation of the bellows indeed he studied them so intently viewing them with his head now on one side now on the other that I fell to watching him under my brows and so presently caught him furtively watching me Hereupon he drew his whip from his mouth and spoke Supposing said he and stopped Well I inquired and leaning upon my hammer I looked him square in the eye Supposing wot are you a staring at my feller You have said supposing twice well Well said he fixing his eye upon the bellows again supposing you was to make a guinea over an above your wages this week I should be very much surprised said I You would I certainly should Then why not surprise yourself You must speak more plainly said I Well then said the Postilion still with his gaze abstracted supposin I was to place a guinea down on that there anvil o yours would that elp you to remember where Number Two er might be No It wouldn t No A guinea s a lot o money It is I nodded An you say it wouldn t It would not said I Then say oh say two pun ten an ave done with it No said I shaking my head What not d ye say no to two pun ten I do Well let s say three pound I shook my head and drawing the iron from the fire began to hammer at it Well then shouted the Postilion for I was making as much din as possible say four five ten fifteen twenty five fifty Here I ceased hammering Tell me when you ve done said I You re a cool customer you are ah an a rum un at that I never see a rummer Other people have thought the same said I examining the half finished horseshoe ere I set it back in the fire Sixty guineas said the Postilion gloomily Come again said I Seventy then said he his gloom deepening Once more said I A undred one undred guineas said he removing his hat to mop at his brow Any more I inquired No returned the Postilion sulkily putting on his hat I m done Did he set the figure at a hundred guineas said I Im oh e s mad for er e is e d ruin isself body and soul for er e would but I ain t goin to ofer no more no woman as ever breathed no matter ow andsome an up standin is worth more n a undred guineas it ain t as if she was a blood mare an I m done Then I wish you good day But just think a undred guineas is a fortun It is said I Come think it over said the Postilion persuasively think it over now Let me fully understand you then said I you propose to pay me one hundred guineas on behalf of your master known heretofore as Number One for such information as shall enable him to discover the whereabouts of a certain person known as Her Number Two is that how the matter stands Ah that s ow it stands nodded the Postilion the money to be yours as soon as ever e lays ands on er is it a go No No No W y you must be stark starin mad that you must unless you re sweet on er yourself You talk like a fool said I angrily So you are sweet on er then Ass said I Fool And dropping my hammer I made towards him but he darted nimbly to the door where seeing I did not pursue he paused I may be a hass he nodded an I may be a fool but I don t go a fallin in love wi ladies as is above me an out o my reach and don t chuck away a undred guineas for one as ain t likely to look my way not me Which I begs leave to say hass yourself an likewise fool bah With which expletive he set his thumb to his nose spread out his fingers wagged them and swaggered off Above me and out of my reach One not likely to look my way And in due season having finished the horseshoe having set each tool in its appointed place in the racks and raked out the clinkers from the fire I took my hat and coat and closing the door behind me set out for the Hollow CHAPTER XIX HOW I MET BLACK GEORGE AGAIN AND WHEREIN THE PATIENT READER SHALL FIND A LITTLE BLOOD It was evening that time before the moon is up and when the earth is dark as yet and full of shadows Now as I went by some chance there recurred to me the words of an old song I had read somewhere years ago words written in the glorious brutal knightly days of Edward the First of warlike memory and the words ran thus For her love I carke and care For her love I droop and dare For her love my bliss is bare And I wax wan I wonder what poor love sick long dead and forgotten fool wrote that said I aloud For her love in sleep I slake For her love all night I wake For her love I mourning make More than any man Some doughty squire at arms or perhaps some wandering knight probably of a dark unlovely look who rode the forest ways with his thoughts full of Her and dreaming of Her loveliness Howbeit he was beyond all doubt a fool and a great one said I for it is to be inferred from these few words he has left us that his love was hopeless She was perhaps proud and of a high estate one who was above him and far beyond his reach who was not likely even to look his way Doubtless she was beautiful and therefore haughty and disdainful for disdainful pride is an attribute of beauty and ever was and ever will be and hence it came that our misfortunate squire or knight errant was scorned for his pains poor fool Which yet was his own fault after all and indeed his just reward for what has any squire at arms or lusty knight with the world before him and glory yet unachieved to do with love Love is a bauble a toy a pretty pastime for idle folk who have no thought above such away with it Bah And in my mind that is to say mentally I set my thumb to my nose and spread my fingers and wagged them even as the Postilion had done And yet despite this the words of the old song recurred again and again pathetically insistent voicing themselves in my footsteps so that to banish them I presently stood still And in that very moment a gigantic figure came bursting through the hedge clearing the ditch in a single bound and Black George confronted me Haggard of face with hair and beard matted and unkempt his clothes all dusty and torn he presented a very wild and terrible appearance and beneath one arm he carried two bludgeons The Pedler had spoken truly then and as I met the giant s smouldering eye I felt my mouth become suddenly parched and dry and the palms of my hands grew moist and clammy For a moment neither of us spoke only we looked at each other steadily in the eye and I saw the hair of his beard bristle and he raised one great hand to the collar of his shirt and tore it open as if it were strangling him George said I at last and held out my hand George never stirred Won t you shake hands George His lips opened but no words came Had I known where to look for you I should have sought you out days ago I went on as it is I have been wishing to meet you hoping to set matters right Once again his lips opened but still no word came You see Prudence is breaking her heart over you A laugh burst from him sudden and harsh You m a liar said he and his voice quavered strangely I speak gospel truth said I I be nowt to Prue since the day you beat me at th ammer throwin an ye know it Prudence loves you and always has said I Go back to her George go back to her and to your work be the man I know you are go back to her she loves you If you still doubt my word here read that and I held out his own letter the letter on which Prudence had written those four words George I love you He took it from me crumpled it slowly in his hand and tossed it into the ditch You m a liar said he again an a coward And you said I you are a fool a blind gross selfish fool who in degrading yourself in skulking about the woods and lanes is bringing black shame and sorrow to as sweet a maid as ever It don t need you to tell me what she be an what she bean t said Black George in a low repressed voice I knowed er long afore you ever set eyes on er grew up wi er I did an I bean t deaf nor blind Ye see I loved er all my life that s why one o us two s a goin to lie out ere all night ah an all to morrow likewise if summun don t chance to find us saying which he forced a cudgel into my hand What do you mean George I means as if you don t do for me then I be a goin to do for ee But why I cried in God s name why I be slow p r aps an thick p raps but I bean t a fule come man if she be worth winnin she be worth fightin for But I tell you she loves Black George and no other she never had any thought of me or I of her this is madness and worse and I tossed the cudgel aside An I tell ee broke in the smith his repression giving way before a fury as fierce as it was sudden I tell ee you be a liar an a coward I know I know I ve heerd an I ve seen your lyin coward s tongue sha n t save ee oh ecod wi your white face an tremblin ands you be a shame to the woman as loves ye an the woman as bore ye stand up I say or by God I ll do for ee and he raised his weapon Without another word I picked up the cudgel and pointing to a gate a little farther along the road I led the way into the meadow beyond On the other side of this meadow ran the lane I have mentioned before and beyond the lane was the Hollow and glancing thitherward I bethought me that supper would be ready and Charmian waiting for me just about now and I sighed I remember as I drew off my coat and laid it together with my hat under the hedge The moon was beginning to rise casting the magic of her pale loveliness upon the world and as I rolled up my sleeves I glanced round about me with an eye that strove to take in the beauty of all things of hedge and tree and winding road the gloom of wood the sheen of water and the far soft sweep of hill and dale Over all these my glance lingered yearningly for it seemed to me that this look might be my last And now as I stooped and gripped my weapon I remembered how I had that morning kissed her fingers and I was strangely comforted and glad The night air which had been warm heretofore struck chilly now and as I stood up fronting Black George I shivered seeing which he laughed short and fierce and with the laugh came at me striking downwards at my head as he came and tough wood met tough wood with a shock that jarred me from wrist to shoulder To hit him upon the arm and disable him was my one thought and object I therefore watched for an opening parrying his swift strokes and avoiding his rushes as well as I might Time and again our weapons crashed together now above my head now to right or left sometimes rattling in quick succession sometimes with pauses between strokes pauses filled in with the sound of heavy breathing and the ceaseless thud of feet upon the sward I was already bruised in half a dozen places my right hand and arm felt numb and with a shooting pain in the shoulder that grew more acute with every movement my breath also was beginning to labor Yet still Black George pressed on untiring relentless showering blow on blow while my arm grew ever weaker and weaker and the pain in my shoulder throbbed more intensely How long had we fought five minutes ten half an hour an hour I could see the sweat gleaming upon his cheek his eyes were wild his mouth gaped open and he drew his breath in great sobbing pants But as I looked his cudgel broke through my tired guard and taking me full upon the brow drove me reeling back my weapon slipped from my grasp and blinded with blood I staggered to and fro like a drunken man and presently slipped to the grass And how sweet it was to lie thus with my cheek upon kind mother earth to stretch my aching body and with my weary limbs at rest But Black George stood above me panting and as his eyes met mine he laughed a strange sounding broken laugh and whirled up his cudgel to beat out my brains even as the Pedler had foretold to morrow the blackbird would sing upon my motionless breast and looking into Black George s eyes I smiled Get up he panted and lowered the cudgel Get up or by God I ll do for ee Sighing I rose and took the cudgel he held out to me wiping the blood from my eyes as I did so And now as I faced him once more all things vanished from my ken save the man before me he filled the universe and even as he leaped upon me I leaped upon him and struck with all my strength there was a jarring splintering shock and Black George was beaten down upon his knees but as dropping my weapon I stepped forward he rose and stood panting and staring at the broker cudgel in his hand George said I You m a bleedin Peter For that matter so are you Blood lettin be good for a man sometimes eases un It does I panted perhaps you are willing to hear reason now We be even so fur but fists be better nor sticks any day an I be goin to try ye wi fists Have we not bled each other sufficiently No cried George between set teeth theer be more nor blood lettin twixt you an me I said as ow one on us would lie out ere all night an so e shall by God come on fists be best arter all This was the heyday of boxing and while at Oxford I had earned some small fame at the sport But it was one thing to spar with a man my own weight in a padded ring with limited rounds governed by a code of rules and quite another to fight a man like Black George in a lonely meadow by light of moon Moreover he was well acquainted with the science as I could see from the way he shaped the only difference between us being that whereas he fought with feet planted square and wide apart I balanced myself upon my toes which is I think to be commended as being quicker and more calculated to lessen the impact of a blow Brief though the respite had been it had served me to recover my breath and though my head yet rung from the cudgel stroke and the blood still flowed freely getting every now and then into my eyes my brain was clear as we fronted each other for what we both knew must be the decisive bout The smith stood with his mighty shoulders stooped something forward his left arm drawn back his right flung across his chest and so long as we fought I watched that great fist and knotted forearm for though he struck oftener with his left it was in that passive right that I thought my danger really lay It is not my intention to chronicle this fight blow by blow enough and more than enough has already been said in that regard suffice it then that as the fight progressed I found that I was far the quicker as I had hoped and that the majority of his blows I either blocked or avoided easily enough Time after time his fist shot over my shoulder or over my head and time after time I countered heavily now on his body now on his face once he staggered and once I caught a momentary glimpse of his features convulsed with pain he was smeared with blood from the waist up but still he came on I fought desperately now savagely taking advantage of every opening for though I struck him four times to his once yet his blows had four times the weight of mine my forearms were bruised to either elbow and my breath came in gasps and always I watched that deadly right And presently it came with arm and shoulder and body behind it quick as a flash and resistless as a cannonball but I was ready and as I leaped I struck and struck him clean and true upon the angle of the jaw and spinning round Black George fell and lay with his arms wide stretched and face buried in the grass Slowly slowly he got upon his knees and thence to his feet and so stood panting hideous with blood and sweat bruised and cut and disfigured staring at me as one in amaze Now as I looked my heart went out to him and I reached forth my right hand George I panted Oh George But Black George only looked at me and shook his head and groaned Oh Peter said he you be a man Peter I ve fou t ah many s the time an no man ever knocked me down afore Oh Peter I I could love ee for it if I didn t hate the very sight of ee come on an let s get it over an done wi So once again fists were clenched and jaws set once again came the trampling of feet the hiss of breath and the thudding shock of blows given and taken A sudden jarring impact the taste of sulphur on my tongue a gathering darkness before my eyes and knowing this was the end I strove desperately to close with him but I was dazed blind my arms fell paralyzed and in that moment the Smith s right fist drove forward A jagged flame shot up to heaven the earth seemed to rush up towards me a roaring blackness engulfed me and then silence CHAPTER XX HOW I CAME UP OUT OF THE DARK Some one was calling to me a long way off Some one was leaning down from a great height to call to me in the depths and the voice was wonderfully sweet but faint faint because the height was so very high and the depths so very great And still the voice called and called and I felt sorry that I could not answer because as I say the voice was troubled and wonderfully sweet And little by little it seemed that it grew nearer this voice was it descending to me in these depths of blackness or was I being lifted up to the heights where I knew blackness could not be Ay indeed I was being lifted for I could feel a hand upon my brow a smooth cool hand that touched my cheek and brushed the hair from my forehead a strong gentle hand it was with soft fingers and it was lifting me up and up from the loathly depths which seemed more black and more horrible the farther I drew from them And so I heard the voice nearer and ever nearer until I could distinguish words and the voice had tears in it and the words were very tender Peter speak speak to me Peter Charmian said I within myself why truly whose hand but hers could have lifted me out of that gulf of death back to light and life Yet I did not speak aloud for I had no mind to yet a while Ah speak to me speak to me Peter How can you lie there so still and pale And now her arms were about me strong and protecting and my head was drawn down upon her bosom Oh Peter my Peter Nay but was this Charmian the cold proud Charmian Truly I had never heard that thrill in her voice before could this indeed be Charmian And lying thus with my head on this sweet pillow I could hear her heart whispering to me and it seemed that it was striving to tell me something striving striving to tell me something could I but understand ah could I but understand I waited for you so long so long Peter and the supper is all spoiled a rabbit Peter you liked rabbit and and oh God I want you don t you hear me Peter I want you want you and now her cheek was pressed to mine and her lips were upon my hair and upon my brow her lips Was this indeed Charmian and was I Peter Vibart Ah if I could but know what it was her heart was trying to tell me so quickly and passionately And while I lay listening listening something hot splashed down upon my cheek and then another and another her bosom heaved tumultuously and instinctively raising my arms I clasped them about her Don t I said and my voice was a whisper don t Charmian For a moment her clasp tightened about me she was all tenderness and clinging warmth then I heard a sudden gasp her arms loosened and fell away and so I presently raised my head and supporting myself upon my hand looked at her And then I saw that her cheeks were burning Peter Yes Charmian Did you She paused plucking nervously at the grass and looking away from me Well Charmian Did you hear Again she broke off and still her head was averted I heard your voice calling to me from a great way off and so I came Charmian Were you conscious when when I found you No I answered I was lying in a very deep black pit Here she looked at me again I I thought you were dead Peter My soul was out of my body until you recalled it You were lying upon your back by the hedge here and oh Peter your face was white and shining in the moonlight and there was blood upon it and you looked like one that is dead and she shivered And you have brought me back to life said I rising but being upon my feet I staggered giddily to hide which I laughed and leaned against a tree Indeed said I I am very much alive still and monstrously hungry you spoke of a rabbit I think A rabbit said Charmian in a whisper and as I met her eye I would have given much to have recalled that thoughtless speech I I think you did mention a rabbit said I floundering deeper So then you deceived me you lay there and deceived me with your eyes shut and your ears open taking advantage of my pity No no indeed no I thought myself still dreaming it it all seemed so unreal so so beyond all belief and possibility and I stopped aghast at my crass folly for with a cry she sprang to her feet and hid her face in her hands while I stood dumbfounded like the fool I was When she looked up her eyes seemed to scorch me And I thought mister Vibart a man of honor like a knight of his old time romances high and chivalrous oh I thought him a gentleman Instead of which said I speaking as it were despite myself instead of which you find me only a blacksmith a low despicable fellow eager to take advantage of your unprotected womanhood She did not speak standing tall and straight her head thrown back wherefore reading her scorn of me in her eyes seeing the proud contempt of her mouth a very demon seemed suddenly to possess me for certainly the laugh that rang from my lip proceeded from no volition of mine And yet madam my voice went on this despicable blacksmith fellow refused one hundred guineas for you to day Peter she cried and shrank away from me as if I had threatened to strike her Ah you start at that your proud lip trembles do not fear madam the sum did not tempt him though a large one Peter she cried again and now there was a note of appeal in her voice Indeed madam even so degraded a fellow as this blacksmith could not very well sell that which he does not possess could he And so the hundred guineas go a begging and you are still unsold Long before I had done she had covered her face again and coming near I saw the tears running out between her fingers and sparkling as they fell And once again the devil within me laughed loud and harsh But while it still echoed I had flung myself down at her feet Charmian I cried forgive me you will you must and kneeling before her I strove to catch her gown and kiss its hem but she drew it close about her and turning fled from me through the shadows Heedless of all else but that she was leaving me I stumbled to my feet and followed The trees seemed to beset me as I ran and bushes to reach out arms to stay me but I burst from them running wildly blunderingly for she was going Charmian was leaving me And so spent and panting I reached the cottage and met Charmian at the door She was clad in the long cloak she had worn when she came and the hood was drawn close about her face I stood panting in the doorway barring her exit Let me pass Peter By God no I cried and entering closed the door and leaned my back against it And after we had stood thus awhile each looking upon the other I reached out my hands to her and my hands were torn and bloody Don t go Charmian I mumbled don t go Oh Charmian I m hurt I didn t want you to know but you mustn t leave me I am not well it is my head I think I met Black George and he was too strong for me I m deaf Charmian and half blinded oh don t leave me I m afraid Charmian Her figure grew more blurred and indistinct and I sank down upon my knees but in the dimness I reached out and found her hands and clasped them and bowed my aching head upon them and remained thus a great while as it seemed to me And presently through the mist her voice reached me Oh Peter I will not leave you lean on me there there And little by little those strong gentle hands drew me up once more to light and life And so she got me to a chair and brought cool water and washed the blood and sweat from me as she had once before only now my hurts were deeper for my head grew beyond my strength to support and hung upon my breast and my brain throbbed with fire and the mist was ever before my eyes Are you in much pain Peter My head only my head Charmian there is a bell ringing there no it is a hammer beating And indeed I remembered little for a while save the touch of her hands and the soothing murmur of her voice until I found she was kneeling beside me feeding me with broth from a spoon Wherefore I presently took the basin from her and emptied it at a gulp and finding myself greatly revived thereby made some shift to eat of the supper she set before me So she presently came and sat beside me and ate also watching me at each morsel Your poor hands said she and looking down at them I saw that my knuckles were torn and broken and the fingers much swelled And yet said Charmian except for the cut in your head you are quite unmarked Peter He fought mostly for the body I answered and I managed to keep my face out of the way but he caught me twice once upon the chin lightly and once up behind the ear heavily had his fist landed fairly I don t think even you could have brought me back from those loathly depths Charmian And in a while supper being done she brought my pipe and filled it and held the light for me But my head throbbed woefully and for once the tobacco was flavorless so I sighed and laid the pipe by Why Peter said Charmian regarding me with an anxious frown can t you smoke Not just now Charmian said I and leaning my head in my hands fell into a sort of coma till feeling her touch upon my shoulder I started and looked up You must go to bed Peter No said I Yes Peter Very well Charmian yes I will go to bed and I rose Do you feel better now Peter Thank you yes much better Then why do you hold on to the chair I am still a little giddy but it will pass And Charmian you forgive Yes yes don t don t look at me like that Peter and oh good night foolish boy I am twenty five Charmian But as she turned away I saw that there were tears in her eyes Dressed as I was I lay down upon my bed and burying my head in the pillow groaned for my pain was very sore indeed I was to feel the effects of George s fist for many a day to come and it seems to me now that much of the morbid imaginings the nightly horrors and black despair that I endured in the time which immediately followed was chiefly owing to that terrible blow upon the head CHAPTER XXI OF THE OPENING OF THE DOOR AND HOW CHARMIAN BLEW OUT THE LIGHT He bestrode a powerful black charger and his armor glittered through the green And as he rode beneath the leafy arches of the wood he lifted up his voice and sang and the song was mournful and of a plaintive seeming and rang loud behind his visor bars therefore as I sat beside the freshet I hearkened to his song For her love I carke and care For her love I droop and dare For her love my bliss is bare And I wax wan Forth he rode from the shadowy woodland pacing very solemn and slow and thrice he struck his iron hand upon his iron breast For her love in sleep I slake For her love all night I wake For her love I mourning make More than any man Now being come to where I sat beside the brook he checked his horse and gazed full long upon me and his eyes shone from the gloom of his helmet Messire quoth be how like you my song But little sir to be plain with you not a whit I answered And beseech you wherefore Because it is folly away with it for if your head be full of such how shall you achieve any lasting good Glory Learning Power But sighing he shook his head quoth he O Blind One Glory is but a name Learning but a yearning emptiness and whither leadeth Ambition Man is a mote dancing in a sun ray the world a speck hanging in space All things vanish and pass utterly away save only True love and that abideth everlastingly tis sweeter than Life and stronger than Death and reacheth up beyond the stars and thus it is I pray you tell me where is she She She whom ye love I love no woman said I Liar cried he in a terrible voice and the voice was the voice of Black George And who are you that says so I demanded and stood upon my feet Look behold and know thyself O Blind and more than blind And leaning down he raised his visor so that the moonlight fell upon his face and the face I looked upon was my own and while I gazed he lifted up his voice and cried Ye Spirits of the Wood I charge ye who is he that rideth in the green dreaming ever of her beauty and sighing forth his love everlastingly Spirits of the Wood I charge ye And out of the gloom of the wood from every rustling leaf and opening bud came a little voice that rose and blended in a soft hushed chorus crying Peter Vibart Peter Vibart Spirits of the Wood I charge ye who is he that walketh to and fro in the world and having eyes seeth not and ears heareth not a very Fool of Love Once again the voices cried in answer Peter Vibart Peter Vibart Spirits of the Wood I charge ye who is he that shall love with a love mightier than most who shall suffer greatly for love and because of it who shall think of it by day and dream of it o nights who is he that must die to find love and the fulness of life O Spirits of the Wood I charge ye And again from out the green came the soft hushed chorus Peter Vibart Peter Vibart But even as I laughed came one from the wood with a horse and armor And the armor he girded on me and the horse I mounted And there in the moonlit glade we fought and strove together my Other Self and I And sudden and strong he smote me so that I fell down from my horse and lay there dead with my blood soaking and soaking into the grass And as I watched there came a blackbird that perched upon my breast carolling gloriously Yet little by little this bird changed and lo in its place was a new Peter Vibart standing upon the old and the New trampled the Old down into the grass and it was gone Then with his eyes on the stars the new Peter Vibart fell a singing and the words I sang were these For her love I carke and care For her love I droop and dare For her love my bliss is bare And I wax wan And thus there came into my heart that which had been all unknown undreamed of hitherto yet which once there could never pass away O Spirits of the Wood I charge ye who is he that counteth True love sweeter than Life greater than Wisdom stronger than Death O Spirits of the Wood I charge ye And the hushed voices chorused softly Peter Vibart Peter Vibart And while I listened one by one the voices ceased till there but one remained calling calling but ever soft and far away and when I would have gone toward this voice lo there stood a knife quivering in the ground before me that grew and grew until its haft touched heaven yet still the voice called upon my name very softly Peter Peter oh Peter I want you oh Peter wake wake I sat up in bed and as I listened grew suddenly sick and a fit of trembling shook me violently for the whisper was still in my ears and in the whisper was an agony of fear and dread indescribable Peter oh Peter I am afraid wake wake A cold sweat broke out upon me and I glared helplessly towards the door Quick Peter come to me oh God I strove to move but still I could not And now in the darkness hands were shaking me wildly and Charmian s voice was speaking in my ear The door it whispered the door Then I arose and was in the outer room with Charmian close beside me in the dark and my eyes were upon the door And then I beheld a strange thing for a thin line of white light traversed the floor from end to end Now as I watched this narrow line I saw that it was gradually widening and widening very slowly and with infinite caution the door was being opened from without In this remote place in this still dead hour of the night full of the ghostly hush that ever precedes the dawn there was something devilish something very like murder in its stealthy motion I heard Charmian s breath catch and in the dark her hand came and crept into mine and her fingers were cold as death And now a great anger came upon me and I took a quick step forward but Charmian restrained me No Peter she breathed not yet wait and wound her arms round mine In a corner near by stood that same trusty staff that had been the companion of my wanderings and now I reached and took it up balancing it in my hand And all the time I watched that line of light upon the floor widening and widening growing ever broader and more broad The minutes dragged slowly by while the line grew into a streak and the streak into a lane and upon the lane came a blot that slowly resolved itself into the shadow of a hand upon the latch Slowly slowly to the hand came a wrist and to the wrist an arm another minute and this maddening suspense would be over Despite Charmian s restraining clasp I crept a long pace nearer the softly moving door The sharp angle of the elbow was growing obtuse as the shadowy arm straightened itself Thirty seconds more I began to count and gripping my staff braced myself for what might be when with a sudden cry Charmian sprang forward and hurling herself against the door shut it with a crash Quick Peter she panted I was beside her almost as she spoke and had my hand upon the latch I must see who this was said I You are mad she cried Let me open the door Charmian No no I say no Whoever it was must not escape open the door Never never I tell you death is outside there s murder in the very air I feel it and dear God the door has no bolt They are gone now whoever they were said I reassuringly the danger is over if danger it could be called Danger cried Charmian I tell you it was death Yet after all it may have been only some homeless wanderer Then why that deadly silent caution True said I becoming thoughtful Bring the table Peter and set it across the door Surely the table is too light to But it will give sufficient warning not that I shall sleep again to night Oh Peter had I not been dreaming and happened to wake had I not chanced to look towards the door it would have opened wide and then oh horrible You were dreaming A hateful hateful dream and awoke in terror and being afraid glanced towards the door and saw it opening and now bring the table Peter Now groping about my hand encountered one of the candles and taking out my tinder box all unthinking I lighted it Charmian was leaning against the door clad in a flowing white garment a garment that was wonderfully stitched all dainty frills and laces with here and there a bow of blue riband disposed it would seem by the hand of chance and yet most wonderfully And up from this foam of laces her shoulders rose white and soft and dimpled sweeping up in noble lines to the smooth round column of her throat But as I stared at all this loveliness she gave a sudden gasp and stooped her head and crossed her hands upon her bosom while up over the snow of shoulder over neck and cheek and brow ebbed that warm crimson tide and I could only gaze and gaze till with a movement swift and light she crossed to that betraying candle and stooping blew out the light Then I set the table across the door having done which I stood looking towards where she yet stood Charmian said I Yes Peter To morrow Yes Peter I will make a bar to hold the door Yes Peter Two bars would be better perhaps Yes Peter You would feel safe then safer than ever Safer than ever Peter CHAPTER XXII IN WHICH THE ANCIENT DISCOURSES ON LOVE I am forging a bar for my cottage door such a bar as might give check to an army or resist a battering ram a bar that shall defy all the night prowlers that ever prowled a stout solid bar broad as my wrist and thick as my two fingers that looking upon it as it lies in its sockets across the door Charmian henceforth may sleep and have no fear The Ancient sat perched on his stool in the corner but for once we spoke little for I was very busy also my mind was plunged in a profound reverie And of whom should I be thinking but of Charmian and of the dimple in her shoulder Tis bewitched you be Peter said the old man suddenly prodding me softly with his stick bewitched as ever was and he chuckled Bewitched said I starting Ah theer you stand wi your ammer in your and a starin an a starin at nobody nor nothin leastways not as uman eye can see an a sighin an a sighin Did I indeed sigh Ancient Ah that ye did like a cow Peter or a orse eavy an tired like An slow you be an dreamy you as was so bright an spry theer s some fools like Joel Amos as might think as twere the work o ghostes or demons a castin their spells on ye or that some vampire ad bit ye in the night an sucked your blood as ye lay asleep but I know different you m just bewitched Peter and he chuckled again Who knows perhaps I am but it will pass whatever it is it will pass Don t ye be too sure o that theer s bewitchments an bewitchments Peter Hereupon the smithy became full of the merry din of my hammer and while I worked the Ancient smoked his pipe and watched me informing me between whiles that the Jersey cow was in calf that the hops seemed more than usually forward and that he had waked that morning with a touch o the rheumatics but otherwise he was unusually silent moreover each time that I happened to glance up it was to find him regarding me with a certain fixity of eye which at another time would have struck me as portentous Ye be palish this marnin Peter said he dabbing at me suddenly with his pipe stem shouldn t wonder if you was to tell me as your appetite was bad come now ye didn t eat much of a breakfus this marnin did ye I don t think I did Ancient A course not said the old man with a nod of profound approval it aren t to be expected Let s see it be all o four months since I found ye bean t it Four months and a few odd days I nodded and fell to work upon my glowing iron bar Ye ll make a tidy smith one o these days Peter said the old man encouragingly as I straightened my back and plunged the iron back into the fire Thank you Ancient Ay you ve larned to use a ammer purty well considerin though you be wastin your opportoonities shameful Peter shameful Am I Ancient Ay that ye be moon can t last much longer she be on the wane a ready Moon said I staring Ah moon nodded the old man theer s nowt like a moon Peter an if she be at the full so much the better But what have the moon and I to do with each other Ancient Old I be Peter a old old man but I were young once an I tell ee the moon as a lot more to do wi it than some folks think why Lord love ee theer wouldn t be near so many children a playin in the sun if it wasn t for the moon Ancient said I what might you be driving at Love Peter Love said I letting go the handle of the bellows An marriage Peter What in the world put such thoughts into your head You did Peter I Ah some men is born lovers Peter an you be one I never see such eyes as yourn afore so burnin ot they be Ah Peter some maid will see the lovelight aflame in em some day an droop er ead an blush an tremble for she ll know Peter she ll know maids was made to be loved Peter But Ancient I am not the kind of man women would be attracted by I love books and solitude and am called a pedant and besides I am not of a loving sort Some men Peter falls in love as easy as they falls out it comes to some soft an quiet like the dawn of a summer s day Peter but to others it comes like a gert an tur ble storm oh that it do Theer s a fire ready to burn up inside o ye at the touch o some woman s and or the peep o er eye ah a fire as ll burn an burn an never go out again not even if you should live to be as old as I be an you ll be strong an wild an fierce wi it an some day you ll find er Peter an she ll find you And said I staring away into the distance do you think that by any possible chance she might love me this woman Ay for sure said the Ancient for sure she will why don t ee up an ax er Wi a fine round moon over ead an a pretty maid at your elber it s easy enough to tell er you love er aren t it Indeed yes said I beginning to rub my chin very easy and I sighed An when you looks into a pair o sweet eyes an sees the shine o the moon in em why it aren t so very fur to er lips are it Peter No said I rubbing my chin harder than ever no and there s the danger of it Wheer s t danger Peter Everywhere I answered in her eyes in her thick soft hair the warmth of her breath the touch of her hand the least contact of her garments her very step I knowed it cried the Ancient joyfully peering at me under his brows I knowed it Knew what You be in love good lad good lad and he flourished his pipe in the air In love I exclaimed in love I Sure as sure But love according to Aristotle is Love Peter is what makes a man forget is breakfus an is work an is But I work very hard besides Love is what makes a man so brave as a lion Peter an fall a tremblin like a coward when She stands a lookin up at im love makes the green earth greener an the long road short ah almost too short sometimes the love of a woman comes betwixt a man an all evils an dangers why don t ee up an ax er Peter She d laugh at me Ancient Not she That soft low laugh of hers Well what o that Besides she hardly knows me The Ancient took out his snuff box and gave two loud double knocks upon the lid A woman knows a man sooner than a man knows a woman ah a sight sooner Why Lord bless ye Peter she as im all reckoned up long afore e knows for sure if er eyes be black uns or brown uns that she as Here he extracted a pinch of snuff As for Prudence she loves ee wi all er eart an soul Prudence said I staring Ah Prudence I be er grandfeyther an I know Prudence said I again She m a andsome lass an so pretty as a picter you said so yourself an what s more she m a sensible lass an ll make ye as fine a wife as ever was if only If only she loved me Ancient To be sure Peter But you

sure Certain Ow d ye know She told me so But why why shouldn t she love ye Why should she But I I d set my eart on it Peter It is very unfortunate said I and began blowing up the fire Peter Yes Ancient Do ee love she No Ancient The old man rose and hobbling forward tapped me upon the breast with the handle of his stick Then who was you a talkin of a while back bout er eyes an er air an er dress an bein afraid o them To be exact I don t know Ancient Oh Peter exclaimed the old man shaking his head I wonders at ye arter me a thinkin an a thinkin an a plannin an a plannin all these months

d never took the trouble to find ye at all And with this Parthian shot the old man sighed and turned his back upon me and tottered out of the forge CHAPTER XXIII HOW GABBING DICK THE PEDLER SET A HAMMER GOING IN MY HEAD Having finished my bars with four strong brackets to hold them I put away my tools and donned hat and coat It was yet early and there was besides much work waiting to be done but I felt unwontedly tired and out of sorts wherefore with my bars and brackets beneath my arm I set out for the Hollow From the hedges on either side of me came the sweet perfume of the honeysuckle and beyond the hedges the fields stood high with ripening corn a yellow heavy headed host nodding and swaying lazily I stood awhile to listen to its whisper as the gentle wind swept over it and to look down the long green alleys of the hop gardens beyond and at the end of one of these straight arched vistas there shone a solitary great star And presently lifting my eyes to the sky already deepening to evening and remembering how I had looked round me ere I faced Black George I breathed a sigh of thankfulness that I was yet alive with strength to walk within a world so beautiful Now as I stood thus I heard a voice hailing me and glancing about espied one some distance up the road who sat beneath the hedge whom upon approaching I recognized as Gabbing Dick the Pedler He nodded and grinned as I came up but in both there was a vague unpleasantness as also in the manner in which he eyed me slowly up and down You ve stood a lookin up into the sky for a good ten minutes said he And what if I have Nothin said the Pedler nothin at all though if the moon ad been up a cove might ha thought as you was dreamin of some Eve or other love sick folk always stares at the moon leastways so they tell me Any one as stares at the moon when e might be doin summ at better is a fool as great a fool as any man as stares at a Eve for a Eve never brought any man nothin but trouble and sorrer and never will no ow Don t frown young cove nor shake your ead for it s true wot s caused more sorrer an blood than them Eves Blood ah rivers of it Oceans of good blood s been spilt all along o women from the Eve as tricked old Adam to the Eve as tricks the like o me or say yourself Here he regarded me with so evil a leer that I turned my back in disgust Don t go young cove I ain t done yet and I got summ at to tell ye Then tell it said I stopping again struck by the fellow s manner and tell it quickly I m a comin to it as fast as I can ain t I Very well then You re a fine up standin young cove and may ave white ands which I don t see myself but no matter and may likewise be chock full o taking ways which though not noticin I won t go for to deny but a Eve s a Eve and always will be you ll mind as I warned you again em last time I see ye very well then Well said I impatiently Well nodded the Pedler and his eyes twinkled malevolently I says it again I warns you again You re a nice civil spoke young cove and quiet though I don t like the cock o your eye and mind I don t bear you no ill will though you did turn me from your door on a cold dark night It was neither a cold nor a dark night said I Well it might ha been mightn t it very well then Still I don t said the Pedler spitting dejectedly into the ditch I don t bear you no ard feelin s for it no ow me always makin it a pint to forgive them as woefully oppresses me likewise them as despitefully uses me it might ha been cold and dark wi ice and snow and I might ha froze to death but we won t say no more about it You ve said pretty well I think said I supposing you tell me what you have to tell me otherwise good night Very well then said the Pedler let s talk o summ at else still livin in the Oller I suppose Yes Ah well I come through there today said he grinning and again his eyes grew malevolent Indeed Ah indeed I come through this ere very arternoon and uncommon pretty everythin was lookin wi the grass so green and the trees so so Shady Shady s the word nodded the Pedler glancing up at me through his narrowed eyelids and chuckling A paradise you might call it ah a paradise or a garden of Eden wi Eve and the serpent and all and he broke out into a cackling laugh And in the look and the laugh indeed about his whole figure there was something so repellent so evil that I was minded to kick and trample him down into the ditch yet the leering triumph in his eyes held me Yes said I Ye see bein by I appened to pass the cottage and very pretty that looked too and nice and neat inside Yes said I And bein so near I appened to glance in at the winder and there sure enough I see er as you might say Eve in the gardin And a fine figure of a Eve she be and andsome wi it t ain t often as you see a maid the likes o er so proud and aughty like Well Well just as I appened to look in at the winder she appened to be standin wi an open book in er and a old leather book wi a broken cover Yes said I And she was a laughin and a pretty soft Eve s laugh it were too Yes said I And e were a lookin at the book over er shoulder The irons slipped from my grasp and fell with a harsh clang Ketches ye does it said the Pedler I did not speak but meeting my eye he scrambled hastily to his feet and catching up his pack retreated some little way down the road Ketches ye does it my cove he repeated turn me away from your door on a cold dark night would ye not as I bears you any ill will for it bein of a forgivin natur But I says to you I says look out a fine andsome lass she be wi er soft eyes and red lips and long white arms the eyes and lips and arms of a Eve and Eve tricked Adam didn t she and you ain t a better man nor Adam are ye very well then saying which he spat once more into the ditch and shouldering his pack strode away And after some while I took up my iron bars and trudged on towards the cottage As I went I repeated to myself over and over again the word Liar Yet my step was very slow and heavy and my feet dragged in the dust and somewhere in my head a small hammer had begun to beat soft and slow and regular but beating beating upon my brain Now the upper cover of my Virgil book was broken CHAPTER XXIV THE VIRGIL BOOK A man was leaning in the shadow of a tree looking down into the Hollow I could not see him very distinctly because though evening had scarcely fallen the shadows where he stood were very dense but he was gazing down into the Hollow in the attitude of one who waits For what for whom A sudden fit of shivering shook me from head to foot and while I yet shivered I grew burning hot the blood throbbed at my temples the small hammer was drumming much faster now and the cool night air seemed to be stifling me Very cautiously I began creeping nearer the passive figure while the hammer beat so loud that it seemed he must hear it where he stood a shortish broad shouldered figure clad in a blue coat He held his hat in his hand and he leaned carelessly against the tree and his easy assurance of air maddened me the more As he stood thus looking always down into the Hollow his neck gleamed at me above the collar of his coat wherefore I stooped and laying my irons in the grass crept on once more and as I went I kept my eyes upon his neck A stick snapped sharp and loud beneath my tread the lounging back stiffened and grew rigid the face showed for an instant over the shoulder and with a spring he had vanished into the bushes It was a vain hope to find a man in such a dense tangle of boughs and underbrush yet I ran forward nevertheless but though I sought eagerly upon all sides he had made good his escape So after a while I retraced my steps to where I had left my irons and brackets and taking them up turned aside to that precipitous path which as I have already said leads down into the Hollow Now as I went listening to the throb of the hammer in my head whom should I meet but Charmian coming gayly through the green and singing as she came At sight of me she stopped and the song died upon her lip Why why Peter you look pale dreadfully pale Thank you I am very well said I You have not been fighting again Why should I have been fighting Charmian Your eyes are wild and fierce Peter Were you coming to to meet me Charmian Yes Peter Now watching beneath my brows it almost seemed that her color had changed and that her eyes of set purpose avoided mine Could it be that she was equivocating But I am much before my usual time to night Charmian Then there will be no waiting for supper and I am ravenous Peter And as she led the way along the path she began to sing again Being come to the cottage I set down my bars and brackets with a clang These said I in answer to her look are the bars I promised to make for the door Do you always keep your promises Peter I hope so Then said she coming to look at the great bars with a fork in her hand for she was in the middle of dishing up then if you promise me always to come home by the road and never through the coppice you will do so won t you Why should I I inquired turning sharply to look at her Because the coppice is so dark and lonely and if I say if I should take it into my head to come and meet you sometimes there would be no chance of my missing you And so she looked at me and smiled and going back to her cooking fell once more a singing the while I sat and watched her beneath my brows Surely surely no woman whose heart was full of deceit could sing so blithely and happily or look at one with such sweet candor in her eyes And yet the supper was a very ghost of a meal for when I remembered the man who had watched and waited the very food grew nauseous and seemed to choke me She s a Eve a Eve rang a voice in my ear Eve tricked Adam didn t she and you ain t a better man nor Adam she s a Eve a Eve Peter you eat nothing Yes indeed said I staring unseeingly down at my plate and striving to close my ears against the fiendish voice And you are very pale I shrugged my shoulders Peter look at me I looked up obediently Yes you are frightfully pale are you ill again is it your head Peter what is it and with a sudden half shy gesture she stretched her hand to me across the table And as I looked from the mute pity of her eyes to the mute pity of that would be comforting hand I had a great impulse to clasp it close in mine to speak and tell her all my base and unworthy suspicions and once more to entreat her pardon and forgiveness The words were upon my lips but I checked them madman that I was and shook my head It is nothing I answered unless it be that I have not yet recovered from Black George s fist it is nothing And so the meal drew to an end and though feeling my thoughts base I sat with my head on my hand and my eyes upon the cloth yet I knew she watched me and more than once I heard her sigh A man who acts on impulse may sometimes be laughed at for his mistakes but he will frequently attain to higher things and be much better loved by his fellows than the colder more calculating logician who rarely makes a blunder and Simon Peter was a man of impulse Supper being over and done Charmian must needs take my coat despite my protests and fall to work upon its threadbare shabbiness mending a great rent in the sleeve And watching her through the smoke of my pipe noting the high mould of her features the proud poise of her head the slender elegance of her hands I was struck sharply by her contrast to the rough bare walls that were my home and the toil worn unlovely garment beneath her fingers As I looked she seemed to be suddenly removed from me far above and beyond my reach That is the fourth time Peter What Charmian That is the fourth time you have sighed since you lighted your pipe and it is out and you never noticed it Yes said I and laid the pipe upon the table and sighed again before I could stop myself Charmian raised her head and looked at me with a laugh in her eyes Oh most philosophical dreamy blacksmith where be your thoughts I was thinking how old and worn and disreputable my coat looked Indeed sir said Charmian holding it up and regarding it with a little frown forsooth it is ancient and hath seen better days Like its wearer said I and sighed again Hark to this ancient man she laughed this hoary headed blacksmith of ours who sighs and forever sighs if it could possibly be that he had met any one sufficiently worthy I should think that he had fallen philosophically in love how think you Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance I remember said I that among other things you once called me Superior mister Smith Charmian laughed and nodded her head at me You had been describing to me some quite impossible idealistic creature alone worthy of your regard sir Do you still think me superior Charmian Do you still dream of your impalpable bloodlessly perfect ideals sir No I answered no I think I have done with dreaming And I have done with this thy coat for behold it is finished and rising she folded it over the back of my chair Now as she stood thus behind me her hand fell and for a moment rested lightly upon my shoulder Peter Yes Charmian I wish yes I do wish that you were either much younger or very much older Why Because you wouldn t be quite so so cryptic such a very abstruse problem Sometimes I think I understand you better than you do yourself and sometimes I am utterly lost now if you were younger I could read you easily for myself and if you were older you would read yourself for me I was never very young said I No you were always too repressed Peter Yes perhaps I was Repression is good up to a certain point but beyond that it is dangerous said she with a portentous shake of the head Heigho was it a week or a year ago that you avowed yourself happy and couldn t tell why I was the greater fool said I For not knowing why Peter For thinking myself happy Peter what is happiness An idea said I possessed generally of fools And what is misery Misery is also an idea Possessed only by the wise Peter surely he is wiser who chooses happiness Neither happiness nor misery comes from choice But if one seeks happiness Peter One will assuredly find misery said I and sighing rose and taking my hammer from its place above my bookshelf set to work upon my brackets driving them deep into the heavy framework of the door All at once I stopped with my hammer poised and for no reason in the world looked back at Charmian over my shoulder looked to find her watching me with eyes that were if it could well be puzzled wistful shy and glad at one and the same time eyes that veiled themselves swiftly before my look yet that shot one last glance between their lashes in which were only joy and laughter Yes said I answering the look But she only stooped her head and went on sewing yet the color was bright in her cheeks And having driven in the four brackets or staples and closed the door I took up the bars and showed her how they were to lie crosswise across the door resting in the brackets We shall be safe now Peter said she those bars would resist an elephant I think they would I nodded but there is yet something more Going to my shelf of books I took thence the silver mounted pistol she had brought with her and balanced it in my hand To morrow I will take this to Cranbrook and buy bullets to fit it Why there are bullets there in one of the old shoes Peter They are too large this is an unusually small calibre and yet it would be deadly enough at close range I will load it for you Charmian and give it into your keeping in case you should ever grow afraid again when I am not by this is a lonely place for a woman at all times Yes Peter She was busily employed upon a piece of embroidery and began to sing softly to herself again as she worked that old song which worthy mister Pepys mentions having heard from the lips of mischievous eyed Nell Gwynn In Scarlet town where I was born There was a fair maid dwellin Made every youth cry Well a way Her name was Barbara Allen Are you so happy Charmian Oh sir indifferent well I thank you All in the merry month of May When green buds they were swellin Young Jemmy Grove on his death bed lay For love of Barbara Allen Are you so miserable Peter Why do you ask Because you sigh and sigh like poor Jemmy Grove in the song He was a fool said I For sighing Peter For dying I suppose no philosopher could ever be so foolish Peter No said I certainly not It is well to be a philosopher isn t it Peter Hum said I and once more set about lighting my pipe Anon I rose and crossing to the open door looked out upon the summer night and sighed and coming back sat watching Charmian s busy fingers Charmian said I at last Yes Peter Do you ever see any any men lurking about the Hollow when I am away Her needle stopped suddenly and she did not look up as she answered No Peter Never are you sure Charmian The needle began to fly to and fro again but still she did not look up No of course not how should I see any one I scarcely go beyond the Hollow and I m busy all day A Eve a Eve said a voice in my ear Eve tricked Adam didn t she a Eve After this I sat for a long time without moving my mind harassed with doubts and a hideous morbid dread Why had she avoided my eye Her own were pure and truthful and could not lie Why why had they avoided mine If only she had looked at me Presently I rose and began to pace up and down the room You are very restless Peter Yes said I yes I fear I am you must pardon me Why not read Indeed I had not thought of my books Then read me something aloud Peter I will read you the sorrow of Achilles for the loss of Briseis said I and going into the corner I raised my hand to my shelf of books and stood there with hand upraised yet touching no book for a sudden spasm seemed to have me in its clutches and once again the trembling seized me and the hammer had recommenced its beat beating upon my brain And in a while I turned from my books and crossing to the door leaned there with my back to her lest she should see my face just then I I don t think I will read to night said I at last Very well Peter let us talk Or talk said I I I think I ll go to bed Pray I went on hurriedly for I was conscious that she had raised her head and was looking at me in some surprise pray excuse me I m very tired So while she yet stared at me I turned away and mumbling a good night went into my chamber and closing the door leaned against it for my mind was sick with dread and sorrow and a great anguish for now I knew that Charmian had lied to me my Virgil book had been moved from its usual place CHAPTER XXV IN WHICH THE READER SHALL FIND LITTLE TO DO WITH THE STORY AND MAY THEREFORE SKIP Is there anywhere in the world so damnable a place of torment as a bed To lie awake through the slow dragging hours surrounded by a sombre quietude from whose stifling blackness thoughts like demons leap to catch us by the throat or like waves come rolling in upon us ceaselessly remorselessly burying us beneath their resistless flow catching us up whirling us dizzily aloft dashing us down into depths infinite now retreating now advancing from whose oncoming terror there is no escape until we are once more buried beneath their stifling rush To lie awake staring wide eyed into a crowding darkness wherein move terrors unimagined to bury our throbbing temples in pillows of fire to roll and toss until the soul within us cries out in agony and we reach out frantic hands into a void that mocks us by the contrast of its deep and awful quiet At such times fair Reason runs affrighted to hide herself and foaming Madness fills her throne at such times our everyday sorrows howsoever small and petty they be grow and magnify themselves until they overflow the night filling the universe above and around us and of all the woes the human mind can bear surely Suspicion gnaws deeper than them all So I lay beneath the incubus my temples clasped tight between my burning palms to stay the maddening ring of the hammer in my brain And suspicion grew into certainty and with certainty came madness imagination ran riot she was a Messalina a Julia a Joan of Naples a veritable Succuba a thing polluted degraded and abominable and because of her beauty I cursed all beautiful things and because of her womanhood I cursed all women And ever the hammer beat upon my brain and foul shapes danced before my eyes shapes so insanely hideous and revolting that of a sudden I rose from my bed groaning and coming to the casement leaned out Oh the cool sweet purity of the night I heard the soft stir and rustle of leaves all about me and down from heaven came a breath of wind and in the wind a great raindrop that touched my burning brow like the finger of God And leaning there with parted lips and closed eyes gradually my madness left me and the throbbing in my brain grew less How many poor mortals since the world began sleepless and anguish torn even as I have looked up into that self same sky and sorrowed for the dawn For her love in sleep I slake For her love all night I wake For her love I mourning make More than any man Poor fool to think that thou couldst mourn more than thy kind Thou rt but a little handful of gray dust ages since thy name and estate long out of mind where er thou art thou shouldst have got you wisdom by now perchance Poor fool that thou must love a woman and worship with thy love building for her an altar in thine heart If altar crumble and heart burst is she to blame who is but woman or thou who wouldst have made her all divine Well thou rt dead a small handful of gray dust long since perchance thou hast got thee wisdom ere now poor fool O Fool Divine As thou art now thy sleepless nights forgot the carking sorrows of thy life all overpast and done so must I some time be and ages hence shall smile at this and reckon it no more than a broken toy heigho And so I presently turned back to my tumbled bed but it seemed to me that torment and terror still waited me there moreover I was filled with a great desire for action This narrow chamber stifled me while outside was the stir of leaves the gentle breathing of the wind the cool murmur of the brook with night brooding over all deep and soft and still Being now dressed I stood awhile deliberating how I might escape without disturbing her who slumbered in the outer room So I came to the window and thrusting my head and shoulders sidewise through the narrow lattice slowly and with much ado wriggled myself out Rising from my hands and knees I stood up and threw wide my arms to the perfumed night inhaling its sweetness in great deep breaths and so turned my steps towards the brook drawn thither by its rippling melody for a brook is a companionable thing at all times to a lonely man and very full of wise counsel and friendly admonitions if he but have ears to hear withal Thus as I walked beside the brook it spoke to me of many things grave and gay delivering itself of observations upon the folly of Humans comparing us very unfavorably with the godlike dignity of trees the immutability of mountains and the profound philosophy of brooks Indeed it waged most eloquent upon this theme caustic if you will but with a ripple between whiles like the deep throated chuckle of the wise old philosopher it was Go to chuckled the brook Oh heavy footed heavy sighing Human go to It is written that Man was given dominion over birds and beasts and fishes and all things made yet how doth Man in all his pride compare with even a little mountain And as to birds and beasts and fishes they provide for themselves day in and day out while Man doth starve and famish To what end is Man born but to work beget his kind and die O Man lift up thy dull sighted eyes behold the wonder of the world and the infinite universe about thee behold thyself and see thy many failings and imperfections and thy stupendous littleness go to Man was made for the world and not the world for man Man is a leaf in the forest a grain of dust borne upon the wind and when the wind faileth dust to dust returneth out upon thee with thy puny griefs and sorrows O Man who hath dominion over all things save thine own heart and who in thy blind egotism setteth thyself much above me who am but a runlet of water O Man I tell thee when thou art dusty bones I shall still be here singing to myself in the sun or talking to some other poor human fool in the dark Go to chuckled the brook the Wheel of Life turneth ever faster and faster the woes of to day shall be the woes of last year or ever thou canst count them all out upon thee go to CHAPTER XXVI OF STORM AND TEMPEST AND HOW I MET ONE PRAYING IN THE DAWN On I went chin on breast heedless of all direction now beneath the shade of trees now crossing grassy glades or rolling meadow or threading my way through long alleys of hop vines on and on skirting hedges by haycocks looming ghostly in the dark by rustling cornfields through wood and coppice where branches touched me as I passed like ghostly fingers in the dark on I went lost to all things but my own thoughts And my thoughts were not of Life nor Death nor the world nor the spaces beyond the world but of my Virgil book with the broken cover and of him who had looked at it over her shoulder And raising my hands I clasped them about my temples and leaning against a tree stood there a great while Yet when the trembling fit had left me I went on again and with every footstep there rose a voice within me crying Why Why Why Why should I Peter Vibart hale and well in body healthy in mind why should I fall thus into ague spasms because of a woman of whom I knew nothing who had come I knew not whence accompanied by one whose presence under such conditions meant infamy to any woman why should I burn thus in a fever if she chose to meet another while I was abroad Was she not free to follow her own devices had I any claim upon her by what right did I seek to compass her goings and comings or interest myself in her doings Why Why Why As I went the woods gradually fell away and I came out upon an open place The ground rose sharply before me but I climbed on and up and so in time stood upon a hill Now standing upon this elevation with the woods looming dimly below me as if they were a dark tide hemming me in on all sides I became conscious of a sudden great quietude in the air a stillness that was like the hush of expectancy not a sound came to me not a whisper from the myriad leaves below But as I stood there listening very faint and far away I heard a murmur that rose and died and rose again that swelled and swelled into the roll of distant thunder Down in the woods was a faint rustling as if some giant were stirring among the leaves and out of their depths breathed a puff of wind that fanned my cheek and so was gone But in a while it was back again stronger more insistent than before till sudden as it came it died away again and all was hushed and still save only for the tremor down there among the leaves but lightning flickered upon the horizon the thunder rolled nearer and nearer and the giant grew ever more restless Round about me in the dark were imps that laughed and whispered together and mocked me amid the leaves Who is the madman that stands upon a lonely hill at midnight bareheaded half clad and hungers for the storm Peter Vibart Peter Vibart Who is he that having eyes sees not and having ears hears not Peter Vibart Peter Vibart Blow Wind and buffet him Flame O Lightning that he may see Roar O Thunder that he may hear and know Upon the stillness came a rustling loud and ever louder drowning all else for the giant was awake at last and stretching himself and now up he sprang with a sudden bellow and gathering himself together swept up towards me through the swaying treetops pelting me with broken twigs and flying leaves and filling the air with the tumult of his coming Oh the wind the bellowing giant wind On he came exulting whistling through my hair stopping my breath roaring in my ears his savage wild halloo And as if in answer forth from the inky heaven burst a jagged blinding flame that zigzagged down among the tossing trees and vanished with a roaring thunder clap that seemed to stun all things to silence But not for long for in the darkness came the wind again fiercer wilder than before shrieking a defiance The thunder crashed above me and the lightning quivered in the air about me till my eyes ached with the swift transitions from pitch darkness to dazzling light light in which distant objects started out clear and well defined only to be lost again in a swirl of blackness And now came rain a sudden hissing downpour long threads of scintillating fire where the lightning caught it rain that wetted me through and through The storm was at its height and as I listened rain and wind and thunder became merged and blended into awful music a symphony of Life and Death played by the hands of God and I was an atom a grain of dust an insect to be crushed by God s little finger And yet needs must this insect still think upon its little self for half drowned deafened blind and half stunned though I was still the voice within me cried Why Why Why Why was I here instead of lying soft and sheltered and sleeping the blessed sleep of tired humanity Why was I here with death about me and why must I think and think and think of Her The whole breadth of heaven seemed torn asunder blue flame crackled in the air it ran hissing along the ground then blackness and a thunderclap that shook the very hill beneath me and I was down upon my knees with the swish of the rain about me Little by little upon this silence stole the rustle of leaves and in the leaves were the imps who mocked me Who is he that doth love in despite of himself and shall do all his days be she good or evil whatever she was whatever she is Who is the very Fool of Love Peter Vibart Peter Vibart And so I bowed my face upon my hands and remained thus a great while heeding no more the tempest about me For now indeed was my question answered and my fear realized I love her whatever she was whatever she is good or evil I love her O Fool O most miserable Fool And presently I rose and went on down the hill Fast I strode stumbling and slipping plunging on heedlessly through bush and brake until at last looking about me I found myself on the outskirts of a little spinney or copse and then I became conscious that the storm had passed for the thunder had died down to a murmur and the rain had ceased only all about me were little soft sounds as if the trees were weeping silently together Pushing on I came into a sort of narrow lane grassy underfoot and shut in on either hand by very tall hedges that loomed solid and black in the night and being spent and weary I sat down beneath one of these and propped my chin in my hands How long I remained thus I cannot say but I was at length aroused by a voice a strangely sweet and gentle voice at no great distance and the words it uttered were these Oh give thanks unto the Lord for He is good for His mercy endureth forever O Lord I beseech Thee look down in Thine infinite pity upon this Thy world for to day is at hand and Thy children must soon awake to life and toil and temptation Oh Thou who art the Lover of Men let Thy Holy Spirit wait to meet with each one of us upon the threshold of the dawn and lead us through this coming day Like as a father pitieth his children so dost Thou pity all the woeful and heavy hearted Look down upon all those who must so soon awake to their griefs speak comfortably to them remember those in pain who must so soon take up their weary burdens Look down upon the hungry and the rich the evil and the good that in this new day finding each something of Thy mercy they may give thanks unto the Lord for He is good for His mercy endureth forever So the voice ended and there were silence and a profound stillness upon all things wherefore lifting my eyes unto the east I saw that it was dawn CHAPTER XXVII THE EPILEPTIC Now when the prayer was ended I turned my back upon the lightening east and set off along the lane But as I went I heard one hailing me and glancing round saw that in the hedge was a wicket gate and over this gate a man was leaning A little thin man with the face of an ascetic or mediaeval saint a face of a high and noble beauty upon whose scholarly brow sat a calm serenity yet beneath which glowed the full bright eye of the man of action Good morning friend said be welcome to my solitude I wish you joy of this new day of ours it is cloudy yet but there is a rift down on the horizon it will be a fair day I think On the contrary sir said I to me there are all the evidences of the bad weather continuing I think it will be a bad day with rain and probably thunder and lightning Good morning sir Stay cried he as I turned away and with the word set his hand upon the gate and vaulting nimbly over came towards me with a broad brimmed straw hat in one hand and a long stemmed wooden pipe in the other Sir said he my cottage is close by you look warn and jaded Will you not step in and rest awhile Thank you sir but I must be upon my way And whither lies your way To Sissinghurst sir You have a long walk before you and with your permission I will accompany you a little way With pleasure sir I answered though I fear you will find me a moody companion and a somewhat silent one but then I shall be the better listener so light your pipe sir and while you smoke talk My pipe said he glancing down at it ah yes I was about to compose my Sunday evening s sermon You are a clergyman sir No no a preacher or say rather a teacher and a very humble one who striving himself after Truth seeks to lend such aid to others as he may Truth said I what is Truth Truth sir is that which can never pass away the Truth of Life is Good Works which abide everlastingly Sir said I you smoke a pipe I perceive and should therefore be a good preacher for smoking begets thought And yet sir is not to act greater than to think Why Thought far outstrips puny Action said I it reaches deeper soars higher in our actions we are pigmies but in our thoughts we may be gods and embrace a universe But sighed the Preacher while we think our fellows perish in ignorance and want Hum said I Thought pursued the Preacher may become a vice as it did with the old time monks and hermits who shutting themselves away from their kind wasted their lives upon their knees thinking noble thoughts and dreaming of holy things but leaving the world very carefully to the devil And as to smoking I am seriously considering giving it up Here he took the pipe from his lips and thrust it behind his back Why It has become unfortunately too human It is a strange thing sir he went on smiling and shaking his head that this my one indulgence should breed me more discredit than all the cardinal sins and become a stumbling block to others Only last Sunday I happened to overhear two white headed old fellows talking A fine sermon Giles said the one Ah good enough replied the other but it might ha been better ye see e smokes So I am seriously thinking of giving it up for it would appear that if a preacher prove himself as human as his flock they immediately lose faith in him and become deaf to his teaching Very true sir I nodded It has always been human to admire and respect that only which is in any way different to ourselves in archaic times those whose teachings were above men s comprehension or who were remarkable for any singularity of action were immediately deified Pythagoras recognized this truth when he shrouded himself in mystery and delivered his lectures from behind a curtain though to be sure he has come to be regarded as something of a charlatan in consequence Pray sir said the Preacher absent mindedly puffing at his pipe again may I ask what you are A blacksmith sir And where did you read of Pythagoras and the like At Oxford sir How comes it then that I find you in the dawn wet with rain buffeted by wind and most of all a shoer of horses But instead of answering I pointed to a twisted figure that lay beneath the opposite hedge A man exclaimed the Preacher and asleep I think No said I not in that contorted attitude Indeed you are right said the Preacher the man is ill poor fellow And hurrying forward he fell on his knees beside the prostrate figure He was a tall man roughly clad and he lay upon his back rigid and motionless while upon his blue lips were flecks and bubbles of foam Epilepsy said I The Preacher nodded and busied himself with loosening the sodden neckcloth the while I unclasped the icy fingers to relieve the tension of the muscles The man s hair was long and matted as was also his beard and his face all drawn and pale and very deeply lined Now as I looked at him I had a vague idea that I had somewhere at some time seen him before Sir said the Preacher looking up will you help me to carry him to my cottage It is not very far So we presently took the man s wasted form between us and bore it easily enough to where stood a small cottage bowered in roses and honeysuckle And having deposited our unconscious burden upon the Preacher s humble bed I turned to depart Sir said the Preacher holding out his hand it is seldom one meets with a blacksmith who has read the Pythagorean Philosophy at Oxford and I should like to see you again I am a lonely man save for my books come and sup with me some evening and let us talk And smoke said I The little Preacher sighed I will come said I thank you and good by Now even as I spoke chancing to cast my eyes upon the pale still face on the bed I felt more certain than ever that I had somewhere seen it before CHAPTER XXVIII IN WHICH I COME TO A DETERMINATION As I walked through the fresh green world there ensued within me the following dispute as it were between myself and two voices and the first voice I will call Pro and the other Contra MYSELF May the devil take that Gabbing Dick PRO He probably will MYSELF Had he not told me of what he saw of the man who looked at my Virgil over her shoulder PRO Or had you not listened MYSELF Ah yes but then I did listen and that he spoke the truth is beyond all doubt the misplaced Virgil proves that However it is certain yes very certain that I can remain no longer in the Hollow CONTRA Well there is excellent accommodation at The Bull PRO And pray why leave the Hollow MYSELF Because she is a woman PRO And you love her MYSELF To my sorrow PRO Well but woman was made for man Peter and man for woman MYSELF sternly Enough of that I must go PRO Being full of bitter jealousy MYSELF No PRO Being a mad jealous fool MYSELF As you will PRO who has condemned her unheard with no chance of justification MYSELF To morrow at the very latest I shall seek some other habitation PRO Has she the look of guilt MYSELF No but then women are deceitful by nature and very skilful in disguising their faults at least so I have read in my books PRO contemptuously Books Books Books MYSELF shortly No matter I have decided PRO Do you remember how willingly she worked for you with those slender capable hands of hers MYSELF Why remind me of this Pro You must needs miss her presence sorely her footstep that was always so quick and light MYSELF Truly wonderful in one so nobly formed PRO and the way she had of singing softly to herself MYSELF A beautiful voice PRO With a caress in it And then her habit of looking at you over her shoulder MYSELF Ah yes her lashes a little drooping her brows a little wrinkled her lips a little parted CONTRA A comfortable inn is The Bull MYSELF hastily Yes yes certainly PRO Ah her lips the scarlet witchery of her lips Do you remember how sweetly the lower one curved upward to its fellow A mutinous mouth with its sudden bewildering changes You never quite knew which to watch oftenest her eyes or her lips CONTRA hoarsely Excellent cooking at The Bull PRO And how she would berate you and scoff at your Master Epictetus and dry as dust philosophers MYSELF I have sometimes wondered at her pronounced antipathy to Epictetus PRO And she called you a creature MYSELF The meaning of which I never quite fathomed PRO And frequently a pedant MYSELF I think not more than four times PRO On such occasions you will remember she had a petulant way of twitching her shoulder towards you and frowning and occasionally stamping her foot and deep within you you loved it all you know you did CONTRA But that is all over and you are going to The Bull MYSELF hurriedly To be sure The Bull PRO And lastly you cannot have forgotten you never will forget the soft tumult of the tender bosom that pillowed your battered head the pity of her hands those great scalding tears the sudden swift caress of her lips and the thrill in her voice when she said MYSELF hastily Stop that is all forgotten PRO You lie You have dreamed of it ever since working at your anvil or lying upon your bed with your eyes upon the stars you have loved her from the beginning of things MYSELF And I did not know it I was very blind The wonder is that she did not discover my love for her long ago for not knowing it was there how should I try to hide it CONTRA O Blind and more than blind Why should you suppose she hasn t MYSELF stopping short What Can it be possible that she has CONTRA Didn t she once say that she could read you like a book MYSELF She did CONTRA And have you not often surprised a smile upon her lips and wondered MYSELF Many times CONTRA Have you not beheld a thin veiled mockery in her look Why poor fool has she not mocked you from the first You dream of her lips Were not their smiles but coquetry and derision MYSELF But why should she deride me CONTRA For your youth and innocence MYSELF My youth my innocence CONTRA Being a fool ingrain didn t you boast that you had known but few women MYSELF I did but CONTRA Didn t she call you boy boy boy and laugh at you MYSELF Well even so CONTRA with bitter scorn O Boy O Innocent of the innocent Go to for a bookish fool Learn that lovely ladies yield themselves but to those who are masterful in their wooing who have wooed often and triumphed as often O Innocent of the innocent Forget the maudlin sentiment of thy books and old romances thy pure Sir Galahads thy vary parfait gentil knightes thy meek and lowly lovers serving their ladies on bended knee open thine eyes learn that women to day love only the strong hand the bold eye the ready tongue kneel to her and she will scorn and contemn you What woman think you would prefer the solemn stern eyed purity of a Sir Galahad though he be the king of men to the quick witted gayety of a debonair Lothario though he be but the shadow of a man Out upon thee pale faced student Thy tongue hath not the trick nor thy mind the nimbleness for the winning of a fair and lovely lady Thou rt well enough in want of a better but when Lothario comes must she not run to meet him with arms outstretched To morrow said I clenching my fists to morrow I will go away Being now come to the Hollow I turned aside to the brook at that place where was the pool in which I was wont to perform my morning ablutions and kneeling down I gazed at myself in the dark still water and I saw that the night had indeed set its mark upon me To morrow said I again nodding to the wild face below to morrow I will go far hence Now while I yet gazed at myself I heard a sudden gasp behind me and turning beheld Charmian Peter is it you she whispered drawing back from me Who else Charmian Did I startle you Yes oh Peter Are you afraid of me You are like one who has walked with death I rose to my feet and stood looking down at her Are you afraid of me Charmian No Peter I am glad of that said I because I want to ask you to marry me Charmian CHAPTER XXIX IN WHICH CHARMIAN ANSWERS MY QUESTION Peter Yes I wish you wouldn t Wouldn t what Charmian Stir your tea round and round and round it is really most exasperating I beg your pardon said I humbly And you eat nothing and that is also exasperating I am not hungry And I was so careful with the bacon see it is fried beautifully yes you are very exasperating Peter Here finding I was absent mindedly stirring my tea round and round again I gulped it down out of the way whereupon Charmian took my cup and refilled it having done which she set her elbows upon the table and propping her chin in her hands looked at me You climbed out through your window last night Peter Yes It must have been a dreadfully tight squeeze Yes And why did you go by the window I did not wish to disturb you That was very thoughtful of you only you see I was up and dressed the roar of the thunder woke me It was a dreadful storm Peter Yes The lightning was awful Yes And you were out in it Yes Oh you poor poor Peter How cold you must have been On the contrary I began I And wet Peter miserably wet and clammy I did not notice it I murmured Being a philosopher Peter and too much engrossed in your thoughts I was certainly thinking Of yourself Yes You are a great egoist aren t you Peter Am I Charmian Who but an egoist could stand with his mind so full of himself and his own concerns as to be oblivious to thunder and lightning and not know that he is miserably clammy and wet I thought of others besides myself But only in connection with yourself everything you have ever read or seen you apply to yourself to make that self more worthy in mister Vibart s eyes Is this worthy of Peter Vibart Can Peter Vibart do this that or the other and still retain the respect of Peter Vibart Then why being in all things so very correct and precise why is Peter Vibart given to prowling abroad at midnight quite oblivious to thunder lightning wet and clamminess I answer Because Peter Vibart is too much engrossed by Peter Vibart There that sounds rather cryptic and very full of Peter Vibart but that is as it should be and she laughed And what does it mean Charmian Good sir the sibyl hath spoken Find her meaning for yourself You have called me on various occasions a creature a pedant very frequently a pedant and now it seems I am an egoist and all because Because you think too much Peter you never open your lips without having first thought out just what you are going to say you never do anything without having laboriously mapped it all out beforehand that you may not outrage Peter Vibart s tranquillity by any impulsive act or speech Oh you are always thinking and thinking and that is even worse than stirring and stirring at your tea as you are doing now I took the spoon hastily from my cup and laid it as far out of reach as possible If ever you should write the book you once spoke of it would be just the very sort of book that I should hate Why Charmian Because it would be a book of artfully turned phrases a book in which all the characters especially women would think and speak and act by rote and rule as according to mister Peter Vibart it would be a scholarly book of elaborate finish and care of detail with no irregularities of style or anything else to break the monotonous harmony of the whole indeed sir it would be a most unreadable book Do you think so Charmian said I once more taking up the teaspoon Why of course she answered with raised brows it would probably be full of Greek and Latin quotations And you would polish and rewrite it until you had polished every vestige of life and spontaneity out of it as you do out of yourself with your thinking and thinking But I never quote you Greek or Latin that is surely something and as for thinking would you have me a thoughtless fool or an impulsive ass Anything rather than a calculating introspective philosopher seeing only the mote in the sunbeam and nothing of the glory Here she gently disengaged the teaspoon from my fingers and laid it in her own saucer having done which she sighed and looked at me with her head to one side Were they all like you Peter I wonder those old philosophers grim and stern and terribly repressed with burning eyes Peter and with very long chins Epictetus was of course And you dislike Epictetus Charmian I detest him He was just the kind of person Peter who being unable to sleep would have wandered out into a terrible thunderstorm in the middle of the night and being cold and wet and clammy Peter would have drawn moral lessons and made epigrams upon the thunder and lightning Epictetus I am quite sure was a person He was one of the wisest gentlest and most lovable of all the Stoics said I Can a philosopher possibly be lovable Peter Here I very absent mindedly took up a fork but finding her eye upon me laid it down again You are very nervous Peter and very pale and worn and haggard and all because you habitually overthink yourself and indeed there is something very far wrong with a man who perseveringly stirs an empty cup with a fork And with a laugh she took my cup and having once more refilled it set it before me And yet Peter I don t think no I don t think I would have you very much changed after all You mean that you would rather I remained the pedantic egotistical creature I mean Peter that being a woman I naturally love novelty and you are very novel and very interesting Thank you said I frowning And more contradictory than any woman Hum said I You are so strong and simple so wise and brave and so very weak and foolish and timid Timid said I Timid nodded she I am a vast fool I acknowledged And I never knew a man anything like you before Peter And you have known many I understand Very many Yes you told me so once before I believe Twice Peter and each time you became very silent and gloomy Now you on the other hand she continued have known very few women And my life has been calm and unruffled in consequence You had your books Peter and your horseshoes My books and horseshoes yes And were content Quite content Until one day a woman came to you Until one day I met a woman And then And then I asked her to marry me Charmian Here there ensued a pause during which Charmian began to pleat a fold in the tablecloth That was rather unwise of you wasn t it said she at last How unwise Because she might have taken you at your word Peter Do you mean that that you won t Charmian Oh dear no I have arrived at no decision yet how could I You must give me time to consider Here she paused in her pleating to regard it critically with her head on one side To be sure said she with a little nod to be sure you need some one to to look after you that is very evident Yes To cook and wash for you Yes To mend your clothes for you Yes And you think me sufficiently competent Oh Charmian I yes Thank you said she very solemnly and though her lashes had drooped I felt the mockery of her eyes wherefore I took a sudden great gulp of tea and came near choking while Charmian began to pleat another fold in the tablecloth And so mister Vibart would stoop to wed so humble a person as Charmian Brown mister Peter Vibart would actually marry a woman of whose past he knows nothing Yes said I That again would be rather unwise wouldn t it Why Considering mister Vibart s very lofty ideals in regard to women What do you mean Didn t you once say that your wife s name must be above suspicion like Caesar s or something of the kind Did I yes perhaps I did well Well this woman this Humble Person has no name at all and no shred of reputation left her She has compromised herself beyond all redemption in the eyes of the world But then said I this world and I have always mutually despised each other She ran away this woman eloped with the most notorious the most accomplished rake in London Well Oh is not that enough Enough for what Charmian I saw her busy fingers falter and tremble but her voice was steady when she answered Enough to make any wise man think twice before asking this Humble Person to to marry him I might think twenty times and it would be all one You mean That if Charmian Brown will stoop to marry a village blacksmith Peter Vibart will find happiness again a happiness that is not of the sunshine nor the wind in the trees Lord what a fool I was Her fingers had stopped altogether now but she neither spoke nor raised her head Charmian said I leaning nearer across the table speak Oh Peter said she with a sudden break in her voice and stooped her head lower Yet in a little she looked up at me and her eyes were very sweet and shining Now as our glances met thus up from throat to brow there crept that hot slow wave of color and in her face and in her eyes I seemed to read joy and fear and shame and radiant joy again But now she bent her head once more and strove to pleat another fold and could not while I grew suddenly afraid of her and of myself and longed to hurl aside the table that divided us and thrust my hands deep into my pockets and finding there my tobacco pipe brought it out and fell to turning it aimlessly over and over I would have spoken only I knew that my voice would tremble and so I sat mum chance staring at my pipe with unseeing eyes and with my brain in a ferment And presently came her voice cool and sweet and sane Your tobacco Peter and she held the box towards me across the table Ah thank you said I and began to fill my pipe while she watched me with her chin propped in her hands Peter Yes Charmian I wonder why so grave a person as mister Peter Vibart should seek to marry so impossible a creature as the Humble Person I think I answered I think if there is any special reason it is because of your mouth My mouth Or your eyes or the way you have with your lashes Charmian laughed and forthwith drooped them at me and laughed again and shook her head But surely Peter surely there are thousands millions of women with mouths and eyes like the Humble Person s It is possible said I but none who have the same way with their lashes What do you mean I can t tell I don t know Don t you Peter No it is just a way And so it is that you want to marry this very Humble Person I think I have wanted to from the very first but did not know it being a blind fool And did it need a night walk in a thunderstorm to teach you No that is yes perhaps it did And are you quite quite sure Quite quite sure said I and as I spoke I laid my pipe upon the table and rose and because my hands were trembling I clenched my fists But as I approached her she started up and put out a hand to hold me off and then I saw that her hands were trembling also And standing thus she spoke very softly Peter Yes Charmian Do you remember describing to me the the perfect woman who should be your wife Yes How that you must be able to respect her for her intellect Yes Honor her for her virtue Yes Charmian And worship her for her spotless purity I dreamed a paragon perfect and impossible I was a fool said I Impossible Oh Peter what what do you mean She was only an impalpable shade quite impossible of realization a bloodless thing as you said and quite unnatural a sickly figment of the imagination I was a fool And you are too wise now to expect such virtues in any woman Yes said I no oh Charmian I only know that you have taken this phantom s place that you fill all my thoughts sleeping and waking No No she cried and struggled in my arms so that I caught her hands and held them close and kissed them many times Oh Charmian Charmian don t you know can t you see it is you I want you and only you forever whatever you were whatever you are I love you love you and always must Marry me Charmian marry me and you shall be dearer than my life more to me than my soul But as I spoke her hands were snatched away her eyes blazed into mine and her lips were all bitter scorn and at the sight fear came upon me Marry you she panted marry you no and no and no And so she stamped her foot and sobbed and turning fled from me out of the cottage And now to fear came wonder and with wonder was despair Truly was ever man so great a fool CHAPTER XXX CONCERNING THE FATE OF BLACK GEORGE A broad white road on either hand some half dozen cottages with roofs of thatch or red tile backed by trees gnarled and ancient among which rises the red conical roof of some oast house Such in a word is Sissinghurst Now upon the left hand side of the way there stands a square comfortable whitewashed building peaked of roof bright as to windows and with a mighty sign before the door whereon you shall behold the picture of a bull a bull rolling of eye astonishingly curly of horn and stiff as to tail and with a prodigious girth of neck and shoulder such a snorting fiery eyed curly horned bull as was never seen off an inn sign It was at this bull that I was staring with much apparent interest though indeed had that same curly horned monstrosity been changed by some enchanter s wand into a green dragon or griffin or swan with two necks the chances are that I should have continued sublimely unconscious of the transformation Yet how should honest Silas Hoskins ostler and general factotum of The Bull inn be aware of this fact who being thus early at work and seeing me lost in contemplation paused to address me in all good faith A fine bull e be eh Peter Look at them orns an that theer tail it s seldom as you sees orns or a tail the like o them eh Very seldom I answered and sighed An then is nose oles Peter jest cast your eye on them nose oles will ye why dang me if I can t ear im a snortin when I looks at em An e were all painted by a chap a little old chap wi gray whiskers no taller n your elber Peter Think o that a little chap no taller n your elber I seen im do it wi my two eyes a sittin on a box Drored t bull in wi a bit o chalk first then e outs wi a couple o brushes dab e goes an dab dab again an by Goles theer was a pair o eyes a rollin theirselves at me just a pair o eyes Peter Ah e were a wonder were that little old chap wi gray whiskers The way e went at that theer bull a dabbin at im ere an a dabbin at im theer till e come to is tail e done is tail last of all Peter Give un a good tail says I Ah that I will says e An a good stiff un says I Ye jest keep your eye on it an watch says e Talk about tails Peter E put in that theer tail so quick as nigh made my eyes water an as for stiffness well look at it I tell ee that chap could paint a bull wi is eyes shut ah that e could an im such a very small man wi gray whiskers No ye don t see many bulls like that un theer I m thinkin Peter They would be very hard to find said I and sighed again Whereupon Silas sighed for company s sake and nodding went off about his many duties whistling cheerily So I presently turned about and crossed the road to the smithy But upon the threshold I stopped all at once and drew softly back for despite the early hour Prudence was there upon her knees before the anvil with George s great hand hammer clasped to her bosom sobbing over it and while she sobbed she kissed its worn handle And because such love was sacred and hallowed that dingy place I took off my hat as I once more crossed the road Seeing The Bull was not yet astir for the day was still young as I say I sat me down in the porch and sighed And after I had sat there for some while with my chin sunk upon my breast and plunged in bitter meditation I became aware of the door opening and next moment a tremulous hand was laid upon my head and looking round I beheld the Ancient Bless ee Peter bless ee lad an a old man s blessin be no light thing specially such a old old man as I be an it bean t often as I feels in a blessin sperrit but oh Peter twere me as found ye weren t it Why to be sure it was Ancient very nearly five months ago An I be allus ready wi some noos for ye bean t I Yes indeed Well I got more noos for ee Peter gert noos And what is it this time I be allus full up o noos bean t I he repeated Yes Ancient said I and sighed and what is your news Why first of all Peter jest reach me my snuff box will ee ere it be in my back ind pocket thankee thankee Hereupon he knocked upon the lid with a bony knuckle I du be that full o noos this marnin that my innards be all of a quake Peter all of a quake he nodded saying which he sat down close beside me Peter Yes Ancient Some day when that theer old stapil be all rusted away an these old bones is a restin in the churchyard over to Cranbrook Peter you ll think sometimes o the very old man as was always so full o noos won t ee Peter Surely Ancient I shall never forget you said I and sighed An now Peter said the old man extracting a pinch of snuff now for the noos bout Black Jarge it be What of him Ancient The old man shook his head It took eight on em to du it Peter an now four on em s a layin in their beds an four on em s obblin on crutches an all over a couple o rabbits though theer be some fules as says they was pa tridges Why what do you mean Why ye see Peter Black Jarge be such a gert strong man I were much such another when I were young like lion in is wrath e be ah a bull bean t nothin to Black Jarge An they keepers come an found im under a tree fast asleep like David in the Cave of Adullam Peter wi a couple o rabbits as e d snared An when they keepers tried to tak im e rose up e did an throwed some on em this way an some on em that way twere like Samson an the Philistines if only e d appened to find the jaw bone of a ass lyin andy e d ha killed em all an got away sure as sure But it weren t to be Peter no dead donkeys be scarce nowadays an as for asses jaw bones Do you mean that George is taken a prisoner The Ancient nodded and inhaled his pinch of snuff with much evident relish It be gert noos bean t it Peter What have they done with him Where is he Ancient But before the old man could answer Simon appeared Ah Peter said he shaking his head the Gaffer s been tellin ye ow they ve took Jarge for poachin I suppose Simon cried the Ancient shut thy mouth lad hold thy gab an give thy poor old feyther a chance I be tellin im so fast as I can As I was a sayin Peter like a fur us lion were Jarge wi they keepers eight on em Peter like dogs a growlin an growlin an leapin and worryin all round im ah like a lion e were Waitin for a chance to use is right d ye see Peter added Simon ANCIENT Wi is eyes a rollin an flamin Peter an is mane all bristlin SIMON Cool as any cucumber Peter ANCIENT A roarin an a lashin of is tail SIMON And sparrin for an openin Peter and when e sees one downin is man every time ANCIENT Leapin in the air rollin in the grass wi they keepers clingin to im like leeches ah leeches SIMON And every time they rushed tap ud go is left and bang ud go is right ANCIENT An up e d get like Samson again Peter an give isself a shake bellerin like a bull o Bashan SIMON Ye see they fou t so close together that the keepers was afear d to use their guns ANCIENT indignantly Guns who s a talkin o guns Simon my bye you be allus a maggin an a maggin bridle thy tongue lad bridle thy tongue afore it runs away wi ye SIMON sheepishly All right Old Un fire away But at this juncture Old Amos hove in view followed by the Apologetic Dutton with Job and sundry others on their way to work and as they came they talked together with much solemn wagging of heads Having reached the door of The Bull they paused and greeted us and I thought Old Amos s habitual grin seemed a trifle more pronounced than usual So poor Jarge as been an gone an done for isself at last eh Oh my soul think o that now sighed Old Amos Allus knowed as e would added Job many s the time I ve said as e would an you know it all on you It ll be the Barbadies or Austrayley grinned Amos transportation it ll be Oh my soul think o that now an im a Siss n urst man An all along o a couple o rabbits said the Ancient emphasizing the last word with a loud rap on his snuff box Pa tridges Gaffer they was pa tridges returned Old Amos I allus said as Black Jarge d come to a bad end reiterated Job an what s more e aren t got nobody to blame but isself An all for a couple o rabbits sighed the Ancient staring Old Amos full in the eye Pa tridges Gaffer they was pa tridges you James Dutton was they pa tridges or was they not speak up James Hereupon the man Dutton all perspiring apology as usual shuffled forward and mopping his reeking brow delivered himself in this wise W ich I must say meanin no offence to nobody an if so be apologizin w ich I must say me avin seen em they was leastways he added as he met the Ancient s piercing eye leastways they might ave been w ich if they ain t no matter Having said which he apologetically smeared his face all over with his shirt sleeve and subsided again It do wring my eart ah that it do to think o pore Jarge a convic at Bot ny Bay said Old Amos a workin an diggin an slavin wi irons on is legs an arms a jinglin an ajanglin when e walks Well but it s Justice aren t it demanded Job a poacher s a thief an a thief s a convic or should be I ve eerd said Old Amos shaking his head I ve eerd as they ties they convic s up to posts an lashes an lashes em wi the cat o nine tails They generally mostly deserves it nodded Job But tis ard to think o pore Jarge tied up to one o them floggin posts wi is back all raw an bleedin pursued Old Amos crool ard it be an im such a fine strappin young chap E were allus a sight too fond o pitchin into folk Jarge were said Job it be a mercy as my back weren t broke more nor once Ah nodded the Ancient you must be amazin strong in the back Job The way I ve seed ee come a rollin an awallerin out o that theer smithy s wonnerful wonnerful Lord Job ow you did roll Well e won t never do it no more said Job glowering what wi poachin is game an knockin is keepers about t aren t likely as Squire Beverley ll let im off very easy Who said I looking up and speaking for the first time Squire Beverley o Burn am All Sir Peregrine Beverley Ay for sure And how far is it to Burnham Hall Ow fur repeated Job staring why it lays t other side o Horsmonden It be a matter o eight mile Peter said the Ancient Nine Peter cried old Amos nine mile it be Though I won t swear Peter continued the Ancient I won t swear as it aren t seven call it six an three quarters said he with his eagle eye on Old Amos Then I had better start now said I and rose Why Peter wheer be goin To Burnham Hall Ancient What you exclaimed Job d ye think Squire ll see you I think so yes Well e won t they ll never let the likes o you or me beyond the gates That remains to be seen said I So you m goin are ye I certainly am All right nodded Job if they sets the dogs on ye or chucks you into the road don t go blamin it on to me that s all What be ye really a goin Peter I really am Ancient Then by the Lord I ll go wi ye It s a long walk Nay Simon shall drive us in the cart That I will nodded the Innkeeper Ay lad cried the Ancient laying his hand upon my arm we ll up an see Squire you an me shall us Peter There be some fules said he looking round upon the staring company some fules as talks o Bot ny Bay an irons an whippin posts all I says is let em Peter let em You an me ll up an see Squire Peter sha n t us Black Jarge aren t a convic yet let fules say what they will we ll show em Peter we ll show em So saying the old man led me into the kitchen of The Bull while Simon went to have the horses put to CHAPTER XXXI IN WHICH THE ANCIENT IS SURPRISED A cheery place at all times is the kitchen of an English inn a comfortable place to eat in to talk in or to doze in a place with which your parlors and withdrawing rooms your salons a la the three Louis with their irritating rococo their gilt and satin and spindle legged discomforts are not to my mind worthy to compare And what inn kitchen in all broad England was ever brighter neater and more comfortable than this kitchen of The Bull where sweet Prue held supreme sway with such grave dignity and with her two white capped maids to do her bidding and behests surely none And surely in no inn tavern or hostelry soever great or small was there ever seen a daintier prettier sweeter hostess than this same Prue of ours And her presence was reflected everywhere and if ever the kitchen of an inn possessed a heart to lose then beyond all doubt this kitchen had lost its heart to Prue long since even the battered cutlasses crossed upon the wall the ponderous jack above the hearth with its legend ANNO DOMINI sixteen forty three took on a brighter sheen to greet her when she came and as for the pots and pans they fairly twinkled But today Prue s eyes were red and her lips were all a droop the which though her smile was brave and ready the Ancient was quick to notice Why Prue lass you ve been weepin Yes grandfer Your pretty eyes be all swole red they be what s the trouble Oh tis nothing dear tis just a maid s fulishness never mind me dear Ah but I love ee Prue come kiss me theer now tell me all about it all about it Prue Oh grandfer said she from the hollow of his shoulder tis just Jarge The old man grew very still his mouth opened slowly and closed with a snap Did ee did ee say Jarge Prue Is it breekin your eart ye be for that theer poachin Black Jarge To think as my Prue should come down to a poachin Prudence slipped from his encircling arm and stood up very straight and proud there were tears thick upon her lashes but she did not attempt to wipe them away Grandfer she said very gently you mustn t speak of Jarge to me like that ye mustn t ye mustn t because I love him and if he ever comes back I ll marry him if if he will only ax me and if he never comes back then I think I shall die The Ancient took out his snuff box knocked it opened it glanced inside and shut it up again Did ee tell me as you love Black Jarge Prue Yes grandfer I always have and always shall Loves Black Jarge he repeated allus as allus will Oh Lord what ave I done Now very slowly a tear crept down his wrinkled cheek at sight of which Prue gave a little cry and kneeling beside his chair took him in her arms Oh my lass my little Prue tis all my doin I thought Oh Prue twere me as parted you I thought The quivering voice broke off Tis all right grandfer never think of it see there I be smilin and she kissed him many times A danged fule I be said the old man shaking his head No no grandfer That s what I be Prue a danged fule If I do go afore that theer old rusty stapil twill serve me right a danged fule I be Allus loved im allus will an wishful to wed wi im Why then said the Ancient swallowing two or three times so ee shall my sweet so ee shall sure as sure so come an kiss me an forgive the old man as loves ee so What do ee mean grandfer said Prue between two kisses A fine strappin chap be Jarge arter all Peter you bean t a patch on Jarge for looks be you No indeed Ancient Wishful to wed im she is an so she shall Lordy Lord Kiss me again Prue for I be goin to see Squire ay I be goin to up an speak wi Squire for Jarge an Peter be comin too Oh mister Peter faltered Prudence be this true and in her eyes was the light of a sudden hope Yes I nodded D you think Squire ll see you listen to you she cried breathlessly I think he will Prudence said I God bless you mister Peter she murmured God bless you But now came the sound of wheels and the voice of Simon calling wherefore I took my hat and followed the Ancient to the door but there Prudence stopped me Last time you met wi Jarge he tried to kill you Oh I know and now you be goin to Nonsense Prue said I But as I spoke she stooped and would have kissed my hand but I raised her and kissed her upon the cheek instead For good luck Prue said I and so turned and left her In the porch sat Job with Old Amos and the rest still in solemn conclave over pipes and ale who watched with gloomy brows as I swung myself up beside the Ancient in the cart A fule s journey remarked Old Amos sententiously with a wave of his pipe a fule s journey The Ancient cast an observing eye up at the cloudless sky and also nodded solemnly Theer be some fules in this world Peter as mixes up rabbits wi pa tridges and honest men like Jarge wi thieves an lazy waggabones like Job but we ll show em Peter we ll show em dang em Drive on Simon my bye So with this Parthian shot feathered with the one strong word the Ancient kept for such occasions we drove away from the silenced group who stared mutely after us until we were lost to view But the last thing I saw was the light in Prue s sweet eyes as she watched us from the open lattice CHAPTER XXXII HOW WE SET OUT FOR BURNHAM HALL Peter said the Ancient after we had gone a little way Peter I do opes as you aren t been an gone an rose my Prue s opes only to dash em down again I can but do my best Ancient Old Un said Simon tweren t Peter as rose er opes twere you Peter never said nowt about bringin Jarge ome Simon commanded the Ancient hold thy tongue lad I says again if Peter s been an rose Prue s opes only to dash em t will be a bad day for Prue you mark my words Prue s a lass as don t love easy an don t forget easy Why true Gaffer true God bless er She be one as ud pine slow an quiet like a flower in the woods or a leaf in autumn ah fade she would fade an fade Well she bean t a goin to

if Jarge should ave to go a convic to Austrayley or or t other place why then she ll fade fade as ever was an be laid in the churchyard afore er poor old grandfeyther Lord Old Un exclaimed Simon who s a talkin o fadin s an churchyards I don t like it let s talk o summ at else Simon said the Ancient shaking his head reprovingly ye be a good bye ah a steady dootiful lad ye be I don t deny it but the Lord aren t give you no imagination which arter all you should be main thankful for a imagination s a troublesome thing aren t it Peter It is said I a damnable thing Ay many s the man as as been ruinated by is imagination theer was one Nicodemus Blyte were is name And a very miserable cove e sounds too added Simon But a very decent civil spoke quiet young chap e were continued the Ancient only for is imagination Lord e were that full o imagination e couldn t drink is ale like an ordinary chap sip e d go an sip sip till twere all gone an then e d forget as ever e d ad any an go away wi out paying for it if some un didn t remind im E were no fule Old Un nodded Simon An that weren t all neither not by no manner o means the Ancient continued I ve knowed that theer chap sit an listen to a pretty lass by the hour together an never say a word not one Didn t git a chance to p r aps said Simon It weren t that no it were jest is imagination a workin an workin inside of im an fillin im up Ows ever at last one day e up an axed er to marry im an she bein all took by surprise said yes an went an married some un else Lord said Simon what did she go and marry another chap for Simon returned the Ancient don t go askin fulish questions Ows ever she did an poor Nicodemus growed more imaginative than ever arter that e took to turnips Turnips exclaimed Simon staring Turnips as ever was nodded the Ancient used to stand for hours at a time a lookin at is turnips an shakin is ead over em But what for a man must be a danged fule to go shakin of is ead over a lot o turnips Well I don t know rejoined the Ancient is turnips was very good uns as a rule an fetched top prices in the markets At this juncture there appeared a man in a cart ahead of us who flourished his whip and roared a greeting a coarse visaged loud voiced fellow whose beefy face was adorned with a pair of enormous fiery whiskers that seemed forever striving to hide his ears which last being very large and red stood boldly out at right angles to his head refusing to be thus ambushed and scorning all concealment W at be that the Old Un be you alive an kickin yet Ay God be thanked John And w at be all this I ear about that theer Black Jarge e never were much good but w at be all this Lies mostly you may tak your oath nodded the Ancient But e ve been took for poachin ah an locked up at the All An we m goin to

frowning Oh ah chuckled the old man your ears is all right John prize ears ye might call em I never seed a pair better grow d never no A bit large they may be growled John giving a furtive pull to the

grows any bigger you ll be earin things afore they re spoke an John gave a fierce tug to the ambush muttered an oath and lashing up his horse disappeared down the road in a cloud of dust Twere nigh on four year ago since Black Jarge thrashed John weren t it Simon Ah nodded Simon John were in The Ring then Peter an a pretty tough chap e were too though a bit too fond o swingin wi is right to please

myself an the chances are e d ave beat me seein I adn t been inside of a ring for ten year when Up comes Jarge chuckled the Ancient What s all this say Jarge I be goin to teach John ere to keep away

in a fair stand up fight Hum said I Ye see e be that ard Peter nodded the Ancient Why look he cried look ee theer Now looking where he pointed I saw a man dart across the road some distance away he was hidden almost immediately for there were many trees thereabouts but there was no mistaking that length of limb and breadth of shoulder Twere Black Jarge isself exclaimed Simon whipping up his horses but when we reached the place George was gone and though we called and sought for some time we saw him no more So in a while we turned and jogged back towards Sissinghurst What be you a shakin your ead over Old Un inquired Simon after we had ridden some distance I were wonderin what that old fule Amos ll say when we drive back wi out Jarge Being come to the parting of the ways I descended from the cart for my head was strangely heavy and I felt much out of sorts and though the day was still young I had no mind for work Therefore I bade adieu to Simon and the Ancient and turned aside towards the Hollow leaving them staring after me in wonderment CHAPTER XXXIII IN WHICH I FALL FROM FOLLY INTO MADNESS It was with some little trepidation that I descended into the Hollow and walked along beside the brook for soon I should meet Charmian and the memory of our parting and the thought of this meeting had been in my mind all day long She would not be expecting me yet for I was much before my usual time wherefore I walked on slowly beside the brook deliberating on what I should say to her until I came to that large stone where I had sat dreaming the night when she had stood in the moonlight and first bidden me in to supper And now sinking upon this stone I set my elbows upon my knees and my chin in my hands and fixing my eyes upon the ever moving waters of the brook fell into a profound meditation From this I was suddenly aroused by the clink of iron and the snort of a horse Wondering I lifted my eyes but the bushes were very dense and I could see nothing But in a little borne upon the gentle wind came the sound of a voice low and soft and very sweet whose rich tones there was no mistaking followed almost immediately by another deeper gruffer the voice of a man With a bound I was upon my feet and had somehow crossed the brook but even so I was too late there was the crack of a whip followed by the muffled thud of a horse s hoofs which died quickly away and was lost in the stir of leaves I ground my teeth and cursed that fate which seemed determined that I should not meet this man face to face this man whose back I had seen but once a broad shouldered back clad in a blue coat I stood where I was dumb and rigid staring straight before me and once again a tremor passed over me that came and went growing stronger and stronger and once again in my head was the thud thud thud of the hammer In Scarlet town where I was born There was a fair maid dwellin Made every youth cry Well a way Her name was Barbara Allen She was approaching by that leafy path that wound its way along beside the brook and there came upon me a physical nausea and ever the thud of the hammer grew more maddening All in the merry month of May When green buds they were swellin Young Jemmy Grove on his death bed lay For love of Barbara Allen Now as she ended the verse she came out into the open and saw me and seeing me looked deliberately over my head and went on singing while I stood shivering So slowly slowly rase she up And slowly she came nigh him And when she drew the curtain by Young man I think you re dyin And suddenly the trees and bushes swung giddily round the grass swayed beneath my feet and Charmian was beside me with her arm about my shoulders but I pusbed her from me and leaned against a tree near by and hearkened to the hammer in my brain Why Peter said she Oh Peter Please Charmian said I speaking between the hammer strokes do not touch me again it is too soon after What do you mean Peter What do you mean He has been with you again What do you mean she cried I know of his visits if he was the same as last time in a blue coat no don t don t touch me But she had sprung upon me and caught me by the arms and shook me in a grip so strong that giddy as I was I reeled and staggered like a drunken man And still her voice hissed What do you mean And her voice and hands and eyes were strangely compelling I mean I answered in a low even voice like one in a trance that you are a Messalina a Julia a Joan of Naples beautiful as they and as wanton Now at the word she cried out and struck me twice across the face blows that burnt and stung Beast she cried Liar Oh that I had the strength to grind you into the earth beneath my foot Oh you poor blind self deluding fool and she laughed and her laughter stung me most of all As I look at you she went on the laugh still curling her lip you stand there what you are a beaten hound This is my last look and I shall always remember you as I see you now scarlet cheeked shamefaced a beaten hound And speaking she shook her hand at me and turned upon her heel but with that word and in that instant the old old demon leapt up within me and as he leapt I clasped my arms about her and caught her up and crushed her close and high against my breast Go said I Go no no not yet And now as her eyes met mine I felt her tremble yet she strove to hide her fear and heaped me with bitter scorn but I only shook my head and smiled And now she struggled to break my clasp fiercely desperately her long hair burst its fastenings and enveloped us both in its rippling splendor she beat my face she wound her fingers in my hair but my lips smiled on for the hammer in my brain had deadened all else And presently she lay still I felt her body relax and grow suddenly pliable and soft her head fell back across my arm and as she lay I saw the tears of her helplessness ooze out beneath her drooping lashes but still I smiled So with her long hair trailing over me I bore her to the cottage Closing the door behind me with my foot I crossed the room and set her down upon the bed She lay very still but her bosom heaved tumultuously and the tears still crept from beneath her lashes but in a while she opened her eyes and looked at me and shivered and crouched farther from me among the pillows Why did you lie to me Charmian why did you lie to me She did not answer only she watched me as one might watch some relentless oncoming peril I asked you once if you ever saw men hereabouts when I was away do you remember You told me no and while you spoke I knew you lied for I had seen him standing among the leaves waiting and watching for you I once asked you if you were ever lonely when I was away and you answered no you were too busy seldom went beyond the Hollow do you remember And yet you had brought him here here into the cottage he had looked at my Virgil over your shoulder do you remember You played the spy she whispered with trembling lips yet with eyes still fierce and scornful You know I did not had I seen him I should have killed him because I loved you I had set up an altar to you in my heart where my soul might worship poor fool that I was I loved you with every breath I drew I think I must have shown you something of this from time to time for you are very clever and you may have laughed over it together you and he And lately I have seen my altar foully desecrated shattered and utterly destroyed and with it your sweet womanhood dragged in the mire and yet I loved you still Can you imagine I wonder the agony of it the haunting horrors of imagination the bitter days the sleepless nights To see you so beautiful so glorious and know you so base Indeed I think it came near driving me mad It has sent me out into the night I have held out my arms for the lightning to blast me I have wished myself a thousand deaths If Black George had but struck a little harder or a little lighter I am not the man I was before he thrashed me my head grows confused and clouded at times would to God I were dead But now you would go Having killed my heart broken my life driven away all peace of mind you would leave me No Charmian I swear by God you shall not go yet awhile I have bought you very dear bought you with my bitter agony and by all the blasting torments I have suffered Now as I ended she sprang from the bed and faced me but meeting my look she shrank a little and drew her long hair about her like a mantle then sought with trembling hands to hold me off Peter be sane Oh Peter be merciful and let me go give me time let me explain My books said I have taught me that the more beautiful a woman s face the more guileful is her heart and your face is wonderfully beautiful and as for your heart you lied to me before I oh Peter I am not the poor creature you think me Were you the proudest lady in the land you have deceived me and mocked me and lied to me So saying I reached out and seized her by each rounded arm and slowly drew her closer And now she strove no more against me only in her face was bitter scorn and an anger that cast out fear I hate you despise you she whispered I hate you more than any man was ever hated Inch by inch I drew her to me until she stood close within the circle of my arms And I think I love you more than any woman was ever loved said I for the glorious beauty of your strong sweet body for the temptation of your eyes for the red lure of your lips And so I stooped and kissed her full upon the mouth She lay soft and warm in my embrace all unresisting only she shivered beneath my kiss and a great sob rent her bosom And I also think said I that because of the perfidy of your heart I hate you as much as you do me as much as ever woman dead or living was hated by man and shall forever And while I spoke I loosed her and turned and strode swiftly out and away from the cottage CHAPTER XXXIV IN WHICH I FIND PEACE AND JOY AND AN ABIDING SORROW I hurried on looking neither to right nor left seeing only the face of Charmian now fearful and appealing now blazing with scorn And coming to the brook I sat down and thought upon her marvellous beauty of the firm roundness of the arms that my fingers had so lately pressed Anon I started up again and plunged knee deep through the brook and strode on and on bursting my way through bramble and briar heedless of their petty stings till at last I was clear of them being now among trees And here where the shadow was deepest I came upon a lurking figure a figure I recognized a figure there was no mistaking and which I should have known in a thousand A shortish broad shouldered man clad in a blue coat who stood with his back towards me looking down into the Hollow in the attitude of one who waits for what for whom He was cut off from me by a solitary bush a bramble that seemed to have strayed from its kind and lost itself and running upon my toes I cleared this bush at a bound and before the fellow had realized my presence I had pinned him by the collar Damn you show your face I cried and swung him round so fiercely that he staggered and his hat fell off Then as I saw I clasped my head between my hands and fell back staring A grizzled man with an honest open face a middle aged man whose homely features were lighted by a pair of kindly blue eyes just now round with astonishment Lord mister Peter he exclaimed Adam I groaned Oh God forgive me it s Adam Lord mister Peter said he again you sure give me a turn Sir But what s the matter wi you sir Come mister Peter never stare so wild like come sir what is it Tell me quick said I catching his hand in mine you have been here many times before of late Why yes mister Peter but Quick said I on one occasion she took you into the cottage yonder and showed you a book you looked at it over her shoulder Yes sir but What sort of book was it A old book sir wi the cover broke and wi your name writ down inside of it twas that way as she found out who you was Oh Adam I cried Oh Adam now may God help me And dropping his hand I turned and ran until I reached the cottage but it was empty Charmian was gone In a fever of haste I sought her along the brook among the bushes and trees even along the road And as I sought night fell and in the shadows was black despair I searched the Hollow from end to end calling upon her name but no sound reached me save the hoot of an owl and the far off dismal cry of a corncrake With some faint hope that she might have returned to the cottage I hastened thither but finding it dark and desolate I gave way to my despair O blind self deceiving fool She had said that and she was right as usual She had called me an egoist I was an egoist a pedant a blind self deceiving fool who had wilfully destroyed all hopes of a happiness the very thought of which had so often set me trembling and now she had left me was gone The world my world was a void its emptiness terrified me How should I live without Charmian the woman whose image was ever before my eyes whose soft low voice was ever in my ears And I had thought so much to please her I who had set my thoughts to guard my tongue lest by word or look I might offend her And this was the end of it Sitting down at the table I leaned my head there pressing my forehead against the hard wood and remained thus a great while At last because it was very dark I found and lighted a candle and came and stood beside her bed Very white and trim it looked yet I was glad to see its smoothness rumpled where I had laid her down and to see the depression in the pillow that her head had made And while I stood there up to me stole a perfume very faint like the breath of violets in a wood at evening time wherefore I sank down upon my knees beside the bed And now the full knowledge of my madness rushed upon me in an overwhelming flood but with misery was a great and mighty joy for now I knew her worthy of all respect and honor and worship for her intellect for her proud virtue and for her spotless purity And thus with joy came remorse and with remorse an abiding sorrow And gradually my arms crept about the pillow where her head had so often rested wherefore I kissed it and laid my head upon it and sighed and so fell into a troubled sleep CHAPTER XXXV HOW BLACK GEORGE FOUND PRUDENCE IN THE DAWN The chill of dawn was in the air when I awoke and it was some few moments before with a rush I remembered why I was kneeling there beside Charmian s bed Shivering I rose and walked up and down to reduce the stiffness in my limbs The fire was out and I had no mind to light it for I was in no mood to break my fast though the necessary things stood ready as her orderly hands had set them and the plates and cups and saucers twinkled at me from the little cupboard I had made to hold them a cupboard whose construction she had overlooked with a critical eye And I must needs remember how she had insisted on being permitted to drive in three nails with her own hand I could put my finger on those very nails how she had tapped at those nails for fear of missing them how beautiful she had looked in her coarse apron and with her sleeves rolled up over her round white arms how womanly and sweet yet I had dared to think had dared to call her a Messalina Oh that my tongue had withered or ever I had coupled one so pure and noble with a creature so base and common So thinking I sighed and went out into the dawn as I closed the door behind me its hollow slam struck me sharply and I called to mind how she had called it a bad and ill fitting door And indeed so it was With dejected step and hanging head I made my way towards Sissinghurst for since I was up I might as well work and there was much to be done and as I went I heard a distant clock chime four Now when I reached the village the sun was beginning to rise and thus lifting up my eyes I beheld one standing before The Bull a very tall man much bigger and greater than most a wild figure in the dawn with matted hair and beard and clad in tattered clothes yet hair and beard gleamed a red gold where the light touched them and there was but one man I knew so tall and so mighty as this Wherefore I hurried towards him all unnoticed for his eyes were raised to a certain latticed casement of the inn And being come up I reached out and touched this man upon the arm George said I and held out my hand He turned swiftly but seeing me started back a pace staring George said I again Oh George But George only backed still farther passing his hand once or twice across his eyes Peter said he at last speaking hardly above a whisper but you m dead Peter dead I killed ee No I answered you didn t kill me George indeed I wish you had you came pretty near it but you didn t quite manage it And George I m very desolate won t you shake hands with a very desolate man if you can believing that I have always been your friend and a true and loyal one then give me your hand if not if you think me still the despicable traitor you once did then let us go into the field yonder and if you can manage to knock me on the head for good and all this time why so much the better Come what do you say Without a word Black George turned and led the way to a narrow lane a little distance beyond The Bull and from the lane into a meadow Being come thither I took off my coat and neckerchief but this time I cast no look upon the world about me though indeed it was fair enough But Black George stood half turned from me with his fists clenched and his broad shoulders heaving oddly Peter said he in his slow heavy way never clench ye fists to me don t I can t abide it But oh man Peter ow may I clasp ands wi a chap as I ve tried to kill I can t do it Peter but don t don t clench ye fists again me no more I were jealous of ee from the first ye see you beat me at th ammer throwin an she took your part again me an then you be so takin in your ways an I be so big an clumsy so very slow an eavy Theer bean t no choice betwixt us for a maid like Prue she allus was different from the likes o me an any lass wi half an eye could see as you be a gentleman ah an a good un An so Peter an so I be goin away a sojer p r aps I shan t love the dear lass quite so much arter a bit p r aps it won t be quite so sharp like arter a bit but what s to be is to be I ve larned wisdom an you an she was made for each other an meant for each other from the first so don t go to clench ye fists again me no more Peter Never again George said I Unless he continued as though struck by a bright idea unless you m minded to ave a whack at me if so be why tak it Peter an welcome Ye see I tried so ard to kill ee so cruel ard Peter an I thought I ad I thought twere for that as they took me an so I broke my way out o the lock up to come an say good by to Prue s winder an then I were goin back to give myself up an let em hang me if they wanted to Were you George Yes Here George turned to look at me and looking dropped his eyes and fumbled with his hands while up under his tanned skin there crept a painful burning crimson Peter said he Yes George I got summ at more to tell ee summ at as I never meant to tell to a soul when you was down lyin at my feet Yes George I I kicked ee once Did you George Ay I I were mad mad wi rage an blood lust an oh man Peter I kicked ee Theer said he straightening his shoulders leastways I can look ee in the eye now that be off my mind An now if so be you m wishful to tak ye whack at me why let it be a good un Peter No I shall never raise my hand to you again George Tis likely you be thinkin me a poor sort o man arter what what I just told ee a coward I think you more of a man than ever said I Why then Peter if ye do think that here s my hand if ye ll tak it an I bid ye good by I ll take your hand and gladly George but not to wish you goodby it shall be rather to bid you welcome home again No he cried No I couldn t I couldn t abide to see you an Prue married Peter no I couldn t abide it And you never will George Prue loves a stronger a better man than I And she has wept over him George and prayed over him such tears and prayers as surely might win the blackest soul to heaven and has said that she would marry that man ah even if he came back with fetter marks upon him even then she would marry him if he would only ask her Oh Peter cried George seizing my shoulders in a mighty grip and looking into my eyes with tears in his own oh man Peter you as knocked me down an as I love for it be this true It is God s truth said I and look there is a sign to prove I am no liar look and I pointed towards The Bull George turned and I felt his fingers tighten suddenly for there at the open doorway of the inn with the early glory of the morning all about her stood Prue As we watched she began to cross the road towards the smithy with laggard step and drooping head Do you know where she is going George I can tell you she is going to your smithy to pray for you do you hear to pray for you Come and I seized his arm No Peter no I durstn t I couldn t But he suffered me to lead him forward nevertheless Once he stopped and glanced round but the village was asleep about us And so we presently came to the open doorway of the forge And behold Prue was kneeling before the anvil with her face hidden in her arms and her slender body swaying slightly But all at once as if she felt him near her she raised her head and saw him and sprang to her feet with a glad cry And as she stood George went to her and knelt at her feet and raising the hem of her gown stooped and kissed it Oh my sweet maid said he Oh my sweet Prue I bean t worthy I bean t But she caught the great shaggy head to her bosom and stifled it there And in her face was a radiance a happiness beyond words and the man s strong arms clung close about her So I turned and left them in paradise together CHAPTER XXXVI WHICH SYMPATHIZES WITH A BRASS JACK A BRACE OF CUTLASSES AND DIVERS POTS AND PANS I found the Ancient sunning himself in the porch before the inn as he waited for his breakfast Peter said he I be tur ble cold sometimes It comes a creepin on me all at once even if I be sittin before a roarin fire or a baskin in this good warm sun a cold as reaches down into my poor old eart grave chills I calls em Peter ah grave chills Ketches me by the eart they do ye see I be that old Peter that old an wore out But you re a wonderful man for your age said I clasping the shrivelled hand in mine and very lusty and strong So strong as a bull I be Peter he nodded readily but then even a bull gets old an wore out an these grave chills ketches me oftener an oftener Tis like as if the Angel o Death reached out an touched me just touched me wi is finger soft like as much as to say Ere be a poor old wore out creeter as I shall be wantin soon Well I be ready tis only the young or the fule as fears to die Threescore years an ten says the Bible an I be years an years older than that Oh I shan t be afeared to answer when I m called Peter Ere I be Lord I ll say Ere I be thy poor old servant but oh Peter if I could be sure o that theer old rusty stapil bein took first why then I d go j yful j yful but why theer be that old fule Amos Lord what a dodderin old fule e be an theer be Job an Dutton they be comin to plague me Peter I can feel it in my bones Jest reach me my snuff box out o my ind pocket an you shall see me smite they Amalekites ip an thigh Gaffer began Old Amos saluting us with his usual grin as he came up we be wishful to ax ee a question we be wishful to know wheer be Black Jarge which you avin gone to fetch im an bring im ome again them was your words Ah nodded Job them was your very words bring im ome again says you But you didn t bring im ome continued Old Amos leastways not in the cart wi you Dutton ere James Dutton see you come drivin ome but e didn t see no Jarge along wi you no not so much as you could shake a stick at as you might say Speak up James Dutton you was a leanin over your front gate as Gaffer come drivin ome wasn t you an you see Gaffer plain as plain didn t you W ich me wishin no offense an no one objectin I did began the Apology perspiring profusely as usual but I takes the liberty to say as it were a spade an not a gate leastways But you didn t see no signs o Jarge did ye demanded Old Amos as ye might say neither ide nor air of im speak up James Dutton W ich since you axes me I makes so bold as to answer an very glad I m sure no though as to ide an air I aren t wishin to swear to me not bein near enough w ich could only be expected an very much obliged I m sure Ye see Gaffer pursued Amos if you didn t bring Jarge back wi you w ich you said you would the question we axes is wheer be Jarge Ah wheer nodded Job gloomily Here the Ancient was evidently at a loss to cover which he took a vast pinch of snuff Ow be we to know as e bean t pinin away in a dungeon cell wi irons on is legs an strapped in a straitjacket an Old Amos stopped open mouthed and staring for out from the gloom of the smithy issued Black George himself with Prue upon his arm The Ancient stared also but dissembling his vast surprise he dealt the lid of his snuffbox two loud triumphant knocks Peter said he rising stiffly Peter lad I were beginnin to think as Jarge were never comin in to breakfus at all I ve waited and waited till I be so ravenous as a lion an tiger but ere e be at last Peter ere e be so let s go in an eat summ at Saying which he turned his back upon his discomfited tormentors and led me into the kitchen of the inn And there were the white capped maids setting forth such a breakfast as only such a kitchen could produce And presently there was Prue herself with George hanging back something shamefaced till the Ancient had hobbled forward to give him welcome And there was honest Simon all wonderment and hearty greeting And last but by no means least there were the battered cutlasses the brass jack and the glittering pots and pans glittering and gleaming and twinkling a greeting likewise and with all their might Ah but they little guessed why Prue s eyes were so shy and sweet or why the color came and went in her pretty cheeks little they guessed why this golden haired giant trod so lightly and held his tall head so very high little they dreamed of the situation as yet had they done so surely they must one and all have fallen upon that curly golden head and buried it beneath their gleaming glittering twinkling jealousy And what a meal was that with those deft whitecapped maids to wait upon our wants and with Prudence hovering here and there to see that all were duly served and refusing to sit down until George s great arm a very gentle arm for one so strong and big drew her down beside him Yes truly what a meal that was and how the Ancient chuckled and dug me with one bony elbow and George with the other and chuckled again till he choked and choked till he gasped and gasped till he had us all upon our feet then demanded indignantly why we couldn t let him enj y hisself in peace And now when the meal was nearly over he suddenly took it into his head that Prue didn t love George as she should and as he deserved to be and nothing would content him but that she must kiss him then and there An not on the forr ud mind nor on the cheek but on the place as God made for it the mouth my lass And now who so shy and blushing as Prue and who so nervous for her sake as Black George very evidently clasping her hand under the table and bidding her never to mind as he was content and never to put herself out over such as him Whereupon Mistress Prue must needs turn and taking his bead between her hands kissed him not once or twice but three times and upon the place God made for it the mouth O gleaming Cutlasses O great Brass Jack and glittering Pots and Pans can ye any longer gleam and glitter and twinkle in doubt Alas I trow not Therefore it is only natural and to be expected that beneath your outward polish lurk black and bitter feelings against this curly headed giant and a bloodthirsty desire for vengeance If so then one and all of you have at least the good feeling not to show it a behavior worthy of gentlemen what do I say of gentlemen fie rather let it be said of pots and pans CHAPTER XXXVII THE PREACHER It is a wise and to some extent a true saying that hard work is an antidote to sorrow a panacea for all trouble but when the labor is over and done when the tools are set by and the weary worker goes forth into the quiet evening how then For we cannot always work and sooner or later comes the still hour when Memory rushes in upon us again and Sorrow and Remorse sit dark and gloomy on either hand A week dragged by a season of alternate hope and black despair a restless fever of nights and days for with each dawn came hope that lived awhile beside me only to fly away with the sun and leave me to despair I hungered for the sound of Charmian s voice for the quick light fall of her foot for the least touch of her hand I became more and more possessed of a morbid fancy that she might be existing near by could I but find her that she had passed along the road only a little while before me or at this very moment might be approaching might be within sight were I but quick enough Often at such times I would fling down my hammer or tongs to George s surprise and hurrying to the door stare up and down the road or pause in my hammerstrokes fiercely bidding George do the same fancying I heard her voice calling to me from a distance And George would watch me with a troubled brow but with a rare delicacy say no word Indeed the thought of Charmian was with me everywhere the ringing hammers mocked me with her praises the bellows sang of her beauty the trees whispered Charmian Charmian and Charmian was in the very air But when I had reluctantly bidden George good night and set out along lanes full of the fragrant dusk of evening when reaching the Hollow I followed that leafy path beside the brook which she and I had so often trodden together when I sat in my gloomy disordered cottage with the deep silence unbroken save for the plaintive murmur of the brook then indeed my loneliness was well nigh more than I could bear There were dark hours when the cottage rang with strange sounds when I would lie face down upon the floor clutching my throbbing temples between my palms fearful of myself and dreading the oncoming horror of madness It was at this time too that I began to be haunted by the thing above the door the rusty staple upon which a man had choked out his wretched life sixty and six years ago a wanderer a lonely man perhaps acquainted with misery or haunted by remorse one who had suffered much and long even as I but who had eventually escaped it all even as I might do Thus I would sit chin in hand staring up at this staple until the light failed and sometimes in the dead of night I would steal softly there to touch it with my finger Looking back on all this it seems that I came very near losing my reason for I had then by no means recovered from Black George s fist and indeed even now I am at times not wholly free from its effect My sleep too was often broken and troubled with wild dreams so that bed became a place of horror and rising I would sit before the empty hearth a candle guttering at my elbow and think of Charmian until I would fancy I heard the rustle of her garments behind me and start up trembling and breathless at such times the tap of a blown leaf against the lattice would fill me with a fever of hope and expectation Often and often her soft laugh stole to me in the gurgle of the brook and she would call to me in the deep night silences in a voice very sweet and faint and far away Then I would plunge out into the dark and lift my hands to the stars that winked upon my agony and journey on through a desolate world to return with the dawn weary and despondent It was after one of these wild night expeditions that I sat beneath a tree watching the sunrise And yet I think I must have dozed for I was startled by a voice close above me and glancing up I recognized the little Preacher As our eyes met he immediately took the pipe from his lips and made as though to cram it into his pocket Though indeed it is empty he explained as though I had spoken Old habits cling to one young sir and my pipe here has been the friend of my solitude these many years and I cannot bear to turn my back upon it yet so I carry it with me still and sometimes when at all thoughtful I find it between my lips But though the flesh as you see is very weak I hope in time to forego even this and he sighed shaking his head in gentle deprecation of himself But you look pale haggard he went on you are ill young sir No no said I springing to my feet look at this arm is it the arm of a sick man No no I am well enough but what of him we found in the ditch you and I the miserable creature who lay bubbling in the grass He has been very near death sir indeed his days are numbered I think yet he is better for the time being and last night declared his intention of leaving the shelter of my humble roof and setting forth upon his mission His mission sir He speaks of himself as one chosen by God to work His will and asks but to live until this mission whatever it is be accomplished A strange being said the little Preacher puffing at his empty pipe again as we walked on side by side a dark incomprehensible man and a very very wretched one poor soul Wretched said I is not that our human lot Man is born to sorrow as the sparks fly upward and Job was accounted wise in his generation That was a cry from the depths of despond but Job stood at last upon the heights and felt once more God s blessed sun and rejoiced even as we should But as regards this stranger he is one who would seem to have suffered some great wrong the continued thought of which has unhinged his mind his heart seems broken dead I have sitting beside his delirious couch heard him babble a terrible indictment against some man I have also heard him pray and his prayers have been all for vengeance Poor fellow said I it were better we had left him to die in his ditch for if death does not bring oblivion it may bring a change of scene Sir said the Preacher laying his hand upon my arm such bitterness in one so young is unnatural you are in some trouble I would that I might aid you be your friend know you better Oh sir that is easily done I am a blacksmith hardworking sober and useful to my fellows they call me Peter Smith A certain time since I was a useless dreamer spending more money in a week than I now earn in a year and getting very little for it I was studious egotistical and pedantic wasting my time upon impossible translations that nobody wanted and they knew me as Peter Vibart Vibart exclaimed the Preacher starting and looking up at me Vibart I nodded Related in any way to Sir Maurice Vibart His cousin sir My companion appeared lost in thought for he was puffing at his empty pipe again Do you happen to know Sir Maurice I inquired No returned the Preacher no sir but I have heard mention of him and lately though just when or where I cannot for the life of me recall Why the name is familiar to a great many people said I you see he is rather a famous character in his way Talking thus we presently reached a stile beyond which the footpath led away through swaying corn and by shady hopgarden to Sissinghurst village Here the Preacher stopped and gave me his hand but I noticed he still puffed at his pipe And you are now a blacksmith And mightily content so to be You are a most strange young man said the Preacher shaking his head Many people have told me the same sir said I and vaulted over the stile Yet turning back when I had gone some way I saw him leaning where I had left him and with his pipe still in his mouth CHAPTER XXXVIII IN WHICH I MEET MY COUSIN SIR MAURICE VIBART As I approached the smithy late though the hour was and George made it a rule to have the fire going by six every morning no sound of hammer reached me and coming into the place I found it empty Then I remembered that to day George was to drive over to Tonbridge with Prudence and the Ancient to invest in certain household necessities for in a month s time they were to be married Hereupon I must needs contrast George s happy future with my dreary one and fall bitterly to cursing myself and sitting on the Ancient s stool in the corner I covered my face and my thoughts were very black Now presently as I sat thus I became conscious of a very delicate perfume in the air and also that some one had entered quietly My breath caught in my throat but I did not at once look up fearing to dispel the hope that tingled within me So I remained with my face still covered until something touched me and I saw that it was the gold mounted handle of a whip wherefore I raised my head suddenly and glanced up Then I beheld a radiant vision in polished riding boots and speckless moleskins in handsome flowered waistcoat and perfect fitting coat with snowy frills at throat and wrists a tall gallant figure of a graceful easy bearing who stood a picture of cool gentlemanly insolence tapping his boot lightly with his whip But as his eye met mine the tapping whip grew suddenly still his languid expression vanished he came a quick step nearer and bent his face nearer my own a dark face handsome in its way pale and aquiline with a powerful jaw and dominating eyes and mouth a face nay a mask rather that smiled and smiled but never showed the man beneath Now glancing up at his brow I saw there a small newly healed scar Is it possible said he speaking in that softly modulated voice I remembered to have heard once before Can it be possible that I address my worthy cousin That shirt that utterly impossible coat and belcher And yet the likeness is remarkable Have I the honor to address mister Peter Vibart late of Oxford The same sir I answered rising Then most worthy cousin I salute you and he removed his hat bowing with an ironic grace Believe me I have frequently desired to see that paragon of all the virtues whose dutiful respect our revered uncle rewarded with the proverbial shilling Egad he went on examining me through his glass with a great show of interest had you been any other than that same virtuous Cousin Peter whose graces and perfections were forever being thrown at my head I could have sympathized with you positively if only on account of that most obnoxious coat and belcher and the grime and sootiness of things in general Poof he exclaimed pressing his perfumed handkerchief to his nostrils faugh how damnably sulphur and brimstony you do keep yourself cousin oh gad You would certainly find it much clearer outside said I beginning to blow up the fire But then Cousin Peter outside one must become a target for the yokel eye and I detest being stared at by the uneducated who naturally lack appreciation On the whole I prefer the smoke though it chokes one most infernally Where may one venture to sit here I tendered him the stool but he shook his head and crossing to the anvil flicked it daintily with his handkerchief and sat down dangling his leg Pon my soul said he eyeing me languidly through his glass again pon my soul you are damnably like me you know in features Damnably I nodded He glanced at me sharply and laughed My man a creature of the name of Parks said he swinging his spurred boot to and fro led me to suppose that I should meet a person here a blacksmith fellow Your man Parks informed you correctly I nodded what can I do for you The devil exclaimed Sir Maurice shaking his head but no you are as I gather somewhat eccentric but even you would never take such a desperate step as to to become a blacksmith fellow I put in Precisely Alas Sir Maurice I blush to say that rather than become an unprincipled adventurer living on my wits or a mean spirited hanger on fawning upon acquaintances for a livelihood or doing anything rather than soil my hands with honest toil I became a blacksmith fellow some four or five months ago Really it is most distressing to observe to what depths Virtue may drag a man you are a very monster of probity and rectitude exclaimed Sir Maurice indeed I am astonished you manifested not only shocking bad judgment but a most deplorable lack of thought Virtue is damnably selfish as a rule really it is quite disconcerting to find one s self first cousin to a blacksmith fellow I added Fellow nodded Sir Maurice Oh the devil to think of my worthy cousin reduced to the necessity of laboring with hammer and saw Not a saw I put in We will say chisel then a Vibart with hammer and chisel deuce take me Most distressing and you will pardon my saying so you do not seem to thrive on hammers and chisels no one could say you looked blooming or even flourishing like the young bay tree which is I fancy an Eastern expression Sir said I may I remind you that I have work to do A deuced interesting place though this he smiled staring round imperturbably through his glass so er so devilish grimy and smutty and gritty quite a number of horseshoes too D ye know cousin I never before remarked what a number of holes there are in a horseshoe but live and learn Here he paused to inhale a pinch of snuff very daintily from a jewelled box It is a strange thing he pursued as he dusted his fingers on his handkerchief a very strange thing that being cousins we have never met till now especially as I have heard so very much about you Pray said I pray how should you hear about one so very insignificant as myself Oh I have heard of good Cousin Peter since I was an imp of a boy he smiled Cousin Peter was my chart whereby to steer through the shoals of boyish mischief into the haven of our Uncle George s good graces Oh I have heard over much of you cousin from dear kind well meaning relatives and friends damn em They rang your praises in my ears morning noon and night And why simply that I might come to surpass you in virtue learning wit and appearance and so win our Uncle George s regard and incidentally his legacy But I was a young demon romping with the grooms in the stable while you were a young angel in nankeens passing studious hours with your books When I was a scapegrace at Harrow you were winning golden opinions at Eton when you were an honors man at Oxford I was rusticated at Cambridge Naturally enough perhaps I grew sick of the name of Peter and indeed it smacks damnably of fish don t you think you or your name crossed me at every turn If it wasn t for Cousin Peter I was heir to ten thousand a year but good Cousin Peter was so fond of Uncle George and Uncle George was so fond of good Cousin Peter that Maurice might go hang for a graceless dog and be damned to him You have my deepest sympathy and apologies said I Still I have sometimes been curious to meet worthy Cousin Peter and it is rather surprising that I have never done so On the contrary I began but his laugh stopped me Ah to be sure he nodded our ways have lain widely separate hitherto you a scholar treading the difficult path of learning I oh egad a terrible fellow a mauvais sujet a sad sad dog But after all cousin when one comes to look at you to day you might stand for a terrible example of Virtue run riot a distressing spectacle of dutiful respect and good precedent cut off with a shilling Really it is horrifying to observe to what depths Virtue may plunge an otherwise well balanced individual Little dreamed those dear kind well meaning relatives and friends damn em that while the wilful Maurice lived on continually getting into hot water and out again up to his eyes in debt and pretty well esteemed the virtuous pattern Peter would descend to a hammer and saw I should say chisel in a very grimy place where he is it seems the presiding genius Indeed this first meeting of ours under these circumstances is somewhat dramatic as it should be And yet we have met before said I and the circumstances were then even more dramatic perhaps we met in a tempest sir Ha he exclaimed dwelling on the word and speaking very slowly a tempest cousin There was much wind and rain and it was very dark Dark cousin But I saw your face very plainly as you lay on your back sir by the aid of a Postilion s lanthorn and was greatly struck by our mutual resemblance Sir Maurice raised his glass and looked at me and as he looked smiled but he could not hide the sudden passionate quiver of his thin nostrils or the gleam of the eyes beneath their languid lids He rose slowly and paced to the door when he came back again he was laughing softly but still he could not hide the quiver of his nostrils or the gleam of the eyes beneath their languid lids So it was you he murmured with a pause between the words Oh was ever anything so damnably contrary To think that I should hunt her into your very arms To think that of all men in the world it should be you to play the squire of dames And he laughed again but as he did so the stout riding whip snapped in his hands like a straw He glanced down at the broken pieces and from them to me You see I am rather strong in the hands cousin said he shaking his head but I was not quite strong enough last time we met though to be sure as you say it was very dark Had I known it was worthy Cousin Peter s throat I grasped I think I might have squeezed it just a little tighter Sir said I shaking my head I really don t think you could have done it Yes he sighed tossing his broken whip into a corner Yes I think so you see I mistook you for merely an interfering country bumpkin Yes I nodded while I on the other hand took you for a fine gentleman nobly intent on the ruin of an unfortunate friendless girl whose poverty would seem to make her an easy victim In which it appears you were as much mistaken as I Cousin Peter Here he glanced at me with a sudden keenness Indeed Why surely said he surely you must know He paused to flick a speck of soot from his knee and then continued Did she tell you nothing of herself Very little beside her name Ah she told you her name then Yes she told me her name Well cousin Well sir We had both risen and now fronted each other across the anvil Sir Maurice debonair and smiling while I stood frowning and gloomy Come said I at last let us understand each other once for all You tell me that you have always looked upon me as your rival for our uncle s good graces I never was You have deceived yourself into believing that because I was his ward that alone augmented my chances of becoming the heir it never did He saw me as seldom as possible and if he ever troubled his head about either of us it would seem that he favored you I tell you I never was your rival in the past and never shall be in the future Meaning cousin Meaning sir in regard to either the legacy or the Lady Sophia Sefton I was never fond enough of money to marry for it I have never seen this lady nor do I propose to thus so far as I am concerned you are free to win her and the fortune as soon as you will I as you see prefer horseshoes And what said Sir Maurice flicking a speck of soot from his cuff and immediately looking at me again what of Charmian I don t know I answered nor should I be likely to tell you if I did wherever she may be she is safe I trust and beyond your reach No he broke in she will never be beyond my reach until she is dead or I am perhaps not even then and I shall find her again sooner or later depend upon it yes you may depend upon that Cousin Maurice said I reaching out my hand to him wherever she may be she is alone and unprotected pursue her no farther Go back to London marry your Lady Sefton inherit your fortune but leave Charmian Brown in peace And pray said he frowning suddenly whence this solicitude de on her behalf What is she to you this Charmian Brown Nothing I answered hurriedly nothing at all God knows nor ever can be Sir Maurice leaned suddenly forward and catching me by the shoulder peered into my face By Heaven he exclaimed the fellow actually loves her Well said I meeting his look why not Yes I love her A very fury of rage seemed suddenly to possess him the languid smiling gentleman became a devil with vicious eyes and evil snarling mouth whose fingers sank into my flesh as he swung me back and forth in a powerful grip You love her you you he panted Yes I answered flinging him off so that he staggered yes yes I who fought for her once and am willing most willing to do so again now or at any other time for though I hold no hope of winning her ever yet I can serve her still and protect her from the pollution of your presence and I clenched my fists He stood poised as though about to spring at me and I saw his knuckles gleam whiter than the laces above them but all at once he laughed lightly easily as ever A very perfect gentle knight he murmured sans peur et sans reproche though somewhat grimy and in a leather apron Chivalry kneeling amid hammers and horseshoes worshiping Her with a reverence distant and lowly How like you worthy cousin how very like yon and how affecting But and here his nostrils quivered again but I tell you she is mine mine and always has been and no man living shall come between us no by God That said I that remains to be seen Ha Though indeed I think she is safe from you while I live But then Cousin Peter life is a very uncertain thing at best he returned glancing at me beneath his drooping lids Yes I nodded it is sometimes a blessing to remember that Sir Maurice strolled to the door and being there paused and looked back over his shoulder I go to find Charmian said he and I shall find her sooner or later and when I do should you take it upon yourself to come between us again or presume to interfere again I shall kill you worthy cousin without the least compunction If you think this sufficient warning act upon it if not He shrugged his shoulders significantly Farewell good and worthy Cousin Peter farewell or shall we say au revoir CHAPTER XXXIX HOW I WENT DOWN INTO THE SHADOWS Peter said George one evening turning to me with the troubled look I had seen so often on his face of late what be wrong wi you my chap You be growing paler everyday Oh Peter you be like a man as is dyin by inches if tis any o my doin Nonsense George I broke in with sudden asperity I am well enough Yet I ve seen your ands fall a trembling sometimes Peter all at once An you missed your stroke yesterday come square down on th anvil you can t ha forgot I remember I muttered I remember An twice again to day An you be silent Peter an don t seem to ear when spoke to an short in your temper oh you bean t the man you was I ve see it a comin on you more an more Oh man Peter he cried turning his back upon me suddenly you as I d let walk over me you as I d be cut in pieces for if it be me as done it No no George it wasn t you of course not If I am a little strange it is probably due to lack of sleep nothing more Ye see Peter I tried so ard to kill ee an you said yourself as I come nigh doin it But then you didn t quite manage it I cried harshly would to God you had as it is I am alive and there s an end of it Twere a woundy blow I give ee that last one I ll never forget the look o your face as you went down Oh Peter you ve never been the same since it be all my doin I know it I know it and sinking upon the Ancient s stool in the corner Black George covered his face Never think of it George I said laying my arm across his heaving shoulders that is all over and done with dear fellow and I would not have it otherwise since it gained me your friendship I am all right well and strong it is only sleep that I need George only sleep Upon the still evening air rose the sharp tap tap of the Ancient s stick whereat up started the smith and coming to the forge began raking out the fire with great dust and clatter as the old man hobbled up saluting us cheerily as he came Lord he exclaimed pausing in the doorway to lean upon his stick and glance from one to the other of us with his quick bright eyes Lord theer bean t two other such fine up standin likely lookin chaps in all the South Country as you two chaps be no nor such smiths it du warm my old eart to look at ee Puts me in mind o what I were myself ages an ages ago I weren t quite so tall as Jarge p r aps by about say alf a inch but then I were wider wider ah a sight wider in the shoulder an so strong as four bulls an wi eyes big an sharp an piercin like Peter s only Peter s bean t quite so sharp no nor yet so piercin an that minds me as I ve got noos for ee Peter What news said I turning S prisin noos it be ah an stonishin tu But first of all Peter I wants to ax ee a question What is it Ancient Why it be this Peter said the old man hobbling nearer and peering up into my face ever since the time as I went an found ye I ve thought as theer was summ at strange about ee what wi your soft voice an gentle ways an it came on me all at once about three o the clock s arternoon as you might be a dook in disguise Peter Come now be ye a dook or bean t ye yes or ne Peter and he fixed me with his eye No Ancient I answered smiling I m no duke Ah well a earl then Nor an earl A barrynet p r aps Not even a baronet Ah said the old man eyeing me doubtfully I ve often thought as you might be one or t other of em specially since bout three o the clock s arternoon Why so Why that s the p int that s the very noos as I ve got to tell ee chuckled the Ancient as he seated himself in the corner You must know then he began with an impressive rap on the lid of his snuffbox bout three o clock s arternoon I were sittin on the stile by Simon s five acre field when along the road comes a lady an some an proud looking an as fine as fine could be a ridin of a orse an wi a servant ridin another orse be ind er As she comes up she gives me a look out o er eyes soft they was an dark an up I gets to touch my at All at once she smiles at me an er smile were as sweet an gentle as er eyes an she pulls up er orse W y you must be the Ancient says she W y so Peter calls me my leddy says I An ow is Peter she says quick like ow is Peter says she Fine an earty says I eats well an sleeps sound says I is arms is strong an is legs is strong an e aren t afeared o nobody like a young lion be Peter says I Now while I m a sayin this she looks at me soft an thoughtful like an takes out a little book an begins to write in it a wrinklin er pretty black brows over it an a shakin er ead to erself An presently she tears out what she s been a writin an gives it to me Will you give this to Peter for me says she That I will my leddy says I Thank ee says she smilin again an oldin out er w ite an to me which I kisses Indeed says she I understand now why Peter is so fond of you I think I could be very fond of ee tu says she An so she turns er orse an the servant e turns is an off they go an ere Peter ere be the letter Saying which the Ancient took a slip of paper from the cavernous interior of his hat and tendered it to me With my head in a whirl I crossed to the door and leaned there awhile staring sightlessly out into the summer evening for it seemed that in this little slip of paper lay that which meant life or death to me so for a long minute I leaned there fearing to learn my fate Then I opened the little folded square of paper and holding it before my eyes read Charmian Brown presents This scratched out While you busied yourself forging horseshoes your cousin Sir Maurice sought and found me I do not love him but CHARMIAN Farewell This also scored out Again I stared before me with unseeing eyes but my hands no longer trembled nor did I fear any more the prisoner had received his sentence and suspense was at an end And all at once I laughed and tore the paper across and laughed and laughed till George and the Ancient came to stare at me Don t ee cried the old man don t ee Peter you be like a corp laughin don t ee But the laugh still shook me while I tore and tore at the paper and so let the pieces drop and flutter from my fingers There said I there goes a fool s dream See how it scatters a little here a little there but so long as this world lasts these pieces shall never come together again So saying I set off along the road looking neither to right nor left But when I had gone some distance I found that George walked beside me and he was very silent as he walked and I saw the trouble was back in his eyes again George said I stopping why do you follow me I don t follow ee Peter he answered I be only wishful to walk wi you a ways I m in no mood for company George Well I bean t company Peter your friend I be he said doggedly and without looking at me Yes said I yes my good and trusty friend Peter he cried suddenly laying his hand upon my shoulder don t go back to that theer ghashly Oller to night It is the only place in the world for me to night George And so we went on again side by side through the evening and spoke no more until we had come to the parting of the ways Down in the Hollow the shadows lay black and heavy and I saw George shiver as he looked Good by said I clasping his hand good by George Why do ee say good by Because I am going away Goin away Peter but wheer God knows I answered but wherever it be I shall carry with me the memory of your kind true heart and you I think will remember me It is a blessed thing George to know that howso far we go a friend s kind thoughts journey on with us untiring to the end Oh Peter man don t go for to leave me To part is our human lot George and as well now as later good by No no he cried throwing his arm about me not down theer it be so deadly an lonely down theer in the darkness Come back wi me just for to night But I broke from his detaining hand and plunged on down into the shadows And presently turning my head I saw him yet standing where I had left him looming gigantic upon the sky behind and with his head sunk upon his breast Being come at last to the cottage I paused and from that place of shadows lifted my gaze to the luminous heaven where were a myriad eyes that seemed to watch me with a new meaning to night wherefore I entered the cottage hastily and closing the door barred it behind me Then I turned to peer up at that which showed above the door the rusty staple upon which a man had choked his life out sixty and six years ago And I began very slowly to loosen the belcher neckerchief about my throat Peter cried a voice Peter and a hand was beating upon the door CHAPTER XL HOW IN PLACE OF DEATH I FOUND THE FULNESS OF LIFE She came in swiftly closing the door behind her found and lighted a candle and setting it upon the table between us put back the hood of her cloak and looked at me while I stood mute before her abashed by the accusation of her eyes Coward she said and with the word snatched the neckerchief from my grasp and casting it upon the floor set her foot upon it Coward said she again Yes I muttered yes I was lost in a great darkness and full of a horror of coming rights and days and so I would have run away from it all like a coward Oh hateful hateful she cried and covered her face as from some horror Indeed you cannot despise me more than I do myself said I now or ever I am a failure in all things except perhaps the making of horseshoes and this world has no place for failures and as for horseshoes Fool she whispered Oh fool that I dreamed so wise Oh coward that seemed so brave and strong Oh man that was so gloriously young and unspoiled that it should end here that it should come to this And though she kept her face hidden I knew that she was weeping A woman s love transforms the man till she sees him not as he is but as her heart would have him be the dross becomes pure gold and she believes and believes until one day her heart breaks Charmian what what do you mean Oh are you still so blind Must I tell you she cried lifting her head proudly Why did I live beside you here in the wilderness Why did I work for you contrive for you and seek to make this desolation a home for you Often my heart cried out its secret to you but you never heard often it trembled in my voice looked at you from my eyes but you never guessed Oh blind blind And you drove me from you with shameful words but oh I came back to you And now I know you for but common clay after all and even yet She stopped suddenly and once more hid her face from me in her hands And even yet Charmian I whispered Very still she stood with her face bowed upon her hands but she could not hide from me the swift rise and fall of her bosom Speak oh Charmian speak I am so weak so weak she whispered I hate myself Charmian I cried oh Charmian and seized her hands and despite her resistance drew her into my arms and clasping her close forced her to look at me And even yet what more what more tell me But lying back across my arm she held me off with both hands Don t she cried don t you shame me let me go God knows I am all unworthy Charmian and so low in my abasement that to touch you is presumption but oh woman whom I have loved from the first and shall to the end have you stooped in your infinite mercy to lift me from these depths is it a new life you offer me was it for this you came to night Let me go oh Peter let me go Why why did you come Loose me Why did you come To meet Sir Maurice Vibart To meet Sir Maurice I repeated dully Sir Maurice And in that moment she broke from me and stood with her head thrown back and her eyes very bright as though defying me But I remained where I was my arms hanging He was to meet me here at nine o clock Oh Charmian I whispered are all women so cruel as you I wonder And turning my back upon her I leaned above the mantel staring down at the long dead ashes on the hearth But standings there I heard a footstep outside and swung round with clenched fists yet Charmian was quicker and as the door opened and Sir Maurice entered she was between us He stood upon the threshold dazzled a little by the light but smiling graceful debonair and point device as ever Indeed his very presence seemed to make the mean room the meaner by contrast and as he bent to kiss her hand I became acutely conscious of my own rough person my worn and shabby clothes and of my hands coarsened and grimed by labor wherefore my frown grew the blacker and I clenched my fists the tighter I lost my way Charmian he began but though late I am none the less welcome I trust Ah you frown Cousin Peter Quite a ghoulish spot this at night you probably find it most congenial good cousin Timon of Athens indeed cousin you are very like Timon of Athens And he laughed so that I finding my pipe upon the mantelshelf began to turn it aimlessly round and round in my twitching fingers You have already met then inquired Charmian glancing from one to the other of us We had that mutual pleasure nearly a week ago nodded Sir Maurice when we agreed to disagree as we always have done and shall do with the result that we find each other agreeably disagreeable I had hoped that you might be friends My dear Charmian I wonder at you he sighed so unreasonable Would you have us contravene the established order of things It was preordained that Cousin Peter should scowl at me precisely as he is doing and that I should shrug my shoulders thus at Cousin Peter a little hate with say a dash of contempt give a zest to that dish of conglomerate vapidity which we call Life and make it almost palatable But I am not here on Cousin Peter s account he went on drawing a step nearer to her at this moment I heartily wish him among his hammers and chisels I have come for you Charmian because I love you I have sought you patiently until I found you and I will never forego you so long as life lasts but you know all this Yes I know all this I have been very patient Charmian submitting to your whims and fancies but through it all I knew and in your woman s heart you knew that you must yield at last that the chase must end some day well let it be to night my chaise is waiting When I ran away from you in the storm Sir Maurice I told you once and for all that I hated you Have you forgotten hated you always and ever and tried to kill you Oh Charmian I have known such hate transfigured into love before now such love as is only worth the winning And you are mine you always were from the first moment that our eyes met Come my chaise is waiting in a few hours we can be in London or Dover No never Never is a long time Charmian but I am at your service what is your will I shall remain here Here In the wilderness With my husband Your husband I am going to marry your cousin Peter Vibart The pipe slipped from my fingers and shivered to pieces on the floor and in that same fraction of time Sir Maurice had turned and leapt towards me but as he came I struck him twice with left and right and he staggered backwards to the wall He stood for a moment with his head stooped upon his hands When he looked up his face was dead white and with a smear of blood upon it that seemed to accentuate its pallor but his voice came smooth and unruffled as ever The Mind Feminine is given to change said he softly and I shall return yes I shall come back Smile madam Triumph cousin But I shall come between you yet I tell you I ll come between you living or dead And so he turned and was gone into the shadows But as for me I sat down and leaning my chin in my hand stared down at the broken fragments of my pipe Peter You are safe now said I without looking up he is gone but oh Charmian was there no other way She was down beside me on her knees had taken my hand rough and grimy as it was and pressed it to her lips and so had drawn it about her neck holding it there and with her face hidden in my breast Oh strong man that is so weak she whispered Oh grave philosopher that is so foolish Oh lonely boy that is so helpless Oh Peter Vibart my Peter Charmian said I trembling what does it mean It means Peter Yes That the Humble Person Yes Will marry you whenever you will if Yes If you will only ask her CHAPTER XLI LIGHT AND SHADOW Now as the little Preacher closed his book the sun rose up filling the world about us with his glory And looking into the eyes of my wife it seemed that a veil was lifted for a moment there and I read that which her lips might never tell and there also were joy and shame and a deep happiness See said the little Preacher smiling upon us it is day and a very glorious one already a thousand little choristers of God s great cathedral have begun to chant your marriage hymn Go forth together Man and Wife upon this great wide road that we call Life go forth together made strong in Faith and brave with Hope and the memory of Him who walked these ways before you who joyed and sorrowed and suffered and endured all things even as we must Go forth together and may His blessing abide with you and the peace that passeth understanding And so we turned together side by side and left him standing amid his roses Silently we went together homewards through the dewy morning with a soft green carpet underfoot and leafy arches overhead where trees bent to whisper benedictions and shook down jewels from their dewy leaves upon us as we passed by merry brooks that laughed and chattered and gurgled of love and happiness while over all rose the swelling chorus of the birds Surely never had they piped so gladly in this glad world before not even for the gentle Spenser though he says There was none of them that feigned To sing for each of them him pained To find out merry crafty notes They ne spared not their throats And being come at length to the Hollow Charmian must needs pause beside the pool among the willows to view herself in the pellucid water And in this mirror our eyes met and lo of a sudden her lashes drooped and she turned her head aside Don t Peter she whispered don t look at me so How may I help it when you are so beautiful And because of my eyes she would have fled from me but I caught her in my arms and there amid the leaves despite the jealous babble of the brook for the second time in my life her lips met mine And gazing yet into her eyes I told her how in this shady bower I had once watched her weaving leaves into her hair and heard her talk to her reflection and so had stolen away for fear of her beauty Fear Peter We were so far out of the world and I longed to kiss you And didn t Peter And didn t Charmian because we were so very far from the world and because you were so very much alone and And because Peter because you are a gentle man and strong as the old locket says And do you remember she went on hurriedly laying her cool restraining fingers on my eager lips how I found you wearing that locket and how you blundered and stammered over it and pretended to read your Homer And how you sang to prevent me And how gravely you reproved me And how you called me a creature And how you deserved it sir and grew more helpless and ill at ease than ever and how just to flatter my vanity you told me I had glorious hair And so you have said I kissing a curl at her temple when you unbind it my Charmian it will cover you like a mantle Now when I said this for some reason she glanced up at me sudden and shy and blushed and slipped from my arms and fled up the path like a nymph So we presently entered the cottage flushed and panting and laughing for sheer happiness And now she rolled up her sleeves and set about preparing breakfast laughing my assistance to scorn but growing mightily indignant when I would kiss her yet blushing and yielding nevertheless And while she bustled to and fro keeping well out of reach of my arm she began to sing in her soft voice to herself In Scarlet town where I was born There was a fair maid dwellin Made every youth cry Well a way Her name was Barbara Allen Oh Charmian how wonderful you are All in the merry month of May When green buds they were swellin Surely no woman ever had such beautiful arms so round and soft and white Charmian She turned upon me with a fork held up admonishingly but meeting my look her eyes wavered and up from throat to brow rushed a wave of burning crimson Oh Peter you make me almost afraid of you she whispered and hid her face against my shoulder Are you content to have married such a very poor man to be the wife of a village blacksmith Why Peter in all the world there never was such another blacksmith as mine and and there the kettle is boiling over Let it said I And the bacon the bacon will burn let me go and oh Peter So in due time we sat down to our solitary wedding breakfast and there were no eyes to speculate upon the bride s beauty to note her changing color or the glory of her eyes and no healths were proposed or toasts drunk nor any speeches spoken except perhaps by my good friend the brook outside who of course understood the situation and babbled tolerantly of us to the listening trees like the grim old philosopher he was In this solitude we were surely closer together and belonged more fully to each other for all her looks and thoughts were mine as mine were hers And as we ate sometimes talking and sometimes laughing though rarely one seldom laughs in the wilderness our hands would stray to meet each other across the table and eye would answer eye while in the silence the brook would lift its voice to chuckle throaty chuckles and outlandish witticisms such as could only be expected from an old reprobate who had grown so in years and had seen so very much of life At such times Charmian s cheeks would flush and her lashes droop as though indeed she were versed in the language of brooks So the golden hours slipped by the sun crept westward and evening stole upon us This is a very rough place for you said I and sighed We were sitting on the bench before the door and Charmian had laid her folded hands upon my shoulder and her chin upon her hands And now she echoed my sigh but answered without stirring It is the dearest place in all the world And very lonely I pursued I shall be busy all day long Peter and you always reach home as evening falls and then then oh I sha n t be lonely But I am such a gloomy fellow at the best of times and very clumsy Charmian and something of a failure And my husband Peter Peter oh Peter I started and rose to my feet Peter oh Peter called the voice again seemingly from the road and now I thought it sounded familiar Charmian stole her arms aboat my neck I think it is Simon said I uneasily what can have brought him And he will never venture down into the Hollow on account of the ghost I must go and see what he wants Yes Peter she murmured but the clasp of her arms tightened What is it said I looking into her troubled eyes Charmian you are trembling what is it I don t know but oh Peter I feel as if a shadow a black and awful shadow were creeping upon us hiding us from each other I am very foolish aren t I and this our wedding day Peter Pe ter Come with me Charmian let us go together No I must wait it is woman s destiny to wait but I am brave again go see what is wanted I found Simon sure enough in the lane seated in his cart and his face looked squarer and grimmer even than usual Oh Peter said he gripping my hand it be come at last Gaffer be goin Going Simon Dyin Peter Fell downstairs s marnin Doctor says e can t last the day out sinkin fast e be an e be axin for ee Peter Wheer be Peter says e over an over again wheer be the Peter as I found of a sunshiny arternoon down in th aunted Oller You weren t at work s marnin Peter so I be come to fetch ee you ll come back wi me to bid good by to the old man Yes I ll come Simon I answered wait here for me Charmian was waiting for me in the cottage and as she looked up at me I saw the trouble was back in her eyes again You must go leave me she inquired For a little while Yes I I felt it she said with a pitiful little smile The Ancient is dying said I Now as I spoke my eyes encountered the staple above the door wherefore mounting upon a chair I seized and shook it And lo the rusty iron snapped off in my fingers like glass and I slipped it into my pocket Oh Peter don t go don t leave me cried Charmian suddenly and I saw that her face was very pale and that she trembled Charmian said I and sprang to her side Oh my love what is it It is as though the shadow hung over us darker and more threatening Peter as if our happiness were at an end I seem to hear Maurice s threat to come between us living or dead I am afraid she whispered clinging to me I am afraid But all at once she was calm again and full of self reproaches calling herself weak and foolish and hysterical though indeed I was never hysterical before and telling me that I must go that it was my duty to go to the gentle dying old man urging me to the door almost eagerly till being out of the cottage she must needs fall a trembling once more and wind her arms about my neck with a great sob But oh you will come back soon very soon Peter And we know that nothing can ever come between us again never again my husband And with that blessed word she drew me down to her lips and turning fled into the cottage I went on slowly up the path to meet Simon and as I went my heart was heavy and my mind full of a strange foreboding But I never thought of the omen of the knife that had once fallen and quivered in the floor between us Twere is snuff box as done it said Simon staring very hard at his horse s ears as we jogged along the road E were a goin upstairs for it an slipped e did Simon says he as I lifted of im in my arms Simon says e quiet like I be done for at last lad this poor old feyther o yourn ll never go a climbin up these stairs no more says e never no more After this Simon fell silent and I likewise until we reached the village Before The Bull was a group who talked with hushed voices and grave faces even Old Amos grinned no more The old man lay in his great four post bed propped up with pillows and with Prue beside him to smooth his silver hair with tender fingers and Black George towering in the shade of the bed curtains like a grieving giant Ere I be Peter said the old man beckoning me feebly with his hand ere I be at the partin o the ways an wi summ at gone wrong wi my innards When a man gets so old as I be is innards be like glass Peter like glass an apt to fly all to pieces if e goes a slippin an a slidin downstairs like me Are you in pain I asked clasping his shrivelled hand Jest a twinge now an then Peter but Lord that bean t nothin to a man the likes o me Peter You always were so hale and hearty I nodded giving him the usual opening he had waited for Ay so strong as a bull that I were like a lion in my youth Black Jarge were nought to me a cart orse I were Yes said I yes and stooped my head lower over the feeble old hand But arter all Peter bulls pass away an lions an cart orses lose their teeth an gets wore out for all flesh is grass but iron s iron bean t it Peter rusts it do but tis iron all the same an lasts a man out even such a earty chap as I were Sometimes said I without looking up An I be very old an tired Peter my eart be all

Yes Ancient Oh Peter it be that theer old stapil as ll go on rustin away an rustin away arter the old man as watched it so is laid in the earth an forgot about No said I without looking up but slipping my hand into my pocket no Ancient Peter Oh Peter do ee mean I mean that although it had no heart the staple was tired and worn out just as you are and so I brought it to you and I slipped the rusty bit of iron into the old man s trembling palm O Lord he began in a fervent voice O dear Lord I got it Lord th owd stapil I be ready to come to Thee an j yful j yful an for this mercy an benefit received blessed be Thy name Amen He lay very quiet for a while with the broken staple clasped to his breast and his eyes closed Peter said he suddenly you won t ave no one to bring you noos no more why Peter be ee cryin for me Tis true t were me as found ye but I didn t think as you d go to cry tears for me I be goin to tak t owd stapil wi me Peter all along the road an Peter Yes Ancient Be you quite sure as you aren t a dook Quite sure Nor a earl No Ancient Not even a barrynet No Ancient Ah well you be a man Peter an tis summ at to ha found a man that it be And now he feebly beckoned us all nearer Children said he I be a old an ancient man I be goin on across the river to wait for you my blessin on ye It be a dark dark road but I ve got t owd stapil an there be a light beyond the river So the Ancient sighed and crossed the dark River into the Land of Light Eternal CHAPTER XLII HOW SIR MAURICE KEPT HIS WORD Night with a rising moon and over all things a great quietude a deep deep silence Air close and heavy without a breath to wake the slumbering trees an oppressive stillness in which small sounds magnified themselves and seemed disproportionately loud And presently as I went upon my way I forgot the old man sleeping so peacefully with the rusty staple clasped to his shrunken breast and thought only of the proud woman who had given her life into my keeping and who henceforth would walk with me hand in hand upon this Broad Highway over rough places and smooth even unto the end So I strode on full of a deep and abiding joy and with heart that throbbed and hands that trembled because I knew that she watched and waited for my coming A sound broke upon the stillness sudden and sharp like the snapping of a stick I stopped and glanced about me but it had come and gone lost in the all pervading calm And presently reaching the leafy path that led steeply down into the Hollow I paused a moment to look about me and to listen again but the deep silence was all unbroken save for the slumberous song of the brook that stole up to me from the shadows and I wondered idly what that sudden sound might have been So I began to descend this leafy path and went on to meet that which lay waiting for me in the shadows It was dark here among the trees for the moon was low as yet but every now and then she sent a kindly ray through some opening amid the leaves so that as I descended the path I seemed to be wading through small limpid pools of radiance But all at once I stopped staring at something which lay at the edge of one of these pools a white claw a hand whose fingers talon like had sunk deep and embedded themselves in the turf And beyond this gleaming hand was an arm and beyond that again something that bulked across my path darker than the shadows Running forward I stood looking down at that which lay at my feet so very still and stooped suddenly and turned it over that I might see the face and seeing it started back in shuddering horror For in those features hideous with blood stained and blackened with powder I recognized my cousin Sir Maurice Vibart Then remembering the stick that had snapped I wondered no more but a sudden deadly faintness came upon me so that I leaned weakly against a tree near by A rustling of leaves a shuddering breath and though I did not raise my head I knew that Charmian was there Oh Peter she whispered oh Peter and that was all but moved by something in her tone I glanced up Her eyes were wide and staring not at me but at that which lay between us her face was pallid even her lips had lost their color and she clasped one hand upon her bosom the other was hidden in the folds of her gown hidden as I remembered to have seen it once before but now it struck me with a horrible significance Wherefore I reached out and caught that hidden hand and drew the weapon from her nerveless fingers holding it where the light could play upon it She started shivered violently and covered her eyes while I looking down at the pistol in my hand saw that it had lately been discharged He has kept his word she whispered he has kept his word Yes Charmian he has kept his word Oh Peter she moaned and stretched out her hands towards me yet she kept her face turned from that which lay across the path between us and her hands were shaking pitifully Peter she cried with a sudden break in her voice but I went on wiping the soot from the pistol barrel with the end of my neckerchief Then all at once she was beside me clasping my arm and she was pleading with me her words coming in a flood No Peter no oh God you do not think it you can t you mustn t I was alone waiting for you and the hours passed and you didn t come and I was nervous and frightened and full of awful fancies I thought I heard some one creeping round the cottage Once I thought some one peered in at the lattice and once I thought some one tried the door And so because I was frightened Peter I took that that and held it in my hand Peter And while I sat there it seemed more than ever that somebody was breathing softly outside the door And so Peter I couldn t bear it any more and opened the lattice and fired in the air I swear it was in the air And I stood there at the open casement sick with fear and trying to pray for you because I knew he had come back to kill you Peter and while I prayed I heard another shot not close but faint like the snapping of a twig Peter and I ran out and oh Peter that is all but you believe oh you believe don t you Peter While she spoke I had slipped the pistol into my pocket and now I held out my hands to her and drew her near and gazed into the troubled depths of her eyes Charmian said I Charmian I love you and God forbid that I should ever doubt you any more So with a sigh she sank in my embrace her arms crept about my neck and our lips met and clung together But even then while I looked upon her beauty while the contact of her lips thrilled through me even then in any mind I saw the murderous pistol in her hand as I had seen it months ago Indeed it almost seemed that she divined my thought for she drew swiftly back and looked up at me with haggard eyes Peter she whispered what is it what is it Oh Charmian said I over and over again I love you I love you And I kissed her appealing eyes and stayed her questioning lips with my kisses I love you more than my life more than honor more than my soul and because I so love you to night you must leave me Leave you ah no Peter no no I am your wife I must stay with you to suffer and share your troubles and dangers it is my right my privilege Let us go away together now anywhere anywhere only let us be together my husband Don t I cried don t Do you think it is so easy to remain here without you to lose you so soon so very soon If I only loved you a little less Ah don t you see before the week is out my description will be all over England we should be caught and you would have to stand beside me in a court of justice and face the shame of it Dear love it would be my pride my pride Peter to face them all to clasp this dear hand in mine Never I cried clenching my fists never You must leave me no one must know Charmian Brown ever existed you must go Hush she whispered clasping me tighter listen some one is coming Away to the right we could hear the leaves rustling as though a strong wind passed through them a light flickered went out flickered again and a voice hailed faintly Hallo Come said Charmian clasping my hand let us go and meet him No Charmian no I must see this man alone You must leave here to night now You can catch the London Mail at the cross roads Go to Blackheath to Sir Richard Anstruther he is my friend tell him everything She was down at my feet and had caught my hand to her bosom I can t she cried I can t go and leave you here alone I have loved you so from the very first and it seems that each day my love has grown until it is part of me Oh Peter don t send me away from you it will kill me I think Better that than the shame of a prison I exclaimed and while I spoke I lifted her in my arms Oh I am proud proud to have won such a love as yours let me try to be worthy of it Good by my beloved and so I kissed her and would have turned away but her arms clung about me Oh Peter she sobbed if you must go if you will go call me your wife just once Peter The hovering light was much nearer now and the rustle of leaves louder as I stooped above her cold hands and kissed their trembling fingers Some day said I some day if there is a just God in heaven we shall meet again perhaps soon perhaps late Until then let us dream of that glorious golden some day but now farewell oh beloved wife With a broken cry she drew my head down upon her breast and clasped it there while her tears mingled with her kisses and so crying my name she turned and was lost among the leaves CHAPTER XLIII HOW I SET OUT TO FACE MY DESTINY The pallid moon shone down pitilessly upon the dead white face that stared up at me through its grime and blood with the same half tolerant half amused contempt of me that it had worn in life the drawn lips seemed to mock me and the clenched fists to defy me still so that I shivered and turned to watch the oncoming light that danced like a will o the wisp among the shadows Presently it stopped and a voice hailed once more Hallo Hallo I called back this way this way In a little while I saw the figure of a man whom I at once recognized as the one time Postilion bearing the lanthorn of a chaise and as he approached it struck me that this meeting was very much like our first save for him who lay in the shadows staring up at me with unwinking eyes So ho exclaimed the Postilion as he came up raising his lanthorn that he might view me the better it s you again is it Yes I nodded Well I don t like it he grumbled a meeting of each other again like this in this ere ghashly place no I don t like it too much like last time to be nat ral and as you know I can t abide onnat ralness If I was to ax you where my master was like as not you d tell me e was Here said I and moving aside pointed to the shadow The Postilion stepped nearer lowering his lanthorns then staggered blindly backward Lord he whimpered Lord love me and stood staring with dropped jaw Where is your chaise Up yonder yonder in the lane he mumbled his eyes still fixed Then help me to carry him there No no I dursn t touch it I can t not me not me I think you will said I and took the pistol from my pocket Ain t one enough for to night he muttered put it away I ll come I ll do it put it away So I dropped the weapon back into my pocket while the Postilion shivering violently stooped with me above the inanimate figure and with our limp burden between us we staggered and stumbled up the path and along the lane to where stood a light traveling chaise E ain t likely to come to this time I m thinkin said the Postilion mopping the sweat from his brow and grinning with pallid lips after we had got our burden into the vehicle no e ain t likely to wake up no more nor yet curse my ead off this side o Jordan No I answered beginning to unwind my neckcloth Nor it ain t no good to go a bandagin and a bindin of im up like you did last time No said I no And stepping into the chaise I muffled that disfigured face in my neckcloth having done which I closed the door What now inquired the Postilion Now you can drive us to Cranbrook What be you a comin too Yes I nodded yes I am coming too Lord love me he exclaimed and a moment later I heard him chirruping to his horses the whip cracked and the chaise lurched forward Whether he had some wild notion that I might attempt to descend and make my escape before we reached our destination I cannot say but he drove at a furious pace taking corners at reckless speed so that the chaise lurched and swayed most violently and more than once I was compelled to hold that awful figure down upon the seat before me lest it should slide to the floor On we sped past hedge and tree by field and lonely wood And ever in my ears was the whir of the wheels the drumming of hoofs and the crack of the whip and ever the flitting moonbeams danced across that muffled face until it seemed that the features writhed and gibed at me beneath the folds of the neckerchief And so at last came lights and houses and the sound of excited voices as we pulled up before the Posting House at Cranbrook Looking from the window I saw a ring of faces with eyes that gleamed in the light of the lanthorns and every eye was fixed on me and every foot gave back a step as I descended from the chaise And while I stood there the Postilion came with two white faced ostlers who between them bore a heavy burden through the crowd stumbling awkwardly as they went and as men saw that which they carried there came a low deep sound wordless inarticulate yet full of menace But above this murmur rose a voice and I saw the Postilion push his way to the steps of the inn and turn there with hands clenched and raised above his head My master Sir Maurice Vibart is killed shot to death murdered down there in the aunted Oller he cried and if you axes me who done it I says to you e did so elp me God and speaking he raised his whip and pointed at me Once more there rose that inarticulate sound of menace and once more all eyes were fixed upon me E were a fine general man said a voice Ah so gay an light earted said another Ay ay a generous open open anded general man said a third And every moment the murmur swelled and grew more threatening fists were clenched and sticks flourished so that instinctively I set my back against the chaise for it seemed they lacked only some one to take the initiative ere they fell upon me The Postilion saw this too for with a shout he sprang forward his whip upraised But as he did so the crowd was burst asunder he was caught by a mighty arm and Black George stood beside me his eyes glowing his fists clenched and his hair and beard bristling Stand back you chaps he growled stand back or I ll urt some on ye be ye all a lot o dogs to set on an worry one as is all alone And then turning to me What be the matter wi the fools Peter Matter cried the Postilion murder be the matter my master be murdered shot to death an there stands the man as done it Murder cried George in an altered voice murder Now as he spoke the crowd parted and four ostlers appeared bearing a hurdle between them and on the hurdle lay a figure an elegant figure whose head and face were still muffled in my neckerchief I saw George start and like a flash his glance came round to my bare throat and dismay was in his eyes Peter he murmured then he laughed suddenly and clapped his hand down upon my shoulder Look ee you chaps he cried facing the crowd this is my friend Peter an honest man an no murderer as e will tell ye isself this is my friend as I d go bail for wi my life to be a true man speak up Peter an tell em as you m an honest man an no murderer But I shook my head Oh Peter he whispered speak speak Not here George I answered it would be of no avail besides I can say nothing to clear myself Nothin Peter Nothing George This man was shot and killed in the Hollow I found him lying dead I found the empty pistol and the Postilion yonder found me standing over the body That is all I have to tell Peter said he speaking hurriedly beneath his breath Oh Peter let s run for it twould be main easy for the likes o you an me No George I answered it would be worse than useless But one thing I do ask of you you who know me so much better than most and it is that you will bid me good by and take my hand once more George here before all these eyes that look upon me as a murderer and Before I had finished he had my hand in both of his nay had thrown one great arm protectingly about me Why Peter he began in a strangely cracked voice oh man as I love never think as I d believe their lies an Peter such fighters as you an me a match for double their number let s make a bolt for it ecod I want to hit somebody Never doubt me Peter your friend an they d go over like skittles like skittles Peter The crowd which had swelled momentarily surged opened and a man on horseback pushed his way towards me a man in some disorder of dress as though he had clothed himself in a hurry Rough hands were now laid upon me I saw George s fist raised threateningly but caught it in my grasp Good by said I good by George and don t look so downcast man But we were forced apart and I was pushed and pulled and hustled away through a crowd of faces whose eyes damned me wherever I looked along panelled passage ways and into a long dim room where sat the gentleman I had seen on the horse busily tying his cravat to whom I delivered up the pistol and answered divers questions as well as I might and by whom after much jotting of notes and memoranda I was delivered over to four burly fellows who with deep gravity and a grip much tighter than was necessary once more led me out into the moonlit street where were people who pressed forward to stare into my face and people who leaned out of windows to stare down upon my head and many more who followed at my heels And thus in much estate I ascended a flight of worn stone steps into the churchyard and so by a way of tombs and graves came at last to the great square church tower into which I was incontinently thrust and there very securely locked up CHAPTER XLIV THE BOW STREET RUNNERS It was toward evening of the next day that the door of my prison was opened and two men entered The first was a tall cadaverous looking individual of a melancholy cast of feature who despite the season was wrapped in a long frieze coat reaching almost to his heels from the pocket of which projected a short staff or truncheon He came forward with his hands in his pockets and his bony chin on his breast looking at me under the brim of a somewhat weather beaten hat that is to say he looked at my feet and my hands and my throat and my chin but never seemed to get any higher His companion on the contrary bustled forward and tapping me familiarly on the shoulder looked me over with a bright appraising eye S elp me Jeremy said he addressing his saturnine friend s elp me if I ever see a pore misfort nate cove more to my mind an fancy nice an tall an straight legged twelve stone if a pound a five foot drop now or say five foot six an e ll go off as sweet as a bird ah you ll never feel it my covey not a twinge a leetle tightish round the windpipe p r aps but Lord it s soon over You re lookin a bit pale round the gills young cove but Lord that s only nat ral too Here he produced from the depths of a capacious pocket something that glittered beneath his agile fingers And ow might be your general ealth young cove he went on affably bobbish I ope fair an bobbish As he spoke with a sudden dexterous motion he had snapped something upon my wrists so quickly that at the contact of the cold steel I started and as I did so something jingled faintly There he exclaimed clapping me on the shoulder again but at the same time casting a sharp glance at my shackled wrists there now we re all appy an comfortable I see as you re a cove as takes things nice an quiet an so long as you do I m your friend Bob s my name an bobbish is my natur Lord the way I ve seen misfort nate coves take on at sight o them bracelets is something out rageous But you why you re a different kidney you re my kind you are what do you say Jeremy Don t like is eye growled that individual Don t mind Jeremy winked the other it s just is per werseness Lord e is the per wersest codger you ever see Why e finds fault wi the Pope o Rome jest because e s in the abit o lettin coves kiss is toe I ve eard Jeremy work isself up over the Pope an a pint o porter till you d ave thought Ain t we never a goin to start inquired Jeremy staring out of the window with his back to us And where said I where might you be taking me Why since you ax my covey we m a takin you where you ll be took good care on where you ll feed well and ave justice done on you trust us for that Though to be sure I m sorry to take you from such proper quarters as these ere nice and airy eh Jeremy Ah an wi a fine view o the graves growled Jeremy leading the way out In the street stood a chaise and four surrounded by a pushing jostling throng of men women and children who catching sight of me between the Bow Street Runners forgot to push and jostle and stared at me with every eye and tooth they possessed until I was hidden in the chaise Right away growled Jeremy shutting the door with a bang Whoa roared a voice and a great shaggy golden head was thrust in at the window and a hand reached down and grasped mine A pipe an baccy Peter from me a flask o rum Simon s best from Simon an chicken sang widges from my Prue This as he passed in each article through the window An I were to say Peter as we are all wi you ever an ever an I were likewise to tell ee as ow Prue ll pray for ee oftener than before an ecod he broke off the tears running down his face there were a lot more but I ve forgot it all only Peter me an Simon be goin to get a lawyer chap for ee an oh man Peter say the word an I ll have ee out o this in a twinklin an we ll run for it But even as I shook my head the postboy s whip cracked and the horses plunged forward Good by George I cried good by dear fellow and the last I saw of him was as he stood rubbing his tears away with one fist and shaking the other after the chaise CHAPTER XLV WHICH CONCERNS ITSELF AMONG OTHER MATTERS WITH THE BOOTS OF THE SATURNINE JEREMY A bottle o rum said the man Bob and taking it up very abstracted of eye he removed the cork sniffed at it tasted it took a gulp and handed it over to his companion who also looked at sniffed at and tasted it And what d ye make o that Jeremy Tasted better afore now growled Jeremy and immediately took another pull Sang widges too pursued the man Bob in a ruminating tone an I always was partial to chicken and forthwith opening the dainty parcel he helped himself and his companion also What d ye make o them Jeremy he inquired munching I ve eat wuss rumbled Jeremy also munching Young cove they does you credit said the man Bob nodding to me with great urbanity great credit there ain t many misfort nates as can per jooce such sang widges as them though to be sure they eats uncommon quick old ard there Jeremy But indeed the sandwiches were already only a memory wherefore his brow grew black and he glared at the still munching Jeremy who met his looks with his usual impenetrable gloom A pipe and bacca mused the man Bob after we had ridden some while in silence and with the same serene unconsciousness of manner he took the pipe filled it lighted it and puffed with an air of dreamy content Jeremy is a good ish sort he began with a complacent flourish of the pipe a good ish sort but cross grained Lord young cove is cross grainedness is ekalled only by is per werseness and cause why cause e don t smoke go easy wi the rum Jeremy there s nothin like a pipe o bacca to soothe such things away I got my eye on ye Jeremy no there s nothin like a pipe o bacca Look at me I were the per wersest infant that ever was till I took to smokin and to day whatever I am I ain t per werse nor yet cross grained and many a misfort nate cove as is now no more as wept over me at partin They generally always do growled Jeremy uncorking the rum bottle with his teeth No Jerry no returned the other blowing out a cloud of smoke misfort nates ain t all the same arter you wi that bottle you ave Cryers and Laughers and Pray ers and Silent Ones and the silent coves is the dangerousest arter you wi the bottle Jeremy now you my covey he went on tapping my hand gently with his pipe stem you ain t exactly talkative in fact not wishin no offense I might say as you was inclined to be one o the Silent Ones Not as I olds that again you far from it only you reminds me of a young cove as ad the misfort n to get isself took for forgery and who arter me a talkin and a chattin to im in my pleasant way went and managed to commit sooicide under my very nose which were ardly nice or even respectable considerin arter you wi the bottle Jeremy Jeremy growled held up the bottle to the failing light of evening measured its contents with his thumb and extended it unwillingly towards his comrade s ready hand but it never got there for at that instant the chaise lurched violently there was a cry a splintering of glass a crash and I was lying half stunned in a ditch listening to the chorus of oaths and cries that rose from the cloud of dust where the frightened horses reared and plunged How long I remained thus I cannot say but all at once I found myself upon my feet running down the road for hazy though my mind yet was I could think only of escape of liberty and freedom at any price at any cost So I ran on down the road somewhat unsteadily as yet because my fall had been a heavy one and my brain still reeled I heard a shout behind me the sharp crack of a pistol and a bullet sang over my head and then I knew they were after me for I could hear the patter of their feet upon the hard road Now as I ran my brain cleared but this only served me to appreciate the difficulty of eluding men so seasoned and hardy as my pursuers moreover the handcuffs galled my wrists and the short connecting chain hampered my movements considerably and I saw that upon this straight level I must soon be run down or shot from behind Glancing back I beheld them some hundred yards or so away elbows in heads up running with that long free stride that speaks of endurance I increased the pace the ground flew beneath me but when I glanced again though the man Bob had dropped back the saturnine Jeremy ran on no nearer but no farther than before Now as I went I presently espied that for which I had looked a gate set in the midst of the hedge but it was closed and never did a gate before or since appear quite so high and insurmountable but with the desperation of despair I turned ran at it and sprang swinging my arms above my head as I did so My foot grazed the top bar down I came slipped stumbled regained my balance and ran on over the springy turf I heard a crash behind me an oath a second pistol barked and immediately it seemed that a hot iron seared my forearm and glancing down I saw the skin cut and bleeding but finding it no worse breathed a sigh of thankfulness and ran on By that leap I had probably gained some twenty yards I would nurse my strength therefore If I could once gain the woods How far off were they half a mile a mile well I could run that easily thanks to my hardy life Stay what was that sound behind me the fall of flying feet or the throbbing of my own heart I turned my head the man Jeremy was within twelve yards of me lean and spare his head thrust forward he ran with the long easy stride of a greyhound So it was to be a question of endurance Well I had caught my second wind by now I set my teeth and clenching my fists lengthened my stride And now indeed the real struggle began My pursuer had long ago abandoned his coat but his boots were heavier and clumsier than those I wore but then again my confining shackles seemed to contract my chest and the handcuffs galled my wrists cruelly On I went scattering flocks of scampering sheep past meditative cows who started up puffing out snorts of perfume scrambling through hedges over gate and stile and ditch with eyes upon the distant woods full of the purple gloom of evening and in my ears the muffled thud thud thud thud of the pursuit sometimes seeming much nearer and sometimes much farther off but always the same rhythmic remorseless thud thud thud thud On and ever on climbing steep uplands plunging down precipitous slopes past brawling brooks and silent pools all red and gold with sunset past oak and ash and thorn on and on with ever those thudding footfalls close behind And as we ran it seemed to me that our feet beat out a kind of cadence his heavy shoes and my lighter ones Thud thud pad pad thud thud pad pad until they would suddenly become confused and mingle with each other One moment it seemed that I almost loved the fellow and the next that I bitterly hated him Whether I had gained or not I could not tell to look back was to lose ground The woods were close now so close that I fancied I heard the voice of their myriad leaves calling to me encouraging me But my breath was panting thick and short my stride was less sure my wrists were raw and bleeding and the ceaseless jingle of my chain maddened me Thud thud untiring persistent thud thud the pulse at my temples throbbed in time with it my breath panted to it And surely it was nearer more distinct yes he had gained on me in the last half mile but how much I cast a look over my shoulder it was but a glance yet I saw that he had lessened the distance between us by half His face shone with sweat his mouth was a line his nostrils broad and expanded his eyes staring and shot with blood but he ran on with the same long easy stride that was slowly but surely wearing me down We were descending a long grassy slope and I stumbled more than once and rolled in my course but on came those remorseless footfalls thud thud thud thud strong and sure as ever He was nearing me fast he was close upon me closer within reach of me I could hear his whistling breaths and then all at once I was down on hands and knees he tried to avoid me failed and shooting high over me thudded down upon the grass For a moment he lay still then with a groan he rolled over and propping himself on his arm thrust a hand into his bosom but I hurled myself upon him and after a brief struggle twisted the pistol from his grasp whereupon he groaned again Hurt I panted Arm broke I think he growled and forthwith burst out into a torrent of curses Does it hurt so much I panted Ah but it ain t that he panted back it s me a lettin of you work off a mouldy old trick on me like that there It was my only chance said I sitting down beside him to regain my wind To think he growled o me bein took in by a But you are a great runner said I A great fool you mean to be took in by a You have a long walk back and your arm will be painful And serve me right for bein took in by If you will lend me your neckerchief I think I can make your arm more comfortable said I He ceased cursing to stare at me slowly and awkwardly unwound the article in question and passed it to me Thereupon having located the fracture I contrived a rough splint with a piece of wood lying near which done he thanked me in a burst of profanity and rose I ve see worse coves nor you said he and one good turn desarvin another lie snug all day and travel by night and keep to the byroads this ain t no common case there ll be a thousand pound on your ead afore the week s out so look spry my cove saying which he nodded turned upon his heel and strode away cursing to himself Now presently as I went I heard the merry ring and clink of hammer and anvil and guided by the sound came to a tumbledown smithy where was a man busily at work with a shock headed boy at the bellows At sight of me the smith set down his hammer and stared openmouthed as did also the shock headed boy How long would it take you to file off these shackles I inquired holding out my hands To to file em off Yes Why that that depends Then do it as soon as you can Upon this the man turned his back to me and began rummaging among his tools with his head very near that of the shock headed boy until having found a file suitable to the purpose he set to work upon my handcuffs But he progressed so slowly for one reason and another that I began to grow impatient moreover noticing that the shock headed boy had disappeared I bade him desist A cold chisel and hammer will be quickest said I come cut me off this chain here close up to the rivets And when he had done this I took his file and thrusting it beneath my coat set off running my hardest leaving him to stare after me with his eyes and mouth wider than ever The sun was down when I reached the woods and here in the kind shadows I stayed awhile to rest and rid myself of my handcuffs but when I felt for the file to do so it was gone CHAPTER XLVI HOW I CAME TO LONDON Justly to narrate all that befell me during my flight and journey to London would fill many pages and therefore as this book of mine is already of a magnitude far beyond my first expectations I shall hurry on to the end of my story Acting upon the advice of the saturnine Jeremy I lay hidden by day and traveled by night avoiding the highway But in so doing I became so often involved in the maze of cross roads bylanes cow paths and cart tracks that twice the dawn found me as completely lost as though I had been set down in the midst of the Sahara I thus wasted much time and wandered many miles out of my way wherefore to put an end to these futile ramblings I set my face westward hoping to strike the highroad somewhere between Tonbridge and Sevenoaks determined rather to run the extra chance of capture than follow haphazard these tortuous and interminable byways It was then upon the third night since my escape that faint and spent with hunger I saw before me the welcome sight of a finger post and hurrying forward eager to learn my whereabouts came full upon a man who sat beneath the finger post with a hunch of bread and meat upon his knee which he was eating by means of a clasp knife Now I had tasted nothing save two apples all day and but little the day before thus at sight of this appetizing food my hunger grew and increased to a violent desire before which prudence vanished and caution flew away Therefore I approached the man with my eyes upon his bread and meat But as I drew nearer my attention was attracted by something white that was nailed up against the finger post and I stopped dead with my eyes riveted by a word printed in great black capitals and stood oblivious alike of the man who had stopped eating to stare at me and the bread and meat that he had set down upon the grass for what I saw was this G R MURDER Lfive hundred REWARD WHEREAS PETER SMITH blacksmith late of SISSINGHURST in the county of Kent suspected of the crime of WILFUL MURDER did upon the Tenth of August last make his escape from his gaolers upon the Tonbridge road somewhere between SISSINGHURST and PEMBRY the above REWARD namely FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS will be paid to such person or persons who shall give such INFORMATION as shall lead to the ARREST and APPREHENSION of the aforesaid PETER SMITH In the furtherance of which is hereunto added a just and close description of the same VIZ He is six foot tall and a sizable ROGUE His hair black his eyes dark and piercing Clad when last seen in a worn velveteen jacket kneebreeches buckled at the knees gray worsted stockings and patched shoes The coat TORN at the RIGHT shoulder Upon his wrists a pair of steel HANDCUFFS Last seen in the vicinity of PEMBRY While I yet stared at this I was conscious that the man had risen and now stood at my elbow also that in one hand his carried a short heavy stick He stood very still and with bent head apparently absorbed in the printed words before him but more than once I saw his eyes gleam in the shadow of his hat brim as they turned to scan me furtively up and down Yet he did not speak or move and there was something threatening I thought in his immobility Wherefore I in turn watched him narrowly from the corner of my eye and thus it chanced that our glances met You seem thoughtful said I Ah I be that And what might you be thinking Why since you ax me I was thinkin as your eye was mighty sharp and piercin Ah said I and what more That your coat was tore at the shoulder So it is I nodded well You likewise wears buckled breeches and gray worsted stockings You are a very observant man said I Though to be sure said he shaking his head I don t see no andcuffs That is because they are hidden under my sleeves A h h said he and I saw the stick quiver in his grip As I said before you are a very observant man said I watching the stick Well I ve got eyes and can see as much as most folk he retorted and here the stick quivered again Yes I nodded you also possess legs and can probably walk fast Ah and run too if need be he added significantly Then suppose you start Start where Anywhere so long as you do start Not wi out you my buck I ve took a powerful fancy to you and that there five hundred pounds here his left hand shot out and grasped my collar so s posin you come along o me And no tricks mind no tricks or ah would ye The heavy stick whirled up but quick as he I had caught his wrist and now presented my pistol full in his face Drop that stick said I pressing the muzzle of the weapon lightly against his forehead as I spoke At the touch of the cold steel his body suddenly stiffened and grew rigid his eyes opened in a horrified stare and the stick clattered down on the road Talking of fancies I pursued I have a great mind to that smock frock of yours so take it off and quick about it In a fever of haste he tore off the garment in question and he thrusting it eagerly upon me I folded it over my arm Now said I since you say you can run supposing you show me what you can do This is a good straight lane off with you and do your best and no turning or stopping mind for the moon is very bright and I am a pretty good shot Hardly waiting to hear me out the fellow set off up the lane running like the wind whereupon I waiting only to snatch up his forgotten bread and meat took to my heels down the lane so that when I presently stopped to don the smock frock its late possessor had vanished as though he had never been I hurried on nevertheless eating greedily as I went and after some while left the narrow lane behind and came out on the broad highway that stretched like a great white riband unrolled beneath the moon And here was another finger post with the words To Sevenoaks Tonbridge and the Wells To Bromley and London And here also was another placard headed by that awful word MURDER which seemed to leap out at me from the rest And with that word there rushed over me the memory of Charmian as I had seen her stand white lipped haggard of eye and with one hand hidden in the folds of her gown So I turned and strove to flee from this hideous word and as I went I clenched my fists and cried within myself I love her love her no doubt can come between us more I love her love her love her Thus I hurried on along the great highroad but wherever I looked I saw this most hateful word it shone out palely from the shadows it was scored into the dust at my feet even across the splendor of the moon in jagged characters I seemed to read that awful word MURDER And the soft night wind woke voices to whisper it as I passed the somber trees and gloomy hedgerows were full of it I heard it in the echo of my step MURDER MURDER It was always there whether I walked or ran in rough and stony places in the deep soft dust in the dewy tender grass it was always there whispering at my heels and refusing to be silenced I had gone on in this way for an hour or more avoiding the middle of the road because of the brilliance of the moon when I overtook something that crawled in the gloom of the hedge and approaching pistol in hand saw that it was a man He was creeping forward slowly and painfully on his hands and knees but all at once sank down on his face in the grass only to rise groaning and creep on once more and as he went I heard him praying Lord give me strength O Lord give me strength Angela Angela It is so far so far And groaning he sank down again upon his face You are ill said I bending over him I must reach Deptford she s buried at Deptford and I shall die to night O Lord give me strength he panted Deptford is miles away said I Now as I spoke he lifted himself upon his hands and stared up at me I saw a haggard hairy face very thin and sunken but a fire burned in the eyes and the eyes seemed somehow familiar You he cried and spat up in the air towards me devil he cried Devil Vibart I recoiled instinctively before the man s sudden wild ferocity but propping himself against the bank he shook his hand at me and laughed Devil he repeated shade ghost of a devil have you come back to see me die Who are you I cried bending to look into the pale emaciated face who are you A shadow he answered passing a shaking hand up over his face and brow a ghost a phantom as you are but my name was Strickland once as yours was Devil Vibart I am changed of late you said so in the Hollow and laughed You don t laugh now Devil Vibart you remember poor John Strickland now You are the Outside Passenger I exclaimed the madman who followed and shot at me in a wood Followed Yes I was a shadow that was always behind you following and following you Satan Vibart tracking and tracking you to hell and damnation And you fled here and you fled there but I was always behind you you hid from me among lowly folk but you could not escape the shadow Many times I would have killed you but she was between the Woman I came once to your cottage it was night and the door opened beneath my hand but your time was not then But ha I met you among trees as I did once before and I told you my name as I did once before and I spoke of her of Angela and cried her name and shot you just here above the brow and so you died Devil Vibart as soon I must for my mission is accomplished It was you I cried kneeling beside him it was your hand that shot Sir Maurice Vibart Yes he answered his voice growing very gentle as he went on for Angela s sake my dead wife and fumbling in his pocket he drew out a woman s small lace edged handkerchief and I saw that it was thickened and black with blood This was hers he continued in her hand the night she died I had meant to lay it on her grave the blood of atonement but now A sudden crash in the hedge above a figure silhouetted against the sky a shadowy arm that falling struck the moon out of heaven and in the darkness I was down upon my knees and fingers were upon my throat Oh Darby cried a voice I ve got him this way quick oh Darb My fist drove into his ribs I struggled up under a rain of blows and we struck and swayed and staggered and struck trampling the groaning wretch who lay dying in the ditch And before me was the pale oval of a face and I smote it twice with my pistol butt and it was gone and I was running along the road Charmian spoke truth O God I thank thee I burst through a hedge running on and on careless alike of being seen of capture or escape of prison or freedom for in my heart was a great joy I was conscious of shouts and cries but I heeded them no more listening only to the song of happiness my heart was singing Charmian spoke truth her hands are clean O God I thank thee And as I went I presently espied a caravan and before it a fire of sticks above which a man was bending who raising his head stared at me as I approached He was a strange looking man who glared at me with one eye and leered jocosely with the other and being spent and short of breath I stopped and wiping the sweat from my eyes I saw that it was blood How is Lewis I panted What exclaimed the man drawing nearer is it you James but you re a picter you are hallo he stopped as his glance encountered the steel that glittered upon my wrist while upon the silence the shouts swelled drawing near and nearer So the Runners is arter you are they young feller Yes said I yes You have only to cry out and they will take me for I can fight no more nor run any farther this knock on the head has made me very dizzy Then take a pull at this ere said he and thrust a flat bottle into my hand The fiery spirit burned my throat but almost immediately my strength and courage revived Better Much better I answered returning the bottle and I thank you Don t go for to thank me young feller said he driving the cork into the bottle with a blow of his fist you thank that young feller as once done as much for me at a fair An now cutaway run the edge is good and dark up yonder lay low a bit and leave these damned Runners to me I obeyed without more ado and as I ran up the lane I heard him shouting and swearing as though engaged in a desperate encounter and turning in the shadow of the hedge I saw him met by two men with whom still shouting and gesticulating excitedly he set off running down the lane And so I once more turned my face London wards The blood still flowed from the cut in my head getting often into my eyes yet I made good progress notwithstanding But little by little the effect of the spirits wore off a drowsiness stole over me my limbs felt numbed and heavy And with this came strange fancies and a dread of the dark Sometimes it seemed that odd lights danced before my eyes like marsh fires and strange voices gabbled in my ears furiously unintelligible with laughter in a high pitched key sometimes I cast myself down in the dewy grass only to start up again trembling and run on till I was breathless but ever I struggled forward despite the throbbing of my broken head and the gnawing hunger that consumed me After a while a mist came on a mist that formed itself into deep valleys or rose in jagged spires and pinnacles but constantly changing a mist that moved and writhed within itself And in this mist were forms nebulous and indistinct multitudes that moved in time with me and the voices seemed louder than before and the laughter much shriller while repeated over and over again I caught that awful word MURDER MURDER Chief among this host walked one whose head and face were muffled from my sight but who watched me I knew through the folds with eyes that stared fixed and wide But now indeed the mist seemed to have got into my brain and all things were hazy and my memory of them is dim Yet I recall passing Bromley village and slinking furtively through the shadows of the deserted High Street but thereafter all is blank save a memory of pain and toil and deadly fatigue I was stumbling up steps the steps of a terrace a great house lay before me with lighted windows here and there but these I feared and so came creeping to one that I knew well and whose dark panes glittered palely under the dying moon And now I took out my clasp knife and fumbling blindly put back the catch as I had often done as a boy and so the window opening I clambered into the dimness beyond Now as I stumbled forward my hand touched something a long dark object that was covered with a cloth and hardly knowing what I did I drew back this cloth and looked down at that which it had covered and sank down upon my knees groaning For there staring up at me cold contemptuous and set like marble was the smiling dead face of my cousin Maurice As I knelt there I was conscious that the door had opened that some one approached bearing a light but I did not move or heed Peter good God in heaven is it Peter I looked up and into the dilated eyes of Sir Richard Is it really Peter he whispered Yes sir dying I think No no Peter dear boy he stammered You didn t know you hadn t heard poor Maurice murdered fellow name of Smith Yes Sir Richard I know more about it than most You see I am Peter Smith Sir Richard fell back from me and I saw the candle swaying in his grasp You he whispered you Oh Peter oh my boy But I am innocent innocent you believe me you who were my earliest friend my good kind friend you believe me and I stretched out my hands appealingly but as I did so the light fell gleaming upon my shameful wristlets and even as we gazed into each other s eyes mute and breathless came the sound of steps and hushed voices Sir Richard sprang forward and catching me in a powerful hand half led half dragged me behind a tall leather screen beside the hearth and thrusting me into a chair turned and hurried to meet the intruders They were three as I soon discovered by their voices one of which I thought I recognized It s a devilish shame the first was saying not a soul here for the funeral but our four selves I say it s a shame a burning shame That sir depends entirely on the point of view answered the second a somewhat aggressive voice and this it was I seemed to recognize Point of view sir Where I should like to know are all those smiling nonentities those fawning sycophants who were once so proud of his patronage who openly modelled themselves upon him whose highest ambition was to be called a friend of the famous Buck Vibart where are they now Doing the same by the present favorite as is the nature of their kind responded the third poor Maurice is already forgotten The Prince said the harsh voice the Prince would never have forgiven him for crossing him in the affair of the Lady Sophia Sefton the day he ran off with her he was as surely dead in a social sense as he is now in every sense Here the mist settled down upon my brain once more and I heard nothing but a confused murmur of voices and it seemed to me that I was back on the road again hemmed in by those gibbering phantoms that spoke so much and yet said but one word Murder Quick a candle here a candle bring a light There came a glare before my smarting eyes and I struggled up to my feet Why I have seen this fellow s face somewhere ah yes at an inn a hang dog rogue I threatened to pull his nose I remember and by Heaven handcuffs He has been roughly handled too Gentlemen I ll lay my life the murderer is found though how he should come here of all places extraordinary Sir Richard you and I as magistrates duty But the mist was very thick and the voices grew confused again only I knew that hands were upon me that I was led into another room where were lights that glittered upon the silver the decanters and glasses of a supper table Yes I was saying slowly and heavily yes I am Peter Smith a blacksmith who escaped from his gaolers on the Tonbridge Road but I am innocent before God I am innocent And now do with me as you will for I am very weary Sir Richard s arm was about me and his voice sounded in my ears but as though a great way off Sirs said he this is my friend Sir Peter Vibart There was a moment s pause then a chair fell with a crash and there rose a confusion of excited voices which grew suddenly silent for the door had opened and on the threshold stood a woman tall and proud and richly dressed from the little dusty boot that peeped beneath her habit to the wide sweeping hat brim that shaded the high beauty of her face And I would have gone to her but that my strength failed me Charmian She started and turning uttered a cry and ran to me Charmian said I oh Charmian And so with her tender arms about me and her kisses on my lips the mist settled down upon me thicker and darker than ever CHAPTER XLVII IN WHICH THIS HISTORY IS ENDED A bright room luxuriously appointed a great wide bed with carved posts and embroidered canopy between the curtained windows a tall oak press with grotesque heads carved thereon heads that leered and gaped and scowled at me But the bed and the room and the oak press were all familiar and the grotesque heads had leered and gaped and frowned at me before and haunted my boyish dreams many and many a night And now I lay between sleeping and waking staring dreamily at all these things till roused by a voice near by and starting up broad awake beheld Sir Richard Deuce take you Peter he exclaimed I say the devil fly away with you my boy curse me a nice pickle you ve made of yourself with your infernal Revolutionary notions your digging and blacksmithing your walking tours Where is she Sir Richard I broke in pray where is she She he returned scratching his chin with the corner of a letter he held she She whom I saw last night You were asleep last night and the night before Asleep then how long have I been here Three days Peter And where is she surely I have not dreamed it all where is Charmian She went away this morning Gone where to Gad Peter how should I know But seeing the distress in my face he smiled and tendered me the letter She left this For Peter when he awoke and I ve been waiting for Peter to wake all the morning Hastily I broke the seal and unfolding the paper with tremulous hands read DEAREST NOBLEST AND MOST DISBELIEVING OF PETERS Oh did you think you could hide your hateful suspicion from me from me who know you so well I felt it in your kiss in the touch of your strong hand I saw it in your eyes Even when I told you the truth and begged you to believe me even then deep down in your heart you thought it was my hand that had killed Sir Maurice and God only knows the despair that filled me as I turned and left you And so Peter perhaps to punish you a little perhaps because I cannot bear the noisy world just yet perhaps because I fear you a little I have run away But I remember also how believing me guilty you loved me still and gave yourself up to shield me and dying of hunger and fatigue came to find me And so Peter I have not run so very far nor hidden myself so very close and if you understand me as you should your search need not be so very long And dear dear Peter there is just one other thing which I hoped that you would guess which any other would have guessed but which being a philosopher you never did guess Oh Peter I was once very long ago it seems Sophia Charmian Sefton but I am now and always was Your Humble Person CHARMIAN The letter fell from my fingers and I remained staring before me so long that Sir Richard came and laid his hand on my shoulder Oh boy said he very tenderly she has told me all the story and I think Peter I think it is given to very few men to win the love of such a woman as this God knows it said I And to have married one so very noble and high in all things you should be very proud Peter I am said I oh I am sir Even Peter even though she be a virago this Lady Sophia or a termagant I was a great fool in those days said I hanging my head and very young It was only six months ago Peter But I am years older today sir And the husband of the most glorious woman the most oh curse me Peter if you deserve such a goddess And she worked for me said I cooked and served and mended my clothes where are they I cried and sprang out of bed What the deuce began Sir Richard My clothes said I looking vainly about my clothes pray Sir Richard where are they Burnt Peter Burnt Every blood stained rag he nodded her orders But what am I to do Sir Richard laughed and crossing to the press opened the door Here are all the things you left behind you when you set out to dig and egad make your fortune I couldn t let em go with all the rest so I er had em brought here to er to keep them for you ready for the time when you should grow tired of digging and come back to me and er oh dammit you understand and Grainger s waiting to see you in the library been there hours so dress yourself In Heaven s name dress yourself he cried and hurried from the room It was with a certain satisfaction that I once more donned buckskin and spurred boots and noticed moreover how tight my coat was become across the shoulders yet I dressed hastily for my mind was already on the road galloping to Charmian In the library I found Sir Richard and mister Grainger who greeted me with his precise little bow I have to congratulate you Sir Peter he began not only on your distinguished marriage and accession to fortune but upon the fact that the ah unpleasantness connecting a certain Peter Smith with your unfortunate cousin s late decease has been entirely removed by means of the murderer s written confession placed in my hands some days ago by the Lady Sophia A written confession and she brought it to you Galloped all the way from Tonbridge by Gad nodded Sir Richard It seems pursued mister Grainger that the ah man John Strickland by name lodged with a certain preacher to whom in Lady Vibart s presence he confessed his crime and willingly wrote out a deposition to that effect It also appears that the man sick though he was wandered from the Preacher s cottage and was eventually found upon the road and now lies in Maidstone gaol in a dying condition Chancing presently to look from the window I beheld a groom who led a horse up and down before the door and the groom was Adam and the horse I opened the window and leaning out called a name At the sound of my voice the man smiled and touched his hat and the mare ceased her pawing and chafing and turned upon me a pair of great soft eyes and snuffed the air and whinnied So I leapt out of the window and down the steps and thus it was that I met Wings She be in the pink o condition sir said Adam proudly Sir Richard bought er For a song added the baronet who with mister Grainger had followed to bid me good by I really got her remarkably cheap he explained thrusting his fists deep into his pockets and frowning down my thanks But when I had swung myself into the saddle he came and laid his hand upon my knee You are going to find her Peter Yes sir And you know where to look I think so Because if you don t I might I shall go to a certain cottage said I tentatively Then you d better go boy the mare s all excitement good by Peter and cutting up my gravel most damnably good by So saying he reached up and gripped my hand very hard and stared at me also very hard though the tears stood in his eyes I always felt very fatherly towards you Peter and you won t forget the lonely old man come and see me now and then both of you for it does get damnably lonely here sometimes and oh curse it Goodby dear lad So he turned and walked up the steps into his great lonely house O Wings with thy slender grace and tireless strength if ever thou didst gallop before do thy best to day Spurn spurn the dust neath thy fleet hoofs stretch thy graceful Arab neck bear me gallantly to day O Wings for never shalt thou and I see its like again Swift we flew with the wind before and the dust behind past wayside inns where besmocked figures paused in their grave discussions to turn and watch us by past smiling field and darkling copse past lonely cottage and village green through Sevenoaks and Tonbridge with never a stop up Pembry hill and down galloping so lightly so easily over that hard familiar road which I had lately tramped with so much toil and pain and so as evening fell to Sissinghurst A dreamy sleepy place is Sissinghurst at all times for its few cottages like its inn are very old and great age begets dreams But when the sun is low and the shadows creep out when the old inn blinks drowsy eyes at the cottages and they blink back drowsily at the inn like the old friends they are when distant cows low at gates and fences when sheep bells tinkle faintly when the weary toiler seated sideways on his weary horse fares homewards nodding sleepily with every plodding hoof fall but rousing to give one a drowsy good night then who can resist the somnolent charm of the place save only the Bull himself snorting down in lofty contempt as rolling of eye as curly of horn as stiff as to tail as any indignant bull ever was or shall be But as I rode watching the evening deepen about me soft and clear rose the merry chime of hammer and anvil and turning aside to the smithy I paused there and stooping my head looked in at the door George said I He started erect and dropping hammer and tongs came out running then stopped suddenly as one abashed Oh friend said I don t you know me Why Peter he stammered and broke off Have you no greeting for me George Ay ay I heerd you was free Peter and I was glad glad because you was the man as I loved an I waited ay I ve been waitin for ee to come back But now you be so changed so fine an grand an I be all black wi soot from the fire oh man ye bean t my Peter no more Never say that George never say that I cried and leaping from the saddle I would have caught his hand in mine but he drew back You be so fine an grand Peter an I be all sooty from the fire he repeated I d like to just wash my ands first Oh Black George said I dear George Be you rich now Peter Yes I suppose so A gentleman wi orses an ouses an servants Well what of it I d like to wash my ands first if so be you don t mind Peter George said I don t be a fool Now as we stood thus fronting each other in the doorway I heard a light step upon the road behind me and turning beheld Prudence Oh Prue George is afraid of my clothes and won t shake hands with me For a moment she hesitated looking from one to the other of us then all at once laughing a little and blushing a little she leaned forward and kissed me Why George said she still blushing how fulish you be mister Peter were as much a gentleman in his leather apron as ever he is in his fine coat how fulish you be George So proud George gave me his hand all grimy as it was rejoicing over me because of my good fortune and mourning over me because my smithing days were over Ye see Peter when men as worked together and sorrowed together an fou t together an knocked each other down like you an me it bean t so easy to say good by so if you must leave us why don t let s say it No George there shall be no good bys for either one of us and I shall come back soon Until then take my mare have her made comfortable for me and now good night good night And so clasping their loving hands I turned away somewhat hurriedly and left them There was no moon but the night was luminous with stars and as I strode along my eyes were often lifted to the wonder of the heavens and I wondered which particular star was Charmian s and which mine Reaching the Hollow I paused to glance about me as I ever did before descending that leafy path and the shadows were very black and a chill wind stirred among the leaves so that I shivered and wondered for the first time if I had come right if the cottage had been in Charmian s mind when she wrote Then I descended the path hurrying past a certain dark spot And coming at last within sight of the cottage I paused again and shivered again for the windows were dark and the door shut But the latch yielded readily beneath my hand so I went in and closed and barred the door behind me For upon the hearth a fire burned with a dim red glow that filled the place with shadows and the shadows were very deep Charmian said I oh Charmian are you there have I guessed right I heard a rustle close beside me and in the gloom came a hand to meet and clasp my own wherefore I stooped and kissed those slender fingers drawing her into the fireglow and her eyes were hidden by their lashes and the glow of the fire seemed reflected in her cheeks The candles were so bright Peter she whispered Yes And so when I heard you coming You heard me I was sitting on the bench outside Peter And when you heard me you put the candles out They seemed so very bright Peter And shut the door I only just closed it Peter She was still wrapped in her cloak as she had been when I first saw her wherefore I put back the hood from her face And behold as I did so her hair fell down rippling over my arm and covering us both in its splendor as it had done once before Indeed you have glorious hair said I It seems wonderful to think that you are my wife I can scarcely believe it even yet Why I had meant you should marry me from the first Peter Had you Do you think I should ever have come back to this dear solitude otherwise Now when I would have kissed her she turned her head aside Peter Yes Charmian The Lady Sophia Sefton never did gallop her horse up the steps of saint Paul s Cathedral Didn t she Charmian And she couldn t help her name being bandied from mouth to mouth or hiccoughed out over slopping wineglasses could she No said I frowning what a young fool I was And Peter Well Charmian She never was and never will be buxom or strapping will she buxom is such a hateful word Peter And you love her wait Peter as much as ever you loved Charmian Brown Yes said I yes And nearly as much as your dream woman More much more because you are the embodiment of all my dreams you always will be Charmian Because I honor you for your intellect and worship you for your gentleness and spotless purity and love you with all my strength for your warm sweet womanhood and because you are so strong and beautiful and proud And because Peter because I am just your loving Humble Person And thus it was I went forth a fool and toiled and suffered and loved and in the end got me some little wisdom And thus did I all unworthy as I am win the heart of a noble woman whose love I pray will endure even as mine will when we shall have journeyed to the end of this Broad Highway which is Life and into the mystery of the Beyond End
