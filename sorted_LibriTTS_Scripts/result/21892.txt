a small station on one of the transcontinental lines winding among the mountains far above the level of the sea the burning rays of the noonday sun fell so fiercely that the few buildings seemed ready to ignite from the intense heat A season of unusual drought had added to the natural desolation of the scene Mountains and foot hills were blackened by smouldering fires among the timber while a dense pall of smoke entirely hid the distant ranges from view Patches of sage brush and bunch grass burned sere and brown alternated with barren stretches of sand from which piles of rubble rose here and there telling of worked out and abandoned mines Occasionally a current of air stole noiselessly down from the canyon above but its breath scorched the withered vegetation like the blast from a furnace Not a sound broke the stillness life itself seemed temporarily suspended while the very air pulsated and vibrated with the heat rising in thin quivering columns Suddenly the silence was broken by the rapid approach of the stage from a distant mining camp rattling noisily down the street followed by a slight stir within the apparently deserted station Whirling at breakneck pace around a sharp turn it stopped precipitately amid a blinding cloud of dust to deposit its passengers at the depot One of these a young man of about five and twenty arose with some difficulty from the cramped position which for seven weary hours he had been forced to maintain and with sundry stretchings and shakings of his superb form seemed at last to pull himself together Having secured his belongings from out the pile of miscellaneous luggage thrown from the stage upon the platform he advanced towards the slouching figure of a man just emerging from the baggage room his hands thrust deep in his trousers pockets his mouth stretched in a prodigious yawn the arrival of the stage having evidently awakened him from his siesta How s the west bound on time queried the young man rather shortly but despite the curtness of his accents there was a musical quality in the ringing tones Before the cavernous jaws could close sufficiently for reply two distant whistles sounded almost simultaneously That s her drawled the man with a backward jerk of his thumb over his shoulder in the direction of the sound she s at Blind Man s Pass be here in about fifteen minutes The young man turned and sauntered to the rear end of the platform where he paused for a few moments then unconscious of the scrutiny of his fellow passengers he began silently pacing up and down being in no mood for conversation with any one Every bone in his body ached and his head throbbed with a dull pain but these physical discomforts which he attributed to his long and wearisome stage ride caused him less annoyance than did the fact that he had lost several days time besides subjecting himself to numerous inconveniences and hardships on what he now denominated a fool s errand An expert mineralogist and metallurgist he had been commissioned by a large syndicate of eastern capitalists to come west primarily to examine a certain mine recently offered for sale and secondarily to secure any other valuable mining properties which might happen to be on the market A promoter whose acquaintance he had formed soon after leaving saint Paul had poured into his ear such fabulous tales of a mine of untold wealth which needed but the expenditure of a few thousands to place it upon a dividend paying basis that after making due allowance for optimism and exaggeration he had thought it might be worth his while to stop off and investigate The result of the investigation had been anything but satisfactory for either the promoter or the expert He was the more annoyed at the loss of time because of a telegram handed him just before his departure from saint Paul which he now drew forth and which read as follows Parkinson expert for M and M on trail Knows you as our representative but only by name Lie low and block him if possible BARNARD He well understood the import of the message The M and M stood for a rival syndicate of enormous wealth and the fact that its expert was also on his way west promised lively competition in the purchase of the famous Ajax mine Five days he soliloquized glancing at the date of the message which he now tore into bits together with two or three letters of little importance I have lost my start and am now likely to meet this Parkinson at any stage of the game However he has never heard of John Darrell and that name will answer my purpose as well as any among strangers I ll notify Barnard when I reach Ophir His plans for the circumvention of Parkinson were now temporarily cut short by the appearance of the double header rounding a curve and rapidly approaching a welcome sight for the heat and blinding glare of light were becoming intolerable Only for a moment the ponderous engines paused panting and quivering like two living sentient monsters the next with heavy labored breath as though summoning all their energies for the task before them they were slowly ascending the steadily increasing grade moment by moment with accelerated speed plunging into the very heart of the mountains bearing John Darrell as he was to be henceforth known to a destiny of which he had little thought but which he himself had unconsciously helped to weave An hour later on returning to the sleeper after an unsuccessful attempt at dining Darrell sank into his seat and leaning wearily back watched with half closed eyes the rapidly changing scenes through which he was passing for the time utterly oblivious to his surroundings Gigantic rocks grotesque in form and color flashed past towering peaks loomed suddenly before him advancing receding disappearing and reappearing with the swift windings and doublings of the train massive walls of granite pressed close and closer seeming for one instant a threatening impenetrable barrier the next opening to reveal glimpses of distant billowy ranges their summits white with perpetual snow The train had now reached a higher altitude and breezes redolent of pine and fir fanned his throbbing brow their fragrance thronging his mind with memories of other and far distant scenes until gradually the bold outlines of cliff and crag grew dim and in their place appeared a cool dark forest through which flecks of golden sunlight sifted down upon the moss grown flower strewn earth a stream singing beneath the pines then rippling onward through meadows of waving green a wide spreading house of colonial build half hidden by giant trees and clinging rose vines and framed among the roses a face strong tender sweet crowned with silvered hair one of the few which sorrow makes beautiful which came nearer and nearer bending over him with a mother s blessing and then he slept The face of the sleeper with its clear cut well moulded features formed a pleasing study reminding one of a bit of unfinished carving the strong bold lines of which reveal the noble design of the sculptor the thing of wondrous beauty yet to be but which still lacks the finer strokes the final touch requisite to bring it to perfection Strength of character was indicated there an indomitable will that would bend the most adverse conditions to serve its own masterful purpose and make of obstacles the paving stones to success a mind gifted with keen perceptive faculties but which hitherto had dealt mostly with externals and knew little of itself or of its own powers Young with splendid health and superabundant vitality there had been little opportunity for introspection or for the play of the finer subtler faculties and of the whole gamut of susceptibilities ranging from exquisite suffering to ecstatic joy few had been even awakened His was a nature capable of producing the divinest harmonies or the wildest discords according to the hand that swept the strings as yet untouched For more than an hour Darrell slept He was awakened by the murmur of voices near him confused at first but growing more distinct as he gradually recalled his surroundings until catching the name of Parkinson he was instantly on the alert Yes a pleasant voice was saying I understand the Ajax is for sale if the owners can get their price but they don t want less than a cold million for it and it s my opinion they ll find buyers rather scarce at that figure when it comes to a show down Well I don t know that depends was the reply The price won t stand in the way with my people if the mine is all right They can hand over a million or two for that matter as easily as a thousand if the property is what they want but they ve got to know what they re buying That s what I m out here for Taking a quiet survey of the situation Darrell found that the section opposite his own which upon his return from the dining car had contained only a motley collection of coats and grips was now occupied by a party of three two of whom were engaged in animated conversation One of the speakers who sat facing Darrell was a young man of about two and twenty whose self assurance and assumption of worldly wisdom combined with a boyish impetuosity he found vastly amusing while at the same time his frank ingenuous eyes and winning smile of genuine friendliness revealing a nature as unsuspecting and confiding as a child s appealed to him strangely and drew him irresistibly towards the young stranger The other speaker whom Darrell surmised to be Parkinson was considerably older and was seated facing the younger man hence his back was towards Darrell while the third member of the party and by far the eldest of whose face Darrell had a perfect profile view although saying little seemed an interested listener The man whom Darrell supposed to be Parkinson inquired the quickest way of reaching the Ajax mine Well you see it s this way replied the young fellow The Ajax is on a spur that runs out from the main line at Ophir and the train only runs between there and Ophir twice a week Wednesdays and Saturdays Let s see this is Wednesday we ll get into Ophir to morrow and you ll have to wait over until Saturday unless you hire a rig to take you out there and that s pretty expensive and an awfully rough jaunt besides I don t mind the expense retorted the other but I don t know as I care to go on any jaunts over your mountain roads when there s no special necessity for it I can get exercise enough without that I tell you what mister Parkinson said the young fellow cordially you and your friend here mister Hunter Darrell started at the mention of the latter name had better wait over till Saturday and in the mean time I ll take you people out to Camp Bird as we call it and show you the Bird Mine that s our mine you know and I tell you she is a bird and no mistake You ll be interested in looking her over though I ll tell you beforehand she s not for sale Do I understand that you have an interest in this remarkable mine mister Whitcomb Parkinson inquired a tinge of amusement in his tone Not in the way you mean that is not yet though there s no telling how soon I may have if things turn out as I hope and the boyish cheek flushed slightly But I know what I m talking about all the same My uncle D K Underwood is a practical mining man of nearly thirty years experience and what he doesn t know about mines and mining isn t worth knowing He s interested in a dozen or so of the best mines in the State but I don t think he would exchange his half interest in the Bird Mine for all his other holdings put together She s a comparatively new mine yet but taking into consideration her depth and the amount of development she s the best paying mine in the State Here let me show you something And hastily pulling a note book from his pocket he took therefrom a narrow slip of paper which he handed to the expert There s a statement he continued made out by the United States Assay Office back here at Galena that will show you the returns from a sixty days run at the Bird mill what do you think of that Parkinson s face was still invisible to Darrell but the latter heard a long low whistle of surprise Young Whitcomb looked jubilant They say figures won t lie he added in tones of boyish enthusiasm but if you don t believe those figures I ve got the cash right here to show for it accompanying the words with a significant gesture Parkinson handed the slip to Hunter then leaned back in his seat giving Darrell a view of his profile Sixty days he said musingly Seventy five thousand dollars I think I would like to take a look at the Bird Mine I think I would like to make mister Underwood s acquaintance Whitcomb laughed exultingly I ll give you an opportunity to do both if you ll stop over he said and don t you forget that my uncle can give you some pointers on the Ajax for he knows every mine in the State mister Hunter here handed the slip of paper to Whitcomb Young man he said with some severity gazing fixedly at Whitcomb through his eye glasses do you mean to say that you are travelling with seventy five thousand dollars on your person Certainly sir Whitcomb replied evidently enjoying the situation mister Hunter shook his head Very imprudent he commented You are running a tremendous risk I wonder that your uncle would permit it Oh that s all right said Whitcomb confidently Uncle usually comes down himself with the shipments of bullion and he generally banks the most of his money there at Galena but he couldn t very well leave this time so he sent me and as he was going to use considerable money paying for a lot of improvements we ve put in and paying off the men he told me to bring back the cash There s not much danger anyway the West isn t as wild nowadays as it used to be Handing a second bit of paper to Parkinson he added There s something else that will interest you the results of some assays made by the United States Assay Office on some samples taken at random from a new strike we made last week I ll show you some of the samples too Great Scott ejaculated Parkinson running his eye over the returns You seem to have a mine there all right Sure thing You ll think so when you see it Whitcomb answered fumbling in a grip at his feet At sight of the specimens of ore which he produced a moment later his two companions became nearly as enthusiastic as himself Leaning eagerly forward they began an inspection of the samples commenting on their respective values while Whitcomb unfolding a tracing of the workings of the mine explained the locality from which each piece was taken its depth from the surface the width and dip of the vein and other items of interest Darrell who was carefully refraining from betraying any special interest in the party across the aisle soon became aware that he was not the only interested listener to the conversation In the section directly in front of the one occupied by Whitcomb and his companions a man was seated apparently engrossed in a newspaper but Darrell who had a three quarter view of his face soon observed that he was not reading but listening intently to the conversation of the men seated behind him and particularly to young Whitcomb s share in it Upon hearing the latter s statement that he had with him the cash returns for the shipment of bullion Darrell saw the muscles of his face suddenly grow tense and rigid while his hands involuntarily tightened their hold upon the paper He grew uncomfortable under Darrell s scrutiny moved restlessly once or twice then turning looked directly into the piercing dark eyes fixed upon him His own eyes which were small and shifting instantly dropped while the dark blood mounted angrily to his forehead A few moments later he changed his position so that Darrell could not see his face but the latter determined to watch him and to give Whitcomb a word of warning at the earliest opportunity Well said Parkinson leaning back in his seat after examining the ores and listening to Whitcomb s outline of their plans for the future development of the mine it seems to me young man you have quite a knowledge of mines and mining yourself Whitcomb flushed with pleasure I ought to he said there isn t a man in this western country that understands the business better or has got it down any finer than my uncle He may not be able to talk so glibly or use such high sounding names for things as you fellows but he can come pretty near telling whether a mine will pay for the handling and if it has any value he generally knows how to go to work to find it Well that s about the gist of the whole business said Parkinson he added You say he can give me some tips on the Ajax He can if he chooses to laughed Whitcomb but you d better not let him know that I said so He ll be more likely to give you information if you ask him offhand Well continued Parkinson when we get to Ophir I ll know whether or not I can stop over I ve heard there s another fellow out here on this Ajax business whether he s ahead of me I don t know I ll make inquiries when we reach Ophir and if he hasn t come on the scene yet I can afford to lay off if he has I must lose no time in getting out to the mine Parkinson glanced at Hunter who nodded almost imperceptibly I guess that s the best arrangement we can make at present said Parkinson rising from his seat Come and have a smoke with us mister Whitcomb Whitcomb declined the invitation and after Hunter and Parkinson had left sat idly turning over the specimens of ore until happening to catch Darrell s eye he inquired pleasantly Are you interested in this sort of thing In a way yes said Darrell crossing over and taking the seat vacated by Parkinson I m not what you call a mining man that is I ve never owned or operated a mine but I take a great interest in examining the different ores and always try to get as much information regarding them as possible Whitcomb at once launched forth enthusiastically upon a description of the various samples Darrell while careful not to show too great familiarity with the subject or too thorough a knowledge of ores in general yet was so keenly appreciative of their remarkable richness and beauty that he soon won the boy s heart Say he exclaimed you had better stop off at Ophir with us we would make a mining man of you in less than no time By the way how far west are you travelling Ophir is my destination at present though it is uncertain how long I remain there Long enough that we ll get well acquainted I hope Going into any particular line of business No only looking the country over for the present To divert the conversation from himself Darrell by a judicious question or two led Whitcomb to speak of the expert Parkinson he said with a merry laugh Oh yes he s one of those eastern know it alls who come out here occasionally to give us fellows a few points on mines They re all right of course for the men who employ them who want to invest their money and wouldn t know a mine if they saw one but when they undertake to air their knowledge among these old fellows who have spent a lifetime in the business why they re likely to get left that s all Now this Parkinson seems to be a pretty fair sort of man compared with some of them but between you and me I d wager my last dollar that they ll lose him on that Ajax mine Why what s the matter with the Ajax Darrell inquired indifferently Well as you re not interested in any way I m not telling tales out of school The Ajax has been a bonanza in its day but within the last year or so the bottom has dropped out of the whole thing and that s the reason the owners are anxious to sell I hear they ask a pretty good price for the mine Yes they re trading on her reputation but that s all past The mine is practically worked out They ve made a few good strikes lately so that there is some good ore in sight and this is their chance to sell but there are no indications of any permanence One of our own men was over there a while ago and he said there wasn t enough ore in the mine to keep their mill running full force for more than six months Is this Hunter an expert also Oh no Parkinson said he was a friend of his just taking the trip for his health Darrell smiled quietly knowing Hunter to be a member of the syndicate employing Parkinson but kept his knowledge to himself A little later when Darrell and Whitcomb left together for the dining car quite a friendship had sprung up between them There was that mutual attraction often observed between two natures utterly diverse Whitcomb was unaccountably drawn towards the dark eyed courteous but rather reticent stranger while his own frank friendliness and childlike confidence awoke in Darrell s nature a correlative tenderness and affection which he never would have believed himself capable of feeling towards one of his own sex I don t know what is the matter with me said Darrell as he seated himself at a table facing Whitcomb My head seems to have a small sized stamp mill inside of it every bone in my body aches and my joints feel as though they were being pulled apart Whitcomb looked up quickly Are you just from the East or have you been out here any time I stopped for a few days back here a ways In the mountain country Yes By George I believe you ve got the mountain fever there s an awful lot of it round here this season and this is just the worst time of year for an easterner to come out here But we ll look after you when we get to Ophir and bring you round all right Much obliged but I think I ll be all right after a night s rest Darrell replied inwardly resolved upon reaching Ophir to push on to the Ajax as quickly as possible though his ardor was considerably cooled by Whitcomb s report When they left the dining car the train was stopping at a small station and for a few moments the young men strolled up and down the platform A dense bluish gray haze hung low over the country rendering the outlines of even the nearest objects obscure and dim the western sky was like burnished copper and the sun poised a little above the horizon looked like a ball of glowing fire Just as the train was about to start Darrell saw the man whose peculiar actions he had noticed earlier leave the telegraph office and jump hastily aboard Calling Whitcomb s attention as he passed them he related his observations of the afternoon and cautioned him against the man For an instant Whitcomb looked serious I suppose it was rather indiscreet in me to talk as I did he said but it can t be helped now However I guess it s all right but I m obliged to you all the same They passed into the smoker where Darrell was introduced to Hunter and Parkinson In a short time however he found himself suffering from nausea and growing faint and dizzy Gentlemen he said you will have to excuse me I m rather off my base this evening and I find that smoking isn t doing me any good As he rose young Whitcomb sprang instantly to his feet throwing away his cigar and linking his arm within Darrell s he insisted upon accompanying him to the sleeper notwithstanding his protests Good night Parkinson he called cheerily see you in the morning He accompanied Darrell to his section then dropped familiarly into the seat beside him throwing one arm affectionately over Darrell s shoulder and during the next hour while the sunset glow faded and the evening shadows deepened he confided to this acquaintance of only a few hours the outlines of his past life and much regarding his hopes and plans for the future He spoke of his orphaned boyhood of the uncle who had given him a home in his family and initiated him into his own business methods of his hope of being admitted at no distant day into partnership with his uncle and becoming a shareholder in the wonderful Bird Mine But that isn t all I am looking forward to he said in conclusion his boyish tones growing strangely deep and tender My fondest hope of all I hardly dare admit even to myself and I don t know why I am speaking of it to you except that I already like you and trust you as I never did any other man but you will understand what I mean when you see my cousin Kate Underwood He paused but his silence was more eloquent to Darrell than words the latter grasped his hand warmly in token that he understood I wish you all that you hope for he said A few moments later Whitcomb spoke with his usual impetuosity What am I thinking of keeping you up in this way when you are sick and dead tired You had better turn in and get all the rest you can and when we reach Ophir to morrow just remember my dear fellow that no hotels go You ll go directly home with me where you ll find yourself in such good hands you ll think sure you re in your own home and we ll soon have you all right For hours Darrell tossed wearily unable to sleep His head throbbed wildly the racking pain throughout his frame increased while a raging fire seemed creeping through his veins Not until long past midnight did he fall into a fitful sleep Strange fancies surged through his fevered brain torturing him with their endless repetition their seeming reality Suddenly he awoke bewildered exhausted oppressed by a vague sense of impending evil Chapter II A NIGHT S WORK 
4057_12085_000003_000000	train-clean-360	For a few seconds Darrell tried vainly to recall what had awakened him Low confused sounds occasionally reached his ears but they seemed part of his own troubled dreams 
4057_12085_000003_000001	train-clean-360	The heat was intolerable he raised himself to the open window that he might get a breath of cooler air his head whirled but the half sitting posture seemed to clear his brain and he recalled his surroundings 
none	none	At once he became conscious that the train was not in motion yet no sound of trainmen s voices came through the open window all was dead silence and the vague haunting sense of impending danger quickened 
4057_12085_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Suddenly he heard a muttered oath in one of the sections followed by an order low but peremptory 
4057_12085_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 No noise 
4057_12085_000005_000001	train-clean-360	Hand over and be quick about it 
4057_12085_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Instantly Darrell comprehended the situation 
4057_12085_000006_000001	train-clean-360	Peering cautiously between the curtains he saw at the forward end of the sleeper a masked man with a revolver in each hand while the mirror behind him revealed another figure at the rear masked and armed in like manner 
none	none	He heard another order the man was doing his work swiftly 
4057_12085_000006_000003	train-clean-360	He thought at once of young Whitcomb but no sound came from the opposite section and he sank quietly back upon his pillow 
none	none	A moment later the curtains were quickly thrust aside the muzzle of a revolver confronted Darrell and the same low voice demanded
4057_12085_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 Hand out your valuables 
4057_12085_000009_000000	train-clean-360	A man of medium height wearing a mask and full beard stood over him Darrell quietly handed over his watch and purse noting as he did so the man s hands white well formed well kept 
4057_12085_000009_000001	train-clean-360	He half expected a further demand as the purse contained only a few small bills and some change the bulk of his money being secreted about the mattress as was his habit but the man turned with peculiar abruptness to the opposite section as one who had a definite object in view and was in haste to accomplish it 
none	none	Darrell his faculties alert observed that the section in front of Whitcomb s was empty he recalled the actions of its occupant on the preceding afternoon his business later at the telegraph office and the whole scheme flashed vividly before his mind 
4057_12085_000009_000003	train-clean-360	The man had been a spy sent out by the band now holding the train and Whitcomb s money was without doubt the particular object of the hold up 
none	none	Whitcomb was asleep at the farther side of his berth Leaning slightly towards him the man shook him and his first words confirmed Darrell s intuitions
4057_12085_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Hand over that money young man and no fuss about it either 
4057_12085_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Whitcomb instantly awake gazed at the masked face without a word or movement 
4057_12085_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Darrell powerless to aid his friend watched intently dreading some rash act on his part to which his impetuous nature might prompt him 
none	none	Again he heard the low tones this time a note of danger in them
4057_12085_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 No fooling 
4057_12085_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Hand that money over lively 
none	none	With a spring as sudden and noiseless as a panther s Whitcomb grappled with the man knocking the revolver from his hand upon the bed 
4057_12085_000015_000001	train-clean-360	A quick desperate silent struggle followed 
none	none	Whitcomb suddenly reached for the revolver as he did so Darrell saw a flash of steel in the dim light and the next instant his friend sank limp and motionless upon the bed
4057_12085_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Fool he heard the man mutter with an oath 
none	none	An involuntary groan escaped from Darrell s lips Slight as was the sound the man heard it and turned facing him the latter was screened by the curtains and the man seeing no one returned to his work but that brief glance had revealed enough to Darrell that he knew he could henceforth identify the murderer among a thousand In the struggle the mask had been partially pushed aside exposing a portion of the man s face A scar of peculiar shape showed white against the olive skin close to the curling black hair But to Darrell the pre eminently distinguishing characteristic of that face was the eyes Of the most perfect steel blue he had ever seen they seemed as they turned upon him in that intense glance to glint and scintillate like the points of two rapiers in a brilliant sword play while their look of concentrated fury and malignity more demon like than human was stamped ineffaceably upon his brain Having secured as much as he could find of the money the murderer left hastily and silently and a few moments later the guards after a warning to the passengers not to leave their berths took their departure Having partially dressed Darrell at once sprang across the aisle and took Whitcomb s limp form in his arms His heart still beat faintly but he was unconscious and bleeding profusely All had been done so silently and swiftly that no one outside of Darrell dreamed of murder and soon the enforced silence began to be broken by hurried questions and angry exclamations A man cursed over the loss of his money and a woman sobbed hysterically Suddenly Darrell s incisive tones rang through the sleeper
4057_12085_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 For God s sake see if there is a surgeon aboard 
4057_12085_000020_000001	train-clean-360	Here is a man stabbed dying don t stop to talk of money when a life is at stake 
none	none	Instantly all thought of personal loss was for the time forgotten and half a dozen men responded to Darrell s appeal 
4057_12085_000021_000001	train-clean-360	When it became known throughout the train what had occurred the greatest excitement followed 
none	none	Train officials hurrying back and forth stopped hushed and horror stricken beside the section where Darrell sat holding Whitcomb in his arms Passengers from the other coaches crowded in eager to offer assistance that was of no avail A physician was found and came quickly to the scene who after a brief examination silently shook his head and Darrell watching the weakening pulse and shortening gasps needed no words to tell him that the young life was ebbing fast Just as the faint respirations had become almost imperceptible Whitcomb opened his eyes looking straight into Darrell s eyes with eager intensity his face lighted with the winning smile which Darrell had already learned to love 
4057_12085_000022_000001	train-clean-360	His lips moved Darrell bent his head still lower to listen 
none	none	Kate you will see her he whispered Tell her but the sentence was never finished Deftly and gently as a woman Darrell did the little which remained to be done for his young friend closing the eyes in which the love light kindled by his dying words still lingered smoothing the dishevelled golden hair wondering within himself at his own unwonted tenderness An awful pity for a bright young life to go out like that said a voice at his side and turning he saw Parkinson
4057_12085_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 How did it happen the latter inquired recognizing Darrell for the first time in the dim light 
none	none	Briefly Darrell gave the main facts as he had witnessed them saying nothing however of his having seen the face of the murderer

4057_12085_000028_000001	train-clean-360	 He ought never to have made a bluff of that sort there were too many odds against him 
none	none	He was impulsive and acted on the spur of the moment Darrell replied adding in lower tones the mistake was in giving one so young and inexperienced a commission involving so much responsibility and danger You knew of the money then 
4057_12085_000030_000001	train-clean-360	Yes that was bad business for him poor fellow 
4057_12085_000030_000002	train-clean-360	I wonder by the way if it was all taken 
none	none	At Darrell s suggestion a thorough search was made which resulted in the finding of a package containing fifteen thousand dollars which the thief in his haste had evidently overlooked This it was agreed should be placed in Darrell s keeping until the arrival of the train at Ophir Gradually the crowd dispersed most of the passengers returning to their berths Darrell knowing that sleep for himself was out of the question sought an empty section in another part of the car and seating himself bowed his head upon his hands The veins in his temples seemed near bursting and his usually strong nerves quivered from the shock he had undergone but of this he was scarcely conscious His mind abnormally active for the time held his physical sufferings in abeyance He was living over again the events of the past few hours events which had awakened within him susceptibilities he had not known he possessed which had struck a new chord in his being whose vibrations thrilled him with strange undefinable pain As he recalled Whitcomb s affectionate familiarity he seemed to hear again the low musical cadences of the boyish tones to see the sunny radiance of his smile to feel the irresistible magnetism of his presence and it seemed as though something inexpressibly sweet of whose sweetness he had barely tasted had suddenly dropped out of his life His heart grew sick with bitter sorrow as he recalled the look of mingled appeal and trust which shot from Whitcomb s eyes into his own as his young life so full of hope of ambition of love was passing through the dim portals of an unknown world Oh the pity of it that he an acquaintance of but a few hours should have been the only one to whom those eyes could turn for their last message of earthly love and sympathy and oh the impotency of any and all human love then Never before had Darrell been brought so near the unseen the unknown always surrounding us but of which few of us are conscious and for hours he sat motionless lost in thought grappling with problems hitherto unthought of but which now perplexed and baffled him at every turn At last with a heavy sigh he opened his eyes The gray twilight of dawn was slowly creeping down from the mountain tops dispelling the shadows and the light of a new faith streaming downward From the beautiful eternal hills Of God s unbeginning past was banishing the doubts which had assailed him That night had brought to him a revelation of the awful solitude of a human soul standing alone on the threshold of two worlds but it had also revealed to him the Love Infinite Divine that meets the soul when human love and sympathy are no longer of avail Chapter III THE PINES As the day advanced Darrell grew gradually but steadily worse After the excitement of the night had passed a reaction set in he felt utterly exhausted and miserable the pain returned with redoubled violence and the fever increased perceptibly from hour to hour He was keenly observant of those about him and he could not but note how soon the tragedy of the preceding night seemed forgotten Some bemoaned the loss of money or valuables a few more fortunate related how they had outwitted the robbers and escaped with trivial loss but only an occasional careless word of pity was heard for the young stranger who had met so sad a fate So quickly and completely does one human atom sink out of sight It is like the dropping of a pebble in the sea a momentary ripple that is all About noon Parkinson who had sought to while away the tedium of the journey by an interview with Darrell became somewhat alarmed at the latter s condition and went in search of a physician He returned with the one who had been summoned to Whitcomb s aid He was an eastern practitioner and unfortunately for Darrell was not so familiar with the peculiar symptoms in his case as a western physician would have been He has a high fever he remarked to Parkinson a little later as he seated himself beside Darrell to watch the effect of the remedies administered but I do not apprehend any danger I have given him something to abate the fever and induce sleep If necessary I will write out a prescription which he can have filled on his arrival at Ophir but I think in a few days he will be all right They were now approaching the continental divide the scenery moment by moment growing in sublimity and grandeur Darrell soon sank into a sleep light and broken at first but which grew deeper and heavier For more than an hour he slept unconscious that the rugged scenes through which he was then passing were to become part of his future life that each cliff and crag and mountain peak was to be to him an open book whose secrets would leave their indelible impress upon his heart and brain revealing to him the breadth and length the depth and height of life moulding his soul anew into nobler more symmetrical proportions At last the rocks suddenly parted like sentinels making way for the approaching train disclosing a broad sunlit plateau from which rose in gracefully rounded contours a pine covered mountain about whose base nestled the little city of Ophir while in the background stretched the majestic range of the great divide A crowd could be seen congregated about the depot for tidings of the night s tragedy had preceded the train by several hours and Whitcomb from his early boyhood had been a universal favorite in Ophir while his uncle was one of its wealthiest most influential citizens As the train slackened speed Parkinson with a few words to the physician hastily left to make arrangements for transportation for himself Hunter and Darrell to a hotel Amid the noise and confusion which ensued for the next ten minutes Darrell slept heavily till roused by a gentle shake he awoke to find the physician bending over him and heard voices approaching down the now nearly deserted sleeping car Yes said a heavy voice speaking rapidly the conductor wired details he said this young man did everything for the boy that could be done and stayed by him to the end He did he stood by him like a brother Parkinson s voice replied And he is sick you say Well he won t want for anything within my power to do for him that s all Parkinson stopped at Darrell s side mister Darrell he said this is mister Underwood Whitcomb s uncle you know mister Underwood mister Darrell Darrell rose a little unsteadily the two men grasped hands and for an instant neither spoke Darrell saw before him a tall powerfully built man approaching fifty whose somewhat bronzed face shrewd stern and unreadable was lighted by a pair of blue eyes which once had resembled Whitcomb s With a swift penetrating glance the elder man looked searchingly into the face of the younger True as steel with a heart of gold was his mental comment then he spoke abruptly and his voice sounded brusque though his face was working with emotion mister Darrell my carriage is waiting for you outside You will go home with me unless he added inquiringly you are expecting to meet friends or acquaintances No mister Underwood Darrell replied I am a stranger here but much as I appreciate your kindness I could not think of intruding upon your home at such a time as this Porter said mister Underwood with the air of one accustomed to command take this gentleman s luggage outside and tell them out there that it is to go to The Pines my men are there and they will look after it then turning to Darrell he continued still more brusquely This train pulls out in three minutes so you had better prepare to follow your luggage You don t stop in Ophir outside of my house and I don t think you ll travel much farther for a while You look as though you needed a bed and good nursing more than anything else just now I have given him a prescription sir said the physician that I think will set him right if he gets needed rest and sleep Humph responded mister Underwood gruffly he ll get whatever he needs you can depend on that You gentlemen assist him out of the car I ll go and despatch a messenger to the house to have everything in readiness for him there At the foot of the car steps Darrell parted from the physician and leaning on Parkinson s arm slowly made his way through the crowd to the carriage where mister Underwood awaited him Parkinson having taken leave mister Underwood assisted the young man into the carriage A spasm of pain crossed Darrell s face as he saw just ahead of them waiting to precede them on the homeward journey a light wagon containing a stretcher covered with a heavy black cloth a line of stalwart young fellows drawn up on either side and he recalled Whitcomb s parting words on the previous night When we reach Ophir to morrow you ll go directly home with me This was observed by mister Underwood who remarked a moment later as he seated himself beside Darrell and they started homeward This is a sad time to introduce you to our home and household mister Darrell but you will find your welcome none the less genuine on that account mister Underwood said the young man in a troubled voice this seems to me the most unwarrantable intrusion on my part to accept your hospitality at such a time Before he could say more mister Underwood placed a firm heavy hand on his knee You stood by my poor boy Harry to the last and that is enough to insure you a welcome from me and mine I m only doing what Harry himself would do if he were here As to what I did for your nephew God knows it was little enough I could do Darrell answered bitterly I was powerless to defend him against the fatal blow and after that there was no help for him Did you see him killed Yes Tell me all everything just as it occurred mister Underwood little knew the effort it cost Darrell in his condition to go over the details of the terrible scene but he forced himself to give a clear succinct calm statement of all that took place The elder man sat looking straight before him immovable impassive like one who heard not yet in reality missing nothing that was said Not until Darrell repeated Whitcomb s dying words was there any movement on his part then he turned his head so that his face was hidden and remained motionless and silent as before At last he inquired Did he leave no message for me He mentioned only your daughter mister Underwood he evidently had some message for her which he was unable to give A long silence followed Darrell utterly exhausted sank back into a corner of the carriage The slight movement roused mister Underwood he looked towards Darrell whose eyes were closed and was shocked at his deathly pallor He said nothing however for Darrell was again sinking into a heavy stupor but watched him with growing concern making no attempt to rouse him until the carriage left the street and began ascending a long gravelled driveway then putting his hand on Darrell s shoulder he said quite loudly Wake up my boy We re getting home now To Darrell his voice sounded faint and far away like an echo out of a vast distance and it was some seconds before he could realize where he was or form any definite idea of his surroundings Gradually he became conscious that the air was no longer hot and stifling but cool and fragrant with the sweet resinous breath of pines Looking about him he saw they were winding upward along an avenue cut through a forest of small slender pines which extended below them on one side and far above them on the other A moment later they came out into a clearing whence he could see rising directly before him in a series of natural terraces the slopes of the sombre hued pine clad mountain which overlooked the little city Upon one of the terraces of the mountain stood a massive house of unhewn granite a house representing no particular style of architecture but whose deep bay windows broad winding verandas and shadowy secluded balconies all combined to present an aspect most inviting To Darrell the place had an irresistible charm he gazed at it as though fascinated unable to take his eyes from the scene You certainly have a beautiful home mister Underwood he said and a most unique location I never saw anything quite like it It will do said the elder man quietly gratified by what he saw in his companion s face I built it for my little girl It was her own idea to have it that way and she has named it The Pines Thank God I ve got her left yet but she is about all Something in his tone caused Darrell to glance quickly towards him with a look of sympathetic inquiry They were now approaching the house and mister Underwood turned facing him a smile for the first time lighting up his stern rugged features as he said You will find us what my little girl calls a patched up family I am a widower my widowed sister keeps house for me and Harry whom I had grown to consider almost a son was an orphan But the family such as it is will make you welcome I can speak for that Here we are With a supreme effort Darrell summoned all his energies as mister Underwood assisted him from the carriage and into the house But the ringing and pounding in his head increased his brain seemed reeling and he was so nearly blinded by pain that notwithstanding his efforts he was forced to admit to himself as a little later he sank upon a couch in the room assigned to him that his impressions of the ladies to whom he had just been presented were exceedingly vague mister Underwood s sister missus Dean he remembered as a large woman low voiced somewhat resembling her brother in manner and like him of few words yet something in her greeting had assured him of a welcome as deep as it was undemonstrative Of Kate Underwood in whom he had felt more than a passing interest remembering Whitcomb s love for his cousin he recalled a tall slender girlish form a wealth of golden brown hair and a pair of large luminous brown eyes whose wistful almost appealing look haunted him strangely though he was unable to recall another feature of her face mister Underwood who had left the room to telephone for a physician returned with a faithful servant and insisted upon Darrell s retiring to bed without delay a proposition which the latter was only too glad to follow Darrell had already given mister Underwood the package of fifteen thousand dollars found on the train and now while disrobing handed him the belt in which he carried his own money saying I ll put this in your keeping for a few days till I feel more like myself I lost my watch and some change but I took the precaution to have this hidden He stopped abruptly and seemed to be trying to recall something then continued slowly There was something else in connection with that affair which I wished to say to you but my head is so confused I cannot think what it was Don t try to think now it will come to you by and by mister Underwood replied You re in good hands so don t worry yourself about anything but get all the rest you can With a deep sigh of relief Darrell sank on the pillows and was soon sleeping heavily A few moments later mister Underwood coming from Darrell s room having left the servant in charge met his sister coming down the long hall She beckoned and turning slowly retraced her steps her brother following to another part of the house where they entered a darkened chamber and together stood beside a low narrow couch strewn with fragrant flowers Together without a word or a tear they gazed on the peaceful face of this sleeper wrapped in the breathless dreamless slumber we call death They recalled the years since he had come to them the dying bequest of their youngest sister a little golden haired prattler to fill their home with the music of his childish voice and the sunshine of his smile Already the great house seemed strangely silent without his ringing laughter his bursts of merry song But of whatever bitter grief stirred their hearts this silent brother and sister so long accustomed to self restraint and self repression gave no sign Gently she replaced the covering over the face of the sleeper and silently they left the room Not until they again reached the door of Darrell s room was the silence broken then the brother said in low tones Marcia we ve done all for the dead that can be done it s the living who needs our care now Yes she replied quietly I was going to see what I could do for him when you had put him to bed Bennett is in there now and I m going downstairs to wait for doctor Bradley he telephoned that he d be up in twenty minutes Very well I ll sit by him till the doctor comes When doctor Bradley arrived he found Darrell in a state of coma from which it was almost impossible to arouse him From mister Underwood and his sister he learned whatever details they could furnish but from the patient himself very little information could be obtained He has this fever that is prevailing in the mountainous districts and has it in its worst form he said when about to take leave Of course having just come from the East it would be worse for him in any event than if he were acclimated but aside from that the cerebral symptoms are greatly aggravated owing to the nervous shock which he received last night To witness an occurrence of that sort would be more or less of a shock to nerves in a normal state but in the condition in which he was at the time it is likely to produce some rather serious complications Follow these directions which I have written out and I ll be in again in a couple of hours But in two hours Darrell was delirious Has he recognized any one since I was here doctor Bradley inquired as he again stood beside the patient I don t think so missus Dean replied I could hardly rouse him enough to give him the medicine and even then he didn t seem to know me I ll be in about midnight said the physician as he again took leave and I ll send a professional nurse a man this is likely to be a long siege Send whatever is needed said mister Underwood brusquely the same as if twere for the boy himself And missus Dean the physician continued if he should have a lucid interval you had better ascertain the address of his friends It was nearly midnight For hours Darrell had battled against the darkening shadows fast settling down upon him enveloping him with a horror worse than death itself Suddenly there was a rift in the clouds and the calm sweet light of reason stole softly through He felt a cool hand on his forehead and opening his eyes looked with a smile into the face of missus Dean as she bent over him Bending still lower she said in low distinct tones Can you tell me the name of your people and where they live In an instant he comprehended all that her question implied he must give his own name and the address of the far away eastern home He strove to recall it but the effort was too great before he could speak the clouds surged together and all was blotted out in darkness Chapter IV LIFE OR DEATH Hour by hour the clouds thickened obscuring every ray of light closing the avenues of sight and sound until isolated from the outer world by this intangible yet impenetrable barrier Darrell was alone in a world peopled only with the phantoms of his imagination Of the lapse of time of the weary procession of days and nights which followed he knew nothing Day and night were to him only an endless repetition of the horrors which thronged his fevered brain Again and again he lived over the tragic scene in the sleeping car each iteration and reiteration growing in dreadful realism until it was he himself who grappled in deadly contest with the murderer and the latter in turn became a monster whose hot breath stifled him whose malign demoniacal glance seemed to sear his eyeballs like living fire Over and over with failing strength he waged the unequal contest striving at last with a legion of hideous forms Then as the clouds grew still more dense about him these shapes grew dim and he found himself weak and trembling adrift upon a sea of darkness whose black waves tossed him angrily with each breath threatening to engulf him in their gloomy depths Desperately he battled with them each struggle leaving him weaker than the last until at length scarcely breathing his strength utterly exhausted he lay watching the towering forms as they swept relentlessly towards him gathering strength and fury as they came He saw the yawning abysses on each side he heard the roar of the on coming waves but was powerless to move hand or foot But while he waited in helpless terror the waves on which he tossed to and fro grew calm then they seemed to divide and he felt himself going down down into infinite depths The sullen roar died away the darkness was flooded with golden light and through its ethereal waves he was still floating downward more gently than ever a roseleaf floated to earth on the evening s breath Through the waves of golden light there came to him a faint distant murmur of voices and the words He is sinking fast He smiled with perfect content wondering dreamily if it would never end then consciousness was lost in utter oblivion Three weeks had elapsed since Darrell came to The Pines August had given place to September but the languorous days brought no cessation of the fearful heat no cooling rain to the panting earth no promise of renewed life to the drought smitten vegetation The timber on the ranges had been reduced to masses of charred and smouldering embers among which the low flames still crept and crawled winding their way up and down the mountains The pall of smoke overhanging the city grew more and more dense until there came a morning when as the sun looked over the distant ranges the landscape was suffused with a dull red glare which steadily deepened until all objects assumed a blood red hue Two or three hours passed and then a lurid light illumined the strange scene brightening moment by moment till earth and sky glowed like a mass of molten copper The heat seemed to concentrate upon that part of the earth s surface the air grew oppressive and an ominous silence reigned in which even the birds were hushed and the dumb brutes cowered beside their masters As the brazen glow was fading to a weird yellow light an anxious group was gathered about Darrell s bedside He still tossed and moaned in delirium but his movements had grown pathetically feeble and the moans were those of a tired child sobbing himself to sleep He cannot hold out much longer said doctor Bradley his fingers on the weakening pulse his strength is failing rapidly There will be a change soon one way or the other said the nurse and there s not much of a chance left him now One chance in a hundred said doctor Bradley slowly and that is his wonderful constitution he may pull through where ninety nine others would die doctor Bradley watched the sick man in silence then noting that the room was darkening he stepped to an open window and cast a look of anxious inquiry at the murky sky As if in answer to his thought there came the low rumble of distant thunder bringing a look of relief and hopefulness to the face of the physician Returning to the bedside he gave a few directions then as he was leaving remarked There will be a change in the weather soon a change that may help to turn the tide in his favor provided it does not come too late Hours passed the distant mutterings grew louder while the darkness and gloom increased and the sense of oppression became almost intolerable Suddenly the leaden mass which had overspread the sky appeared to drop to earth and in the dead silence which followed could be heard the roar of the wind through the gorges and down the canyons A moment more and clouds of dust and debris the outriders of the coming tempest rushed madly through the streets in whirling columns towering far above the city From their vantage ground the dwellers at The Pines watched the course of the storm but only for a moment then blinding sheets of water hid even the nearest objects from view while lightnings flashed incessantly and the thunder crashed and rolled in one ceaseless deafening roar The trees waved their arms in wild helpless terror as one and another of their number were prostrated by the storm while the dry channels on the mountain side became raging foaming torrents Suddenly the winds changed a chilling blast swept across the plateau and to the rush of the wind the roar of the thunder and the crash of falling timber was added the sharp staccato of swiftly descending hail For nearly an hour the storm raged in its fury then departed as suddenly as it came but it left behind a clear atmosphere crisp as an October morning As the storm clouds touched with beauty by the rays of the setting sun were settling below the eastern ranges doctor Bradley again entered the sick room The room was flooded with golden light and the physician was quick to note the changes which the few hours had wrought in the sick man The fever had gone and his strength spent his splendid energies exhausted life s forces were ebbing moment by moment He is sinking fast said missus Dean Even as she spoke a smile stole over the pallid features then as they watched eagerly for some token of returning consciousness the nervous system so long strained to its utmost tension suddenly relaxed and utter collapse followed For hours Darrell lay as one dead an occasional fluttering about the heart being the only sign of life But late in the forenoon of the following day the watchers by the bedside noting each feeble pulsation thinking it might be the last felt an almost imperceptible quickening of the life current Gradually the fluttering pulse grew calm and steady the faint respirations grew deeper and more regular until at length with a long tremulous sigh Darrell sank into slumber sweet and restful as a child s and the watchers knew that the crisis had passed Chapter V JOHN BRITTON It was on one of those glorious October days when every breath quickens the blood and when simply to live is a joy unspeakable that Darrell first walked abroad into the outdoor world Several times during his convalescence he had sunned himself on the balcony opening from his room or when able to go downstairs had paced feebly up and down the verandas but of late his strength had returned rapidly so that now accompanied by his physician he was walking back and forth over the gravelled driveway under the pine trees his step gaining firmness with every turn Seated on the veranda were mister Underwood and his sister the one with his pipe and newspaper the other with her knitting but the newspaper had slipped unheeded to the floor and though missus Dean s skilful fingers did not slacken their work for an instant yet her eyes like her brother s were fastened upon Darrell and a shade of pity might have been detected in the look of each which the occasion at first sight hardly seemed to warrant Poor fellow said mister Underwood at length it s hard for a young man to be handicapped like that Yes assented his sister and he takes it hard too though he doesn t say much I can t bear to look in his eyes sometimes they look so sort of pleading and helpless Takes it hard reiterated mister Underwood why shouldn t he I m satisfied that he is a young man of unusual ability who had a bright future before him and I tell you Marcia it s pretty hard for him to wake up and find it all rubbed off the slate Well said missus Dean with a sigh everybody has to carry their own burdens but there s a look on his face when he thinks nobody sees him that makes me wish I could help him carry his though I don t suppose anybody can for that matter it isn t anything that anybody feels like saying much about I m glad Jack is coming said mister Underwood after a pause he may do him some good He has a way of getting at those things that you and I haven t Marcia Yes he s seen trouble himself though nobody knows what it was Notwithstanding the tide of returning vitality was fast restoring tissue and muscle to Darrell s wasted limbs and firmness and elasticity to his step it was yet evident to a close observer that some undercurrent of suffering was doing its work day by day sprinkling the dark hair with gleams of silver tracing faint lines in the face hitherto untouched by care working its subtle mysterious changes When a new lease of life was granted to John Darrell and he awoke to consciousness it was to find that every detail of his past life had been blotted out leaving only a blank Of his home his friends of his own name even not a vestige of memory was left It was as though he had entered upon a new existence By degrees as he was able to hear them he was given the details of his arrival at Ophir of his coming to The Pines of the tragedy which he had witnessed in the sleeping car but they awoke no memories in his mind For him there was no past As a realization of his condition dawned upon him his mental distress was pitiable Despite the efforts of physician and nurse to divert his mind he would lie for hours trying to recall some fragment from the veiled and shrouded past but all in vain Yet with returning physical strength many of his former attainments seemed to return to him naturally and without effort doctor Bradley one day used a Latin phrase in his hearing he at once repeated it and without a moment s hesitation gave the correct rendering but was unable to tell how he did it It simply came to me was all the explanation he could give From this the physician argued that the memory of his past life would sooner or later return and it was this hope alone which at that time saved Darrell from total despair Aside from his professional interest in so peculiar a case doctor Bradley had become interested in Darrell himself many of his leisure hours were spent at The Pines and quite a friendship existed between the two In mister Underwood and his sister Darrell had found two steadfast friends each seeming to vie with the other in thoughtful unobtrusive kindness His strange misfortune had only deepened and intensified the sympathy which had been first aroused by the peculiar circumstances under which he had come to them But now as then they said little and for this Darrell was grateful Even the silent pity which he read in their eyes hurt him why he could scarcely explain to himself expressed in words it would have been intolerable Early in his convalescence Darrell had expressed an unwillingness to trespass upon their kindness by remaining after he could with safety be moved but the few words they had spoken on that occasion had effectually silenced any further suggestion of the kind on his part He understood that to leave them would be to forfeit their friendship which he well knew was of a sort too rare to be slighted or thrown aside Of Kate Underwood Darrell knew nothing except as her father or aunt spoke of her for he had no recollection of her and she had left home early in his illness to return to an eastern college from which she would graduate the following year With more animation than he had yet shown since his illness Darrell returned to the veranda He was flushed and trembling slightly from the unusual exertion and doctor Bradley dropping down beside him from force of habit laid his fingers on Darrell s wrist but the latter shook them off playfully No more of that he exclaimed adding Doctor I challenge you for a race two weeks from to day What do you say do you take me up Two weeks from to day repeated the doctor with an incredulous smile at the same time scrutinizing Darrell s form Well yes When you are in ordinary health I don t think I would care to do much business with you along that line but two weeks from to day is a safe proposition I guess What do you want to make it a hundred yards he inquired with a laughing glance at mister Underwood One hundred yards replied Darrell following the direction of the doctor s glance Do you want to name the winner mister Underwood I ll back you my boy said the elder man quietly his shrewd face growing a trifle shrewder What exclaimed doctor Bradley rising hastily I guess it s about time I was going if that s your estimate of my athletic prowess and shaking hands with Darrell he started down the driveway I ll put you up at about ten to one mister Underwood called after the retreating figure but a deprecatory wave of his hand over his shoulder was the doctor s only reply Oh exclaimed Darrell looking about him this is glorious This is one of the days that make a fellow feel that life is worth living Even as he spoke there came to his mind the thought of what life meant to him and the smile died from his lips and the light from his eyes For a moment nothing was said then with the approaching sound of rhythmic hoof beats mister Underwood rose deliberately emptying the ashes from his pipe as a fine pair of black horses attached to a light carriage appeared around the house from the direction of the stables You will be back for lunch David missus Dean inquired Yes and I ll bring Jack with me was his reply as he seated himself beside the driver and the horses started at a brisk trot down the driveway With a smile missus Dean addressed Darrell who was watching the horses with a keen appreciation of their good points This Jack that you ve heard my brother speak of is his partner Yes said Darrell courteously feeling slight interest in the expected guest but glad of anything to divert his thoughts Yes missus Dean continued they ve been partners and friends for more than ten years His name is John Britton but it s never anything but Dave and Jack between the two they re almost like two boys together Darrell wondered what manner of man this might be who could transform his silent stern faced host into anything boy like but he said nothing To see them together you d wonder at their friendship too continued missus Dean for they re noways alike My brother is all business and mister Britton is not what you d really call a practical business man He is very rich for he is one of those men that everything they touch seems to turn to gold but he doesn t seem to care much about money He spends a great deal of his time in reading and studying and though he makes very few friends he could have any number of them if he wanted for he s one of those people that you always feel drawn to without knowing why missus Dean paused to count the stitches in her work and Darrell whose thoughts were of the speaker more than of the subject of conversation watching her placid face wondered whether it were possible for any emotion ever to disturb that calm exterior Presently she resumed her subject speaking in low even tones which a slight gentle inflection now and then just saved from monotony He s always a friend to anybody in distress and I guess there isn t a poor person or a friendless person in Ophir that doesn t know him and love him He has had some great trouble nobody knows what it is but he told David once that it had changed his whole life Darrell now became interested and the dark eyes fixed on missus Dean s face grew suddenly luminous with the quick sympathy her words had aroused He always seems to be on the lookout for anybody that has trouble to help them that s how he got to know my brother missus Dean hesitated a moment I never spoke of this to any one before but I thought maybe you d be interested to know about it she said looking at Darrell with a slightly apologetic air I am and I think I understand and appreciate your motive was his quiet reply She dropped her work folding her hands above it and her face wore a reminiscent look as she continued When David s wife died twelve years ago it was an awful blow to him He didn t say much that isn t our way but we were afraid he would never be the same again His brother was out here at that time but none of us could do anything for him He kept on trying to attend to business just as usual but he seemed as you might say to have lost his grip on things It went on that way for nearly two years his business got behind and everything seemed to be slipping through his fingers when he happened to get acquainted with mister Britton and he seemed to know just what to say and do He got David interested in business again He loaned him money to start with and they went into business together and have been together ever since They have both been successful but David has worked and planned for what he has while mister Britton s money seems to come to him He owns property all over the State and all through the West for that matter and sometimes he s in one place and sometimes in another but he never stays very long anywhere David would like to have him make his home with us but he told him once that he couldn t think of it that he only stayed in a place till the pain got to be more than he could bear and then he went somewhere else A long silence followed then as missus Dean folded her work she said softly It s no wonder he knows just how to help folks who are in trouble for I guess he has suffered himself more than anybody knows A little later she had gone indoors to superintend the preparations for lunch but Darrell still sat in the mellow autumn sunlight his eyes closed picturing to himself this stranger silently bearing his hidden burden changing from place to place but always keeping the pain It still lacked two hours of sunset when John Darrell leaning on the arm of John Britton walked slowly up the mountain path to a rustic seat under the pines They had met at lunch mister Britton had already heard the strange story of Darrell s illness and looking into his eyes with their troubled questioning their piteous appeal knew at once by swift intuition how hopelessly bewildering and dark life must look to the young man before him just at the age when it usually is brightest and most alluring and Darrell meeting the steadfast gaze of the clear gray eyes saw there no pity but something infinitely broader deeper and sweeter and knew intuitively that they were united by the fellowship of suffering that mysterious tie which has not only bound human hearts together in all ages but has linked suffering humanity with suffering Divinity For more than two hours Darrell taking little part himself in the general conversation had watched as one entranced the play of the fine features and listened to the deep musical voice of this stranger who was a stranger no longer He was an excellent conversationalist humorous without being cynical scholarly without being pedantic and showing especial familiarity with history and the natural sciences At last while walking up and down the broad veranda mister Britton had paused beside Darrell and throwing an arm over his shoulder had said Come my son let us have a little stroll Darrell s heart had leaped strangely at the words he knew not why and in a silence pregnant with deep emotion on both sides they had climbed to the rustic bench Here they sat down The ground at their feet was carpeted with pine needles the air was sweet with the fragrance of the pines and of the warm earth no sound reached their ears aside from the chirping of the crickets the occasional dropping of a pine cone or the gentle sighing of the light breeze through the branches above their heads A glorious scene lay outspread before them the distant ranges half veiled in purple haze the valleys flooded with golden light brightened by the autumnal tints of the deciduous timber which marked the courses of numerous small streams and over the whole a restful silence as though the year s work ended earth was keeping some grand solemn holiday mister Britton first broke the silence as in low tones he murmured reverently Thou crownest the year with Thy goodness Then turning to Darrell with a smile of peculiar sweetness he said This is one of what I call the year s coronation days when even Nature herself rests from her labors and dons her royal robes in honor of the occasion Then as an answering light dawned in Darrell s eyes and the tense lines in his face began to relax mister Britton continued musingly I have often wondered why we do not imitate Nature in her great annual holiday and why we a nation who garners one of the richest harvests of the world do not have a national harvest festival How effectively and fittingly for instance something similar to the old Jewish feast of tabernacles might be celebrated in this part of the country In the earliest days of their history the Jews were commanded when the year s harvest had been gathered to take the boughs of goodly trees of palm trees and willows and to construct booths in which they were to dwell feasting and rejoicing for seven days In the only account given of one of these feasts we read that the people brought olive branches and pine branches myrtle branches and palm branches and made themselves booths upon the roofs of their houses in their courts and in their streets and dwelt in them and there was very great gladness Imagine such a scene on these mountain slopes and foot hills under these cloudless skies the sombre evergreen boughs interwoven with the brightly colored foliage from the lowlands this mellow golden sunlight by day alternating with the white mystical radiance of the harvest moon by night mister Britton s words had as he intended they should drawn Darrell s thoughts from himself Under his graphic description accompanied by the powerful magnetism of his voice and presence Darrell seemed to see the Oriental festival which he had depicted and to feel a soothing influence from the very simplicity and beauty of the imaginary scene Think of the rest the relaxation in a week of such a life continued mister Britton Re creation in the true sense of the word The simplest joys are the sweetest but our lives have grown too complex for us to appreciate them Our amusements and recreations as we call them are often more wearing and exhausting than our labors For nearly an hour mister Britton led the conversation on general subjects carefully avoiding every personal allusion Darrell following interested animated wondering more and more at the man beside him until the latter tactfully led him to speak calmly and dispassionately as he could not have spoken an hour before of himself Almost before he was aware Darrell had told all of his vain gropings in the darkness for some clue to the past of the helpless feeling akin to despair which sometimes took possession of him when he attempted to face the situation continuously confronting him During his recital mister Britton had thrown his arm about Darrell s shoulder and when he paused quite a silence followed Did it ever occur to you mister Britton said at length speaking very slowly that there are hundreds yes thousands who would be only too glad to exchange places with you to day No Darrell replied too greatly astonished to say more But there are legions of poor souls haunted by crime or crushed beneath the weight of sorrow whose one prayer would be if such a thing were possible that their past might be blotted out that they might be free to begin life anew with no memories dogging their steps like spectres threatening at every turn to work their undoing For a moment Darrell regarded his friend with a fixed inquiring gaze which gradually changed to a look of comprehension I see he said at length I have got to begin life anew but you consider that there are others who have to make the start under conditions worse than mine Far worse said mister Britton Don t think for a moment that I fail to realize in how many ways you are handicapped or to appreciate the obstacles against which you will have to contend but this I do say the future is in your own hands as much as it is in the hands of any mortal to make the most of and the best of that you can and with the negative advantage at least that you are untrammelled by a past that can hold you back or drag you down The younger man laid his hand on the knee of the elder with a gesture almost appealing The future until now has looked very dark to me it begins to look brighter Advise me tell me how best to begin In one word said mister Britton with a smile Work Just as soon as you are able find some work to do Did we but know it work is the surest antidote for the poisonous discontent and ennui of this world the swiftest panacea for its pains and miseries different forms to suit different cases but every form brings healing and blessing even down to the humblest manual labor That is just what I have wanted said Darrell eagerly to go to work as soon as possible but what can I do What am I fitted for I have not the slightest idea I don t care to work at breaking stone though I suppose that would be better than nothing That would be better than nothing said mister Britton smiling again but that would not be suited to your case What you need is mental work something to keep your mind constantly occupied and rest assured you will find it when you are ready for it Our Father provides what we need just when we need it Day by day we have the daily bread for mental and spiritual life as for temporal But what you most want to do is to keep your mind pleasantly occupied and above all things don t try to recall the past In God s own good time it will return of itself And when it does what revelations will it bring Darrell queried musingly Nothing that you will be afraid or ashamed to meet of that I am sure said mister Britton confidently adding a moment later in a lighter tone It is nearing sunset my boy and time that I was taking you back to the house You have given me new courage new hope said Darrell rising I feel now as though there were something to live for as though I might make something out of life after all I realize said mister Britton tenderly as together they began the descent of the mountain path as deeply as you do that your life is sadly disjointed but strive so to live that when the broken fragments are at last united they will form one harmonious and symmetrical whole It is a difficult task I know but the result will be well worth the effort In your case my son even more than in ordinary lives the words of the poet are peculiarly applicable A sacred burden is this life ye bear Look on it lift it bear it solemnly Stand up and walk beneath it steadfastly Fail not for sorrow falter not for sin But onward upward till the goal ye win An hour later John Britton stood alone on one of the mountain terraces his tall lithe form silhouetted against the evening sky his arms folded his face lifted upward It was a face of marvellous strength and sweetness combined Sorrow had set its unmistakable seal upon his features here and there pain had traced its ineffaceable lines but the firmly set mouth was yet inexpressibly tender the calm brow was unfurrowed and the clear eyes had the far seeing look of one who like the Alpine traveller had reached the heights above the clouds to whose vision were revealed glories undreamed of by the dwellers in the vales below And to Darrell watching from his room the distant figure outlined against the sky the simple grandeur the calm triumph of its pose must have brought some revelation concerning this man of whom he knew so little yet whose personality even more than his words had taken so firm a hold upon himself for as the light faded and deepening twilight hid the solitary figure from view he turned from the window and pacing slowly up and down the room soliloquized With him for a friend I can meet the future with courage and await with patience the resurrection of the buried past As he has conquered so will I conquer I will scale the heights after him until I stand where he stands to night Chapter VI ECHOES FROM THE PAST During his stay at The Pines mister Britton spent the greater portion of his time with mister Underwood either at their offices or at the mines Darrell therefore saw little of his new found friend except as they all gathered in the evening around the glowing fire in the large family sitting room for notwithstanding the lingering warmth and sunshine of the days the nights were becoming sharp and frosty so that an open fire added much to the evening s enjoyment Each morning however before his departure mister Britton stopped for a few words with Darrell some quaint kindly bit of humor the pleasant flavor of which would enliven the entire day some unhackneyed expression of sympathy whose very genuineness and sincerity made Darrell s position seem to him less isolated and solitary than before or some suggestion which acted upon relieved the monotony of the tedious hours of convalescence At his suggestion Darrell took vigorous exercise each day in the morning air and sunshine devoting his afternoons to a course of light pleasant reading If you are going to work said mister Britton the first requisite is to have your body and mind in just as healthful and normal a condition as possible in order that you may be able to give an equivalent for what you receive In these days of trouble between employer and employed we hear a great deal about the laborer demanding an honest equivalent for his toil but it does not occur to him to inquire whether he is giving his employer an honest equivalent for his money The fact is a large percentage of working men and working women in all departments of labor are squandering their energies night after night in various forms and degrees of dissipation until they are utterly incapacitated for one honest day s work yet they do not hesitate to take a full day s wages and would consider themselves wronged were the smallest fraction withheld Darrell found himself rather restricted in his reading for the first few days as he found but a limited number of books at The Pines until missus Dean who had received a hint from mister Britton meeting him one day in the upper hall led him into two darkened rooms saying as she hastened to open the blinds These are what the children always called their dens All their books are here and I thought maybe you d like to look them over If you see anything you like just help yourself and use the rooms for reading or writing whenever you want to Darrell left to himself looked about him with much interest The two rooms were similar in style and design but otherwise were as diverse as possible The room in which he was standing was furnished in embossed leather A leather couch stood near one of the windows and a large reclining chair of the same material was drawn up before the fireplace Near the mantel was a pipe rack filled with fine specimens of briar wood and meerschaum pipes Signs of tennis golf and various athletic sports were visible on all sides in the centre of the room stood a large roll top desk open and on it lay a briar pipe filled with ashes just where the owner s hand had laid it But what most interested Darrell was a large portrait over the fireplace which he knew must be that of Harry Whitcomb The face was neither especially fine nor strong but the winsome smile lurking about the curves of the sensitive mouth and in the depths of the frank blue eyes rendered it attractive and it was with a sigh for the young life so suddenly blotted out that Darrell turned to enter the second room He paused at the doorway feeling decidedly out of place and glanced about him with a serio comic smile The furnishings were as unique as possible no one piece in the room bearing any relation or similarity to any other piece There were chairs and tables of wicker work twisted into the most ornate designs interspersed among heavy antique pieces of carving and slender specimens of colonial simplicity divans covered with pillows of every delicate shade imaginable exquisite etchings and dainty bric a brac In an alcove formed by a large bay window stood a writing desk of ebony inlaid with mother of pearl and on an easel in a secluded corner partially concealed by silken draperies was the portrait of Kate Underwood a childish rather immature face but with a mouth indicating both sweetness and strength of character and with dark strangely appealing eyes The walls of both rooms were lined with bookcases but their contents were widely diverse and to Darrell s surprise he found the young girl s library contained far the better class of books But even in their selection he observed the same peculiarity that he had noted in the furnishing of the room there were few complete sets of books instead there were one two or three volumes of each author as the case might be evidently her especial favorites But Darrell returned to the other room which interested him far more each article in it bearing eloquent testimony to the happy young life of whose tragic end he had now often heard but of which he was unable to recall the faintest memory Passing slowly through the room his attention was caught by a violin case standing in an out of the way corner With a cry of joy he drew it forth his fingers trembling with eagerness as he opened it and took therefrom a genuine Stradivarius At that moment his happiness knew no bounds Seating himself and bending his head over the instrument after the manner of a true violin lover he drew the bow gently across the strings producing a chord of such triumphant sweetness that the air seemed vibrating with the joy which at that instant thrilled his own soul Immediately all thought of himself or of his surroundings was lost With eyes half closed and dreamy he began to play without effort almost mechanically but with the deft touch of a master hand while liquid harmonies filled the room quivering rising falling at times low plaintive despairing then swelling exultantly only to die away in tremulous minor undertones The man s pent up feelings had at last found expression his alternate hope and despair his unutterable loneliness and longing all voiced by the violin Of the lapse of time Darrell had neither thought nor consciousness until the door opened and missus Dean s calm smile and matter of fact voice recalled him to a material world I see that you have found Harry s violin she said I beg your pardon Darrell stammered somewhat dazed by his sudden descent to the commonplace I ought not to have taken it I never thought I was so delighted to find the instrument and so carried away with its tones it never occurred to me how it might seem to you Oh that is all right she interposed quietly use it whenever you like Harry bought it two years ago but he never had the patience to learn it so it has been used very little I never heard such playing as yours and I stepped in to ask you to bring it downstairs and play for us to night mister Britton will be delighted he enjoys everything of that sort Around the fireside that evening Darrell had an attentive audience though the appreciation of his auditors was manifested in a manner characteristic of each mister Underwood after two or three futile attempts to talk business with his partner finding him very uncommunicative gave himself up to the enjoyment of his pipe and the music in about equal proportions indulging surreptitiously in occasional brief naps though always wide awake at the end of each number and joining heartily in the applause missus Dean sat gazing into the glowing embers her face lighted with quiet pleasure but her knitting needles twinkled and flashed in the firelight with the same unceasing regularity and she doubled and seamed and slipped and bound her stitches with the same monotonous precision as on other evenings mister Britton in a comfortable reclining chair sat silent motionless his head thrown back his eyes nearly closed but in the varying expression of his mobile face Darrell found both inspiration and compensation For more than three hours Darrell entertained his friends quaint medleys dreamy waltzes and bits of classical music following one after another with no effort no hesitancy on the part of the player To their eager inquiries he could only answer I don t know how I do it They seem to come to me with the sweep of the bow across the strings I have no recollection of anything that I am playing it seems as though the instrument and I were simply drifting Late in the evening when they were nearly ready to separate for the night Darrell sat idly strumming the violin when an old familiar strain floated sweetly forth and his astonished listeners suddenly heard him singing in a rich baritone an old love song forgotten until then by every one present missus Dean had already laid aside her work and sat with hands folded a smile of unusual tenderness hovering about her lips while mister Britton s face was quivering with emotion At its conclusion he grasped Darrell s hand silently That is a very old song said missus Dean It seems queer to hear you sing it I used to hear it sung when I was a young girl and that she added smiling was a great many years ago And I have sung it many a time a great many years ago said mister Britton And he hastily left the room Chapter VII AT THE MINES Once fairly started on the road to health Darrell gained marvellously Each day marked some new acquisition in physical health and muscular vigor while his systematic reading the soothing influence of the music to which he devoted a considerable time each day and more than all his growing intimacy with mister Britton were doing much towards restoring a better mental equipoise The race to which he had challenged doctor Bradley took place on a frosty morning early in November mister Underwood himself measuring and marking the course for the runners and mister Britton acting as starter The result was a victory for Darrell who came out more than a yard ahead of his opponent somewhat to the chagrin of the latter who had won quite a local reputation as an athlete You ll do he said to Darrell as he took leave a few moments later but don t pose here as an invalid any longer or I ll expose you as a fraud Understand I cross your name off my list of patients to day But not off your list of friends I hope Darrell rejoined as they shook hands When doctor Bradley had gone Darrell turned to mister Britton who was standing near saying as his face grew serious doctor Bradley is right I m no invalid now and I must quit this idling I must find what I can do and go to work All in good time said mister Britton pleasantly We ll find something for you before I go from here Meanwhile I want to give you a little pleasure trip if you are able to take it How would you like to go out to the mines to morrow with mister Underwood and myself Do you think you could rough it with us old fellows for a couple of days You couldn t have suggested anything that would please me better Darrell answered I would like the change and it s time I was roughing it Perhaps when I get out there I ll decide to take a pick and shovel and start in at the bottom of the ladder and work my way up Is that necessary queried mister Britton regarding the younger man with close but kindly scrutiny mister Underwood tells me that you brought a considerable amount of money with you when you came here which he has deposited to your credit Darrell met the penetrating gaze unwaveringly as he replied with quiet decision That money may be mine or it may not it may have been given me to hold in trust In any event it belongs to the past and it will remain where it is intact until the past is unveiled mister Britton looked gratified as he remarked in a low tone I don t think you need any assurance my boy that I will back you with all the capital you need if you would like to start in business No mister Britton said Darrell deeply touched by the elder man s kindness I know without words that I could have from you whatever I needed but it is useless for me to think of going into business with as little knowledge of myself as I have at present The best thing for me is to take whatever work offers itself until I find what I am fitted for or to what I can best adapt myself The next morning found Darrell at an early hour on his way to the mining camp with mister Underwood and mister Britton The ground was white and glistening with frost and the sun not yet far above the horizon shone with a pale cold light but Darrell wrapped in a fur coat of mister Underwood s felt only the exhilarating effect of the thin keen air and as the large double seated carriage drawn by two powerful horses descended the pine clad mountain and passed down one of the principal streets of the little city he looked about him with lively interest Leaving the town behind them they soon began the ascent of a winding canyon After two or three turns to Darrell s surprise every sign of human habitation vanished and only the rocky walls were visible at first low and receding but gradually growing higher and steeper On they went steadily ascending till a turn suddenly brought the distant mountains into closer proximity and mister Britton pointing to a lofty rugged range on Darrell s right said There lies the Great Divide For two hours they wound steadily upward the massive rocks towering on all sides barren grotesque in form but beautiful in coloring dull reds pale greens and lovely blues and purples staining the sombre grays and browns Darrell had grown silent and his companions supposing him absorbed in the grandeur and beauty of the scenery left him to his own reflections while they talked on matters of interest to themselves But to Darrell the surrounding rocks were full of a strange deep significance The colorings and markings in the gray granite were to him what the insignia of the secret orders are to the initiated replete with mystical meaning To him had come the sudden realization that he was in Nature s laboratory and in the hieroglyphics traced on the granite walls he read the symbols of the mysterious alchemy silently and secretly wrought beneath their surface The vastness of the scale of Nature s work the multiplicity of her symbols bewildered him but in his own mind he knew that he still held the key to this mysterious code and the knowledge thrilled him with delight He gazed about him fascinated saying nothing but trembling with joy and with eagerness to put himself to the test and it was with difficulty that he controlled his impatience till the long ride should come to an end At last they left the canyon and followed a steep road winding up the side of a mountain which after an hour s hard climbing brought them to the mining camp As the carriage stopped Darrell was the first to alight springing quickly to the ground and looking eagerly about him At a short distance beyond them the road was terminated by the large milling plant above which the mountain rose abruptly its sides dotted with shaft houses and crossed and recrossed with trestle work almost to the summit A wooden flume clung like a huge serpent to the steep slopes and a tramway descended from near the summit to the mill below At a little distance from the mill were the boarding house and bunk houses while in the foreground near the road was the office building to which the party adjourned after exchanging greetings with mister Hathaway the superintendent who had come out to meet them and to whom Darrell was duly introduced The room they first entered was the superintendent s office Beyond that was a pleasant reception room while in the rear were the private rooms of the superintendent and the assayer who were not expected to share the bunk houses with the miners mister Underwood and the superintendent at once proceeded to business but mister Britton mindful of Darrell s comfort ushered him into the reception room A coal fire was glowing in a small grate a couch three or four comfortable chairs and a few books and magazines contributed to give the room a cosey appearance but the object which instantly riveted Darrell s attention was a large case extending nearly across one side of the room filled with rare mineralogical and geological specimens There were quartz crystals gleaming with lumps of free milling gold curling masses of silver and copper wire direct from the mines gold nuggets of unusual size and brilliancy and specimens of ores from the principal mines not only of that vicinity but of the West Observing Darrell s interest in the contents of the case mister Britton threw open the doors for a closer inspection and began calling his attention to some of the finest specimens but at Darrell s first remarks he paused astonished listened a few moments then stepping to the next room called mister Underwood That gentleman looked somewhat perturbed at the interruption but at a signal from mister Britton followed the latter quietly across the room to where Darrell was standing Here they stood silently listening while Darrell unconscious of their presence went rapidly through the specimens classifying the different ores stating the conditions which had contributed to their individual characteristics giving the approximate value of each and the mode of treatment required for its reduction all after the manner of a student rehearsing to himself a well conned lesson At last catching sight of the astonished faces of his listeners his own lighted with pleasure as he exclaimed joyously I wanted to test myself and see if it would come back to me and it has I believed it would and it has What has come back to you queried mister Underwood too bewildered himself to catch the drift of Darrell s meaning The knowledge of all this Darrell answered indicating the collection with a swift gesture it began to come to me as soon as I saw the rocks on our way up it confused me at first but it is all clear now Take me to your mill mister Underwood I want to see what I can do with the ores there At that moment mister Hathaway entered to summon the party to dinner and seeing Darrell standing by the case his hands filled with specimens he said addressing mister Underwood with a pleasant tone of inquiry mister Darrell is a mining man But mister Underwood was still too confused to answer intelligibly and it was mister Britton who replied as he linked his arm within Darrell s on turning to leave the room mister Darrell is a mineralogist At dinner Darrell found himself too excited to eat so overjoyed was he at the discovery of attainments he had not dreamed he possessed and so eager to put them to every test possible It had been mister Underwood s intention to visit the mines that afternoon but at Darrell s urgent request they went first to the mill Here he found ample scope for his abilities He fairly revelled in the various ores separating assorting and classifying them with the rapidity and accuracy of an expert and at once proceeded to assay some samples taken from a new lead recently struck the report of which had occasioned this particular trip to the camp He worked with a dexterity and skill surprising in one of his years producing the most accurate results to the astonishment and delight of both mister Underwood and mister Britton After an extended inspection of the different departments of the large milling plant he was taken into a small laboratory where the assayer in charge was testing some of the recently discovered ore for the presence of certain metals After watching for a while in silence Darrell said turning to mister Underwood I can give you a quicker and a surer test than that The assayer and himself at once exchanged places and unheeding the many eyes fixed upon him Darrell seated himself before the long table and deftly began operations Not a word broke the silence as by methods wholly new to his spectators he subjected the ore to successive chemical changes until within an incredibly short time the presence of the suspected metals was demonstrated beyond the shadow of a doubt Mineralogist and metallurgist exclaimed mister Britton delightedly as he congratulated Darrell upon his success The short November day had now nearly drawn to a close and after supper the gentlemen adjourned to the office building where they spent an hour or more around the open fire Darrell who was quite wearied with the unusual exertion and excitement of the day retired early the superintendent and assayer had gone out on some business at the mill and mister Underwood and mister Britton were left together No sooner were they by themselves than mister Britton who was walking up and down the room stopped beside his partner as he sat smoking and gazing abstractedly into the fire and laying a hand on his shoulder said Well Dave what do you think After what we ve seen to day can t you make a place over there at the mill for the boy Hang it all answered the other somewhat testily secretly a little jealous of the growing intimacy between his partner and Darrell supposing I can is there any need of your dipping in your oar about it Do you think I need any suggestion from you in the way of befriending him or standing by him No Dave said mister Britton pleasantly dropping into a chair by mister Underwood s side I did not put my question with a view of making any suggestions I know and Darrell knows that he hasn t a better friend than you and because I know this and also because I am a friend to you both I was interested to ask you what you intended doing for him What I intended doing for him and what I probably will actually do for him are two altogether different propositions all on account of his own pig headedness was the rather surly response How s that mister Britton inquired Why confound the fellow I took a liking to him from the first coming here the way he did and after what he did for Harry there was nothing I wouldn t have done for him Then after his sickness when we found his memory had gone back on him and left him helpless as a child in some ways I knew he d stand no show among strangers and my idea was to take him in in Harry s place give him a small interest in the business until he got accustomed to it and then after a while let him in as partner But when I broached the subject to him a week ago or so he wouldn t hear to it said he d rather find some work for which he was adapted and stick to that at a regular salary I told him he was missing a good thing but nothing that I could say would make any difference Well said mister Britton slowly I m not sure but his is the wiser plan You must remember Dave that his stay with us will probably be but temporary Whenever that portion of his brain which is now dormant does awaken you can rest assured he will not remain here long He no doubt realizes this and wishes to be absolutely foot loose ready to leave at short notice And as to the financial side of the question if you give him the place in your mill for which he is eminently fitted it will be fully as remunerative in the long run as the interest in the business which you intended giving him What place in the mill do you refer to mister Underwood asked quickly Oh I m not making any suggestions Dave you don t need them And mister Britton smiled quietly into the fire Go ahead and say your say Jack said the other his own face relaxing into a grim smile that was only a bit of my crankiness and you know me well enough to know it Give him the position of assayer in charge Great Scott and fire Benson who s been there for five years It makes no difference how long he s been there Darrell is a better man every way quicker more accurate more scientific You can put Benson to sorting and weighing ores down at the ore bins After a brief silence mister Britton continued You couldn t find a better man for the place or a better position for the man The work is evidently right in the line of his profession and therefore congenial and even though you should pay him no more salary than Benson that with outside work in the way of assays for neighboring camps will be better than any business interest you would give him short of twelve or eighteen months at least I guess you re right and I ll give him the place but hang it all I did want to put him in Harry s place You and I are getting along in years Jack and it s time we had some young man getting broke to the harness so that after a while he could take the brunt of things and let us old fellows slack up a bit We could not expect that of Darrell said mister Britton He is neither kith nor kin of ours and when once Nature s ties begin to assert themselves in his mind we may find our hold upon him very slight Both men sighed deeply as though the thought had in some way touched an unpleasant chord After a pause mister Britton inquired You have no clue whatever as to Darrell s identity have you mister Underwood shook his head Queerest case I ever saw There wasn t a scrap of paper nor a pen mark to show who he was Parkinson the mine expert who was on the same train said he didn t remember seeing him until Harry introduced him he said he supposed he was some friend of Harry s Since his sickness I ve looked up the conductor on that train and questioned him but all he could remember was that he boarded the train a little this side of Galena and that he had a ticket through from saint Paul You say this Parkinson was a mine expert what was he doing out here He was one of three or four that were here at that time looking up the Ajax for eastern parties In all probability said mister Britton musingly Darrell was here on the same business If that was his business he said nothing about it to me and I would have thought he would under the circumstances I wonder whether we could ascertain from the owners of the Ajax what experts were out here or expected out here at that time mister Underwood smiled grimly Not from the former owners for nobody knows where they are though there are some people quite anxious to know and not from the present owners for they are too busy looking for their predecessors in interest to think of anything else Why has the Ajax really changed owners Did they find any one to buy it Yes a Scotch syndicate bought it They sent over a man one of their own number I believe and authorized to act for them that I guess knew more about sampling liquors than ores The Ajax people worked him accordingly with the result that the mine was sold at the figure named one million half down you know The man rushed back to New York to meet a partner whom he had cabled to come over About ten days later they arrived on the ground and began operations at the Ajax The mill ran for just ten days when they discovered the condition of affairs and shut down and they have been looking for the former owners ever since Both men laughed then relapsed into silence A little later as mister Britton stirred the fire to a brighter glow he said while the tender curves about his mouth deepened I cannot help feeling that the coming to us of this young man whose identity is wrapped in so much mystery has some peculiar significance to each of us I believe that in some way whether for good or ill I cannot tell his life is to be henceforth inseparably linked with our own lives He already holds as you know a place in each of our hearts which no stranger has held before and I have only this to say David old friend that our mutual regard for him our mutual efforts for his well being must never lead to any estrangement between ourselves We have been stanch friends for too many years for any one at this late date to come between us and you must never envy me my little share in the boy s friendship The two men had risen and now stood before the fire with clasped hands I was an old fool to night Jack that was all said mister Underwood rather gruffly I haven t the knack of saying things that you have never had but I m with you all the time On the forenoon of the following day Darrell was shown the underground workings of the various mines not excepting the Bird Mine located almost at the summit of the mountain This was the newest mine in camp but in proportion to its development the best producer of all After an early dinner there was a private meeting in the reception room beyond the office at which were present only mister Underwood mister Britton and Darrell and at which mister Underwood duly tendered to Darrell the position of assayer in charge at the Camp Bird mill which the latter accepted with a frank and manly gratitude which more than ever endeared him to the hearts of his two friends In this little proceeding mister Britton purposely took no part standing before the grate his back towards the others gazing into the fire as though absorbed in his own thoughts When all was over however he congratulated Darrell with a warmth and tenderness which filled both the heart and the eyes of the latter to overflowing That night after their arrival at The Pines as mister Britton and Darrell took their accustomed stroll the latter said mister Britton I feel that I have you to thank for my good fortune of to day You had nothing to say when mister Underwood offered me that position but nevertheless I believe the offer was made at your suggestion It was in reality your kindness not his You are partly right and partly wrong replied mister Britton smiling Never doubt mister Underwood s kindness of heart towards yourself If I had any part in that affair it was only to indicate the channel in which that kindness should flow Together they talked of the strange course of events which had finally brought him and the work for which he was especially adapted together Do you know said mister Britton as they paused on the veranda before entering the house I am no believer in accident I believe that of the so called happenings in our lives each has its appointed time and mission and it is not for us to say which is trivial or which is important until knowing as we are known we look back upon life as God sees it Chapter VIII UNTIL THE DAY BREAK A week later Darrell was duly installed at the mining camp mister Britton had already left called on private business to another part of the State After his departure life at The Pines did not seem the same to Darrell He sorely missed the companionship amounting almost to comradeship notwithstanding the disparity of their years which had existed between them from their first meeting and he was not sorry when the day came for him to exchange the comfort and luxury with which the kindness of mister Underwood and his sister had surrounded him for the rough fare and plain quarters of the mining camp missus Dean when informed of Darrell s position at the camp had most strenuously objected to his going and had immediately stipulated that he was to return to The Pines every Saturday and remain until Monday Of course he s coming home every Saturday and as much oftener as he likes her brother had interposed This is his home and he understands it without any words from us On the morning of his departure he realized as never before the depth of the affection of his host and hostess for himself manifesting itself as it did in silent unobtrusive acts of homely but heartfelt kindness As the storing of Darrell s belongings in the wagon which was to convey him to the camp was about completed missus Dean appeared carrying a large covered basket with snow white linen visible between the gaping edges of the lids This she deposited within the wagon saying as she turned to Darrell There s a few things to last you through the week just so you don t forget how home cooking tastes And at the last moment there was brought from the stables at mister Underwood s orders for Darrell s use in going back and forth between The Pines and the camp a beautiful bay mare which had belonged to Harry Whitcomb and which having sadly missed her young master greeted Darrell with a low whinny muzzling his cheek and nosing his pockets for sugar with the most affectionate familiarity It was a cold bleak morning The ground had frozen after a heavy rain and the wagon jolted roughly over the ruts in the canyon road making slow progress The sky was overcast and straggling snowflakes wandered aimlessly up and down in the still air Darrell from his seat beside the driver turned occasionally to speak to Trix the mare fastened to the rear end of the wagon and daintily picking her way along the rough road Sometimes he hummed a bit of half remembered song but for the most part he was silent While not attempting any definite analysis of his feelings he was distinctly conscious of conflicting emotions He was deeply touched by the kindness of mister Underwood and missus Dean and felt a sort of self condemnation that he was not more responsive to their affection He knew that their home and hearts were alike open to him that he was as welcome as one of their own flesh and blood yet he experienced a sense of relief at having escaped from the unvarying kindliness for which at heart he was profoundly grateful Even late that night in the solitude of his plainly furnished room with the wind moaning outside and the snow tapping with muffled fingers against the window pane he yet exulted in a sense of freedom and happiness hitherto unknown in the brief period which held all he recalled of life The ensuing days and weeks passed pleasantly and swiftly for Darrell He quickly familiarized himself with the work which he had in charge and frequently found leisure when his routine work was done for experiments and tests of his own as well as for outside work which came to him as his skill became known in neighboring camps His evenings were well filled as he had taken up his old studies along the lines of mineralogy and metallurgy pushing ahead into new fields of research and discovery studying by night and experimenting by day Meanwhile the rocky peaks around him seemed beckoning him with their talismanic signs as though silently challenging him to learn the mighty secrets for ages hidden within their breasts and he promised himself that with the return of lengthening days he would start forth a humble learner to sit at the feet of those great teachers of the centuries He had occasional letters from mister Britton cheering inspiring helpful much as his presence had been and in return he wrote freely of his present work and his plans for future work Sometimes when books were closed or the plaintive tones of the violin had died away in silence he would sit for hours pondering the strange problem of his own life watching listening for some sign from out the past but neither ray of light nor wave of sound came to him His physician had told him that some day the past would return and that the intervening months or years as the case might be would then doubtless be in turn forgotten and as he revolved this in his mind he formed a plan which he at once proceeded to put into execution On his return one night from a special trip to Ophir he went to his room with more than usual haste and opening a package in which he seemed greatly interested drew forth what appeared to be a book about eleven by fifteen inches in size bound in flexible morocco and containing some five or six hundred pages The pages were blank however and bound according to an ingenious device which he had planned and given the binder by which they could be removed and replaced at will and if necessary extra pages could be added For some time he stood by the light turning the volume over and over with an expression of mingled pleasure and sadness then removing some of the pages he sat down and prepared to write The new task to which he had set himself was the writing of a complete record day by day of this present life of his beginning with the first glimmerings of memory faint and confused in the earliest days of his convalescence at The Pines He dipped his pen then hesitated how should this strange volume be inscribed Only for a moment then his pen was gliding rapidly over the spotless surface and the first page when laid aside bore the following inscription To one from the outer world whose identity is hidden among the secrets of the past With the hope that when the veil is lifted these pages may assist him in uniting into one perfect whole the strangely disjointed portions of his life they are inscribed by JOHN DARRELL Below was the date and then followed the words Until the day break and the shadows flee away After penning the last words he paused repeating them vainly trying to recall when or where he had heard them They seemed to ring in his ears like a strain of melody wafted from some invisible shore and blending with the minor undertone he caught a note of triumph They had come to him like a voice from out the past but ringing with joyful assurance for the future the assurance that the night however dark must end in a glorious dawning in which no haunting shadow would have an abiding place Chapter IX TWO PORTRAITS The winter proved to be mild and open so that Darrell s weekly visits to The Pines were made with almost unbroken regularity and to his surprise he discovered as the months slipped away that instead of a mere obligation which he felt bound to perform they were becoming a source of pleasure After a week of unremitting toil and study and contact with the rough edges of human nature there was something unspeakably restful in the atmosphere of that quiet home something soothing in the silent steadfast affection the depth of which he was only beginning to fathom One Saturday evening in the latter part of April Darrell was as usual descending the canyon road on his way to The Pines For weeks the winter had lingered as though loath to leave and Darrell absorbed in work and study had gone his way hiding his loneliness and suffering so deeply as to be ofttimes forgotten even by himself and at all times unsuspected by those about him Then in one night had come the warm breath of the west winds and within a few hours the earth was transformed as though by magic and the restless longing within his breast awoke with tenfold intensity As he rode along he was astounded at the changes wrought in one week From the southern slopes of the mountains the snow had almost disappeared and the sunny exposures of the ranges were fast brightening into vivid green The mountain streams had burst their icy fetters and augmented by the melting snows were roaring tumultuously down their channels tumbling and plunging over rocky ledges in sheets of shimmering silver or foaming cascades then their mad frolic ended flowing peacefully through distant valleys onward to the rivers ever chanting the song which would one day blend in the great ocean harmonies The frail flowers clinging to the rocks and smiling fearlessly up into the face of the sun the silvery sheen of the willows along the distant water courses the softened outlines and pale green of budding cottonwoods in the valleys far below all told of the newly released life currents bounding through the veins of every living thing From the lower part of the canyon the wild ecstatic song of a robin came to him on the evening breeze and in the slanting sunbeams myriads of tiny midges held high carnival The whole earth seemed pulsating with new life and tree and flower bird and insect were filled anew with the unspeakable joy of living Amid this universal baptism of life what wonder that he felt his own pulse quicken and the warm life blood leaping swiftly within his veins His heart but throbbed in unison with the great heart of Nature but its very beating stifled him as the sense of his own restrictions came back upon him with crushing weight For one moment he paused his spirit struggling wildly against the bars imprisoning it then with a look towards the skies of dumb appealing anguish he rode onward his head bowed his heart sick with unutterable longing Arriving at The Pines he received the usual welcome but neither its undemonstrative affection nor the restful quiet of the old home could soothe or satisfy him that night But if his host and hostess noted the gloom on his face or his restless manner they made no comments and asked no questions On going upstairs at a late hour he went across the hall to the libraries in search of a book with which to pass away the time as he was unable to sleep He had no definite book in mind and wandered aimlessly through both rooms reading titles in an abstracted manner until he came at last face to face with the picture of Kate Underwood He had seen it many times without especially observing it but in his present mood it appealed to him as never before The dark eyes seemed fixed upon his face with a look of entreaty from which he could not escape and drawing a chair in front of the easel he sat down and became absorbed in a study of the picture Heretofore he had considered it merely the portrait of a very young and somewhat plain girl Now he was surprised to find that the more it was studied in detail the more favorable was the impression produced Though childish and immature there was not a weak line in the face The nose and mouth were especially fine the former denoting distinct individuality the latter marked strength and sweetness of character and while the upper part of the face indicated keen perceptions and quick sympathies the general contour showed a nature strong either to do or to endure The eyes were large and beautiful but it was not their beauty which riveted Darrell s attention it was their look of wistful appeal of unsatisfied longing which led him at last to murmur while his eyes moistened You dear child How is it that in your short life surrounded by all that love can provide you have come to know such heart hunger as that Long after he had returned to his room those eyes still haunted him nor could he banish the conviction that some time somewhere in that young life there had been an unfilled void which in some degree however slight corresponded to the blank emptiness of his own The next morning Darrell attended church with missus Dean The latter was a strict church woman and Darrell by way of showing equal courtesy to host and hostess usually accompanied her in the morning devoting the afternoon to mister Underwood After lunch he and mister Underwood seated themselves in one of the sunny bay windows for their customary chat missus Dean having gone to her room for the afternoon nap which was as much a part of her Sunday programme as the morning sermon For a while they talked of the latest developments at the mines but mister Underwood seemed preoccupied gazing out of the window and frowning heavily At last after a long silence he said slowly I expect we re going to have trouble at the camp this season How is that Darrell asked quickly in a tone of surprise Oh it s some of this union business the other answered with a gesture of impatience and about the most foolish proposition I ever heard of at that But he added decidedly they know my position they know they ll get no quarter from me I ve steered clear of them so far they ve let me alone and I ve let them alone but when it comes to a parcel of union bosses undertaking to run my business or make terms to me I ll fight em to a finish and they know it Darrell watching the face of the speaker saw the lines about his mouth harden and his lips settle into a grim smile that boded no good to his opponents What do they want higher wages or shorter hours he inquired Neither said mister Underwood shortly as he re lighted his pipe After a few puffs he continued As I said before it s the most foolish proposition I ever heard of You see there s five or six camps all told in the neighborhood of our camp up there One or two of the lot like the Buckeye group for instance are run by men that haven t much capital and I suppose are working as economically as they can Anyhow there s been some kicking over there among the miners about the grub and the upshot of the whole thing is that the union has taken the matter in hand and is going to open a union boarding house and take in the men from all the camps at six bits a day for each man instead of the regular rate of a dollar a day charged by the mining companies The scale of wages to remain the same I suppose said Darrell so that means a gain to each man of twenty five cents a day Exactly said mister Underwood It means a gain of two bits a day to each man it means loss and inconvenience to the companies and it means a big pile of money in the pockets of the bosses who are running the thing There are not many of the owners up there that can stand that sort of thing said Darrell reflectively Of course they can t stand it and they won t stand it if they ve got any backbone Take Dwight and Huntley they ve been to heavy expense in enlarging their mill and have just put up a new boarding house and they re in debt they can t afford to have all that work and expenditure for nothing Now with us the loss wouldn t be so great as with the others for we don t make so much out of our boarding house My motto has always been Live and let live and I give my men a good table just what I d want for myself if I were in their places It isn t the financial part that troubles me What I object to is this I won t have my men tramping three quarters of a mile for meals that won t be as good as they can get right on their own grounds more than that I ve got a good likely set of men and I won t have them demoralized by herding them in with the tough gangs from those other camps and above all and once for all here mister Underwood s tones became excited as he exclaimed with an oath I ve always been capable of running my own business and I ll run it yet and no damned union boss will ever run it for me How do the men feel about it Have you talked with them Darrell inquired There isn t one of them that s dissatisfied or would leave of his own free will mister Underwood replied but I don t suppose they would dare to stand out against the bosses Why man if the workingmen only knew it they are ten times worse slaves to the union bosses than ever they were to corporations They have to pay over their wages to let those fellows live like nabobs they have to come and go at their beck and call and throw up good positions and live in enforced idleness because of some other fellows grievances they don t dare express an opinion or say their souls are their own Humph mister Underwood said Darrell who had been smilingly listening to the other s tirade what will you do if this comes to a strike Strike he exclaimed in tones of scathing contempt Strike I ll strike too and they ll find I can strike just as hard as they can and a little harder Will you close down The shrewd face grew a bit shrewder If it s necessary to close down he remarked evasively I ll close down I guess I can stand it as long as they can Those mines have lain there in those rocks idle for centuries for aught that I know twon t hurt em to lie idle a few weeks or months now nobody ll run off with em I guess Darrell laughed aloud Well one thing is certain mister Underwood I for one wouldn t want to quarrel with you mister Underwood slowly shook his head You d better not try it my boy you d better not When do you expect this trouble to come to a head Darrell asked at length Some time in the early part of July probably they expect to get their arrangements completed by that time A long silence followed missus Dean came softly into the room and took her accustomed seat and as mister Underwood made it a point never to talk of business matters in his sister s presence nothing more was said regarding the prospective disturbance at the mines After dinner the beauty of the sunset brought them out upon the veranda The air was warm and fragrant with the breath of spring The buds were swelling on the lilacs near the house and out on the lawn beyond the driveway millions of tiny spears of living green trembled in the light breeze David said missus Dean presently have you shown mister Darrell that picture of Katherine that came yesterday I declare No I had forgotten it mister Underwood exclaimed It s well for you she isn t here to hear you say that missus Dean remarked smiling Puss knows her old father well enough to know he wouldn t forget her very long Bring the picture out Marcia Darrell heard missus Dean approaching and turned with the glory of the sunset in his eyes Don t you want to see Katherine s new picture she inquired Her words instantly recalled the portrait he had studied the preceding night and with that in his mind he took the picture she handed him and silently compared the two Ah the beauty of the spring everywhere confronting him was in that face also the joy of a life as yet pure untainted and untrammelled It was like looking into the faces of the spring flowers which reflect only the sunshine the purity and the sweetness of earth There was a touch of womanly dignity too in the poise of the head but the beautiful eyes though lighted with the faint dawn of coming womanhood were the same as those that had appealed to him the night before with their wistful longing It is a fine portrait but as I do not remember her I cannot judge whether it is like herself or not he said handing the picture to mister Underwood who seemed almost to devour it with his eyes though he spoke no word and not a muscle moved in his stern immobile face She is getting to be such a young lady remarked missus Dean that I expect when she comes home we will feel as though she had grown away from us all She will never do that Marcia never said mister Underwood brusquely as he abruptly left the group and went into the house There was a moment s silence then missus Dean said in a low tone She is getting to look just like her mother I haven t seen David so affected since his wife died as he was when that picture came yesterday Darrell bowed silently in token that he understood She was a lovely woman but she was very different from any of our folks she added with a sigh and I guess Katherine is going to be just like her When is Miss Underwood expected home Darrell inquired About the last of June was the reply Long after the sun had set Darrell paced up and down the veranda pausing at intervals to gaze with unseeing eyes out over the peaceful scene below him his only companions his own troubled thoughts The young moon was shining and in its pale radiance his set face gleamed white like marble Like and yet unlike it was to the face of the sleeper journeying westward on that summer afternoon eight months before Experience the mighty sculptor was doing his work and doing it well only a few lines as yet here and there and the face was already stronger finer But it was the face of one hardened by his own sufferings not softened by the sufferings of others The sculptor s work was as yet only begun Chapter X THE COMMUNION OF TWO SOULS Gradually the springtide crept upward into the heart of the mountains quickening the pulses of the rocks themselves until even the mosses and lichens slumbering at their feet awakened to renewed life Bits of green appeared wherever a grass root could push its way through the rocky soil and fragile wild flowers gleamed starlike here and there fed by tiny rivulets which trickled from slowly melting snows on the summits far above With the earliest warm days Darrell had started forth to explore the surrounding mountains eager to learn the secrets which they seemed ever challenging him to discover New conditions confronted him sometimes baffling him but always inciting to renewed effort His enthusiasm was so aroused that often when his day s work was done taking a light lunch with him he pursued his studies while the daylight lasted walking back in the long twilight and in the solitude of his room making full notes of the results of that day s research before retiring for the night Returning one evening from one of these expeditions he saw pacing back and forth before the office building a figure which he at once recognized as that of mister Britton Instantly all thought of work or weariness was forgotten and he hastened forward while mister Britton catching sight of Darrell rapidly approaching turned and came down the road to meet him A thousand welcomes Darrell cried as soon as they were within speaking distance say but this is glorious to see you here How long have I kept you waiting A few hours but that does not matter it does us good to have to stop and call a halt on ourselves once in a while How are you my son And as the two grasped hands the elder man looked searchingly through the gathering dusk into the face of the younger Even in the dim twilight Darrell could feel that penetrating glance reading his inmost soul I am well and doing well he answered my physical health is perfect as for the rest your coming is the very best thing that could have happened Are you alone he asked eagerly or did mister Underwood come with you I came alone mister Britton replied with quiet emphasis linking his arm within Darrell s as they ascended the road together How long have you been in town But two days I am on my way to the coast and only stopped off for a few days I shall spend to morrow with you go back with you Saturday to The Pines and go on my way Monday Having made his guest as comfortable as possible in his own room Darrell laid aside his working paraphernalia his hammer and bag of rock specimens and donning a house coat and pair of slippers seated himself near mister Britton all the time conscious of the close but kindly scrutiny with which the latter was regarding him This is delightful he exclaimed but it is past my comprehension how mister Underwood ever let you slip off alone mister Britton looked amused I told him I was coming to see you and I think he intended coming with me till he heard me order my saddle horse for the trip I think that settled the matter I believe there can be no perfect interchange of confidence except between two The presence of a third party even though a mutual friend breaks the magnetic circuit and weakens the current of sympathy Our interviews are necessarily rare and I want to make the most of them therefore I would come to you alone or not at all Yes Darrell replied your visits are so rare that every moment is precious to me and think of the hours I lost by my absence to day Do you court Dame Nature so assiduously every day subsisting on cold lunches and tramping the mountains till nightfall Not every day but as often as possible Darrell replied smiling And I suppose if I were not here you would now be burrowing into that pile over there mister Britton said glancing significantly towards the table covered to a considerable depth with books of reference note books writing pads and sheets of closely written manuscript Let me show you what I am doing it will take but a moment said Darrell springing to his feet He drew forth several sets of extensive notes on researches and experiments he was making along various lines of study in which mister Britton became at once deeply interested You have a good thing here stick to it he said at length looking up from the perusal of Darrell s geological notes gathered from his studies of the rock formations in that vicinity You have a fine field in which to pursue this branch and with the knowledge you already have on this subject and the discoveries you are likely to make you may be able to make some very valuable contributions to the science one of these days That is just what I hope to do exclaimed Darrell eagerly just what I am studying for day and night But you must use moderation said mister Britton smiling at the younger man s enthusiasm you are young you have years before you in which to do this work and this constant study night and day added to your regular routine work is too much for you You are looking fagged already If I am it is not the work that is fagging me Darrell replied quickly his tones becoming excited mister Britton I must work I must accomplish all I can for two reasons You say I have years before me in which to do this work God knows I hope I haven t got to work years like this only half alive you might say and when the change comes if it ever does you know of course I cannot and would not remain here I understand you would not remain here said mister Britton slowly and laying his hand soothingly on the arm of his agitated companion but you can readily see that not only your education but your natural trend of thought is along these lines therefore when you are fully restored to your normal self you will be the more not the less interested in these things and I predict that no matter when the time comes for you to leave you will after a while return to continue this same line of work amid the same surroundings but we hope under far happier conditions Darrell shook his head slowly It does not seem to me that I would ever wish to return to a place where I had suffered as I have here mister Britton smiled one of his slow sad sweet smiles that Darrell loved to watch that seemed to dawn in his eyes and gradually to spread until every feature was irradiated with a tender beneficent light I once thought as you do he said gently but after years of wandering I find that the place most sacred to me now is that hallowed by the bitterest agony of my life Without replying Darrell unconsciously drew nearer to his friend and a brief silence followed broken by mister Britton who inquired in a lighter tone What is the other reason for your constant application to your work You said there were two Darrell bowed his head upon his hands as he answered in a low despairing tone To stop thinking thinking thinking it will drive me mad I have been there my boy I know mister Britton responded then after a pause he continued Something in the tenor of your last letter made me anxious to come to you I thought I detected something of the old restlessness Has the coming of spring quickening the life forces all around you stirred the life currents in your own veins till your spirit is again tugging at its fetters in its struggles for release With a startled movement Darrell raised his head meeting the clear eyes fixed upon him How could you know he demanded Because as Emerson says the heart in thee is the heart of all There are few hearts whose pulses are not stirred by the magic influence of the springtide and under its potent spell I knew you would feel your present limitations even more keenly than ever before Thank God you understand Darrell exclaimed then continued passionately The last three weeks have been torture to me if I but allowed myself one moment s thought Wherever I look I see life life perfect and complete in all its myriad forms the life that is denied to me This is not living this existence of mine with brain shackled fettered in many ways helpless as a child knowing less than a child and not even mercifully wrapped in oblivion but compelled to feel the constant goading and galling of the fetters to be reminded of them at every turn My God if it were not for constant work and study I would go mad In the silence which followed Darrell s mind reverted to that autumn day on which he had first met John Britton and confided to him his trouble and now as then he was soothed and strengthened by the presence beside him by the magnetism of that touch although no word was spoken As he reviewed their friendship of the past months he became conscious for the first time of its one sidedness He had often unburdened himself to his friend confiding to him his griefs and receiving in turn sympathy and counsel but of the great unknown sorrow that had wrought such havoc in his own life what word had John Britton ever spoken As Darrell recalled the bearing of his friend through all their acquaintance and his silence regarding his own sufferings his eyes grew dim The man at his side seemed in the light of that revelation stronger grander nobler than ever before not unlike to the giant peaks whose hoary heads then loomed darkly against the starlit sky calm silent majestic giving no token of the throes of agony which ages agone had rent them asunder except in the mystic symbols graven on their furrowed brows In that light his own complaints seemed puerile At that moment Darrell was conscious of a new fortitude born within his soul a new purpose henceforth to dominate his life A heavy sigh from mister Britton broke the silence I know the fetters are galling he said but have patience and hope for at the time appointed the shackles will be loosened the fetters broken Darrell faced his companion a new light in his eyes but recently so dark with despair as he asked earnestly and tenderly Dearest and best of friends is there no time appointed for the lifting of the burden borne so nobly and uncomplainingly lo these many years With a grave sweet smile the elder man shook his head and rising began pacing up and down the room There are some burdens my son that time cannot lift they can only be laid down at the gates of eternity With a strange choking sensation in his throat Darrell rose and going to the window stood looking out at the dim outlines of the neighboring peaks Their vast solitude no longer oppressed him as at the first it calmed and soothed him in his restless moods and to night those grim monarchs dwelling in silent fellowship seemed to him the embodiment of peace and rest After a time mister Britton paused beside him and throwing his arm about his shoulders asked What are your thoughts my son Only a whim a fancy that has taken possession of me the last few days since my wanderings among the mountains he answered lightly a longing to bury myself in some sort of a retreat on one of these old peaks and devote myself to study And live a hermit s life mister Britton queried with a peculiar smile For a while yes Darrell replied more seriously until I have learned to fight these battles out by myself and to conquer myself There are battles said the other speaking thoughtfully which are waged best in solitude but self is conquered only by association with one s fellows Solitude breeds selfishness mister Britton had resumed his pacing up and down but a few moments later as he approached Darrell the latter turned suddenly confronting him My dear friend he said you have been everything to me you have done everything for me I ask you to do one thing more forgive and answer this question How have you conquered The look of pain that crossed his companion s face filled Darrell with regret for what he had said but before he could speak again mister Britton replied gently with his old smile I doubt whether I have yet wholly conquered but whatever victory is mine I have won not in solitude and seclusion but in association with the sorrowing the suffering the sinning and in sharing their burdens I found rest from my own He paused a moment then continued his glowing eyes holding Darrell as though under a spell I know not why but since our first meeting you have given me a new interest a new joy in life I have been drawn to you and I have loved you as I thought never again to love any human being and some day I will tell you what I have told no other human being the story of my life On Saturday mister Britton and Darrell returned to The Pines The increasing intimacy between them was evident even there For the last day or so mister Britton had fallen into the habit of addressing Darrell by his Christian name much to the latter s delight For this missus Dean laughingly called him to account compelling mister Britton to come to his own defence John he exclaimed of course I ll call him John It seems wonderfully pleasant to me I ve always wanted a namesake and I can consider him one A namesake ejaculated missus Dean smiling broadly I wonder if there s a poor family or one that s seen trouble of any kind anywhere around here that hasn t a John Britton among its children I should think you had namesakes enough now One might possibly like to have one of his own selection he replied dryly As Darrell took leave of mister Britton the following Monday morning the latter said By the way John whenever you are ready to enter upon that hermit life let me know I ll provide the hermitage Are you joking Darrell queried unable to catch his meaning Never more serious in my life he replied with such unusual gravity that Darrell forbore to question further Chapter XI IMPENDING TROUBLE The five or six weeks following mister Britton s visit passed so swiftly that Darrell was scarcely conscious of their flight His work at the mill which had been increased by valuable strikes recently made in the mines in addition to considerable outside work in the way of attests and assays had left him little time for study or experiment For nearly three weeks he had not left the mining camp the last two Saturdays having found him too weary with the preceding week s work to undertake the long ride to Ophir During this time mister Underwood had been a frequent visitor at the camp led not only by his interest in the mining developments but also by his curiosity regarding the progress made by the union in the construction of its boarding house and also to watch the effect on his own employees Entering the laboratory one day after one of his rounds of the camp he stood for some time silently watching Darrell at his work In case of a shut down here he said at length speaking abruptly how would you like a clerical position in my office down there at Ophir book keeping or something of the sort just temporarily you know Darrell looked up from his work in surprise Do you regard a shut down as imminent he inquired smiling Well yes there s no half way measures with me No man that works for me will go off the grounds for his meals But that isn t answering my question Darrell s face grew serious You forget mister Underwood that until I am put to the test I have no means of knowing whether or not I can do the work you wish done By George I never once thought of that mister Underwood exclaimed somewhat embarrassed adding hastily but then I didn t mean book keeping in particular but clerical work generally copying instruments looking up records and so on You see it s like this he continued seating himself near Darrell I m thinking of taking in a partner not in this mining business it has nothing to do with that but just in my mortgage loan business down there and in case I do we ll need two or three additional clerks and book keepers and I thought you might like to come in just temporarily until we resume operations here Of course the salary wouldn t be so very much but I thought it might be better than nothing to bridge over How long do you expect to be closed down here mister Underwood Until the men come to their senses or we find others to take their places the elder man answered decidedly it may be six weeks or it may be six months I was talking with Dwight from the Buckeye Camp this morning He says they ve been to too much expense to put up with the proposition for a moment they simply can t stand it and won t they ll shut down and pull out first I don t believe that mine is paying very well anyway mister Underwood said Darrell slowly if this were a question of accommodation to yourself of coming into your office and helping you out personally I would gladly do it salary would be no object but to take a merely clerical position for an indefinite time when I have a good lucrative profession does not seem to me a very wise policy There must be plenty of assaying to be done in Ophir why couldn t I temporarily open an office there I guess there s no reason why you couldn t if you want to mister Underwood replied evidently disappointed by Darrell s reply and eying him sharply and if you want to open up an office of your own there s plenty of room for you in our building You know the building was formerly occupied by one of Ophir s wildcat banks that collapsed in the general crash six years ago and there s a fine lot of private offices in the rear opening on the side street one of those rooms fitted up would be just the place for you Much obliged said Darrell smiling we ll see about it if the time comes that I need it Possibly your prospective partner will have use for all the private offices I guess I ll have some say about that mister Underwood returned gruffly then after a short pause he continued I haven t fully decided about this partnership business I talked it over with Jack when he was here but he didn t seem to favor the idea told me that at my age I had better let well enough alone I told him that I didn t see what my age had to do with it that I was capable of looking after my own interests partner or no partner but that I d no objection to having some one else take the brunt of the work while I looked on Is the man a stranger or an acquaintance Darrell inquired I m not personally acquainted with him but he s not exactly a stranger for he s lived in Ophir off and on for the last five years His name is Walcott He says his father is an Englishman and very wealthy he himself I should judge has some Spanish blood in his veins He spends part of his time in Texas where he has heavy cattle interests in fact has been there for the greater part of the past year He wants to go into the mortgage loan business and offers to put in seventy five thousand and give his personal attention to the business for thirty three and a third per cent of the profits What has been his business in Ophir all these years Life insurance mostly I believe had two offices one in Ophir and one at Galena and has also done some private loan business What sort of a reputation has he First rate I ve made a number of inquiries about him in both places and nobody has a word to say against him very quiet minds his own business a man of few words just about my sort of a man I should judge mister Underwood concluded as he rose from his chair Well mister Underwood said Darrell whatever arrangements you decide to make I wish you success No more than I do you my boy in anything your pig headedness leads you into mister Underwood replied brusquely but with a humorous twinkle in his eyes Confound you he added I d help you if you d give me a chance but maybe it s best to let you gang your ain gait And he walked out of the room before Darrell could reply A moment later he looked in at the door By the way if you re not at The Pines by five o clock sharp next Saturday afternoon Marcia says she s going to send an officer up here after you with a writ of habeas corpus or something of the sort All right I ll be there Darrell laughed You ll find the old place a bit brighter than you ve seen it yet for we had a letter from Puss this morning that she ll be home to morrow With the last words the door closed and Darrell was left alone with his thoughts to which however he could then give little time But when the day s work was done he went for a stroll and seating himself upon a large rock carefully reviewed the situation Hitherto he had given little thought to the impending trouble at the camp supposing it would affect himself but slightly but he now realized that a suspension of operations there would mean an entire change in his mode of living The prospective change weighed on his sensitive spirits like an incubus Even The Pines he dismally reflected would no longer seem the same quiet homelike retreat since it was to be invaded and dominated by a youthful presence between whom and himself there would probably be little congeniality But finally telling himself that these reflections were childish he rose as the last sunset rays were sinking behind the western ranges and the rosy flush on the summits was fading and walking swiftly to his room resolutely buried himself in his studies Chapter XII NEW LIFE IN THE OLD HOME On the following Saturday as Darrell ascended the long driveway leading to The Pines he was startled at the transformation which the place had undergone since last he was there The rolling lawn seemed carpeted with green velvet enlivened here and there with groups of beautiful foliage plants Fountains were playing in the sunlight their glistening spray tinted with rainbow lights Flowers bloomed in profusion their colors set off by the gray background of the stone walls of the house The syringas by the bay windows were bent to the ground with their burden of snowy blossoms whose fragrance mingled with that of the June roses greeted him as he approached He forgot his three weeks absence and the rapid growth in that high altitude the change seemed simply magical Then as he caught a glimpse through the pines of a slender girlish figure dressed in white darting hither and thither he wondered no longer it was but the fit accompaniment of the young joyous life which had come to the old place As he came out into the open he saw a young girl romping up and down before the house with a fine Scotch collie and he could not restrain a smile as he recalled missus Dean s oft repeated declaration that there was one thing she would never tolerate and that was a dog or a cat about the house She had not yet seen him but when she did the frolic ceased and she started towards the house Then suddenly she stopped as though she recognized some one or something and stood awaiting his approach her lips parted in a smile two small shapely hands shading her eyes from the sun As he came nearer he had time to note the lithe supple figure just rounding into the graceful outlines of womanhood the full smiling lips the flushed cheeks and the glint of gold in her brown hair and the light the beauty the fragrance surrounding her seemed an appropriate setting to the picture She was a part of the scene Darrell of course had no knowledge of his own age but at that moment he felt very remote from the embodiment of youth before him he seemed to himself to have been suddenly relegated to the background among the elder members of the family The collie had been standing beside his mistress with his head on one side regarding Darrell with a sharp inquisitive look and he now broke the silence which threatened to prove rather embarrassing with a short bark Hush Duke said the girl in a low tone then as Darrell dismounted she came swiftly towards him extending her hand This is mister Darrell I know she said speaking quite rapidly in a clear musical voice without a shade of affectation and you probably know who I am so we will need no introduction Yes Miss Underwood said Darrell smiling into the beautiful brown eyes I would have recognized you anywhere from your picture And you have Trix haven t you she exclaimed turning to caress the mare Dear old Trix Just let her go mister Darrell she will go to the stables of her own accord and Bennett will take care of her that was the way Harry taught her Go find Bennett Trix They watched Trix follow the driveway and disappear around the corner then both turned towards the house Auntie is out just now said the girl she had to go down town but I am expecting her back every minute Will you go into the house mister Darrell or do you prefer a seat on the veranda The veranda looks inviting suppose we sit here Darrell suggested They had reached the steps leading to the entrance On the top step the collie had seated himself and was now awaiting their approach with the air of one expecting due recognition mister Darrell said the young girl with a merry little laugh allow me to present you to His Highness the Duke of Argyle The collie gave his head a slight backward toss and with great dignity extended his right paw to Darrell which the latter instantly entering into the spirit of the joke took saying with much gravity I am pleased to meet His Highness The girl s brown eyes danced with enjoyment You have made a friend of him for life now she said as they seated themselves Duke stationing himself at her side in such a manner as to show his snow white vest and great double ruff to the best possible advantage He is a very aristocratic dog and if any one fails to show him what he considers proper respect he is greatly affronted He certainly is a royal looking fellow said Darrell but I cannot imagine how you ever gained missus Dean s consent to his presence here You must possess even more than the ordinary powers of feminine persuasion Aunt Marcia laughed the girl oh well you see it was a case of love me love my dog Wherever I go Duke must go so auntie had to submit to the inevitable Darrell found the situation far less embarrassing than he had expected His young companion with keen womanly intuition had divined something of his feeling and tactfully avoiding any allusion to their previous meeting of which he had no recollection kept the conversation on subjects within the brief span of his memory She seemed altogether unconscious of the peculiar conditions surrounding himself and the brown eyes meeting his own so frankly had in their depths nothing of the curiosity or the pity he had so often encountered and had grown to dread She appeared so childlike and unaffected and her joyous rippling laughter proved so contagious that unconsciously the extra years which a few moments before seemed to have been added to his life dropped away the grave tense lines of his face relaxed and before he was aware he was laughing heartily at the account of some school girl escapade or at some tricks performed by Duke for his especial entertainment In the midst of their merriment they heard the sound of hoof beats and turning saw the family carriage approaching containing both mister Underwood and his sister You two children seem to be enjoying yourselves was mister Underwood s comment as the carriage stopped Darrell sprang to missus Dean s assistance as she alighted while Kate Underwood ran down the steps to meet her father Both greeted Darrell warmly but missus Dean retained his hand a moment as she looked at him with genuine motherly interest I m glad the truant has returned she said with her quiet smile I only hope it seems as good to you to come home as it does to us to have you here Darrell was touched by her unusual kindness You can rest assured that it does mother he said earnestly He was astonished at the effect of his words her face flushed her lips trembled and as she passed on into the house her eyes glistened with tears Darrell looked about him in bewilderment What have I said he questioned how did I wound her feelings She lost a son years ago and she s never got over it mister Underwood explained briefly You did not hurt her feelings she was pleased Kate hastened to reassure him but did she never speak to you about it Never Darrell replied Well that is not to be wondered at for she seldom alludes to it He died years ago before I can remember but she always grieves for him that was the reason she added reflectively half to herself that she always loved Harry better than she did me Better than you you jealous little Puss said her father pinching her cheek don t you have love enough I d like to know I can never have too much you know papa she answered very seriously and Darrell watching saw in the brown eyes for the first time the wistful look he had seen in the two portraits She soon followed her aunt but her father and Darrell remained outside talking of business matters until summoned to dinner On entering the house Darrell saw on every hand evidences of the young life in the old home There was just a pleasant touch of disorder in the rooms he had always seen kept with such precision here a bit of unfinished embroidery there a book open face down just where the fair reader had left it the piano was open and sheets of music lay scattered over it From every side came the fragrance of flowers and in the usually sombre dining room Darrell noted the fireplace nearly concealed by palms and potted plants the chandelier trimmed with trailing vines the epergne of roses and ferns on the table and the tiny boutonnieres at his plate and mister Underwood s With a smile of thanks at the happy young face opposite he appropriated the one intended for himself but mister Underwood picking up the one beside his plate sat twirling it in his fingers with a look of mock perplexity Puss has introduced so many of her folderols I haven t got used to them yet he said How is this to be taken before eating or after he inquired looking at her from under heavy frowning brows To be taken Oh papa she ejaculated why don t you put it on as mister Darrell has his Here I ll fix it for you With an air of resignation he waited while she fastened the flowers in the lapel of his coat giving the latter an approving little pat as she finished There she exclaimed you ought to see how nice you look H m I m glad to hear it he grunted I feel like a prize steer at a county fair In the laughter which followed Kate joined as merrily as the rest and no one but Darrell observed the deepening flush on her cheek or heard the tremulous sigh when the laughter was ended After dinner they adjourned to the large sitting room mister Underwood with his pipe missus Dean with her knitting and Darrell while conversing with the former watched with a new interest the latter s placid face wondering at the depth of feeling concealed beneath that calm exterior As the twilight deepened and conversation began to flag there came from the piano a few sweet chords followed by one of Chopin s dreamy nocturnes mister Underwood began to doze in his chair and Darrell sat silent his eyes closed his whole soul given up to the spell of the music Unconscious of the pleasure she was giving Kate played till the room was veiled in darkness then going to the fireplace she lighted the fire already laid for the nights were still somewhat chilly and sat down on a low seat before the fire while Duke came and lay at her feet It was a pretty picture the young girl in white her eyes fixed dreamily on the glowing embers the firelight dancing over her form and face and lighting up her hair with gleams of gold the dog at her feet his head thrown proudly back and his eyes fastened on her face with a look of loyal devotion seldom seen even in human eyes Happening to glance in mister Underwood s direction Darrell saw pride pleasure and pain struggling for the mastery in the father s face as he watched the picture in the firelight Pain won and with a sudden gesture of impatience he covered his eyes with his hand as though to shut out the scene It was but a little thing but taken in connection with the incident before dinner it appealed to Darrell showing as it did the silent stoical manner in which these people bore their grief missus Dean s quiet voice interrupted his musings and broke the spell which the music seemed to have thrown around them You will have some one now Katherine to accompany you on the violin as you have always wanted mister Darrell is a fine violinist Kate was instantly all animation Oh that will be delightful mister Darrell she exclaimed eagerly there is nothing I enjoy so much as a violin accompaniment it adds so much expression to the music I think a piano alone is so unsympathetic you can t get any feeling out of it I m afraid Miss Underwood I will prove a disappointment to you Darrell replied I have never yet attempted any new music or even to play by note and don t know what success I would have if any So far I have only played what drifts to me some way I don t know how from out of the past The unconscious sadness in his voice stirred the depths of Kate s tender heart Oh that is too bad she exclaimed quickly thinking not of her own disappointment but of his trouble of which she had unwittingly reminded him then she added gently almost timidly But you will at any rate let me hear you play won t you Certainly if it will give you any pleasure he replied with a slight smile Very well then we will arrange it this way she continued her cheerful manner restored you will play your music and if I am familiar with it I will accompany you on the piano I will get out Harry s violin to morrow and while auntie is taking her nap and papa is engaged we will see what we can accomplish in a musical way Before Darrell could reply mister Underwood who had started from his revery demanded What engagement are you talking about you chatterbox I can t say papa she replied playfully seating herself on the arm of his chair I only know that when I asked your company for a walk to morrow afternoon you pleaded a very important engagement Now how is that she asked archly have you an engagement really or didn t you care for my society Why yes to be sure it had escaped my mind for the moment her father answered rather vaguely she thought then looking at Darrell he said Walcott is coming to morrow for my final decision in that matter Darrell bowed in token that he understood but did not feel at liberty to inquire whether the decision was to be favorable to mister Walcott or otherwise Kate glanced quickly from one to the other but before she could speak her father continued I rather think if he consents to two or three conditions which I shall insist upon that my answer will be in the affirmative I thought that quite probable from your conversation the other day Darrell replied See here papa Kate exclaimed mischievously you needn t talk over my head You used to do so when I was little but you can t any longer you know Who is this Walcott and what is this important decision about mister Underwood who did not believe in taking what he called the women folks into his confidence regarding business affairs looked quizzically into the laughing face beside him Didn t I hear you arranging some sort of a musical programme with mister Darrell he inquired Yes what has that to do with your engagement she queried Nothing whatever only you carry out your engagement and I will mine and we ll compare notes afterwards For an instant her face sobered then catching sight of her father s eyes twinkling under their beetling brows she laughingly withdrew from his side saying That s all very well you can score one this time papa but don t you think we won t come out pretty near even in the end Upon learning from Darrell that the violin she expected him to use was in his room at the mining camp she then proposed a stroll to the summit of the pine clad mountain for the following afternoon and having secured his promise that he would bring the violin with him on his next visit she waltzed gayly across the floor turned on the light and seating herself at the piano soon had the room ringing with music and laughter while she sang a number of college songs To Darrell she seemed more child than woman and he was constantly impressed with her unlikeness to her father or aunt She seemed to have absolutely none of their self repression Warm hearted sympathetic and demonstrative every shade of feeling betrayed itself in her sensitive mobile face and in the brown eyes one moment pensive and wistful the next luminous with sympathy or dancing with merriment As Darrell took leave of missus Dean that night he said looking frankly into her calm kindly face I am very sorry if I wounded your feelings this afternoon it was wholly unintentional I assure you You did not in the least she answered it is so long since I have been called by that name it took me by surprise but it sounded very pleasant to me My boy if he had lived would have been just about your age It seemed pleasant to me to call you mother said Darrell it made me feel less like an outsider You can call me so as often as you wish you are no outsider here we consider you one of ourselves she responded with more warmth in her tones than he had ever heard before The following morning Darrell accompanied the ladies to church After lunch he lounged for an hour or more in one of the hammocks on the veranda listening alternately to mister Underwood s comments as he leisurely smoked his pipe and to the faint tones of a mandolin coming from some remote part of the house mister Underwood grew more and more abstracted the mandolin ceased and Darrell soothed by his surroundings to a temporary forgetfulness of his troubles swung gently back and forth in a sort of dreamy content After a while Kate Underwood appeared dressed for a walk and accompanied by Duke the two set forth for their mountain ramble for the time as light hearted as two children Upon their return two or three hours later while still at a little distance from the house they saw mister Underwood and a stranger standing together on the veranda The latter who was apparently about to take his departure and whom Darrell at once assumed to be mister Walcott was about thirty years of age of medium height with a finely proportioned and rather muscular form erect and dignified in his bearing with a lithe suppleness and grace in all his movements He was standing with his hat in his hand and Darrell who had time to observe him closely noting his jet black hair close cut excepting where it curled slightly over his forehead his black silky moustache and the oval contour of his olive face remembered mister Underwood s remark of the probability of Spanish blood in his veins As they came near Duke gave a low growl but Kate instantly hushed him chiding him for his rudeness At the sound the stranger turned towards them and mister Underwood at once introduced mister Walcott to his daughter and mister Darrell He greeted them both with the most punctilious courtesy but as he faced Darrell the latter saw for an instant in the half closed blue black eyes the pity tinged with contempt to which he had long since become accustomed yet which as often as he met it thrilled him anew with pain The look passed however and mister Walcott in low well modulated tones conversed pleasantly for a few moments with the new comers the three young people forming a striking trio as they stood there in the bright sunshine amid the June roses then with a graceful adieu he walked swiftly away As soon as he was out of hearing mister Underwood turning to Darrell said It is decided the papers will be drawn to morrow Then taking his daughter s flushed perplexed face between his hands he said mister Walcott and I are going into partnership how do you like the looks of my partner Puss She looked incredulous That young man your partner she exclaimed why he seems the very last man I should ever expect you to fancy Then she added laughing Oh papa I think he must have hypnotized you Does Aunt Marcia know May I tell her And having gained his consent she ran into the house to impart the news to missus Dean That s the woman of it said mister Underwood grimly they always want to immediately tell some other woman But what do you think of my partner he asked looking searchingly at Darrell who had not yet spoken Darrell did not reply at once he felt in some way bewildered All the content the joy the sunshine of the last few hours seemed to have been suddenly blotted out though he could not have told why The remembrance of that glance still stung him but aside from that he felt his whole soul filled with an inexplicable antagonism towards this man I hardly know yet just what I do think of him he answered slowly I have not formed a definite opinion of him but I think as your daughter says he somehow seems the last man whom I would have expected you to associate yourself with mister Underwood frowned I don t generally make mistakes in people he said rather gruffly if I m mistaken in this man it will be the first time Nothing further was said on the subject though it remained uppermost in the minds of both with the result that their conversation was rather spasmodic and desultory At the dinner table Kate was quick to observe the unusual silence and intuitively connecting it in some way with the new partnership refrained alike from question or comment regarding either that subject or mister Walcott while it was a rule with missus Dean never to refer to her brother s business affairs unless he first alluded to them himself The evening passed more pleasantly as Kate coaxed her father into telling some reminiscences of his early western life which greatly interested Darrell Something of the old restlessness had returned to him however He spent a wakeful night and was glad when morning came and he could return to his work As he came out of the house at an early hour to set forth on his long ride he found Kate engaged in feeding Trix with lumps of sugar She greeted him merrily and as he started down the avenue he was followed by a rippling laugh and a shower of roses one of which he caught and fastened in his buttonhole but on looking back over his shoulder she had vanished and only Duke was visible Chapter XIII mister UNDERWOOD STRIKES FIRST The ensuing days were filled with work demanding close attention and concentration of thought but often in the long cool twilight while Darrell rested from his day s work before entering upon the night s study he recalled his visit to The Pines with a degree of pleasure hitherto unknown He had found Kate Underwood far different from his anticipations though just what his anticipations had been he did not stop to define There was at times a womanly grace and dignity in her bearing which he would have expected from her portrait and which he admired but what especially attracted him was her utter lack of affectation or self consciousness She was as unconscious as a child her sympathy towards himself and her pleasant familiarity with him were those of a warm hearted winsome child He liked best to recall her as she looked that evening seated by the fireside the childish pose the graceful outlines of her form silhouetted against the light the dreamy eyes with their long golden lashes curling upward the lips parted in a half smile and the gleam of the firelight on her hair But it was always as a child that he recalled her and the thought that to himself or to any other she could be aught else never occurred to him Of young Whitcomb s love for her of course he had no recollection nor had it ever been mentioned in his hearing since his illness Day by day the work at the camp increased and there also began to be indications of an approaching outbreak among the men The union boarding house was nearing completion it was rumored that it would be ready for occupancy within a week or ten days the walking delegates from the union could be frequently seen loitering about the camp especially when the changes in shifts were made waiting to get word with the men and it was nothing uncommon to see occasional groups of the men engaged in argument which suddenly broke off at the appearance of Darrell or of Hathaway the superintendent So engrossed was mister Underwood with the arrangement of details for the inauguration of the new firm of Underwood Walcott that he was unable to be at the camp that week On Saturday afternoon Darrell having learned that Hathaway was to be gone over Sunday and believing it best under existing circumstances not to leave the camp sent mister Underwood a message to that effect and also informing him of the status of affairs there Early the following week mister Underwood made his appearance at the camp and if the union bosses had entertained any hope of effecting a compromise with the owner of Camp Bird as it was known such hope must have been blasted upon mere sight of that gentleman s face upon his arrival Darrell himself could scarcely restrain a smile of amusement as they met mister Underwood fairly bristled with defiance and after the briefest kind of a greeting started to make his usual rounds of the camp He stopped abruptly fumbled in his pocket for an instant then handing a dainty envelope to Darrell hastened on without a word Darrell saw smiles exchanged among the men but he preserved the utmost gravity until having reached his desk he opened and read the little note It contained merely a few pleasant lines from Kate expressing disappointment at his failure to come to The Pines on the preceding Saturday and reminding him of his promise concerning the violin but the postscript which in true feminine style comprised the real gist of the note made him smile audibly It ran Papa has donned his paint and feathers this morning and is evidently starting out on the war path I haven t an idea whose scalps he intends taking but hope you will at least preserve your own intact At dinner mister Underwood maintained an ominous silence replying in monosyllables to any question or remark addressed to him He soon left the table and Darrell did not see him again till late in the afternoon when he entered the laboratory A glance at the set lines of his face told Darrell as plainly as words that his line of action was fully determined upon and that it would be as fixed and unalterable as the laws of the Medes and Persians I am going home now he announced briefly in reply to Darrell s somewhat questioning look I ll be back here the last of the week What do you think of the outlook mister Underwood Darrell inquired It is about what I expected I have seen all the men They are as I supposed under the thumb of the union bosses A few of them realize that the whole proposition is unreasonable and absurd and they don t want to go out but they don t dare say so above their breath and they don t dare disobey orders because they are owned body and soul by the union Have any of the leaders tried to make terms I met one of their walking delegates this morning said mister Underwood with scornful emphasis I told him to walk himself out of the camp or I d boot him out and he walked Darrell laughed mister Underwood continued The boarding house opens on Thursday on next Monday every man not enrolled in that institution will be ordered out It s to be a strike then sure thing is it Darrell asked Yes there ll be a strike mister Underwood answered grimly while a quick gleam shot across his face but remember one thing he added as he turned to leave the room no man ever yet got the drop or the first blow on me Matters continued about the same at the camp On Friday favorable reports concerning the new boarding house began to be circulated brought the preceding evening by miners from another camp Some of the men looked sullen and defiant others only painfully self conscious in the presence of Darrell and the superintendent but it was evident that the crisis was approaching Late Friday night a horseman dismounted silently before the door of the office building and mister Underwood walked quietly into Darrell s room How s the new hotel Overrun with boarders he asked as he seated himself paying little attention to Darrell s exclamation of surprise Chapman s men about fifty in all are the only ones there at present Chapman ejaculated mister Underwood what is Chapman doing He agreed to stand in with the rest of us on this thing He told Hathaway this morning he was only doing it for experiment The boarding house is located near his claims you know and he has comparatively few men So he said he didn t mind trying it for a month or so Confound him I ll make it the dearest experiment ever he tried said mister Underwood wrathfully he was in our office the other day trying to negotiate a loan for twenty five thousand dollars that he said he had got to have within ten days or go to the wall I ll see that he doesn t get it anywhere about here unless he stands by his word with us After further conversation mister Underwood went out saying he had a little business about the camp to attend to He returned in the course of an hour and Darrell heard him holding a long consultation with Hathaway before he retired for the night The following morning the mill men of the camp on going to their work were astonished to find the mill closed and silent while fastened on the great doors was a large placard which read as follows NOTICE The entire mining and milling plant of Camp Bird is closed down for an indefinite period All employees are requested to call at the superintendent s office and receive their wages up to and including Saturday the tenth inst D K UNDERWOOD The miners found the hoist house and the various shaft houses closed and deserted with notices similar to the above posted on their doors Darrell upon going to breakfast learned that mister Underwood and the superintendent had breakfasted at an early hour A little later on his way to the mill he observed groups of men here and there some standing some moving in the direction of the office but gave the matter no particular thought until he reached the mill and was himself confronted by the placard As he read the notice and recalled the groups of idlers certain remarks made by mister Underwood came to his mind and he seemed struck by the humorous side of the situation The old gentleman seems to have got the drop on them all right he said to himself as with an amused smile he walked past the mill and out in the direction of the hoist The ore bins were closed and locked the tram cars stood empty on their tracks the hoisting engine was still the hoist house and shaft houses deserted After the ceaseless noise and activity to which he had become accustomed at the camp the silence seemed oppressive and he turned and retraced his steps to the office A crowd of men was gathered outside the office building In single file they passed into the office to the superintendent s window received their money silently in almost every instance without comment or question and passed out again Once outside however there they remained their number constantly augmented by new arrivals for the men on the night shift had been aroused by their comrades and were now streaming down from the bunk houses A few laughed and joked some looked sullen some troubled and anxious but all remained packed about the building quiet undemonstrative and mute as dumb brutes as to their reason for staying there They were all prepared to march boldly out of the mill and mines on the following Monday on a strike in obedience to orders even to resort to violence in defence of their so called rights if so ordered but mister Underwood s sudden move had disarmed them there had been no opportunity for a conference with their leaders with the result that they acted more in accordance with their own individual instincts and the loss of work for which they would have cared little in the event of a strike was now uppermost in their minds They eyed Darrell furtively and curiously making way for him as he entered the building but still they waited For a few moments Darrell watched the scene then he passed through the office into the room beyond where he found mister Underwood engaged in sorting and filing papers The latter looked up with a grim smile Been down to the mill Oh yes Darrell answered laughing I went to work as usual only to find the door shut in my face the same as the rest H m What do you think of the strike now I think you are making them swallow their own medicine but I don t see why you need give me a dose of it I haven t threatened to strike mister Underwood s eyes twinkled shrewdly as he replied You had better go out there and get your pay along with the rest and then go to your room and pack up You may not be needed at the mill again for the next six months Will it be as serious as that do you think Darrell inquired Before mister Underwood could reply the superintendent opened the office door hastily mister Underwood he said will you come out and speak to the men They are all waiting outside and I can t drive them away they say they won t stir till they ve seen you With a look of annoyance mister Underwood rose and passed out into the office Darrell somewhat interested followed Well boys said mister Underwood as he appeared in the doorway what do you want of me If you please sir said one man evidently spokesman for the crowd and whom Darrell at once recognized as Dan the engineer if you please sir we would like to know how long this shut down is going to last Can t tell mister Underwood replied shortly can t tell anything about it at present it s indefinite Well persisted the man there s some of us as thought that mebbe twould only be till this ere trouble about the meals is settled one way or t other and there s some as thought mebbe it hadn t nothing to do with that Well said mister Underwood impatiently Well sir said Dan lowering his voice a little and edging nearer mister Underwood you know as how the most of us was satisfied with things as they was and didn t want no change and wouldn t have made no kick only you see we had to and we felt kinder anxious to know whether if this thing got settled some way and the camp opened up again whether we could get back in our old places Dan said mister Underwood impressively and speaking loudly enough for every man to hear there can be no settlement of this question except to have things go on under precisely the same terms and conditions as they ve always gone so none of your leaders need come to me for terms for they won t get em And as to opening up the mines and mill I ll open them up whenever I get ready not a day sooner or later and when I do start up again if you men have come to your senses by that time and are ready to come back on the same terms all right if not he paused an instant then added with emphasis just remember there ll be others and plenty of em too Yes sir thank ye sir Dan answered somewhat dubiously then one and all moved slowly and mechanically away mister Underwood turned to Darrell Get your things together as soon as you can I m going to send down three or four of the teams after dinner and they can take your things along And here s the key to the mill go over and pick out whatever you will want in the way of an assaying outfit and have that taken down with the rest There s no need of your going to the expense of buying an outfit just for temporary use By two o clock scarcely a man remained at the camp mister Underwood and Darrell were among the last to leave Two faithful servants of mister Underwood s had arrived an hour or so before who were to act as watchmen during the shut down Having taken them around the camp and given them the necessary instructions mister Underwood then gave them the keys of the various buildings saying as he took his departure There s grub enough in the boarding house to last you two for some time but whenever there s anything needed let me know Bring over some beds from the bunk house and make yourselves comfortable He climbed to a seat on one of the wagons and as they started turned back to the watchmen for his parting admonition Keep an eye on things boys You re both good shots if you catch anybody prowling round here day or night wing him boys wing him The teams then rattled noisily down the canyon road Darrell with Trix bringing up the rear feeling himself a sort of shuttlecock tossed to and fro by antagonistic forces in whose conflicts he personally had no part and no interest However he wasted no moments in useless regrets but rode along in deep thought planning for the uninterrupted pursuit of his studies amid the new and less favorable surroundings Thus far he had met with unlooked for success along the line of his researches and experiments and each success but stimulated him to more diligent study On their arrival at Ophir mister Underwood gave directions to have the assaying outfit taken to the rooms in the rear of his own offices after which he and Darrell with the remaining teams proceeded in the direction of The Pines Trix on finding herself headed for home quickened her steps to such a brisk pace that on reaching the long driveway Darrell was considerably in advance of the others He had no sooner emerged from the pines into the open in full view of the house than Duke came bounding down the driveway to meet him with every possible demonstration of joyous welcome His loud barking brought the ladies to the door just as Darrell having quickly dismounted and sent Trix to the stables was running up the broad stairs to the veranda the collie close at his side Just look at Duke Kate Underwood exclaimed shaking hands with Darrell and this is only the second time he has met you You surely have won his heart mister Darrell You are the only person outside of Katherine he has ever condescended to notice said missus Dean with a smile I assure you I feel immensely flattered by his friendship Darrell replied caressing the collie the more so because I know it to be genuine He won t so much as look at me missus Dean added That is because you objected at first to having him here said Kate he knows it and he ll not forget it But mister Darrell where is papa He will be here directly Darrell answered smiling as he suddenly recalled the little note within his pocket he is returning from the war path with the trophies of victory Kate laughed and colored slightly Your own scalp has not suffered at any rate she said But he has brought me back a captive here he comes now The wagon loaded with Darrell s belongings was just coming slowly into view with mister Underwood on the seat beside the driver the other teams having been sent to the stables by another route Darrell noted the surprise depicted on the faces beside him and turning to missus Dean who stood next him he said in a low tone I have come back to the old home mother for a little while is there room for me missus Dean looked at him steadily for an instant while Kate ran to meet her father then she replied earnestly There will always be room in the old home for you I only wish that I could hope it would always hold you Chapter XIV DRIFTING Early the following week Darrell was established in his new office The building containing the offices of the firm of Underwood Walcott had as mister Underwood informed Darrell been formerly occupied by one of the leading banks of Ophir and was situated on the corner of two of its principal streets Of the three handsome private offices in the rear mister Underwood occupied the one immediately adjoining the general offices the next separated from the first by a narrow entrance way had been appropriated by mister Walcott while the third communicating with the second and opening directly upon the street was now fitted up for Darrell s occupancy The carpets and much of the original furnishing of the rooms still remained but in the preparation of Darrell s room Kate Underwood and her aunt made numerous trips in their carriage between the offices and The Pines with the result that when Darrell took possession many changes had been effected Heavy curtains separated that portion of the room in which the laboratory work was to be done from that to be used as a study and to the latter there had been added a rug or two a bookcase in which Darrell could arrange his small library of scientific works a cabinet of mineralogical specimens and a pair of paintings intended to conceal some of Time s ravages on the once finely decorated walls while palms and blooming plants transformed the large plate glass windows into bowers of fragrance and beauty at the same time forming a screen from the too inquisitive eyes of passers by Just as Darrell was completing the arrangement of his effects mister Underwood and his partner sauntered into the room from their apartments Within a few feet of the door mister Underwood came to a stop his hands deep in his trousers pockets his square chin thrust aggressively forward while with a face unreadable as granite his keen eyes scanned every detail in the room mister Walcott on the contrary made the entire circuit of the room his hands carelessly clasped behind him his head thrown well back his every step characterized by a graceful undulatory motion like the movements of the feline tribe H m was mister Underwood s sole comment when he had finished his survey of the room mister Walcott turned towards his partner with a smile mister Darrell is evidently a prime favorite with the ladies he remarked pleasantly Well they don t want to try any of their prime favorite business on me retorted mister Underwood as he slowly turned and left the room Both young men laughed and Walcott with an easy nonchalant air seated himself near Darrell I find the old gentleman has a keen sense of humor he said still smiling but some of his jokes are inclined to be a little ponderous at times His humor generally lies along the lines of sarcasm Darrell replied Ah something of a cynic is he No said Darrell he has too kind a heart to be cynical but he is very fond of concealing it by sarcasm and brusqueness He is quite original and unique in his way I find him really a much more agreeable man than I anticipated You have very pleasant quarters here mister Darrell I should judge you intended this as a sort of study as well as an office I do intend it so Probably for a while I shall do more studying than anything else as it may be some time before I get any assaying I think we can probably throw quite a bit of work your way as we frequently have inquiries from some of our clients wanting something in that line Walcott said mister Underwood re entering suddenly Chapman is out there go and meet him You can conduct negotiations with him on the terms we agreed upon but I don t care to figure in the deal If he asks for me tell him I m out I see as the ladies say you re not at home said Walcott smiling as he sprang quickly to his feet Well mister Darrell he continued I consider myself fortunate in having you for so near a neighbor and I trust that we shall prove good friends and our relations mutually agreeable Darrell s dark penetrating eyes looked squarely into the half closed smiling ones which met his glance for an instant then wavered and dropped I know of no reason why we should not be friends he replied quietly knowing he could say that much with all candor yet feeling that friendship between them was an utter impossibility and that of this Walcott was as conscious as was he himself Well my boy said mister Underwood seating himself before Darrell s desk I guess twas a good thing you took the old man s advice for once I don t know where you would find better quarters than these Darrell smiled As to following your advice mister Underwood you didn t even give me a chance You suggested my taking one of these rooms and then gave orders on your own responsibility for my paraphernalia to be deposited here and there was nothing left for me to do but to settle down However he added laying some money on the desk before mister Underwood I have no complaint to make Just kindly receipt for that Receipt for this What do you mean What is it anyway exclaimed mister Underwood in a bewildered tone It is the month s rent in advance according to your custom Rent mister Underwood ejaculated now thoroughly angry what do I want of rent from you Can t you let me be a friend to you Time and time again I ve tried to help you and you wouldn t have it Now I ll give you warning young man that one of these days you ll go a little too far in this thing and then you ll have to look somewhere else for friends for when I m done with a man I m done with him forever mister Underwood said Darrell with dignity you are yourself going too far at this moment You know I do not refuse favors from you personally Do I not consider your home mine Have I ever offered you compensation for anything that you or your sister have done for me But this is a different affair altogether Different I d like to know wherein mister Underwood if in addition to your other kindnesses you personally offered me the use of this room gratis I might accept it but I will accept no favors from the firm of Underwood Walcott Humph I don t see what difference that need make mister Underwood retorted He sat silently studying Darrell for a few moments but the latter s face was as unreadable as his own What have you got against that fellow he asked at length curiously I have nothing whatever against him mister Underwood But you re not friendly to him Darrell remained silent He is friendly to you continued mister Underwood he has talked with me considerably about you and takes quite an interest in you and in your success Possibly Darrell answered dryly but you will oblige me by not talking of me to him I have nothing against mister Walcott I am neither friendly nor unfriendly to him but he is a man to whom I do not wish to be under any obligations whatsoever In vain mister Underwood argued Darrell remained obdurate and when he left the office a little later he carried with him the receipt of Underwood Walcott for office rent Darrell s reputation as an expert which he had already established at the mining camp soon reached Ophir with the result that he was not long without work in the new office For a time he devoted his leisure hours to unremitting study The brief but intense summer season of the high altitudes was now well advanced however and in its stifling heat amid the noise of the busy little city and constantly subjected to interruptions his scientific studies and researches lost half their charm And in proportion as they lost their power to interest him the home on the mountain side beyond reach of the city s heat and dust and clamor drew him with increasing and irresistible force Never before had it seemed to him so attractive so beautiful so homelike as now He did not stop to ask himself wherein its new charm consisted or to analyze the sense of relief and gladness with which he turned his face homeward when the day s work was ended He only felt vaguely that the silent undemonstrative love which the old place had so long held for him had suddenly found expression It smiled to him from the flowers nodding gayly to him as he passed it echoed in the tinkling music of the fountains the murmuring pines whispered it to him as their fragrant breath fanned his cheek but more than all he read it in the brown eyes which grew luminous with welcome at his approach and heard it in the low sweet voice whose wonderful modulations were themselves more eloquent than words And with this interpretation of the strange new joy day by day permeating his whole life he went his way in deep content And to Kate Underwood this summer seemed the brightest and the fairest of all the summers of her young life why she could not have told except that the skies were bluer the sunlight more golden and the birds sang more joyously than ever before In a mining town like Ophir there was comparatively little society for her so that most of her evenings were spent at home and she and Darrell were of necessity thrown much together Sometimes he joined her in a game of tennis a ride or drive or a short mountain ramble sometimes he sat on the veranda with the elder couple listening while she played and sang but more often their voices blended while the wild plaintive notes of the violin rose and fell on the evening air accompanied by the piano or by the guitar or mandolin Together they watched the sunsets or walked up and down the mountain terrace in the moonlight enjoying to the full the beauty around them neither as yet dreaming that more than their joy in the bloom and beauty and fragrance in the music of the fountains or the murmuring voices of the pines in the sunset s glory or the moonlight s mystical radiance above all deeper than all pervading all was their joy in each other Hers was a nature essentially childlike his very infirmity rendered him in experience less than a child and so devoid of worldly wisdom like Earth s first pair of lovers without knowledge of good or evil all unconsciously they entered their Eden One sultry Sunday afternoon they sat within the vine clad veranda the strains of the violin and guitar blending on the languorous perfumed air As the last notes died away Kate exclaimed I never had any one accompany me who played with so much expression You give me an altogether different conception of a piece of music you seem to make it full of new meaning And why not Darrell inquired Music is a language of itself capable of infinitely more expression than our spoken language Who is speaking then when you play as you did just now the soul of the musician or your own The musician s I am only the interpreter The more perfect the harmony or sympathy between his soul as expressed in the music and mine the truer will be the rendering I give A fine elocutionist will reveal the beauties of a classic poem to hundreds who of themselves might never have understood it but the poem is not his he is only the poet s interpreter If you call that piece of music which you have just rendered only an interpretation Kate answered in a low tone I only wish that I could for once hear your own soul speaking through the violin Darrell smiled Do you really wish it he asked after a pause looking into the wistful brown eyes I do She was seated in a low hammock swinging gently to and fro He sat at a little distance from her feet on the topmost of the broad stairs his back against one of the large vine wreathed columns Duke stretched full length beside him A slight breeze stirred the flower scented air and set the pines whispering for a moment then all was silent With eyes half closed Darrell raised the violin and drawing the bow softly across the strings began one of his own improvisos the exquisite piercing sweetness of the first notes swelling with an indescribable pathos until Kate could scarcely restrain a cry of pain Higher and higher they soared until above the clouds they poised lightly for an instant then descended in a flood of liquid harmonies which alternately rose and fell sometimes tremulous with hope sometimes moaning in low undertones of grief never despairing but always with the same heart rending pathos always voicing the same unutterable longing Unmindful of his surroundings his whole soul absorbed in the music Darrell played on till as the strains sank to a minor undertone he heard a stifled sob followed by a low whine from Duke He glanced towards Kate and the music ceased instantly Unobserved by him she had left the hammock and was seated opposite himself listening as though entranced her lips quivering her eyes shining with unshed tears while Duke alarmed by what he considered signs of evident distress looked anxiously from her to Darrell as though entreating his help Why my dear child what is the matter Darrell exclaimed moving quickly to her side Oh she cried piteously how could you stop so suddenly It was like snapping a beautiful golden thread And burying her face in her hands her whole frame shook with sobs Darrell somewhat alarmed himself laid his hand on her shoulder in an attempt to soothe her In a moment she raised her head the tear drops still glistening on her cheeks and her long golden lashes It was childish in me to give way like that she said with a smile that reminded Darrell of the sun shining through a summer shower but oh that music It was the saddest and the sweetest I ever heard It was breaking my heart and yet I could have listened to it forever It was my fault said Darrell regretfully I should not have played so long but I always forget myself when playing that way Kate s face grew suddenly grave and serious mister Darrell she said hesitatingly I have thought very often about the sad side of your life since your illness you know but I never realized till now the terrible loneliness of it all She paused as though uncertain how to proceed Darrell s face had in turn become grave Did the violin tell you that he asked gently She nodded silently Yes it has been lonely inexpressibly so he said unconsciously using the past tense but I had no right to cause you this suffering by inflicting my loneliness upon you Do not say that she replied quickly I am glad that you told me in the way you did glad not only that I understand you better and can better sympathize with you but also because I believe you can understand me as no one else has for one reason why the music affected me so much was that it seemed the expression of my own feelings of my hunger for sympathy all these years Have there been shadows in your life then too It looked to be all sunshine Darrell said his face growing tender as he saw the tear drops falling Yes it would seem so with this beautiful home and all that papa does for me and sometimes I m afraid I m ungrateful But oh mister Darrell if you could have known my mother you would understand She was so different from papa and auntie and she loved me so And it seems as though since she died I ve had nobody to love me I suppose papa does in a fashion but he is too busy to show it or else he doesn t know how and Aunt Marcia well you know she s good as she can be but if she loved you you would never know it I ve wondered sometimes if poor mamma didn t die just for want of love it has seemed lots of times as though I would Poor little girl said Darrell pityingly He understood now the wistful appealing look of the brown eyes He intended to say something expressive of sympathy but the right words would not come He could think of nothing that did not sound stilted and formal Almost unconsciously he laid his hand with a tender caress on the slender little white hand lying near him much as he would have laid it on a wounded bird and just as unconsciously the little hand nestled contentedly like a bird within his clasp A few days later Darrell heard from Walcott the story of Harry Whitcomb s love for his cousin It had been reported Walcott said in low tones as though imparting a secret that young Whitcomb was hopelessly in love with Miss Underwood but that she seemed rather indifferent to his attentions It was thought however that the old gentleman had favored the match as he had given his nephew an interest in his mining business and had the latter lived and proved himself a good financier it was believed that mister Underwood would in time have bestowed his daughter upon him Darrell listened silently Of young Whitcomb of his death and of his own part in that sad affair he had often heard but no mention of anything of this nature He sat lost in thought Of course you know how sadly the romance ended Walcott continued wondering somewhat at Darrell s silence I have understood that you were a witness of young Whitcomb s tragic death I know from hearsay that is all Darrell replied quietly I have heard the story a number of times Walcott expressed great surprise Pardon me mister Darrell for referring to the matter I had heard something regarding the peculiar nature of your malady but I had no idea it was so marked as that Is it possible that you have no recollection of that affair None whatever Darrell answered briefly as though he did not care to discuss the matter How strange One would naturally have supposed that anything so terrible so shocking to the sensibilities would have left an impression on your mind never to have been effaced But I fear the subject is unpleasant to you mister Darrell pardon me for having alluded to it The conversation turned but Darrell could not banish the subject from his thoughts Kate had often spoken to him of her cousin but never as a lover He recalled his portrait at The Pines the frank boyish face with its winning smile a bonnie lover surely Had she or had she not he wondered learned to reciprocate his love before the tragic ending came And if not did she now regret it He watched her that evening fearing to broach a subject so delicate but pondering long and deeply till at last she rallied him on his unusual seriousness and he told her what he had heard Yes she said in reply Harry loved me or thought he did though he was like the others he did not understand me any better than they But he had always been just like a brother to me and I could never have loved him in any other way and I told him so Papa said I would learn in time and I think perhaps he would have insisted upon it if Harry had lived I was sorry I couldn t care for him as he wished he thought I would after a while but I never could for I think that kind of love is far different from all others don t you mister Darrell And Darrell looking from the mountain side where they were standing out into the deep blue spaces where the stars one by one were gliding into sight answered reverently As far above all others as the heaven is high above the earth To him at that instant love the love that should exist between two who out of earth s millions have chosen each the other seemed something as yet remote a sacred temple whose golden dome like some mystic shrine gleamed from afar but into which he might some day enter unaware that he already stood within its outer court Chapter XV THE AWAKENING As Darrell was returning home one evening some ten days later he heard Kate s rippling laughter and sounds of unusual merriment and on coming out into view of the house beheld her engaged in executing a waltz on the veranda with Duke as a partner The latter in his efforts to oblige his young mistress and at the same time preserve his own dignity presented so ludicrous a spectacle that Darrell was unable to restrain his risibility Hearing his peals of laughter and finding herself discovered Kate rather hastily released her partner and the collie glad to be once more permitted the use of four feet bounded down the steps to give Darrell his customary welcome his mistress following slowly with somewhat heightened color Darrell at once apologized for his hilarity pleading as an excuse Duke s comical appearance We both must have made a ridiculous appearance she replied but as Duke seems to have forgiven you I suppose I must and I think I had better explain such undignified conduct on my part Auntie has just told me that she is going to give a grand reception for me two weeks from to day or really two of them for there is to be an afternoon reception from three until six for her acquaintances with a few young ladies to assist me in receiving and then in the evening I am to have a reception of my own We are going to send nearly two hundred invitations to Galena besides our friends here Papa is going to have the ball room on the top floor fitted up for the occasion and we are to have an orchestra from Galena and altogether it will be quite the event of the season Now do you wonder she added archly that I seized hold of the first object that came in my way and started out for a waltz Not in the least Darrell answered his dark eyes full of merriment I only wish I had been fortunate enough to have arrived a little earlier A mischievous response to his challenge sparkled in Kate s eyes for a moment but she only replied demurely You shall have your opportunity later When Two weeks from to night Ah am I to be honored with an invitation Most assuredly you will be invited Kate replied quietly then added shyly and I myself invite you personally here and now and that is honoring you as no other guest of mine will be honored Thank you he replied gently with one of his tender smiles I accept the personal invitation for your sake She was standing on the topmost stair slightly above him one hand toying with a spray of blossoms depending from the vines above her head With a swift movement Darrell caught the little hand and was in the act of carrying it to his lips when it suddenly slipped from his grasp and its owner as quickly turned and disappeared Darrell seated himself with a curious expression It was not the first time Kate had eluded him thus within the last few days He had missed of late certain pleasant little familiarities and light tender caresses to which he had become accustomed and he began to wonder at this change in his child companion as he regarded her What has come over the child he soliloquized two weeks ago if I had given her a challenge for a waltz she would have taken me up but lately she is as demure as a little nun We will have to give it up won t we Duke old boy he continued addressing the collie whose intelligent eyes were fastened on his face with a shrewd expression as though aware of the trend of Darrell s thoughts he too considered his beloved young mistress rather incomprehensible The ensuing days were so crowded with preparations for the coming event and with such constant demands upon Kate s time that Darrell seldom saw her except at meals and opportunities for anything like their accustomed pleasant interchange of confidence were few and far between On those rare occasions however when he succeeded in meeting her alone Darrell could not but be impressed by the subtle and to him inexplicable change in her manner She seemed in some way so remotely removed from the young girl who but a few days before in response to the violin s tale had confided to him the loneliness of her own life A shy sweet but impenetrable reserve seemed to have replaced the childlike familiarity Her eyes still brightened with welcome at his approach but their light was quickly veiled beneath drooping lids and through the cadences of her low tones he caught at times the vibration of a new chord to whose meaning his ear was as yet unattuned He did not know nor did any other that within that short time she had learned her own heart s secret Child that she was she had met Love face to face and in that one swift burning glance of recognition the womanhood within her had expanded as the bud expands bursting its imprisoning calyx under the ardent glance of the sun But Darrell seeing only the effect and knowing nothing of the cause was vaguely troubled On the day of the reception both mister Underwood and Darrell lunched and dined down town returning together to The Pines in the interim between the afternoon and evening entertainments As Darrell sprang from the carriage and ran up the stairs the servants were already turning on the lights temporarily suspended within the veranda and throughout the grounds so that the place seemed transformed into a bit of fairyland He heard chatter and laughter and caught glimpses of young ladies special guests from out of town flitting from room to room but Kate was nowhere to be seen Going to his room he quickly donned an evening suit not omitting a dainty boutonniere awaiting him on his dressing case and betook himself to the libraries across the hall where by previous arrangement Kate was to call for him when it was time to go downstairs From below came the ceaseless hum of conversation the constant ripple of laughter mingled with bits of song and the occasional strains of a waltz Reading was out of the question Sinking into the depths of a large arm chair Darrell was soon lost in dreamy reverie from which he was roused by a slight sound Looking up he saw framed in the arched doorway between the two rooms a vision like and yet so unlike the maiden for whom he waited and who had occupied his thoughts but a moment before that he gazed in silent astonishment uncertain whether it were a reality or part of his dreams For a moment the silence was unbroken then How do you like my gown said the Vision demurely Darrell sprang to his feet and approached slowly a new consciousness dawning in his soul a new light in his eyes Of the style or texture of her gown a filmy gleaming mass of white he knew absolutely nothing he only knew that its clinging softness revealed in new beauty the rounded outlines of her form that its snowy sheen set off the exquisite moulding of her neck and arms that its long shimmering folds accentuated the height and grace of her slender figure but a knowledge had come to him in that moment like a revelation stunning bewildering him thrilling his whole being irradiating every lineament of his face I know very little about ladies dress he said apologetically and I fear I may express myself rather bunglingly but to me the chief beauty of your gown consists in the fact that it reveals and enhances the beauty of the wearer in that sense I consider it very beautiful Thank you Kate replied with a low sweeping courtesy to conceal the blushes which she felt mantling her cheeks not so much at his words as at what she read in his eyes that is the most delicate compliment I ever heard I know I shall not receive another so delicious this whole evening and to think of prefacing it with an apology I am glad to hear that voice said Darrell possessing himself of one little gloved hand and surveying his companion critically from the charmingly coiffed head to the dainty white slipper peeping from beneath her skirt the voice and the eyes seem about all that is left of the little girl I had known and loved She regarded him silently with a gracious little smile but with deepening color and quickening pulse He continued She has seemed different of late somehow she has eluded me so often I have felt as though she were in some way slipping away from me and now I fear I have lost her altogether How is it Darrell gently raised the sweet face so that he looked into the clear depths of the brown eyes Tell me Kathie dear has she drifted away from me For an instant the eyes were hidden under the curling lashes then they lifted as she replied with an enigmatical smile Not so far but that you may follow if you choose Darrell bowed his head and his lips touched the golden brown hair Sweetheart he said in low tones scarcely above a whisper I follow if I overtake her what then Will I find her the same as in the past Her heart was beating wildly with a new strange joy she longed to get away by herself and taste its sweetness to the full The same and yet not the same she answered slowly then before he could say more she added lightly as a wave of laughter was borne upward from the parlors But I came to see if you were ready to go downstairs ought we not to join the others As you please he replied stooping to pick up the programme she had dropped are the guests arriving yet No it is still early but I want to introduce you to my friends Oh yes my programme thanks That reminds me I am going to ask you to put your name down for two or three waltzes you know she added smiling I promised you two weeks ago some waltzes for this evening so take your choice For an instant Darrell hesitated and the old troubled look returned to his face You are very kind he said slowly and I appreciate the honor but it has just occurred to me that really I am not at all certain regarding my proficiency in that line Kate understood his dilemma They had reached the hall some one was at the piano below and the strains of a dreamy waltz floated through the rooms I haven t a doubt of your proficiency myself she replied with a confident smile but if you would like a test here is a good opportunity and she glanced up and down the vacant but brightly lighted corridor Darrell needed no second hint and almost before she was aware they were gliding over the floor To Kate intoxicated with her new found joy it seemed as though she were borne along on the waves of the music without effort or volition of her own She dared not trust herself to speak Once or twice she raised her eyes to meet the dark ones whose gaze she felt upon her face but the love light shining in their depths overpowered her glance and she turned her eyes away She knew that he had seen and recognized the woman and that as such and not as a child he loved her and for the present this knowledge was happiness enough And Darrell was silent still bewildered by the twofold revelation which had so suddenly come to him the revelation of the lovely womanhood at his side to which he had until now been blind and of the love within his own heart of which till now he had been unconscious Before they had completed two turns up and down the corridor the music ceased as suddenly as it had begun Oh that was heavenly It seemed like a dream Kate exclaimed with a sigh It seemed a very blessed bit of reality to me Darrell laughed in return drawing her arm within his own as they proceeded towards the stairs You are a superb dancer now you certainly can have no scruples about claiming some waltzes Kate replied withdrawing her arm and again placing her programme in his hands As they paused at the head of the stairs while Darrell complied with her request a chorus of voices was heard in the hall below Kate are you never coming some one called and a sprightly brunette appeared for an instant on the first landing but vanished quickly at sight of Darrell Girls they heard her exclaim to the merry group below would you believe it She is taking a base advantage of us she has discovered what we did not suppose existed in this house a young man and is getting her programme filled in advance Cries of Oh Kate that s not fair followed Kate leaned laughingly over the balustrade He s an angel of a dancer girls she called but I ll promise not to monopolize him Darrell returned the programme saying as they passed down the stairs together I didn t want to appear selfish so I only selected three but give me more if you can later Kate smiled I think she replied you will speedily find yourself in such demand that I will consider myself fortunate to have secured those three but she added shyly as her eyes met his my first waltz was with you and that was just as I intended it should be Through the hours which followed so swiftly Darrell was in a sort of waking dream a state of superlative happiness unmarred as yet by phantoms from the shrouded past or misgivings as to the dim uncertain future past and future were for the time alike forgotten One image dominated his mind the form and face of the fair young hostess moving among her guests as a queen amid her court carrying her daintily poised head as though conscious of the twofold royal crown of womanhood and woman s love One thought surged continuously through and through his brain that she was his his by the sovereign right of love Whatever courtesy he showed to others was for her sake because they were her guests her friends and when unengaged he stationed himself in some quiet corner or dimly lighted alcove where unobserved he could watch her movements with their rhythmic grace or catch the music of her voice the sight or sound thrilling him with joy so exquisite as to be akin to pain The oft repeated compliments of the crowd about him seemed to him empty trite meaningless what could they know of her real beauty compared with himself who saw her through Love s eyes As he stood thus alone in a deep bay window shaded by giant palms some one paused beside him Our little debutante has surpassed herself to night she is fairest of the fair Darrell turned to see at his side Walcott faultlessly attired elegant nonchalant a half smile playing about his lips as through half closed eyes he watched the dancers Instantly all the antagonism in Darrell s nature rose against the man strive as he might he was powerless to subdue it There was no trace of it in his voice however as he answered quietly Miss Underwood certainly looks very beautiful to night She has matured marvellously of late continued the other in low pleasant tones her development within the past few weeks has been remarkable But that is to be expected in women of her style and this is but the beginning Mark my words mister Darrell Walcott faced his auditor with a smile Miss Underwood s beauty to night is but the pale shining of a taper beside one of those lights yonder compared with what it will be a few years hence are you aware of that It had not occurred to me Darrell replied with studied calmness for the conversation was becoming distasteful to him Look at her now said Walcott bowing and smiling as Kate floated past them but regarding her with a scrutiny that aroused Darrell s quick resentment very fair very lovely I admit but a trifle too slender a little too colorless too neutral as it were A few years will change all that You will see her a woman of magnificent proportions and with the cold neutral tints replaced by warmth and color I have made a study of women and I know that class well Five or ten years from now she will be simply superb and at the age when ordinary women lose their power to charm she will only be in the zenith of her beauty The look and tone accompanying the words filled Darrell with indignation and disgust You will have to excuse me he said coldly you seem as you say to have made a study of women from your own standpoint but our standards of beauty differ so radically that further discussion of the subject is useless Ah well every man according to his taste of course Walcott remarked indifferently and turning lightly he walked away a faint gleam of amusement lighting his dark features Half an hour later as Darrell glided over the floor with Kate some irresistible force drew his glance towards the bay window where within the shadow of the palms Walcott was now standing alone suave as ever Their eyes met for an instant only and Walcott smiled The dance went on but the smile like a poisoned shaft entered Darrell s soul and rankled there Both Darrell and Walcott were marked men that night and attracted universal attention and comment Darrell s pale intellectual face penetrating eyes and dark hair already streaked with gray would have attracted attention anywhere as would also Walcott with his olive skin his cynical smile and graceful sinuous movement In addition Darrell s peculiar mental condition and the fact that his identity was enveloped in a degree of mystery rendered him doubly interesting In the case of each this was his introduction to the social life of Ophir Each had been a resident of the town the one as a student and recluse the other as a business man but each was a stranger to the stratum known as society Each held himself aloof that evening from the throng the one through natural reserve courteous but indifferent to the passing crowd the other alert watchful studying the crowd weighing gauging this new element speculating whether or not it were worth his while to court its favor whether or not he could make of it an ally for his own future advantage Soon after his arrival Walcott had begged of Kate Underwood the honor of a waltz but her programme being then nearly filled she could only give him one well towards the end As he intended to render himself conspicuous by dancing only once and then with the belle of the evening it was at quite a late hour when he first made his appearance on the floor Kate was on his arm and at that instant his criticism made earlier in the evening that she was too colorless certainly could not have applied As he led her out upon the floor he bent his gaze upon her with a look which brought the color swiftly to her face in crimson waves that flooded the full snow white throat and surging upward reached even to the blue veined temples Instinctively she shrank from him with a sensation almost of fear but something in his gaze held her as though spell bound She looked into his eyes like one fascinated scarcely knowing what he said or what reply she made The waltz began and as their fingers touched Kate s nerves tingled as though from an electric shock She shivered slightly then angry with herself used every exertion to overcome the strange spell To a great extent she succeeded but she felt benumbed as though moving in a dream or in obedience to some will stronger than her own while her temples throbbed painfully and her respiration grew hurried and difficult She grew dizzy but pride came to her rescue and except for the color which now ran riot in her cheeks and a slight tremor through her frame there was no hint of her agitation Her partner was all that could be desired guiding her through the circling crowds and supporting her in the swift turns with the utmost grace and courtesy but it was a relief when it was over At her request Walcott escorted her to a seat near her aunt then smilingly withdrew with much inward self congratulation At that moment Darrell seeing Kate unengaged hastened to her side You look warm and the air here is oppressive he said observing her flushed face and fanning her gently shall we go outside for a few moments Yes please anywhere out of this heat and glare she answered my temples throb as if they would burst and my face feels as though it were on fire Darrell hastened to the hall returning an instant later with a light wrap which he proceeded to throw about Kate s shoulders You are tired Katherine said missus Dean more tired than you realize now you had better not dance any more to night I have but two more dances auntie the young girl answered smiling you surely would not wish me to forego those adding in a lower tone as she turned towards Darrell one of them is your waltz and I would not miss that for anything They passed through the hall and out upon a broad balcony They could hear the subdued laughter of couples strolling through the brightly lighted grounds below while over the distant landscape shone the pale weird light of the waning moon just rising in the east None of the guests had discovered the balcony opening from the hall on the third floor so they had it exclusively to themselves As Darrell drew Kate s arm closer within his own he was surprised to feel her trembling slightly while the hand lying on his own was cold as marble My dear child he exclaimed your hands are cold and you are trembling What is the matter are you cold No not cold exactly only shivery she answered with a laugh My head was burning up in there and I feel sort of hot flashes and then a creepy shivery feeling by turns but I am not cold out here really she added earnestly as Darrell drew her wrap more closely about her Nevertheless I cannot allow you to stay out here any longer Darrell replied finding his first taste of masculine authority very sweet For an instant Kate felt a very feminine desire to put his authority to the test but the sense of his protection and his solicitude for her welfare seemed particularly soothing just then and so with only a saucy little smile she silently allowed him to lead her into the house At his suggestion however they did not return to the ball room but passed around through an anteroom coming out into a small circular apartment dimly lighted and cosily furnished opening upon one corner of the ball room It strikes me said Darrell as he drew aside the silken hangings dividing the two rooms and pushed a low divan before the open space this will be fully as pleasant as the balcony and much safer The very thing Kate exclaimed sinking upon the divan with a sigh of relief we will have a fine view of the dancers and yet be quite secluded ourselves A minuet was already in progress on the floor and for a few moments Kate watched the stately graceful dance while Darrell having adjusted her wrap lightly about her seated himself beside her and silently watched her face with deep content Gradually the throbbing in her temples subsided the nervous tremor ceased her color became natural and she felt quite herself again She leaned back against the divan and looked with laughing eyes into Darrell s face mister Darrell do you believe in hypnotism she suddenly inquired In hypnotism Yes but not in many of those who claim to practise it Most of them are mere impostors But why do you ask he continued drawing her head down upon his shoulder and looking playfully into her eyes are you trying to hypnotize me Kate laughed merrily and shook her head I m afraid I wouldn t find you a good subject she said then added slowly as her face grew serious Do you know I believe I was hypnotized to night by that dreadful mister Walcott He certainly cast a malign spell of some kind over me from the moment we went on the floor together till he left me Why do you say that Darrell asked quickly you know I did not see you on the floor with him for Miss Stockton asked me to go with her for a promenade We came back just as the waltz had ended and mister Walcott was escorting you to your aunt I noticed that you seemed greatly fatigued and excused myself to Miss Stockton and came over at once What had happened Kate related what had occurred I can t give you any idea of it she said in conclusion it seemed unaccountable but it was simply dreadful You know his eyes are nearly always closed in that peculiar way of his and really I don t think I had any idea how they looked but to night as he looked at me they were wide open and do you know I can t describe them but they looked so soft and melting they were beautiful and yet there was something absolutely terrible in their depths It seemed some way like looking down into a volcano And the worst of it was they seemed to hold me I couldn t take my eyes from his He was as kind and courteous as could be I ll admit that but even the touch of his fingers made me shiver Darrell s face had darkened during Kate s recital but he controlled his anger Now was that due to my own imagination or to some uncanny spell of his Kate insisted To neither wholly and yet perhaps a little of each Darrell answered lightly not wishing to alarm her or lead her to attach undue importance to the occurrence I think mister Walcott has an abnormal amount of conceit and that most of those little mannerisms of his are mainly to attract attention to himself He was probably trying to produce some sort of an impression on your mind and to that extent he certainly succeeded only the impression does not seem to have been as favorable as he perhaps would have wished No one but a conceited cad would have attempted such a thing and with your supersensitive nature the effect on you was anything but pleasant but don t allow yourself to think about it or be annoyed by it At the same time I would advise you not to place yourself in his power or where he could have any advantage of you By the way this is our waltz is it not It is Kate replied rising and watching Darrell as he removed her wrap and prepared to escort her to the ball room His playful badinage had not deceived her As she took his arm she said in a low tone You affect to treat this matter rather lightly but all the same you have warned me against this man Forewarned is forearmed you know and no man can ever attempt to harm me or mine with impunity Darrell turned quickly in surprise there was a quality in her tone wholly unfamiliar But I fear you exaggerate what I intended to convey he said hastily I do not know that he would ever deliberately seek to harm you but he might render himself obnoxious in some way as he did to night She shook her head I was taken off guard to night she said but he had best never attempt anything of the kind a second time They were now waiting for the waltz to begin she continued in the same low tone I have had a western girl s education When I was a child this place was little more than a rough mining camp with plenty of desperate characters My father trained me as he would have trained a boy and she added significantly with a bright proud smile I am just as proficient now as I was then Darrell scarcely heeded the import of her words so struck was he by the change in her face which had suddenly grown wonderfully like her father s stern impassive unrelenting She smiled and the look vanished and for the time he thought no more of it but as the passing cloud sometimes reveals features in a landscape unnoticed in the sunlight so it had disclosed a phase of character latent unguessed even by those who knew her best Two hours later the last carriage had gone the guests from out of town who were to remain at The Pines for the night had retired and darkness and silence had gradually settled over the house A light still burned in mister Underwood s private room where he paced back and forth his brows knit in deep thought but his stern face lighted with a smile of intense satisfaction Darrell who had remained below to assist missus Dean in the performance of a few last duties having accompanied her in a final tour of the deserted rooms to make sure that all was safe bade her good night and went upstairs To his surprise Kate s library was still lighted and through the open door he could see her at her desk writing She looked up on hearing his step and as he approached rose and came to the door She had exchanged her evening gown for a dainty robe de chambre of white cashmere and lace and standing there against the background of mellow light her hair coiled low on her neck while numerous intractable locks curled about her ears and temples it was small wonder that Darrell s eyes bespoke his admiration and love even if his lips did not Writing at this time of night he exclaimed we supposed you asleep long ago Sh don t speak so loud she protested You ll have Aunt Marcia up here I have nearly finished my writing so you needn t scold Glancing at the large journal lying open on her desk Darrell asked with a quizzical smile Couldn t that have been postponed for a few hours Not to night she replied with emphasis ordinarily you know it could and would have been postponed perhaps indefinitely but not to night She glanced shyly into his eyes and her own fell as she added in a lower tone To night has memories so golden I want to preserve them before they have been dimmed by even one hour s sleep Darrell s face grew marvellously tender he drew her head down upon his breast while he caressed the rippling hair with its waves of light and shade This night will always have golden memories for me Kathie he said and neither days nor years can ever dim their lustre of that I am sure Kate raised her head drawing herself slightly away from his embrace so that she could look him in the face Kathie she repeated softly that is the second time you have called me by that name to night I never heard it before where did you get it Oh it came to me he said smiling and somehow it seemed just the name for you but I ll not call you so unless you like it I do like it immensely she replied I am tired of Kate and Kittie and Aunt Marcia s terrible Katherine I am glad you are original enough to call me by something different but it sounds so odd I wondered if there might have been a Kathie in the past But she added quickly I must not stay here I just came out to say good night to you We had better say good morning Darrell laughed as the clock in the hall below chimed one of the wee sma hours promise me that you will go to rest at once won t you Very soon she answered smiling then a sudden impulsiveness conquering her reserve she exclaimed Do you know this has been the happiest night of my whole life I hardly dare go to sleep for fear I will wake up and find it all a dream For answer Darrell folded her close to his breast kissing her hair and brow with passionate tenderness then suddenly neither knew just how their lips met in long lingering rapturous kisses Will that make it seem more real sweetheart he asked in a low voice vibrating with emotion Yes oh yes she panted half frightened by his fervor but let me go please do He released her only retaining her hands for an instant which he bent and kissed then bidding her good night he hastened down the hall to his room At the door however he looked back and saw her still standing where he had left her She wafted him a kiss on her finger tips and disappeared Going to her desk she read with shining eyes and smiling lips the last lines written in her journal then dipped her pen as though to write further hesitated and closing the book whispered That is too sacred to intrust even to you you dear old journal I shall keep it locked in my own breast Then locking her desk and turning off the light she stole noiselessly to her room Chapter XVI THE AFTERMATH As Darrell entered his room its dim solitude seemed doubly grateful after the glare of the crowded rooms he had lately left His brain whirled from the unusual excitement He wanted to be alone with his own thoughts alone with this new overpowering joy and assure himself of its reality He seated himself by an open window till the air had cooled his brow and his brain under the mysterious soothing influence of the night grew less confused then partially disrobing he threw himself upon his bed to rest but not to sleep Again he lived over the last few weeks at The Pines comprehending at last the gracious influence which entering into his barren meagre life had rendered it so inexpressibly rich and sweet and complete Ah how blind to have walked day after day hand in hand with Love not knowing that he entertained an angel unawares And then had followed the revelation when the scales had fallen from his eyes before the vision of lovely maiden womanhood which had suddenly confronted him He recalled her as she stood awaiting his tardy recognition recalled her every word and look throughout the evening down to their parting and again he seemed to hold her in his arms to look into her eyes to feel her head upon his breast her kisses on his lips But even with the remembrance of those moments while yet he felt the pressure of her lips upon his own pure and cool like the dewy petals of a rose at sunrise there came to him the first consciousness of pain mingled with the rapture the first dash of bitter in the sweet as he recalled the question in her eyes and the half whispered I wondered if there might have been a Kathie in the past The past How could he for one moment have forgotten that awful shadow overhanging his life As it suddenly loomed before him in its hideous blackness Darrell started from his pillow in horror a cold sweat bursting from every pore Gradually the terrible significance of it all dawned upon him the realization of what he had done and of what he must as best he might undo It meant the relinquishment of what was sweetest and holiest on earth just as it seemed within his grasp the renunciation of all that had made life seem worth living Darrell buried his face in his hands and groaned aloud So it was only a mockery a dream He recalled Kate s words I hardly dare go to sleep for fear I will wake up and find it all a dream and self reproach and remorse added their bitterness to his agony What right had he to bring that bright young life under the cloud overhanging his own to wreck her happiness by contact with his own misfortune What would it be for her when she came to know the truth as she must know it and how was he to tell her In his anguish he groaned God pity us both and be merciful to her For more than an hour he walked the room then kneeling by the bed just as a pale silvery streak appeared along the eastern horizon he cried O God leave me not in darkness give me some clew to the vanished past that I may know whether or not I have the right to this most precious of all thine earthly gifts And burying his face he strove as never before to pierce the darkness enveloping his brain Long he knelt there his hands clinching the bedclothes convulsively even the muscles of his body tense and rigid under the terrible mental strain he was undergoing while at times his powerful frame shook with agony The silvery radiance crept upward over the deep blue dome the stars dwindled to glimmering points of light then faded one by one a roseate flush tinged the eastern sky growing and deepening and the first golden rays were shooting upward from a sea of crimson flame as Darrell rose from his knees He walked to the window but even the sunlight seemed to mock him there was no light for him no rift in the cloud darkening his path and with a heavy sigh he turned away The struggle was not yet over this was to be a day of battle with himself and he nerved himself for the coming ordeal After a cold bath he dressed and descended to the breakfast room It was still early but mister Underwood was already at the table and missus Dean entered a moment later from the kitchen where she had been giving directions for breakfast for Kate and her guests Both were shocked at Darrell s haggard face and heavy eyes but by a forced cheerfulness he succeeded in diverting the scrutiny of the one and the anxious solicitude of the other mister Underwood returned to his paper and his sister and Darrell had the conversation to themselves Last night s dissipation proved too much for me Darrell said playfully in reply to some protest of missus Dean s regarding his light appetite You don t look fit to go down town she exclaimed you had better stay at home and help Katherine entertain her guests I noticed you seemed to be very popular with them last night I m afraid I would prove a sorry entertainer Darrell answered lightly as he rose from the table so you will kindly excuse me to Miss Underwood and her friends Aren t you going to wait and ride down mister Underwood inquired Not this morning Darrell replied a brisk walk will do me good And a moment later they heard his firm step on the gravelled driveway mister Underwood having finished his reading of the morning paper passed it to his sister Pretty good write up of last night s affair he commented as he replaced his spectacles in their case Is there I ll look it up after breakfast I haven t my glasses now missus Dean replied I thought myself that everything passed off pretty well What did you think of Katherine last night David The lines about his mouth deepened as he answered quietly She ll do if she is my child I didn t see any finer than she and old Stockton s daughter with all her father s millions couldn t touch her I had no idea the child was so beautiful missus Dean continued she seemed to come out so unexpectedly some way just like a flower unfolding I never was so surprised in my life I guess the little girl took a good many of em by surprise judging by appearances mister Underwood remarked a shrewd smile lighting his stern features Yes she received a great deal of attention rejoined his sister I suppose she added thoughtfully she ll have lots of admirers round here now No she won t mister Underwood retorted with decision at the same time pushing back his chair and rising hastily I ll see to it that she doesn t If the right man steps up and means business all right but I ll have no hangers on or fortune hunters dawdling about His sister watched him curiously with a faint smile You had better advertise for the kind of man you want she said dryly and state that none others need apply as a warning to applicants whom you might consider undesirable mister Underwood turned quickly What are you driving at he demanded impatiently I ve no time for beating about the bush And I ve no time for explanations she replied with exasperating calmness you can think it over at your leisure With a contemptuous Humph mister Underwood left the house After he had gone his sister sat for a while in deep thought then with a sigh rose and went about her accustomed duties She had been far more keen than her brother to observe the growing intimacy between her niece and Darrell and she had seen some indications on the previous evening which troubled her as much on Darrell s account as Kate s for she had become deeply attached to the young man and she well knew that her brother would not look upon him with favor as a suitor for his daughter Meanwhile Darrell on reaching the office found work and study alike impossible The room seemed narrow and stifling the medley of sound from the adjoining offices and from the street was distracting He recalled the companions of his earlier days of pain and conflict the mountains and his heart yearned for their restful silence for the soothing and uplifting of their solemn presence Having left a brief note on mister Underwood s desk he closed his office and leaving the city behind him started on foot up the familiar canyon road After a walk of an hour or more he left the road and striking into a steep narrow trail began the ascent of one of the mountains of the main range It still lacked a little of midday when he at last found himself on a narrow bench near the summit in a small growth of pines and firs He stopped from sheer exhaustion and looked about him Not a sign of human life was visible not a sound broke the stillness save an occasional breath of air murmuring through the pines and the trickling of a tiny rivulet over the rocks just above where he stood Going to the little stream he caught the crystal drops as they fell quenching his thirst and bathing his heated brow then somewhat refreshed he braced himself for the inevitable conflict Slowly he paced up and down the rocky ledge giving no heed to the passage of time all his faculties centred upon the struggle between the inexorable demands of conscience on the one hand and the insatiate cravings of a newly awakened passion on the other Vainly he strove to find some middle ground Gradually as his brain grew calm the various courses of action which had at first suggested themselves to his mind appeared weak and cowardly and the only course open to him was that of renunciation and of self immolation With a bitter cry he threw himself face downward upon the ground A long time he lay there till at last the peace from the great pitying heart of Nature touched his heart and he slept on the warm bosom of Mother Earth as a child on its mother s breast The sun was sinking towards the western ranges and slowly lengthening shadows were creeping athwart the distant valleys when Darrell rose to his feet and after silently drinking in the beauty of the scene about him prepared to descend His face bore traces of the recent struggle but it was the face of one who had conquered whose mastery of himself was beyond all doubt or question He took the homeward trail with firm step with head erect with face set and determined and there was in his bearing that which indicated that there would be no wavering no swerving from his purpose His own hand had closed and bolted the gates of the Eden whose sweets he had but just tasted and his conscience held the flaming sword which was henceforth to guard those portals A little later as Darrell in the early twilight passed up the driveway to The Pines he was conscious only of a dull leaden weight within his breast his very senses seemed benumbed and he almost believed himself incapable of further suffering till as he approached the house the sight of Kate seated in the veranda with her father and aunt and the thought of the suffering yet in store for her thrilled him anew with most poignant pain His face was in the shadow as he came up the steps and only Kate seated near him saw its pallor She started and would have uttered an exclamation but something in its expression awed and restrained her There was a grave tenderness in his eyes as they met hers but the light and joy which had been there when last she looked into them had gone out and in their place were dark gloom and despair She heard as in a dream his answers to the inquiries of her father and aunt heard him pass into the house accompanied by her aunt who had prepared a substantial lunch against his return and with a strange sinking at her heart sat silently awaiting his coming out It had been a trying day for her On waking her happiness had seemed complete but Darrell s absence on that morning of all mornings had seemed to her inexplicable and when her guests had taken their departure and the long day wore on without his return and with no message from him an indefinable dread haunted her She had watched eagerly for Darrell s return believing that one look into his face would banish her forebodings but instead she had read there only a confirmation of her fears And now she waited in suspense longing yet dreading to hear his step At last he came and as he faced the light Kate was shocked at the change which so few hours had wrought He too was touched by the piteous appeal in her eyes and there was a rare tenderness in voice and smile as he suggested a stroll through the grounds according to their custom which somewhat reassured her Perhaps mister Underwood and his sister had observed the old shadow of gloom in Darrell s face and surmised something of its cause for their eyes followed the young people in their walk up and down under the pines and a softened look stole into their usually impassive faces At last as they passed out of sight on one of the mountain terraces missus Dean said with slight hesitation Did it ever occur to you David that Katherine and mister Darrell are thrown in each other s society a great deal mister Underwood shot a keen glance at his sister from under his heavy brows as he replied Come to think of it I suppose they are though I can t say as I ve ever given the matter much thought Perhaps it s time you did think about it Come Marcia said her brother good humoredly come to the point are you woman like scenting a love affair in that direction missus Dean found herself unexpectedly cornered I don t say that there is but I don t know what else you could expect of two young folks like them thrown together constantly as they are Well said mister Underwood with an air of comic perplexity do you want me to send Darrell adrift or shall I pack Puss off to a convent Now David I m serious his sister remonstrated mildly Of course I don t know that anything will come of it but if you don t want that anything should I think it s your duty for Katherine s sake and mister Darrell s also to prevent it I think too much of them both to see any trouble come to either of them mister Underwood puffed at his pipe in silence while the gleaming needles in his sister s fingers clicked with monotonous regularity When he spoke his tones lacked their usual brusqueness and had an element almost of gentleness Was this what was in your mind this morning Marcia Well maybe so his sister assented I don t think Marcia that I need any one to tell me my duty especially regarding my child I have my own plans for her future and I will allow nothing to interfere with them And as for John Darrell he has the good sterling sense to know that anything more than friendship between him and Kate is not to be thought of for a moment and I can trust to his honor as a gentleman that he will not go beyond it So I rather think your anxieties are groundless Perhaps so his sister answered doubtfully but young folks are not generally governed much by common sense in things of this kind and then you know David Katherine is different from us she grows more and more like her mother and if she once got her heart set on any one I don t think anybody even you could make her change The muscles of mister Underwood s face suddenly contracted as though by acute pain That will do Marcia he said gravely with a silencing wave of his hand there is no need to call up the past I know Kate is like her mother but she has my blood in her veins also enough that when the time comes she ll not let any childish sentimentality stand in the way of what I think is for her good missus Dean silently folded her knitting and rose to go into the house At the door however she paused and looking back at her brother said in her low even tones I have said my last word of this affair David no matter what comes of it You think you understand Katherine better than I but you may find some day that it s better to prevent trouble than to try to cure it Meanwhile Darrell and Kate had reached their favorite seat beneath the pines and after one or two futile attempts at talking had lapsed into a constrained silence To Kate there came a sudden realization that the merely friendly relations heretofore existing between them had been swept away that henceforth she must either give the man at her side the concentrated affection of her whole being or should he prove unworthy she glanced at his haggard face and could not complete the supposition even to herself He was troubled and her tender heart longed to comfort him but his strange appearance held her back At one word one sign of love from him she would have thrown herself upon his breast and begged to share his burden in true woman fashion but he was so cold so distant he did not even take her hand as in the careless happy days before either of them thought of love Kate could endure the silence no longer and ventured some timid word of loving sympathy Darrell turned facing her his dark eyes strangely hollow and sunken Yes he said in a low voice God knows I have suffered since I saw you but I deserve to suffer for having so far forgotten myself last night That is not what is troubling me now it is the thought of the sorrow and wretchedness I have brought into your pure innocent life that you must suffer for my folly my wrong doing But interposed Kate I don t understand what wrong have you done Kathie he answered brokenly it was all a mistake a terrible mistake of mine Can you forgive me Can you forget God grant you can Forgive Forget she exclaimed in bewildered tones a mistake her voice faltered and she paused her face growing deathly pale I cannot think he continued how I came to so forget myself the circumstances under which I am here the kindness you and your people have shown me and the trust they have reposed in me I must have been beside myself But I have no excuse to offer I can only ask your forgiveness and that I may so far as possible undo what has been done While he was speaking she had drawn away from him and sitting proudly erect she scanned his face in the waning light as though to read there the full significance of his meaning Her cheeks blanched at his last words but there was no tremor in her tones as she replied I understand you to refer to what occurred last night is that what you wish undone what you would have me forget I would give worlds if only it might be undone he answered but that is an impossibility Oh Kathie I know how monstrous how cruel this must seem to you but it is the only honorable course left me after my stupidity my cursed folly and believe me it is far more of a kindness even to you to stop this wretched business right here than to carry it farther It is not necessary to consider my feelings in the matter mister Darrell If as you say you found yourself mistaken to attempt after that to carry on what could only be a mere farce would be simply unpardonable A mistake I could forgive a deliberate deception never The tones so unlike Kate s caused Darrell to turn in pained surprise The deepening shadows hid the white drawn face and quivering lips he saw only the motionless slender figure held so rigidly erect But Kathie Miss Underwood you must have misunderstood me he said earnestly I have acted foolishly but in no way falsely You could not under any circumstances accuse me of deception I beg your pardon mister Darrell she interposed more gently I did not intend to accuse you of deception I only meant that regardless of any personal feeling it was as you said better to stop this that to carry it farther after you had found you did not care for me as you supposed or as I was led to suppose She paused an instant uncertain how to proceed Kathie Kathie what are you saying Darrell exclaimed What have I said that you should so misunderstand me But she protested piteously struggling to control her voice did you not say that it was all a mistake on your part that you wished it all undone What else could I understand My poor child said Darrell tenderly then reaching over and possessing himself of one of her hands he continued gravely The mistake was mine in that I ever allowed myself to think of loving you when love is not for me I have no right Kathie to love you or any other woman as I am now I did not know until last night that I did love you Then it came upon me like a revelation a revelation so overwhelming that it swept all else before it You and you alone filled my thoughts Wherever I was I saw you heard you and you only Again and again in imagination I clasped you to my breast I felt your kisses on my lips just as I afterwards felt them in reality He paused a moment and dropped the hand he had taken Under cover of the shadows Kate s tears were falling unchecked one falling on Darrell s hand had warned him that there must be no weakening no softening His voice was almost stern as he resumed For those few hours I forgot that I was a being apart from the rest of the world exiled to darkness and oblivion forgot the obligations to myself and to others which my own condition imposes upon me But the dream passed I awoke to a realization of what I had done and whatever I have suffered since is but the just penalty of my folly The worst of all is that I have involved you in needless suffering I have won your love only to have to put it aside to renounce it But even this is better far better than to allow your young life to come one step farther within the clouds that envelop my own Do you understand me now Kathie Yes she replied calmly I understand it from your view as it looks to you But is not that the only view She did not speak at once and when she did it was with a peculiar deliberation The clouds will lift one day what then Darrell s voice trembled with emotion as he replied We cannot trust to that for neither you nor I know what the light will reveal She remained silent and Darrell after a pause continued Don t make it harder for me Kathie there is but one course for us to follow in honor to ourselves or to each other They sat in silence for a few moments then both rose simultaneously to return to the house and as they did so Darrell was conscious of a new bearing in Kate s manner an added dignity and womanliness As they faced one another Darrell took both her hands in his saying What is it to be Kathie Can we return to the old friendship She stood for a moment with averted face watching the stars brightening one by one in the evening sky No she said presently we can never return to that now it would seem too bare too meagre There will always be something deeper and sweeter than mere friendship between us unless you fail me and I know you will not And do you forgive me he asked She turned then looking him full in the eyes and her own seemed to have caught the radiance of the stars themselves as she answered simply No John Darrell for there is nothing to forgive Chapter XVII SHE KNOWS HER FATHER S WILL IS LAW Though the succeeding days and weeks dragged wearily for Darrell he applied himself anew to work and study and only the lurking shadows within his eyes the deepening lines on his face the fast multiplying gleams of silver in his dark hair gave evidence of his suffering And if to Kate the summer seemed suddenly to have lost its glory and music if she found the round of social pleasures on which she had just entered grown strangely insipid if it sometimes seemed to her that she had quaffed all the richness and sweetness of life on that wondrous first night till only the dregs remained she gave no sign With her sunny smile and lightsome ways she reigned supreme both in society and in the home and none but her aunt and Darrell missed the old time rippling laughter or noted the deepening wistfulness and seriousness of the fair young face Her father watched her with growing pride and with a visible satisfaction which told of carefully laid plans known only to himself whose consummation he deemed not far distant Acting on the suggestion of his sister he had been closely observant of both Kate and Darrell but any conclusions which he formed he kept to himself and went his way apparently well satisfied At the close of an unusually busy day late in the summer Darrell was seated alone in his office reviewing his life in the West and vaguely wondering what would yet be the outcome of it all when mister Underwood entered from the adjoining room Exultation and elation were patent in his very step but Darrell lost in thought was hardly conscious even of his presence Well my boy what are you mooning over mister Underwood asked good naturedly noting Darrell s abstraction Only trying to find a solution for problems as yet insoluble Darrell answered with a smile that ended in a sigh Stick to the practical side of life boy and let the problems solve themselves A very good rule to follow provided the problems would solve themselves commented Darrell Those things generally work themselves out after a while said mister Underwood walking up and down the room I say don t meddle with what you can t understand take what you can understand and make a practical application of it That s always been my motto and if people would stick to that principle in commercial life in religion and everything else there d be fewer failures in business less wrangling in the churches and more good accomplished generally I guess you are about right there Darrell admitted Been pretty busy to day haven t you mister Underwood asked abruptly after a short pause Yes uncommonly so work is increasing of late That s good Well it has been a busy day with us rather an eventful one in fact one which Walcott and I will remember with pleasure I trust for a good many years to come How is that Darrell inquired wondering at the pleasurable excitement in the elder man s tones We made a little change in the partnership to day Walcott is now an equal partner with myself Darrell remained silent from sheer astonishment mister Underwood evidently considered his silence an indication of disapproval for he continued I know you don t like the man Darrell so there s no use of arguing that side of the question but I tell you he has proved himself invaluable to me You might not think it but it s a fact that the business in this office has increased fifty per cent since he came into it He is thoroughly capable responsible honest just the sort of man that I can intrust the business to as I grow older and know that it will be carried on as well as though I was at the helm myself Still a half interest seems pretty large for a man with no more capital in the business than he has said Darrell determined to make no personal reference to Walcott He has put in fifty thousand additional since he came in mister Underwood replied Darrell whistled softly Oh he has money all right I m satisfied of that I m satisfied that he could have furnished the money to begin with only he was lying low Well he certainly has nothing to complain of you ve done more than well by him No better proportionately than I would have done by you my boy if you had come in with me last spring when I asked you to I had this thing in view then and had made up my mind you d make the right man for the place but you wouldn t hear to it That s all right mister Underwood said Darrell I appreciate your kind intentions just the same but I am more than ever satisfied that I wouldn t have been the right man for the place Both men were silent for some little time but neither showed any inclination to terminate the interview mister Underwood was still pacing back and forth while Darrell had risen and was standing by the window looking out absently into the street That isn t all of it and I may as well tell you the rest said mister Underwood suddenly pausing near Darrell his manner much like a school boy who has a confession to make and hardly knows how to begin mister Walcott to day asked me asked my permission to pay his addresses to my daughter my little girl he added under his breath and there was a strange note of tenderness in the usually brusque voice If ever Darrell was thankful it was that he could at that moment look the father squarely in the face He turned facing mister Underwood his dark eyes fairly blazing And you gave your permission he asked slowly with terrible emphasis on each word Most assuredly mister Underwood retorted quickly stung to self defence by Darrell s look and tone I may add that I have had this thing in mind for some time have felt that it was coming in fact this new partnership arrangement was made with a view to facilitate matters and he was enough of a gentleman to come forward at once with his proposition Darrell gazed out of the window again with unseeing eyes mister Underwood he said in a low tone I would never have believed it possible that your infatuation for that man would have led to this There is no infatuation about it the elder man replied hotly it is a matter of good sound judgment and business calculation I know of no man among our townspeople or even in the State to whom I would give my daughter as soon as I would to Walcott There are others who may have larger means now but they haven t got his business ability With what I can give Puss what he has now and what he will make within the next few years she will have a home and position equal to the best Is that all you think of mister Underwood Not all by any means but it s a mighty important consideration just the same But the man is all right morally you with all your prejudice against him can t lay your finger on one flaw in his character mister Underwood said Darrell slowly I have studied that man I have heard him talk He has no conception of life beyond the sensual the animal he is a brute a beast in thought and act He is no more fit to marry your daughter or even to associate with her than Young man interrupted mister Underwood laughing good humoredly I have only one thing against you you are not exactly practical You are like my friend Britton inclined to rather high ideals We don t generally find men built according to those ideals and we have to take em as we find em But you will of course allow your daughter to act according to her own judgment You surely would not force her into any marriage distasteful to her Darrell asked remembering Kate s aversion for Walcott A young girl s judgment in those matters is not often to be relied upon Kate knows that I consider only her best interests and I think her judgment could be brought to coincide with my own At any rate she knows her father s will is law As Darrell convinced that argument would be useless made no reply mister Underwood added after a pause I know I can trust to your honor that you will not influence her against Walcott I shall not of course attempt to influence her one way or the other I have no right but if I had the right if she were my sister that man should never so much as touch the hem of her garment My boy said mister Underwood rather brusquely extending one hand and laying the other on Darrell s shoulder I understand and you re all right We all consider you one of ourselves and he added somewhat awkwardly you understand if conditions were not just as they are But conditions are just as they are Darrell interposed quickly so there is no use discussing what might be were they different The bitterness in his tones struck a chord of sympathy within the heart of the man beside him but he knew not how to express it and it is doubtful whether he would have voiced it had he known how The two clasped hands silently then without a word the elder man left the room Not until now had Darrell realized how strong had been the hope within his breast that some crisis in his condition might yet reveal enough to make possible the fulfilment of his love The pleasant relations between himself and Kate in many respects still remained practically unchanged True his sense of honor forbade any return to the tender familiarities of the past but there yet existed between them a tacit unspoken comradeship beneath which flowed deeply and silently the undercurrent of love not to be easily diverted or turned aside But this he now felt would soon be changed while all hope for the future must be abandoned With a heavy heart Darrell awaited developments He soon noted a marked increase in the frequency of Walcott s calls at The Pines and not caring to embarrass Kate by his presence he absented himself from the house as often as possible on those occasions Walcott himself must have been very soon aware that in his courtship mister Underwood was his sole partisan but he bore himself with a confidence and assurance which would brook no thought of defeat missus Dean knowing her brother as she did was quick to understand the situation and silently showed her disapproval but Walcott politely ignored her disfavor as not worth his consideration At first Kate considering him her father s guest received him with the same frank winning courtesy which she extended to others and he quick to make the most of every opportunity exerted himself to the utmost in his efforts to entertain his young hostess and her friends To a certain extent he succeeded in that Kate was compelled to admit to herself that he could be far more agreeable than she had ever supposed He had travelled extensively and was possessed of good descriptive powers his voice was low and musical and his eyes limpid and tender whenever he fixed them upon her face held her glance by some irresistible magnetic force and invariably brought the deepening color to her cheeks With the first inkling however of the nature of his visits all her old abhorrence of him returned with increased intensity but her ill concealed aversion only furnished him with a new incentive and spurred him to redouble his attentions The only opposition encountered by him that appeared in the least to disturb his equanimity was that of Duke which was on all occasions most forcibly expressed the latter never failing to greet him with a low growl meeting all overtures of friendship with an ominous gleam in his intelligent eyes and a display of ivory that made mister Walcott only too willing to desist Really Miss Underwood Walcott remarked one evening when Duke had been more than usually demonstrative your pet s attentions to me are sometimes a trifle distracting Could you not occasionally bestow the pleasure of his society upon some one else mister Darrell for instance I imagine the two might prove quite congenial to each other Please remember mister Walcott you are speaking of a friend of mine Kate replied coldly mister Darrell I beg pardon I meant no offence but since he and Duke seem to share the same unaccountable antipathy towards myself I naturally thought there would be a bond of sympathy between them Kate had been playing and was still seated at the piano idly waiting for Walcott who was turning the pages of a new music book to make another selection She now rose rather wearily and leaving the piano joined her father and aunt upon the veranda outside Walcott pushed the music from him and taking Kate s mandolin from off the piano followed Throwing himself down upon the steps at Kate s feet in an attitude of genuine Spanish abandon and grace he said lightly Since you will not favor us further I will see what I can do He possessed little technical knowledge of music but had quite a repertoire of songs picked up in his travels in various countries to which he could accompany himself upon the guitar or mandolin He strummed the strings carelessly for a moment then in a low voice began a Spanish love song There was no need of an interpreter to make known to Kate the meaning of the song The low sweet cadences were full of tender pleading every note was tremulous with passion while the dark eyes holding her own seemed burning into her very soul But the spell of the music worked far differently from Walcott s hopes or anticipations Even while angry at herself for listening Kate could scarcely restrain the tears for the tender love strains brought back so vividly the memory of those hours so brief and fleeting in which she had known the pure unalloyed joy of love that her heart seemed near bursting As the last lingering notes died away the pain was more than she could endure and pleading a slight headache she excused herself and went to her room Throwing herself upon the bed she gave way to her feelings sobbing bitterly as she recalled the sudden hopeless ending of the most perfect happiness her young life had ever known Gradually the violence of her grief subsided and she grew more calm but a dull pain was at her heart for though unwilling to admit it even to herself she was hurt at Darrell s absence on the occasions of Walcott s visits Why does he leave me when he knows I can t endure the sight of that man she soliloquized sorrowfully If he would stay by me the creature would not dare make love to me Oh if we could only just be lovers until all this dreadful uncertainty is past I m sure it would come out all right and I would gladly wait years for him if only he would let me As she sat alone in her misery she heard Walcott take his departure A little later Darrell returned and went to his room and soon after she heard her aunt s step in the hall followed by a quiet knock at her door Come in auntie she called wondering what her errand might be Have you gone to bed Katherine or are you up missus Dean inquired for the room was dark I m up why auntie Your father said to tell you he wanted to see you if you had not retired missus Dean stopped a moment to inquire for Kate s headache and as she left the room Kate heard her sigh heavily A happy thought occurred to Kate as she ran downstairs she would have her father put a stop to Walcott s attentions if he knew how they annoyed her he would certainly do it She entered the room where he waited with her sunniest smile for the stern gruff voiced man was the idol of her heart and she believed implicitly in his love for her even though it seldom found expression in words But her smile faded before the displeasure in her father s face He scrutinized her keenly from under his heavy brows but if he noted the traces of tears upon her face he made no comment I did not suppose Kate he said slowly for he could not bring himself to speak harshly to her I did not suppose that a child of mine would treat any guest of this house as rudely as you treated mister Walcott to night I sent for you for an explanation I did not mean to be rude papa Kate replied seating herself on her father s knee and laying one arm caressingly about his neck but he did annoy me so to night he has annoyed me so often of late I just couldn t endure it any longer Has mister Walcott ever conducted himself other than as a gentleman Why no papa he is gentlemanly enough so far as that is concerned I thought so her father interposed I should say that he had laid himself out to entertain you and your friends and to make it pleasant for all of us whenever he has been here It strikes me that his manners are very far from annoying that he is a gentleman in every sense of the word he certainly carried himself like one to night in the face of the treatment you gave him Well I m sorry if I was rude I have no objection to him as a gentleman or as an acquaintance if he would not go beyond that but I detest his attentions and his love making and he will not stop even when he sees that it annoys me No one has a better right to pay his attentions to you for he has asked and received my permission to do so Kate drew herself upright and gazed at her father with eyes full of horror You gave him permission to pay attention to me she exclaimed slowly as though scarcely comprehending his meaning then springing to her feet and drawing herself to her full height she demanded Do you mean papa that you intend me to marry him For an instant mister Underwood felt ill at ease Kate s face was white and her eyes had the look of a creature brought to bay that sees no escape from the death confronting it for even in that brief time Kate knowing her father s indomitable will realized with a sense of despair the hopelessness of her situation I suppose your marriage will be the outcome at least I hope so her father replied quickly recovering his composure for I certainly know of no one to whom I would so willingly intrust your future happiness Listen to me Kate have I not always planned and worked for your best interests You always have papa Have I not always chosen what was for your good and for your happiness Kate gave a silent assent Very well then I think you can trust to my judgment in this case But papa she protested this is different I never can love that man I abhor him loathe him Do you think there can be any happiness or good in a marriage without love Would you and mamma have been happy together if you had not loved each other No sooner had she spoken the words than she regretted them as she noted the look of pain that crossed her father s face In his silent undemonstrative way he had idolized his wife and it was seldom that he would allow any allusion to her in his presence I don t know why you should call up the past he said after a pause but since you have I will tell you that your mother when a girl like yourself objected to our marriage she thought that we were unsuited to each other and that we could never live happily together She listened however to the advice of those older and wiser than she and you know the result The strong man s voice trembled slightly I think our married life was a happy one It was for me I know I hope it was for her A long silence followed To Kate there came the memory of the frail young mother lying day after day upon her couch in the solitude of her sick room often weeping silently while she a mere child knelt sadly and wistfully beside her as silently wiping the tear drops as they fell and wondering at their cause She understood now but not for worlds would she have spoken one word to pain her father s heart At last mister Underwood said rising as though to end the interview I think I can depend upon you now Kate to carry out my wishes in this matter Kate rose proudly I have never disobeyed you papa I will treat mister Walcott courteously but even though you force me to marry him I will never never love him and I shall tell him so Her father smiled mister Walcott I think has too much good sense to attach much weight to any girlish whims that will pass you will think differently by and by As she stopped for her usual good night kiss she threw her arms about her father s neck and looking appealingly into his face said Papa it need not be very soon need it You are not in a hurry to be rid of your little girl Don t talk foolishly child he answered hastily you know I ve no wish to be rid of you but I do want to see you settled in a home of your own equal to the best and as I said a while ago and told mister Darrell in talking the matter over with him I know of no one in whose hands I would so willingly place you and your happiness as mister Walcott s As for the date and other matters of that sort he added playfully pinching her cheeks I suppose those will all be mutually arranged between the gentleman and yourself Kate had started back slightly You have talked this over with mister Darrell she exclaimed Yes why not What did he think of it Well said her father slowly naturally he did not quite fall in with my views for I think he is not just what you could call a disinterested party I more than half suspect that mister Darrell would like to step into mister Walcott s place himself if he were only eligible but knowing that he is not he is too much of a gentleman to commit himself in any way mister Underwood scanned his daughter s face keenly as he spoke but it was as impassive as his own To Kate Darrell s absences of late were now explained he understood it all She kissed her father silently You know Puss I am looking out for your best interests in all of this said her father a little troubled by her silence I know that is your intention papa she replied with gentle gravity and left the room Chapter XVIII ON THE DIVIDE Summer had merged into autumn Crisp exhilarating mornings ushered in glorious days flooded with sunshine followed by sparkling frosty nights The strike at the mining camp had been adjusted the union boarding house after two months was found a failure and abandoned and the strikers gradually returned to their work mister Underwood during the shut down had improved the time to enlarge the mill and add considerable new machinery this work was now nearly completed in two weeks the mill would again be running and he offered Darrell his old position as assayer in charge which the latter somewhat to mister Underwood s surprise accepted Although his city business was now quite well established Darrell felt that life at The Pines was becoming unendurable Walcott s visits were now so frequent it was impossible longer to avoid him The latter s air of easy self assurance the terms of endearment which fell so flippantly from his lips and his bold passionate glances which never failed to bring the rich warm blood to Kate s cheeks and brow all to one possessing Darrell s fine chivalric nature and his delicacy of feeling were intolerable In addition the growing indications of Kate s unhappiness the silent appeal in her eyes the pathetic curves forming about her mouth and the touch of pathos in the voice whose every tone was music to his ear seemed at times more than he could bear There were hours silent brooding hours of the night when he was sorely tempted to defy past and future alike and despite the conditions surrounding himself to rescue her from a life which could have in store for her nothing but bitterness and sorrow But with the dawn his better judgment returned conscience inexorable as ever still held sway he kept his own counsel as in duty bound going his way with a heart that grew heavier day by day and was hence glad of an opportunity to return once more to the seclusion of the mountains Kate realizing that all further appeal to her father was useless as a last resort trusted to Walcott s sense of honor that when he should fully understand her feelings towards himself he would discontinue his attentions But in this she found herself mistaken Taking advantage of the courtesy which she extended to him in accordance with the promise given her father he pressed his suit more ardently than ever Why do you persist in annoying me in this manner she demanded one day indignantly withdrawing from his attempted caresses The fact that my father has given you his permission to pay attention to me does not warrant any such familiarity on your part Perhaps not Walcott replied in his low musical tones but stolen waters are often sweetest If I have offended pardon I supposed my love for you would justify me in offering any expression of it but since you say I have no right to do so I beg of you my dear Miss Underwood to give me that right That is impossible Kate answered firmly Why impossible he asked Because I will not accept any expressions of a love that I cannot reciprocate Love begets love he argued softly so long as you keep me at arm s length you have no means of knowing whether or not you could reciprocate my affection mister Underwood has done me the great honor to consent to bestow his daughter s hand upon me and I have no doubt of yet winning the consent of the lady herself if she will but give me a fair chance mister Walcott said Kate her eyes ablaze with indignation would you make a woman your wife who did not love you who never could under any circumstances love you Walcott suddenly seized her hands in his looking down into her eyes with his steady dominant gaze If I loved her as I love you he said slowly I would make her my wife though she hated me and win her love afterwards I can win it and I will Never Kate exclaimed passionately but he had kissed her hands and was gone before she could recover herself In that look she had for the first time comprehended something of the man s real nature of the powerful brute force concealed beneath the smooth smiling exterior Her heart seemed seized and held in a vise like grip while a cold benumbing despair settled upon her like an incubus which she was unable to throw off for days It lacked only two days of the time set for Darrell s return to the mining camp when he and Kate set out one afternoon accompanied by Duke for a ride up the familiar canyon road At first their ponies cantered briskly but as the road grew more rough and steep they were finally content to walk quietly side by side For a while neither Darrell nor Kate had much to say Their hearts were too oppressed for words Each realized that this little jaunt into the mountains was their last together that it constituted a sort of farewell to their happy life of the past summer and to each other Each was thinking of their first meeting under the pines on that evening gorgeous with the sunset rays and sweet with the breath of June roses At last they turned into a trail which soon grew so steep and narrow that they dismounted and fastening their ponies proceeded up the trail on foot Slowly they wended their way upward pausing at length on a broad projecting ledge a little below the summit where they seated themselves on the rocks to rest a while Kate s eyes wandered afar over the wonderful scene before them wrapped in unbroken silence yet palpitating in the mellow golden sunlight with a mysterious life and beauty all its own But Darrell was for once oblivious to the scene his eyes were fastened on Kate s face a look in them of insatiable hunger as though he were storing up the memory of every line and lineament against the barren days to come He wondered if the silent calm faced self contained woman beside him could be the laughing joyous maiden whom he had seen flitting among the trees and fountains at their first meeting little more than three months past He recalled how he had then thought her unlike either her father or her aunt and believed her to be wholly without their self restraint and self repression Now he saw that the same stoical blood was in her veins Already the sensitive mobile face which had mirrored every emotion of the impulsive sympathetic soul within bore something of the impassive calm of the rocks surrounding them it might have been chiselled in marble so devoid was it at that moment of any trace of feeling A faint sigh seemed to break the spell and she turned facing him with her old time sunny smile What a regal day she exclaimed It is he replied it was on such a day as this about a year ago that I first met mister Britton He called it I remember one of the coronation days of the year I have been reminded of the phrase and of him all day Dear mister Britton said Kate I have not seen him for more than two years He has always been like a second father to me he used to have me call him papa when I was little and I ve always loved him next to papa You and he correspond do you not Yes he writes rather irregularly but his letters are precious to me He was the first to make me feel that this cramped fettered life of mine held any good or anything worth living for He made me ashamed of my selfish sorrow and every message from him no matter how brief seems like an inspiration to something higher and nobler He makes us all conscious of our selfishness Kate answered for if ever there was an unselfish life a life devoted to the alleviation of the sufferings and sorrows of others it is his I wish he were here now she added with a sigh he has more influence with papa than all the rest of us combined though perhaps nothing even he might say would be availing in this instance In all their friendly intercourse of the last few weeks there had been one subject tacitly avoided by each to which although present in the mind of each no reference was ever made From Kate s last words Darrell knew that subject must now be met he must know from her own lips the worst He turned sick with dread and remained silent A moment later Kate again faced him with a smile but her eyes glistened with unshed tears Poor papa she said softly her lips quivering he thinks he is doing it all for my happiness and no matter what wretchedness or misery I suffer no knowledge of it shall ever pain his dear old heart Kathie must it be Darrell exclaimed each word vibrating with anguish is there no hope no chance of escape for you from such a fate I cannot see the slightest reason to hope for escape she replied with the calmness born of despair She clasped her small hands tightly and turned a pale determined face towards Darrell You know you understand it all and I know that you do she said so there is no use in our avoiding this any longer I want to talk it over with you and tell you all the truth so you will not think by and by that I have been false or fickle or weak but first there is something I want you to tell me She paused a moment then looking him full in the eyes she asked earnestly John Darrell do you still love me Startled out of his customary self control Darrell suddenly clasped her in his arms exclaiming Kathie darling how can you ask such a question Do you think my love for you could ever grow less For a moment her head nestled against his breast with a little movement of ineffable content as she replied No it was not that I doubted your love but I wanted an assurance of it to carry with me through the coming days Then gently withdrawing herself from his embrace she continued in the same calm even tones You ask if there is no chance of escape I can see absolutely none but I want you to understand if I am forced into this marriage which papa has planned for me that it is not through any weakness or cowardice on my part that if I yield it will be simply because of the love and reverence I bear my father Though her face was slightly averted Darrell could see the tear drops falling but after a slight pause she proceeded as calmly as before In all these years he has tried to be both father and mother to me and even in this he thinks he is acting for my good I have never disobeyed him and were I to do so now I believe it would break his heart I am all that he has left and after what he has suffered in his silent Spartan way I must bring joy not sorrow to his declining years And this will be my only reason for yielding But Kathie dear child Darrell interposed have you considered what such a life means to you what is involved in such a sacrifice She met his troubled gaze with a smile Yes I know she replied there is not a phase of this affair which I have not considered I am years older than when we met three months ago and I have thought of everything that a woman can think of She watched him a moment the smile on her lips deepening Have you considered this she asked Only those whom we love have the power to wound us deeply one whom I do not love will have little power to hurt me he can never reach my heart that will be safe in your keeping Darrell bowed his head upon his hands with a low moan Kate laying her hand lightly upon his shoulder continued What I particularly wanted you to know before our parting and to remember is this that come what may I shall never be false to my love for you No matter what the future may bring to you or to me my heart will be yours Darrell raised his head his face tense and rigid with emotion she had risen and was standing beside him I can never forgive myself for having won your heart Kathie he said gravely It is the most precious gift that I could ask or you could bestow but one to which I have no right Then hold it in trust she said softly until such time as I have the right to bestow it upon you and you have the right to accept it Startled not only by her words but by the gravity of her tone and manner Darrell glanced swiftly towards Kate but she had turned and was slowly climbing the mountain path Springing to his feet he was quickly at her side Drawing her arm within his own he assisted her up the rocky trail scanning her face as he did so for some clew to the words she had just spoken But excepting a faint flush which deepened under his scrutiny she gave no sign and the trail for the next half hour being too difficult to admit of conversation they made the ascent in silence On reaching the summit an involuntary exclamation burst from Darrell at the grandeur of the scene North west and south far as the eye could reach stretched the vast mountain ranges unbroken with here and there gigantic peaks snow crowned standing in bold relief against the sky while far to the eastward lay the valleys threaded with silver streams and beyond them in the purple distance outlines of other ranges scarcely distinguishable from the clouds against which they seemed to rest Kate watched Darrell silently enjoying his surprise This is my favorite resort on the summit of the divide she said I thought you would appreciate it It involves hard climbing but it is worth the effort Worth the effort Yes a thousand times What must it be to see the sunrise here Lifted out of themselves they wandered over the rocks picking the late flowers which still lingered in the crevices watching the shifting beauty of the scene from various points for a time forgetful of their trouble till looking in each other s eyes they read the final farewell underlying all and the old pain returned with tenfold intensity Seating themselves on the highest point accessible they talked of the future ignoring so far as possible the one dreaded subject speaking of Darrell s life in the mining camp of his studies and of what he hoped to accomplish and of certain plans of her own Duke after an extended tour among the rocks came and lay at their feet watching their faces with anxious solicitude quick to read their unspoken sorrow though unable to divine its cause At last the little that could be said had been spoken they paused their hearts oppressed with the burden of what remained unsaid which no words could express Duke perplexed by the long silence rose and coming to Kate s side stood looking into her eyes with mute inquiry As Kate caressed the noble head she turned suddenly to Darrell John would you like to have Duke with you Will you take him as a parting gift from me I would like to have him above anything you could give me Kathie he replied but you must not think of giving him up to me I will have to give him up she said simply Papa dislikes him already he is so unfriendly to mister Walcott and he himself absolutely hates Duke I believe he would kill him if he dared so you understand I could not keep him much longer He will be happy with you for he loves you and I will be happy in remembering that you have him In that case said Darrell I shall be only too glad to take him and you can rest assured I will never part with him The sinking sun warned them that it was time to return and after one farewell look about them they prepared to descend As they picked their way back to the trail they came upon two tiny streams flowing from some secret spring above them Side by side separated by only a few inches they rippled over their rocky bed murmuring to each other in tones so low that only an attentive ear could catch them sparkling in the sunlight as though for very joy Suddenly near the edge of the narrow plateau over which they ran they turned and with a tinkling plash of farewell plunged in opposite directions the one eastward hastening on its way to the Great Father of Waters the other westward bound towards the land of the setting sun Silently Kate and Darrell watched them as their eyes met his face had grown white but Kate smiled though the tears trembled on the golden lashes A fit emblem of our loves Kathie Darrell said sadly Yes she replied but her clear voice had a ring of triumph a fit emblem dear for though parted now they will meet in the commingling of the oceans just as by and by our loves will mingle in the great ocean of love I can imagine how those two little streams will go on their way as we must go each joining in the labor and song of the rivers as they meet them but each preserving its own individuality until they find one another in the ocean currents as we shall find one another some day Kathie said Darrell earnestly drawing nearer to her have you such a hope as that It is more than hope she answered it is assurance an assurance that came to me I know not whence or how out of the darkness of despair They had reached the trail and here Kate paused for a moment It was a picture for an artist the pair standing on that solitary height The young girl fair and slender as the wild flowers clinging to the rocks at their feet yet with a poise of conscious strength the man at her side broad shouldered deep chested strong limbed his face dark with despair hers lighted with hope Suddenly a small white hand swept the horizon with a swift undulatory motion that reminded Darrell of the flight of some white winged bird and Kate cried Did we think of the roughness and steepness of the path below when we stood here two hours ago and looked on the glory of this scene Did we stop to think of the bruises and scratches of the ascent of how many times we had stumbled or of the weariness of the way No it was all forgotten And so when we come to stand together by and by upon the heights of love such love as we have not even dreamed of yet will we then look back upon the tears the pain the heartache of to day Will we stop to recount the sorrows through which we climbed to the shining heights No they will be forgotten in the excess of joy Darrell gazed at Kate in astonishment her head was uncovered and the rays of the sinking sun touched with gleams of gold the curling locks which the breeze had blown about her face till they seemed like a golden halo she had the look of one who sees within the veil which covers mortal faces she seemed at that moment something apart from earth Taking her hand in his he asked brokenly Sweetheart will that day ever come and when Her eyes luminous with love and hope rested tenderly upon his shadowed face as she replied At the time appointed And that will be God s own good time for you and me Chapter XIX THE RETURN TO CAMP BIRD The day preceding Darrell s departure found him busily engaged in breaking camp as he termed it The assayer s outfit which he had brought from the mill was to be packed as were also his books and quantities of carefully written notes the results of his explorations and experiments to be embodied later in the work which he had in preparation were to be sorted and filed Late in the afternoon Kate and her aunt down town on a shopping tour looked in upon him Buried up to his ears Kate announced at the door as she caught a glimpse of Darrell s head over a table piled high with books and manuscripts it s well we came when we did auntie a few minutes later and he would have been invisible Don t take the trouble to look for seats mister Darrell she added her eyes dancing with mischief as he hastily emerged and began a futile search for vacant chairs we only dropped in for a minute and standing room only will be sufficient Yes don t let us hinder you mister Darrell said missus Dean we just came in to see how you were getting on and to tell you not to trouble yourself about the things from the house we will send and get them whenever we want them I was thinking of those a while ago Darrell answered glancing at the pictures and hangings which had not yet been removed I was wondering if I ought not to send them up to the house No said missus Dean we do not need them there at present and any time we should want them we can send Bennett down after them We will not send for them at all auntie said Kate in her impulsive way I shall keep the room looking as much as possible as when mister Darrell had it and I shall use it as a waiting room whenever I have to wait for papa it will be much pleasanter than waiting in that dusty musty old office of his My room at the camp will look very bare and plain now said Darrell after all the luxuries with which you have surrounded me though I will of course get accustomed to it in a few days Kate and her aunt slyly exchanged smiles which Darrell in his momentary abstraction failed to observe They chatted pleasantly for a few moments but underneath the light words and manner was a sadness that could not be disguised and it was with a still heavier heart that Darrell returned to his work after Kate and her aunt had gone At last all was done the last package was stowed away in the large wagon which was to carry the goods to camp and the team moved up the street in the direction of The Pines where it was to remain over night ready for an early start the next morning Darrell after a farewell survey of the little room followed on foot heartsick and weary going directly to the stables to see the wagon safely stored for the night He was surprised to see a second wagon loaded with furniture rugs and pictures all of which looked strangely familiar and which on closer inspection he recognized as belonging to the room which he had always occupied at The Pines He turned to Bennett who was standing at a little distance ostensibly cleaning some harness but quietly enjoying the scene Bennett what does this mean he inquired Where are these goods going To the camp sir Surely not to the mining camp Bennett you must be mistaken No mistake about it sir they goes to Camp Bird to morrow morning them s missus Dean s orders Darrell was more touched than he cared to betray He went at once to the house and in the hall dim with the early twilight was met by missus Dean herself I m sorry mister Darrell she began but you can t occupy your room to night you ll have to take the one adjoining on the south Your room was torn up to day and we haven t got it put to rights yet missus Dean Darrell answered his voice slightly unsteady you are too kind it breaks a fellow all up and makes this sort of thing the harder missus Dean turned on the light as though for a better understanding I don t see any special kindness in turning you out of your room on your last night here she remarked quietly but we couldn t get it settled Darrell could not restrain a smile as he replied I m afraid it will be some time before it is settled with the furniture packed out there in the stables Have you been to the stables she exclaimed in dismay A smile was sufficient answer If that isn t too bad she continued I was going to have that wagon sent ahead in the morning before you were up and have it for a surprise when you got there and now it s all spoiled I declare I m too disappointed to say a word But missus Dean Darrell interposed hastily as she turned to leave you need not feel like that the surprise was just as genuine and as pleasant as though it had been as you intended besides I can thank you now whereas I couldn t then That s just what I didn t want and don t want now she answered quickly if there is anything I can do for you God knows I ll do it the same as though you were my own son and I want no thanks for it either And with these words she left the room before Darrell could reply Everything that could be done to make the rooms look cheerful and homelike as possible had been done for that night The dining room was decorated with flowers and when after dinner the family adjourned to the sitting room a fire was burning in the grate and around it had been drawn the most comfortable seats in the room But to Darrell the extra touches of brightness and beauty seemed only to emphasize the fact that this was the last night of anything like home life that he would know for some time to come It had been agreed that he and Kate were to have some music that evening and on the piano he saw the violin which he had not used since the summer s happy days He lifted it with the tender caressing manner with which he always handled it as though it were something living and human Turning it lovingly in his hands he caught the gleam of something in the fire light and bending over it saw a richly engraved gold plate on which he read the words TO JOHN DARRELL A SOUVENIR OF THE PINES FROM KATHIE A mist rose before his eyes he could not see he could not trust himself to speak but raising the violin his pent up feelings burst forth in a flood of liquid music of such commingled sweetness and sadness as to hold his listeners entranced mister Underwood for once forgetful of his pipe looked into the fire with a troubled gaze he understood little of the power of expression but even he comprehended dimly the sorrow that surged and ebbed in those wild harmonies missus Dean her hands folded idly above her work sat with eyes closed a solitary tear occasionally rolling down her cheek while in the shadows Kate her face buried on Duke s head and neck was sobbing quietly Gradually the wild strains subsided as the summer tempest dies away till nothing is heard but the patter of the rain drops and after a few bars from a love song a favorite of Kate s the music glided into the simple strains of Home Sweet Home And as the oppressed and overheated atmosphere is cleared by the brief storm so the overwrought feelings of those present were relieved by this little outburst of emotion A pleasant evening followed and except that the good nights exchanged on parting were tenderer more heartfelt than usual there were no indications that this was their last night together as a family circle Darrell had been in his room but a short time however when he heard a light tap at his door and opening it missus Dean entered You seem like a son to me mister Darrell she said with quiet dignity so I have taken the liberty to come to your room for a few minutes the same as I would to a son s That is right missus Dean Darrell replied escorting her to a large arm chair my own mother could not be more welcome You know us pretty well by this time mister Darrell she said as she seated herself and you know that we re not given to expressing our feelings very much but I felt that I couldn t let you go away without a few words with you first I sometimes think that those who can t express themselves are the ones that feel the deepest though I guess we often get the credit of not having any feelings at all If I ever had such an impression of you or your brother I found out my error long ago Darrell remarked gravely as she paused Yes I think you understand us I think you will understand me mister Darrell when I say to you that I haven t felt anything so deeply in years as I do your leaving us now not so much the mere fact of your going away as the real reason of your going I felt bad when you left for camp a year ago but this is altogether different then you felt and we felt that you were one of us that your home was with us and I hoped that as long as you remained in the West your home would be with us Now although there is no change in our love for you or yours for us I know that the place is no longer a home to you that you do not care to stay and about the hardest part of it all is that knowing the circumstances as I do I myself would not ask you to stay You seem to understand the situation missus Dean how did you learn the circumstances Darrell asked wonderingly She regarded him a moment with a motherly smile Did you think I was blind I could see for myself Katherine has told me nothing she added in answer to the unspoken inquiry which she read in his eyes she has told me no more than you but I saw what was coming long before either you or she realized it Oh missus Dean why didn t you warn me in time Darrell exclaimed The time for warning was when you two first met missus Dean replied for two as congenial to be thrown together so constantly would naturally result just as it has it is no more than was to be expected and neither of you can be blamed And she added slowly that is not the phase of the affair which I most regret I think such love as you two bear each other would work little harm or sorrow to either of you in the end if matters could only be left to take their own course I may as well tell you that I think no good will come of this scheme of David s mister Walcott is not a suitable man for Katherine even if she were heart free and loving you as she does as she always will for I understand the child it would have been much better to have waited a year or two I have no doubt that everything would come out all right Of course as I m not her mother I have no say in the matter and no right to interfere but mark my words David will regret this and at no very distant day either I know that nothing but unhappiness can come of it for Kate and that is what troubles me far more than any sorrow of my own said Darrell in a low voice It will bring unhappiness and evil all around but to no one so much as David Underwood himself said missus Dean impressively as she rose missus Dean said Darrell springing quickly to his feet you don t know the good this little interview has done me I thank you for it and for your sympathy from the bottom of my heart I wish I could give you something more practical than sympathy said missus Dean with a smile and I will if I ever have the opportunity And one thing in particular I want to say to you mister Darrell so long as you are in the West whether your home is with us or not I want you to feel that you have a mother in me and should you ever be sick or in trouble and need a mother s care and love no matter where you are I will come to you as I would to my own son They had reached the door Darrell too deeply moved for speech and knowing her aversion to many words bent over her and kissed her on the forehead Thank you mother good night he said She turned and looked at him with glistening eyes as she replied calmly Good night my son The household was astir at an early hour the next morning There were forced smiles and some desultory conversation at the breakfast table but it was a silent group which gathered outside in the early morning sunlight as Darrell was about taking his departure He dreaded the parting and as he glanced at the faces of the waiting group he determined to make it as brief as possible for their sakes as well as his own The heavy teams came slowly around from the stables and behind them came Trix daintily picking her steps along the driveway With a word or two of instructions to the drivers Darrell sent the teams ahead then having adjusted saddle and bridle to his satisfaction he turned to mister Underwood who stood nearest My boy said the latter extending his hand we hate to spare you from the old home but I don t know where I would have got a man to take your place with you up there I feel just as safe as though I were there myself Much obliged mister Underwood Darrell replied looking straight into the elder man s eyes I think you ll find me worthy of any trust you may repose in me at the camp or elsewhere Every time my boy every time exclaimed the old gentleman wringing his hand missus Dean s usually placid face was stern from her effort to repress her feelings but there was a glance of mother love in her eyes and a slight quivering of her lips as she bade him a quiet good by But it was Kate s pale sweet face that nearly broke his own composure as he turned to her last of all Their hands clasped and they looked silently into each other s eyes for an instant Good by John God bless you she said in tones audible only to his ear God bless and help you Kathie he replied and turned quickly to Trix waiting at his side Look at Duke said Kate a moment later as Darrell sprang into the saddle he doesn t know what to make of it that you haven t bade him good by Duke who had shown considerable excitement over the unusual proceedings had bounded to Kate s side as Darrell approached her expecting his usual recognition not having received it he sat regarding Darrell with an evident sense of personal injury quite pathetic Darrell looked at the drooping head and smiled Come Duke he said slowly starting down the driveway Kate bent quickly for a final caress Go on Duke she whispered Nothing loath to follow Darrell he bounded forward but after a few leaps on discovering that his beloved mistress was not accompanying them he stopped looking back in great perplexity At a signal from her and a word from Darrell he again started onward but his backward glances were more than Kate could bear and she turned to go into the house What are you sending the dog after him for anyway inquired her father himself somewhat puzzled I have given Duke to mister Darrell papa she replied Something in the unnatural calmness of her tone startled him he turned to question her She had gone but in the glimpse which he had of her face he read a little of the anguish which at that moment wrung her young heart and happening at the same time to catch his sister s eye he walked away silent and uncomfortable Chapter XX FORGING THE FETTERS 
4856_12103_000003_000000	train-clean-360	During the weeks immediately following Darrell s departure the daily routine of life at The Pines continued in the accustomed channels but there was not a member of the family including mister Underwood himself to whom it did not seem strangely empty as though some essential element were missing 
none	none	To Kate her present life compared with the first months of her return home was like the narrow current creeping sluggishly beneath the icy fetters of winter as compared with the same stream laughing and singing on its way under summer skies 
4856_12103_000004_000001	train-clean-360	But she was learning the lesson that all must learn that the world sweeps relentlessly onward with no pause for individual woe and each must keep step in its ceaseless march no matter how weary the brain or how heavy the heart 
4856_12103_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Walcott s visits continued with the same frequency but he was less annoying in his attentions than formerly 
none	none	It had gradually dawned upon him that Kate was no longer a child but a woman and a woman with a will as indomitable as her father s once it was aroused 
4856_12103_000005_000002	train-clean-360	He was not displeased at the discovery on the contrary he looked forward with all the keener anticipation to the pleasure of what he mentally termed the taming process once she was fairly within his power 
none	none	Meantime he was content to make a study of her sitting evening after evening either in conversation with her father or listening while she played and sang but always watching her every movement scanning every play of her features A loose rein for the present he would say to himself with a smile but by and by my lady you will find whether or no I am master He seldom attempted now to draw her into a tete a tete conversation but finding her one evening sitting upon a low divan in one of the bay windows looking out into the moonlight he seated himself beside her and began one of his entertaining tales of travel 
4856_12103_000007_000001	train-clean-360	An hour or more passed pleasantly and Walcott inquired casually 
none	none	By the way Miss Underwood what has become of my four footed friend 
4856_12103_000008_000001	train-clean-360	I have not seen him for three weeks or more and his attentions to me were so marked I naturally miss them 
4856_12103_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Duke is at the mining camp Kate answered with a faint smile 
4856_12103_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Walcott raised his eyebrows incredulously 
none	none	Possible With my other admirer mister Darrell He is with mister Darrell Accept my gratitude Miss Underwood for having made my entree to your home much pleasanter not to say safer I neither claim nor accept your gratitude mister Walcott Kate replied with cool dignity since I did it simply out of regard for Duke s welfare and not out of any consideration whatever for your wishes in the matter I might have known as much said Walcott with a mock sigh of resignation settling back comfortably among the pillows on the divan and fixing his eyes on Kate s face I might have known that consideration for any wish of mine could never by any chance be assigned as the motive for an act of yours 
4856_12103_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Kate made no reply but the lines about her mouth deepened 
4856_12103_000015_000001	train-clean-360	For a moment he watched her silently then he continued slowly in low nonchalant tones 
none	none	I am positive that when I at last gain your consent to marry me he paused an instant to note the effect of his words but there was not the quiver of an eyelash on her part even then you will have the audacity to tell me that you gave it for any other reason under heaven than consideration for me or my wishes
4856_12103_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 mister Walcott said Kate facing him with sudden hauteur of tone and manner you are correct 
4856_12103_000017_000001	train-clean-360	If ever I consent to marry you I can tell you now as well as then my reason for doing so it will be simply and solely for my dear father s sake for the love I bear him out of consideration for his wishes and with no more thought of you than if you did not exist 
none	none	Conflicting emotions filled Walcott s breast at these words but he preserved a calm smiling exterior He could not but admire Kate s spirit at the same time the thought flashed through his mind that this apparent slip of a girl might prove rather difficult to tame but he reflected that the more difficult the keener would be his enjoyment of the final victory A novel situation surely he commented with a low musical laugh decidedly unique But my dear Miss Underwood he continued a moment later if your love for your father and regard for his wishes are to constitute your sole reasons for consenting to become my wife why need you withhold that consent longer I am sure his wishes in the matter will remain unchanged as will also your love for him why then should our marriage be further delayed
4856_12103_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 After what I have just told you mister Walcott do you still ask me to be your wife Kate demanded indignantly 
none	none	I do Miss Underwood and pardon me I feel that you have trifled with me long enough I must have your answer 
4856_12103_000023_000000	train-clean-360	She rose drawing herself proudly to her full height 
4856_12103_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Take me to my father she said imperiously 
none	none	Walcott offered his arm which she refused with a gesture of scorn and they proceeded to the adjoining room where mister Underwood and his sister were seated together before the fire As Kate advanced towards her father both looked up simultaneously and each read in her white face and proud bearing that a crisis was at hand missus Dean at once arose and noiselessly withdrew from the room Walcott paused at a little distance from mister Underwood assuming a graceful attitude as he leaned languidly over the large chair just vacated by missus Dean but Kate did not stop till she reached her father s side where she bowed coldly to Walcott to proceed with what he had to say
4856_12103_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Some time ago mister Underwood he began smoothly and easily I asked you for your daughter s hand in marriage and you honored me with your consent 
none	none	Since that time I have paid my addresses to Miss Underwood in so marked a manner as to leave her no room for doubt or misunderstanding regarding my intentions although finding that she was not inclined to look upon me with favor I have hitherto refrained from pressing my suit 
4856_12103_000027_000002	train-clean-360	Feeling now that I have given her abundance of time I have this evening asked her to become my wife and insisted that I was entitled to a decision 
none	none	Instead however of giving me a direct answer she has suggested that we refer the matter to yourself
4856_12103_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 How is this Kate her father asked not unkindly I supposed you and I had settled this matter long ago 
4856_12103_000029_000000	train-clean-360	Her voice was clear her tones unfaltering as she replied Before giving my answer I wanted to ask you papa for the last time whether knowing the circumstances as you do and how I regard mister Walcott it is still your wish that I marry him 
4856_12103_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 It is and I expect my child to be governed by my wishes in this matter rather than by her own feelings 
none	none	Have I ever gone contrary to your wishes papa or disobeyed you
4856_12103_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 No my child no 
4856_12103_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Then I shall not attempt it at this late day 
none	none	I only wanted to be sure that this was still your wish I desire it above all things said mister Underwood delighted to find Kate so ready to accede to his wishes rising and taking her hand in his and the day that I see my little girl settled in the home which she will receive as a wedding gift from her old father will be the proudest and happiest day of my life 
4856_12103_000035_000000	train-clean-360	Kate smiled sadly 
4856_12103_000035_000001	train-clean-360	 No home can ever seem to me like The Pines papa but I appreciate your kindness and I want you to know that I am taking this step solely for your happiness 
4856_12103_000036_000000	train-clean-360	She then turned facing Walcott who advanced slightly while mister Underwood made a movement as though to place her hand in his 
4856_12103_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Not yet papa she said gently then addressing Walcott she continued 
none	none	mister Walcott this must be my answer since you insist upon having one Out of love for him who has been both father and mother to me out of reverence for his gray hairs frosted by the sorrows of earlier years out of regard for his wishes which have always been my law for his sake only I consent to become your wife upon one condition Name it Walcott replied
4856_12103_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 There can be no love between us either in our engagement or our marriage for as I have told you I can never love you and you yourself are incapable of love in its best sense you have not even the slightest knowledge of what it is 
4856_12103_000040_000001	train-clean-360	For this reason any token of love between us would be only a mockery a farce and true wedded love is something too holy too sacred to be travestied in any such manner 
none	none	I consent to our marriage therefore only upon this condition that we henceforth treat each other simply with kindness and courtesy that no expressions of affection or endearment are to be used by either of us to the other and that no word or sign of love ever pass between us
4856_12103_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Kate interposed her father sternly this is preposterous 
4856_12103_000041_000001	train-clean-360	I cannot allow such absurdity but Walcott silenced him with a deprecatory wave of his hand and taking Kate s hand in his replied with smiling indifference 
none	none	I accept the condition imposed by Miss Underwood since it is no more unique than the entire situation and I congratulate her upon her decided originality 
4856_12103_000042_000001	train-clean-360	I suppose he added addressing Kate at the same time producing a superb diamond ring you will not object to wearing this 
none	none	I yield that much to conventionality she replied allowing him to place it on her finger there is no need to advertise the situation publicly besides it is a fitting symbol of my future fetters
4856_12103_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Conventionality I believe would require that it be placed on your hand with a kiss and some appropriate bit of sentiment but since that sort of thing is tabooed between us we will have to dispense with that part of the ceremony 
4856_12103_000045_000000	train-clean-360	Then turning to mister Underwood who stood looking on frowningly somewhat troubled by the turn matters had taken Walcott added playfully 
none	none	According to the usual custom I believe the next thing on the programme is for you to embrace us and give us a father s blessing but my lady might not approve of anything so commonplace Before her father could reply Kate spoke for him glancing at him with an affectionate smile Papa is not one of the demonstrative sort and he and I need no demonstration of our love for each other do we dear No child we understand each other said her father reseating himself with Kate in her accustomed place on the arm of his chair while Walcott took the large chair on the other side of the fire and you neither of you need any assurance of my good wishes or good intentions towards you but he continued doubtfully shaking his head I don t quite like the way you ve gone about this business Puss
4856_12103_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 It was the only way for me papa Kate answered gravely and decidedly 
none	none	I admit said Walcott it will be quite a departure from the mode of procedure ordinarily laid down for newly engaged and newly wedded couples but really come to think it over I am inclined to think that Miss Underwood s proposition will save us an immense amount of boredom which is the usual concomitant of engagements and honeymoons 
4856_12103_000051_000001	train-clean-360	That sort of thing you know he added his lip curling just perceptibly is apt to get a little monotonous after a while 
none	none	Kate watching him from under level brows saw the slight sneer and inwardly rejoiced at the stand she had taken
4856_12103_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 Well said mister Underwood resignedly fix it up between you any way to suit yourselves but for heaven s sake don t do anything to cause comment or remarks 
4856_12103_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 Papa you can depend on me not to make myself conspicuous in any way Kate replied with dignity 
none	none	What I have said to night was said simply to let you and mister Walcott know just where I stand and just what you may and may not expect of me but this is only between us three and you can rest assured that I shall never wear my heart upon my sleeve or take the public into my confidence regarding my home life I think myself you need have no fear on that score mister Underwood Walcott remarked with a smile of amusement I believe Miss Underwood is entirely capable of carrying out to perfection any role she may assume and if she chooses to take the part of leading lady in the little comedy of The Model Husband and Wife I shall be only too delighted to render her any assistance within my power 
4856_12103_000056_000000	train-clean-360	As Walcott bade Kate good night at a late hour he inquired What do you think of the little comedy I suggested to night for our future line of action 
4856_12103_000056_000001	train-clean-360	Does it meet with your approval 
4856_12103_000057_000000	train-clean-360	She was quick to catch the significance of the question and looking him straight in the eyes she replied calmly 
none	none	It will answer as well as any I suppose but it has in it more of the elements of tragedy than of comedy Chapter XXI TWO CRIMES BY THE SAME HAND At Walcott s request the date of the wedding was set early in January he having announced that business would call him to the South the first week in December for about a month and that he wished the wedding to take place immediately upon his return The announcement of the engagement and speedily approaching marriage of the daughter of D K Underwood to his junior partner caused a ripple of excitement throughout the social circles of Ophir and Galena Though little known Walcott was quite popular It was therefore generally conceded that the shrewd mining king as mister Underwood was denominated in that region had selected a party in every way eligible as the future husband of the sole heiress of his fortune Kate received the congratulations showered upon her with perfect equanimity but with a shade of quiet reserve which effectually distanced all undue familiarity or curiosity Through the daily paper which found its way to the mining camp Darrell received his first news of Kate s engagement It did not come as a surprise however he knew it was inevitable he even drew a sigh of relief that the blow had fallen for a burden is far more easily borne as an actual reality than by anticipation and applied himself with an almost dogged persistency to his work The winter set in early and with unusual severity The snowfall in the mountains was heavier than had been known in years Much of the time the canyon road was impassable making it impracticable for Darrell to visit The Pines with any frequency even had he wished to do so The weeks passed and ere he was aware the holidays were at hand By special messenger came a little note from Kate informing him of Walcott s absence and begging him to spend Christmas at the old home There had been a lull of two or three days in the storm the messenger reported the road somewhat broken and early on the morning preceding Christmas the trio Darrell Duke and Trix started forth and after a twelve hours siege arrived at The Pines wet cold and thoroughly exhausted but all joyfully responsive to the welcome awaiting them Christmas dawned bright and clear tokens of love and good will abounded on every side but at an early hour news came over the wires which shocked and saddened all who heard particularly the household at The Pines There had been a hold up on the west bound express the preceding night a few miles from Galena in which the mail and express had been robbed and the express clerk a brave young fellow who stanchly refused to open the safe or give the combination had been fatally stabbed It was said to be without doubt the work of the same band that had conducted the hold up in which Harry Whitcomb had lost his life as it was characterized by the same boldness of plan and cleverness of execution The affair brought back so vividly to mister Underwood and the family the details of Harry s death that it cast a shadow over the Christmas festivities which seemed to deepen as the day wore on Outside too gathering clouds harbingers of coming storm added to the general gloom It was with a sense of relief that Darrell set out at an early hour the following morning for the camp He realized as never before that the place teemed with painful memories whose very sweetness tortured his soul until he almost wished that the months since his coming to The Pines might be wrapped in the same oblivion which veiled his life up to that period He was glad to escape from its depressing influence and to return to the camp with its routine of work and study This second winter of Darrell s life at camp was far more normal and healthful than the first His love and sympathy for Kate had unconsciously drawn him out of himself making him less mindful of his own sorrow and more susceptible to the sufferings of others To the men at the camp he was far different interesting himself in their welfare in numerous ways where before he had ignored them The unusual severity of the winter had caused some sickness among them and it was nothing uncommon for Darrell to go of an evening to the miners quarters with medicines newspapers and magazines for the sick and convalescent He was returning from one of these expeditions late one evening about ten days after Christmas accompanied by the collie It had been snowing lightly and steadily all day and the snow was still falling Darrell was whistling softly to himself and Duke who showed a marvellous adaptation to Darrell s varying moods catching the cue for his own conduct began to plunge into the freshly fallen snow wheeling and darting swiftly towards Darrell as though challenging him to a wrestling match Darrell gratified his evident wish and they tumbled promiscuously in the snow emerging at length from a big drift near the office their coats white Duke barking with delight and Darrell laughing like a school boy Shaking themselves they entered the office but no sooner had they stepped within than the collie bounded to the door of the next room where he began a vigorous sniffing and scratching accompanied by a series of short barks As Darrell somewhat puzzled by his actions opened the door he saw a figure seated by the fire which rose and turned quickly revealing to his astonished gaze the tall form and strong sweet face of John Britton For a moment the two men stood with clasped hands looking into each other s eyes with a satisfaction too deep for words After an affectionate scrutiny of his young friend mister Britton resumed his seat remarking You are looking well better than I have ever seen you and I was glad to hear that laughter outside it had the right ring to it Duke was responsible for that Darrell answered with a smiling glance at the collie who had stationed himself by the fire and near mister Britton he challenged me to wrestle with him and got rather the worst of it A moment later having divested himself of his great coat he drew a second seat before the fire saying You evidently knew where to look for me Yes your last letter which by the way followed me for nearly six weeks before reaching me apprised me of your return to the camp I was somewhat surprised too after you had established yourself so well in town It was best for me and for others Darrell answered then noting the inquiry in his friend s eyes he added It is a long story but it will keep there will be plenty of time for that later Tell me of yourself first For two months I have hungered for word from you and now I simply want to listen to you a while mister Britton smiled I owe you an apology but you know I am a poor correspondent at best and of late business has called me here and there until I scarcely knew one day where I would be the next consequently I have received my mail irregularly and have been irregular myself in writing Darrell s face grew tender for he knew it was not business alone which drove his friend from place to place but the old pain which found relief only in ceaseless activity and an equally unceasing beneficence He well knew that many of his friend s journeys were purely of a philanthropic nature and he remarked with a peculiar smile Your travels always remind me very forcibly of the journey of the good Samaritan when he met a case of suffering on the way he was not the one to pass by on the other side nor are you Perhaps said mister Britton gravely he had found as others have since that pouring oil and wine into his neighbor s wounds was the surest method of assuaging the pain in some secret wound of his own Darrell watched his friend closely while he gave a brief account of his recent journeys along the western coast Never before had he seen the lines of suffering so marked upon the face beside him as that night Something evidently had reopened the old wound causing it to throb anew I need not ask what has brought you back into the mountains at this time of year and in this storm Darrell remarked as his friend concluded For answer mister Britton drew from his pocket an envelope which Darrell at once recognized as a counterpart of one which had come to him some weeks before but which he had laid away unopened knowing only too well its contents I am particularly glad for Miss Underwood s sake that you are here he said she feared you might not come and it worried her Which accounts for the importunate little note which accompanied the invitation said mister Britton with a half smile but I would have made it a point to be present in any event why did she doubt my coming Because of the season I suppose and the unusual storms then too Darrell spoke with some hesitation she told me she believed you had a sort of aversion to weddings She was partly right mister Britton said after a pause I have not been present at a wedding ceremony for more than twenty five years not since my own marriage he added slowly in a low tone as though making a confession Darrell s heart throbbed painfully it was the first allusion he had ever heard the other make to his own past and from his tone and manner Darrell knew that he himself had unwittingly touched the great hidden sorrow in his friend s life Forgive me he said with the humility and simplicity of a child I have nothing to forgive mister Britton replied gently fixing his eyes with a look of peculiar affection upon Darrell s face You know more now my son than the whole world knows or has known in all these years and some day in the near future you shall know all because for some inexplicable reason you out of the whole world seem nearest to me A few moments later he resumed with more of his usual manner I am not quite myself to night The events of the last few days have rather upset me and with one of his rare smiles I have come to you to get righted To me Darrell exclaimed Yes why not I am but your pupil one who is just beginning to look above his own selfish sorrows only through the lessons you have taught him You over estimate the little I have tried to do for you but were it even as you say I would come to you and to no one else To whom did the Divine Master himself turn for human sympathy in his last hours of grief and suffering but to his little band of pupils his disciples And in proportion as they had learned of Him and imbibed His spirit in just that proportion could they enter into his feelings and minister to his soul mister Britton had withdrawn the cards from the envelope and was regarding them thoughtfully The receipt of those bits of pasteboard he said slowly unmanned me more than anything that has occurred in nearly a score of years They called up long forgotten scenes little pathetic heart rending memories which I thought buried long ago I don t mind confessing to you my boy that for a while I was unnerved It did not seem as though I could ever bring myself to hear again the music of wedding bells and wedding marches to listen to the old words of the marriage service But for the sake of one who has seemed almost as my own child I throttled those feelings and started for the mountains resolved that no selfishness of mine should cloud her happiness on her wedding day I came to find what I would never have believed possible that my old friend would sacrifice his child s happiness all that is sweetest and holiest in her life to gratify his own ambition I cannot tell you the shock it was to me D K Underwood and I have been friends for many years but that did not prevent my talking plainly with him so plainly that perhaps our friendship may never be the same again But it was of no avail and the worst is he has persuaded himself that he is acting for her good when it is simply for the gratification of his own pride I could not stay there the very atmosphere seemed oppressive so I came up here for a day or two as I told you to get righted And you came to me to be righted Darrell said musingly Can the blind lead the blind mister Britton was quick to catch the significance of he other s query Yes John he answered covering Darrell s hand with his own I came to you for the very reason that your hurt is far deeper than mine Under the magnetism of that tone and touch Darrell calmly and in few words told his story and Kate s the story of their love and brief happiness and of the wretchedness which followed For a while I constantly reproached myself for having spoken to her of love he said in conclusion for having awakened her love as I thought by my own but gradually I came to see that she had loved me as I had her unconsciously almost from our first meeting and that the awakening must in any event have come sooner or later to each of us Then it seemed as though my suffering all converged in sorrow for her that her life instead of being gladdened by love should be saddened and marred perhaps wrecked by it Love works strange havoc with human lives sometimes mister Britton remarked reflectively as Darrell paused I was tempted at times Darrell continued as I thought of what was in store for her to rescue her at any cost tempted to take her and go with her to the ends of the earth if necessary anywhere to save her from the life she dreads Thank God that you did not my son mister Britton exclaimed strangely agitated by Darrell s words you do not know what the cost might have been in the end what bitter remorse what agony of ceaseless regret He stopped abruptly and again Darrell felt that he had looked for an instant into those depths so sacredly guarded from the eyes of the world You did well to leave as you did mister Britton said after a moment s silence in which he had regained his composure I had to I should have done something desperate if I had remained there much longer Darrell spoke quietly but it was the quiet of suppressed passion It was better so better for you both mister Britton continued when we find ourselves powerless to save our loved ones from impending trouble all that is left us is to help them bear that trouble as best we may The best help you can give Kate now is to take yourself as completely as possible out of her life How you can best help her later time alone will show A long silence followed while both watched the flickering flames and listened to the crooning of the wind outside When at length they spoke it was on topics of general interest the outlook at the mining camp the latest news in the town below till their talk at last drifted to the recent hold up A dastardly piece of work exclaimed mister Britton The death of that young express clerk was in some ways even sadder than that of Harry Whitcomb I knew him well the only child of a widowed mother a poor boy who by indomitable energy and unswerving integrity had just succeeded in securing the position which cost him his life Two such brutal cowardly murders ought to arouse the people to such systematic concerted action as would result in the final arrest and conviction of the murderer It is the general opinion that both were committed by one and the same party Darrell remarked as his friend paused Undoubtedly both were the work of the same hand in all probability that of the leader himself He is a man capable of any crime probably guilty of nearly every crime that could be mentioned and his men are mere tools in his hands He exerts a strange power over them and they obey him knowing that their lives would pay the forfeit for disobedience Human life is nothing to him and any one who stood in the way of the accomplishment of his purposes would simply go the way those two poor fellows have gone Why do you know anything regarding this man Darrell asked in surprise Only so far as I have made a study of him and his methods aided by whatever information I could gather from time to time concerning him Surely you are not a detective Darrell exclaimed you spoke like one just now Not professionally his friend answered with a smile though I have often assisted in running down criminals I have enough of the hound nature about me however that when a scent is given me I delight in following the trail till I run my game to cover as I hope some day to run this man to cover he added with peculiar earnestness But how did you ever gain so much knowledge of him To every one else he seems an utter mystery Partly as I said through a study of him and his methods and partly from facts which I learned from one of the band who was fatally shot a few years ago in a skirmish between the brigands and a posse of officials The man was deserted by his associates and was brought to town and placed in a hospital I did what I could to make the poor fellow comfortable with the result that he became quite communicative with me and while in no way betraying his confederates he gave me much interesting information regarding the band and its leader It is a thoroughly organized body of men bound together by the most fearful oaths possessing a perfect system of signals and passwords and with a retreat in the mountains known as the Pocket so inaccessible to any but themselves that no one as yet has been able even to definitely locate it a sort of basin walled about by perpendicular rocks The leader is a man of mixed blood who has travelled in all countries and knows many dark secrets and whose power lies mainly in the mystery with which he surrounds himself No one knows who he is but many of his men believe him to be the very devil personified But how can you or any one else hope to run down a man with such powerful followers and with a hiding place so inaccessible Darrell inquired From a remark inadvertently dropped I was led to infer that this man spends comparatively little time with the band He communicates with them directs them and personally conducts any especially bold or difficult venture but most of the time he is amid far different surroundings leading an altogether different life One of those men with double lives Darrell commented mister Britton bowed in assent But if that were so Darrell persisted his interest thoroughly aroused as much by mister Britton s manner as by his words in the event say of your meeting him how would you be able to recognize or identify him Have you any clew to his identity Years ago said mister Britton slowly I formed the habit of studying people at first as I met them later as I heard or read of them Facts gathered here and there concerning a person s life I put together piece by piece studying his actions and the probable motives governing those actions until I had a mental picture of the real man the ego that constitutes the foundation of the character of every individual Having that fixed in my mind I next strove to form an idea of the exterior which that particular ego would gradually build about himself through his habits of thought and speech and action In this way by a careful study of a man s life I can form something of an idea of his appearance I have often put this to the test by visiting various penitentiaries in order to meet some of the noted criminals of whose careers I had made a study and invariably in expression in voice and manner in gait and bearing in the hundred and one little indices by which the soul betrays itself I have found them as I had mentally portrayed them mister Britton had risen while speaking and was walking back and forth before the fire I see Darrell exclaimed and you have formed a mental portrait of this man by which you expect to recognize and identify him I am satisfied that I would have no difficulty in recognizing him mister Britton replied with peculiar emphasis on the last words the work of identification he paused in front of Darrell looking him earnestly in the face that I hope will one day be yours Mine exclaimed Darrell How so I do not understand mister Underwood has told me that soon after your arrival at The Pines and just before you became delirious there was something on your mind in connection with the robbery and Whitcomb s death which you wished to tell him but were unable to recall and both he and his sister have said that often during your delirium you would mutter That face I can never forget it it will haunt me as long as I live It has always been my belief that amidst the horrors of the scene you witnessed that night you in some way got sight of the murderer s face which impressed you so strongly that it haunted you even in your delirium It is my hope that with the return of memory there will come a vision of that face sufficiently clear that you will be able to identify it should you meet it as I believe you will Darrell scrutinized his friend closely before replying noting his evident agitation You have already met this man and recognized him he exclaimed Possibly was the only reply Chapter XXII THE FETTERS BROKEN Early on the morning of the third day after mister Britton s arrival at camp he and Darrell set forth for The Pines But little snow had fallen within the last two days and the trip was made without much difficulty though progress was slow Late in the day as they neared The Pines the clouds which for hours had been more or less broken suddenly dispersed and the setting sun sank in a flood of gold and crimson light which gave promise of glorious weather for the morrow Arriving at the house they found it filled with guests invited to the wedding from different parts of the State the rooms resounding with light badinage and laughter the very atmosphere charged with excitement as messengers came and went and servants hurried to and fro busied with preparations for the following day Kate herself hastened forward to meet them a trifle pale but calm and wearing the faint inscrutable smile which of late was becoming habitual with her At sight of Darrell and his friend however her face lighted with the old time sunny smile and her cheeks flushed with pleasure She bestowed upon mister Britton the same affectionate greeting with which she had been accustomed to meet him since her childhood s days He was visibly affected and though he returned her greeting kissing her on brow and cheek he was unable to speak Her color deepened and her eyes grew luminous as she turned to welcome Darrell but she only said I am inexpressibly glad that you came It will be good to feel there is one amid all the crowd who knows He knows also Kathie Darrell replied in low tones indicating mister Britton with a slight motion of his head Does he know all she asked quickly Yes I thought you could have no objection No she answered after a brief pause I am glad that it is so There was no opportunity for further speech as mister Underwood came forward to welcome his old friend and Darrell and they were hurried off to their rooms to prepare for dinner mister Underwood was not a man to do things by halves and the elaborate but informal dinner to which he and his guests sat down was all that could be desired as a gastronomic success He himself despite his brusque manners was a genial host and Walcott speedily ingratiated himself into the favor of the guests by his quiet unobtrusive attentions his punctilious courtesy to each and all alike Darrell and his friend felt ill at ease and out of place amid the gayety that filled the house that evening and at an early hour they retired to their rooms It is awful Darrell exclaimed as they stood for a moment together at the door of his room listening to the sounds of merriment from below it is all so hollow such a mockery it seems like dancing over a hidden sepulchre And we are to stand by to morrow and witness this farce carried out to the final culmination mister Britton commented in low tones it is worse than a farce it is a crime My boy how will you be able to stand it he suddenly inquired Darrell turned away abruptly I could not stand it I would not attempt it except that my presence will comfort and help her he answered And so they parted for the night The following morning dawned clear and cloudless the spotless unbroken expanse of snow gleaming in the sunlight as though strewn with myriads of jewels it seemed as if Earth herself had donned her bridal array in honor of the occasion An ideal wedding day was the universal exclamation and such it was The wedding was to take place at noon A little more than an hour before the bridal party was to leave the house Darrell was walking up and down the double libraries upstairs whither he had been summoned by a note from Kate begging him to await her there His thoughts went back to that summer night less than six months gone when he had waited her coming in those very rooms Not yet six months and he seemed to have lived years since then He recalled her as she appeared before him that night in all the grace and witchery of lovely maidenhood just opening into womanhood How beautiful how joyous she had been without a thought of sorrow and now A faint sound like the breath of the wind through the leaves roused him and Kate stood before him once more Kate in her bridal robes their shimmering folds trailing behind her like the gleaming foam in the wake of a ship on a moonlit sea while her veil like a filmy cloud enveloped her from head to foot There was a moment of silence in which Darrell studied the face before him the same yet not the same as on that summer night The childlike naivete the charming piquancy had given place to a sweet seriousness but it was more tender more womanly more beautiful She came a step nearer and raising her clasped hands placed them within Darrell s I felt that I must see you once more John she said in the low sweet tones that always thrilled his very soul there is something I wish to say to you if I can only make my meaning clear and I feel sure you will understand me I want to pledge to you John for time and for eternity my heart s best and purest love Though forced into this union with a man whom I can never love yet I will be true as a wife God knows I would not be otherwise that is farthest from my thoughts But I have learned much within the past few months and I have learned that there is a love far above all passion and sensuality a love tender as a wife s pure as a mother s and lasting as eternity itself Such love I pledge you John Darrell Do you understand me As she raised her eyes to his it seemed to Darrell that he was looking into the face of one of the saints whom the old masters loved to portray centuries ago so spiritual was it so devoid of everything of earth Kathie darling he said clasping her hands tenderly I do understand and thank God I believe I am able to reciprocate your love with one as chastened and pure When I left The Pines last fall I did so because I could not any longer endure to be near you loving you as I did I felt in some blind unreasoning way that it was wrong and yet I knew that to cease to love you was an impossibility But in the solitude of the mountains God showed me a better way He showed me the true meaning of those words In the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels of God in heaven Those words had always seemed to me austere and cold as though they implied that our poor love would be superseded by higher attributes possessed by the angelic hosts of which we knew nothing Now I know that they mean that our human love shall be refined from all the dross of earthly passion purified and exalted above mortal conception I prayed that my love for you might be in some such measure refined and purified and I know that prayer has been answered I pledge you that love Kathie a love that will never wrong you even in thought that you can trust in all the days to come as ready to defend or protect you if necessary and as always seeking your best and highest happiness Thank you John she said and bowed her head above their clasped hands for a moment When she raised her head her eyes were glistening We need not be afraid or ashamed to acknowledge love such as ours she said proudly and with the assurance you have given me I shall have strength and courage whatever may come I must go she added lifting her face to his I want your kiss now John rather than amid all the meaningless kisses that will be given me after the ceremony Their lips met in a lingering kiss then she silently withdrew from the room As she crossed the hall Walcott suddenly brushed past her breathlessly without seeing her and ran swiftly downstairs His evident excitement caused her to pause for an instant as she did she heard him exclaim in a low angry tone and with an oath You dog What brings you here How dare you come here There came a low reply in Spanish followed by a few quick sharp words from Walcott in the same tongue but which by their inflection Kate understood to be an exclamation and a question Her curiosity aroused she noiselessly descended to the first landing and leaning over the balustrade saw a small man with dark olive skin standing close to Walcott with whom he was talking excitedly He spoke rapidly in Spanish Kate caught only one word Senora as he handed a note to Walcott at the same time pointing backward over his shoulder towards the entrance Kate saw Walcott grow pale as he read the missive then with a muttered curse he started for the door followed by the other Quickly descending to the next landing where there was an alcove window looking out upon the driveway Kate could see a closed carriage standing before the entrance and Walcott holding the door partially open talking with some one inside The colloquy was brief and as Walcott stepped back from the carriage the smaller man who had been standing at a little distance sprang in hastily As he swung the door open for an instant Kate had a glimpse of a woman on the rear seat dressed in black and heavily veiled As the man closed the door Walcott stepped to the window for a word or two then turned towards the house and the carriage rolled rapidly down the driveway Kate slowly ascended the stairs listening for Walcott who entered the house but instead of coming upstairs passed through the lower hall going directly to a private room of mister Underwood s in which he received any who happened to call at the house on business Kate went to her room her pulse beating quickly She felt intuitively that something was wrong that here was revealed a phase of Walcott s personality which she in her innocence had not considered had not even suspected She knew that her father believed him to be a moral man and hitherto she had regarded the lack of affinity between herself and him as due to a sort of mental disparity a lack of affiliation in thought and taste Now the conviction flashed upon her that the disparity was a moral one She recalled the sense of loathing with which she instinctively shrank from his touch she understood it now And within two hours she was to have married this man Never Passing a large mirror she paused and looked at the reflection there Was her soul its purity and beauty symbolized by her very dress to be united to that other soul in its grossness and deformity Her cheek blanched with horror at the thought No that fair body should perish first rather than soul or body ever be contaminated by his touch Her decision was taken from that moment and it was irrevocable Nothing not even her father s love or anger his wishes or his commands could turn her now for as he himself boasted his own blood flowed within her veins Swiftly she disrobed tearing the veil in her haste and throwing the shimmering white garments to one side as though she hated the sight of them Taking from her jewel casket the engagement ring which had been laid aside for the wedding ceremony she quickly shut it within its own case to be returned as early as possible to the giver it seemed to burn her fingers like living fire A few moments later her aunt entering her room found her dressed in one of her favorite house gowns a camel s hair of creamy white She looked at Kate then at the discarded robes on a couch near by and stopped speechless for an instant then stammered Katherine child what does this mean It means auntie said Kate putting her arms about her aunt s neck that there will be no wedding and no bride to day Then looking her straight in the eyes she added Really auntie deep down in your heart aren t you glad of it missus Dean gasped then replied slowly Yes it will make me very glad if you do not have to marry that man but Katherine I don t understand what will your father say Before Kate could reply there was a heavy knock at the door which missus Dean answered She came back looking rather frightened Your father wishes to see you Katherine in your library Something must have happened he looks excited and worried I don t know what he ll say to you in that dress I m not afraid Kate replied brightly A moment later she entered the room where less than half an hour before she had left Darrell mister Underwood was walking up and down As Kate entered he turned towards her with a look of solicitude which quickly changed to one of surprise tinged with anger What is the meaning of this he demanded looking at his watch it is within an hour of the time set for your wedding you don t look much like a bride Do you expect to be married in that dress I am not to be married to day papa nor any other day to mister Walcott Kate answered calmly What he exclaimed scarcely comprehending the full import of her words isn t the matter bad enough as it is without your making it worse by any foolish talk or actions I don t understand you papa to what do you refer Why mister Walcott has just been called out of town by news that his father is lying at the point of death it is doubtful whether he will live till his son can reach him He has to take the first train south which leaves within half an hour otherwise he would have waited for the ceremony to be performed Did he tell you that Kate asked with intense scorn Certainly and he left his farewells for you as he hadn t time even to stop to see you It is well that he didn t attempt it Kate replied with spirit I would have told him to his face that he lied What do you mean by such language her father demanded angrily do you doubt his word to me I haven t a doubt that he was called away suddenly but I saw him when he received the message and he didn t appear like a man called by sickness He was terribly excited so excited he did not even see me when he passed me and he was angry for he cursed both the message and the man who brought it Excited Naturally he was excited in talking with me and his anger no doubt was over the postponement of the wedding You show yourself very foolish in getting angry in turn This is a devilishly awkward affair though thank heaven there s no disgrace or scandal attached to it and we must make the best we can of it I have already sent messengers to the church to disperse the guests as they arrive and have also sent a statement of the facts to the different papers so there will be no garbled accounts or misstatements to morrow morning Father said Kate drawing herself up with new dignity as he paused I want you to understand that this is no childish anger or pique on my part I have not told all that I saw nor is it necessary at present but I saw enough that my eyes are opened to his real character I want you to understand that I will never marry him I will die first Her father s face grew dark with anger at her words but the eyes looking fearlessly into his own never quailed Perhaps he recognized his own spirit for he checked the wrathful words he was about to speak and merely inquired Are you going to make a fool of yourself and involve this affair in a scandal or will you allow it to pass quietly and with no unpleasant notoriety You can dispose of it among outsiders as you please papa but I want you to understand my decision in this matter and that it is irrevocable Until you come to your senses he retorted and left the room With comparatively little excitement the guests dispersed and no one not even Darrell or mister Britton knew aught beyond the statement made by mister Underwood Some particular friends of Kate s living in a remote part of the State thinking it might be rather embarrassing for her to remain in Ophir invited her to their home for two or three months and she realizing that she had incurred her father s displeasure gladly accepted The next morning found Darrell on his way to the camp looking longingly forward to his busy life amid the mountains and firmly believing that it would be many a day before he again saw The Pines Chapter XXIII THE MASK LIFTED Three weeks of clear cold weather followed in which the snow became packed and frozen until the horses hoofs on the mountain roads resounded as though on asphalt and the steel shoes of the heavily laden sleds rang out a cheerful rhyme on the frosty air These were weeks of strenuous application to work on Darrell s part His evenings were now spent far into the night in writing He still kept the journal begun during his first winter in camp believing it would one day prove of inestimable value as a connecting link between past and future The geological and mineralogical data which he had collected through more than twelve months research and experiment was now nearly complete and he had undertaken the work of arranging it along with copious notes in form for publication It was an arduous but fascinating task and one to which he often wished he might devote his entire time He was sitting before the fire at night deeply engrossed in this work when he was aroused by the sound of hoof beats on the mountain road leading from the canyon to the camp He listened they came rapidly nearer it was a horseman riding fast and furiously and by the heavy pounding of the foot falls Darrell knew the animal he rode was nearly exhausted On they came past the miners quarters towards the office building it was then some messenger from The Pines and at that hour Darrell glanced at the clock it was nearly midnight it could be no message of trifling import Darrell sprang to his feet and rushing through the outer room followed by Duke barking excitedly opened the door just as the rider drew rein before it What was his astonishment to see Bennett one of the house servants on a panting foam covered horse Ah mister Darrell the man cried as the door opened it s a good thing that you keep late hours right glad I was to see the light in your window I can tell you sir But Bennett what brings you here at this time of night Darrell asked hastily missus Dean sent me sir mister Underwood he s had a stroke and is as helpless as a baby sir and missus Dean s alone excepting for us servants She sent me for you sir here s a note from her and she said you was to ride right back with me if you would sir Certainly I ll go with you Darrell answered taking the note but that horse must not stand in the cold another minute Ride right over into the stables yonder wake up the stable men and tell them to rub him down and blanket him at once and then to saddle Trix and Rob Roy as quickly as they can And while they re looking after the horses you go over to the boarding house and wake up the cook and tell him to get us up a good substantial hand out we ll need it before morning I ll be ready in a few minutes and I ll meet you over there All right sir Bennett responded starting in the direction of the stables while Darrell went back into his room Opening the note he read the following MY DEAR JOHN I am in trouble and look to you as to a son David has had a paralytic stroke was brought home helpless about five o clock I am alone as you might say as there is none of the family here Will you come at once Yours in sorrow but with love MARCIA DEAN Darrell s face grew thoughtful as he refolded the missive He glanced regretfully at his notes and manuscript then carefully gathered them together and locked them in his desk little thinking that months would pass ere he would again resume the work thus interrupted Then only stopping long enough to write a few lines of explanation to Hathaway the superintendent he seized his fur coat cap and gloves and hastened over to the boarding house where a lunch was already awaiting him Half an hour later he and Bennett were riding rapidly down the road Duke bounding on ahead They reached The Pines between four and five o clock Darrell leaving the horses in Bennett s care went directly to the house Before he could reach the door it was opened by missus Dean I ought not to have sent for you on such a night as this she exclaimed as Darrell entered the room his clothes glistening with frost the broad collar turned up about his face a mass of icicles from his frozen breath but I felt as though I didn t know what to do and I wanted some one here who did I was afraid to take the responsibility any longer You did just right Darrell answered dashing away the ice from his face I only wish you had sent for me earlier as soon as this happened How is mister Underwood He is in pretty bad shape but the doctors think he will pull through They have been working over him all night and he is getting so he can move the right hand a little but the other side seems badly paralyzed Is he conscious Yes he moves his hand when we speak to him but he looks so worried That was one reason why I sent for you I thought he would feel easier to know you were here As Darrell approached the bedside he was shocked at the changes wrought in so short a time in the stern but genial face It had aged twenty years and the features partially drawn to one side had as missus Dean remarked a strained worried expression The eyes of the sick man brightened for an instant as Darrell bent over him assuring him that he would attend to everything but the anxious look still remained I don t know anything about David s business affairs missus Dean remarked as she and Darrell left the room but I know as well as I want to that this was brought on by some business trouble I am satisfied something was wrong at the office yesterday though I wouldn t say so to any one but you Why do you think so Darrell queried in surprise Because he was all right when he went away yesterday morning but when he came home at noon he was different from what I had ever seen him before He had just that worried look he has now and he seemed absent minded He was in a great hurry to get back and the head book keeper tells me he called for the books to be brought into his private office and that he spent most of the afternoon going through them He says that about four o clock he went through the office and David was sitting before his desk with his head on his hands and he didn t speak or look up A little while afterwards they heard the sound of something heavy falling and ran to his room and he had fallen on the floor It does look Darrell admitted thoughtfully as though this may have been caused by the discovery of some wrong condition of affairs Yes and it must be pretty serious missus Dean rejoined to bring about such results as these Well said Darrell we may not be able to arrive at the cause of this for some time The first thing to be done is to see that you take a good rest don t have any anxiety I will look after everything As soon as it is daylight it would be well to telegraph for mister Britton if you know his address and possibly for Miss Underwood unless he should seem decidedly better But missus Dean did not know mister Britton s address no word having been received from him since his departure and with the return of daylight mister Underwood had gained so perceptibly it was thought best not to alarm Kate unnecessarily For the first few days the improvement in mister Underwood s condition was slow but gradually became quite pronounced Nothing had been heard from Walcott since his sudden leave taking but about a week after mister Underwood s seizure word was received from him that he was on his way home As an excuse for his prolonged absence and silence he stated that his father had died and that he had been delayed in the adjustment of business matters It was noticeable that after receiving word from Walcott the look of anxiety in mister Underwood s face deepened but his improvement was more marked than ever It seemed as though the powerful brain and indomitable will dominated the body forcing it to resume its former activity By this time he was able to move about his room on crutches and on the day of Walcott s return he insisted upon being placed in his carriage and taken to the office At his request Darrell accompanied him and remained with him Walcott upon his arrival in the city had heard of the illness of his senior partner and was therefore greatly surprised on entering the offices to find him there He quickly recovered himself and greeted mister Underwood with expressions of profound sympathy To his words of condolence however mister Underwood deigned no reply but his keen eyes bent a searching look upon the face of the younger man under which the latter quailed visibly then without any preliminaries or any inquiries regarding his absence mister Underwood at once proceeded to business affairs His stay at the office was brief as he soon found himself growing fatigued As he was leaving Walcott inquired politely for missus Dean then with great particularity for Miss Underwood She is out of town at present mister Underwood replied watching Walcott Out of town Indeed Since when may I inquire You evidently have not been in correspondence with her mister Underwood commented ignoring the other s question Well no the latter stammered slightly taken aback by his partner s manner I had absolutely no opportunity for writing or I would have written you earlier and then really you know it was hardly to be expected that I would write Miss Underwood considering her attitude towards myself I am hoping that she will regard me with more favor after this little absence You will probably be able to judge of that on her return the elder man answered dryly Kate on being informed by letter of her father s condition had wished to return home at once She had been deterred from doing so by brief messages from him to the effect that she remain with her friends but she was unable to determine whether those messages were prompted by kindness or anger On the evening following Walcott s return however mister Underwood dictated to Darrell a letter to Kate addressing her by her pet name assuring her of his constant improvement and that she need on no account shorten her visit but enjoy herself as long as possible and enclosing a generous check as a present To Darrell and to missus Dean who was sitting near by with her knitting this letter seemed rather significant and their eyes met in a glance of mutual inquiry After mister Underwood had retired Darrell surprised that worthy lady by an account of her brother s reception of Walcott that day while she in turn treated Darrell to a greater surprise by telling him of Kate s renunciation of Walcott at the last moment before she knew anything of the postponement of the wedding As they separated for the night Darrell remarked I may be wrong but it looks to me as though the cause of mister Underwood s illness was the discovery of some evidence of bad faith on Walcott s part It looks that way missus Dean assented I ve always felt that man would bring us trouble and I hope David does find him out before it s too late Chapter XXIV FORESHADOWINGS During mister Underwood s illness and convalescence it was pathetic to watch his dependence upon Darrell He seemed to regard him almost as a son and when as his health improved Darrell spoke of returning to the camp he would not hear of it Every day after Walcott s return mister Underwood was taken to the office where he gradually resumed charge directing the business of the firm though able to do little himself As he was still unable to write he wished Darrell to act as his secretary and the latter glad of an opportunity to reciprocate mister Underwood s many kindnesses to himself readily acceded to his wishes When engaged in this work he used the room which had formerly been his own office and which of late had been unoccupied Returning to his office after the transaction of some outside business to await as usual the carriage to convey mister Underwood and himself to The Pines he heard Walcott s voice in the adjoining room A peculiar quality in his tones as though he were pleading for favor arrested Darrell s attention and he could not then avoid hearing what followed But surely he was saying an amount so trifling and taking all the circumstances into consideration that I regarded myself already one of your family and looked upon you as my father you certainly cannot take so harsh a view of it That makes no difference whatever mister Underwood interposed sternly misappropriation of funds is misappropriation of funds no matter what the amount or the circumstances under which it is taken and as for your looking upon me as a father I wouldn t allow my own son if I had one to appropriate one dollar of my money without my knowledge and consent If you needed money you had only to say so and I would have loaned you any amount necessary But I regarded this in the nature of a loan Walcott protested only I was so limited for time I did not think it necessary to speak of it until my return You were not so limited but that you had time to tamper with the books and make false entries in them mister Underwood retorted That was done simply to blind the employees so they need not catch on that I was borrowing There is no use in further talk the other interrupted impatiently what you have done is done and your talk will not smooth it over Besides I have already told you that I care far less for the money withdrawn from my personal account than for the way you are conducting business generally There is not a client of mine who can say that I have ever wronged him or taken an unfair advantage of him and I ll not have any underhanded work started here now Everything has got to be open and above board As I have said mister Underwood in the hurry and excitement of the last week or so before my going away I was forced to neglect some business matters but if I will straighten everything into satisfactory shape and repay that small loan as I still regard it I hope then that our former pleasant relations will be resumed and that no little misapprehension of this sort will make any difference between us Walcott said mister Underwood rising on his crutches and preparing to leave the room I had absolute confidence in you I trusted you implicitly Your own conduct has shaken that confidence and it may be some time before it is wholly restored We will continue business as before but remember you are on probation sir on probation When Kate Underwood received her father s letter instead of prolonging her visit she at once prepared to return home She understood that the barrier between her father and herself had been swept away and nothing could then hold her back from him Two days later as mister Underwood was seated by the fire on his return from the office there came a ring at the door which he took to be the postman s missus Dean answered the door Any letter from Kate he asked as his sister returned Yes there s a pretty good sized one she replied with a broad smile adding as he glanced in surprise at her empty hands I didn t bring it twas too heavy The next instant two arms were thrown about his neck a slender figure was kneeling beside him and a fair young face was pressed close to his while words of endearment were murmured in his ear Without a word he clasped her to his breast holding her for a few moments as though he feared to let her go Then relaxing his hold he playfully pinched her cheeks and stroked the brown hair calling her by the familiar name Puss while his face lighted with the old genial smile for the first time since his illness Each scanned the other s face striving to gauge the other s feelings but each read only that the old relations were re established between them and each was satisfied Within a day or so of her return Kate despatched a messenger to Walcott with the ring accompanied by a brief note to the effect that everything between them was at an end but that it was useless for him to seek an explanation as she would give none whatever He at once took the note to his senior partner I understood mister Underwood that everything was amicably adjusted between us I did not suppose that you had carried your suspicions against me to any such length as this mister Underwood read the note I know nothing whatever regarding my daughter s reasons for her decision and have had nothing whatever to do with it I knew that she had formed that decision at the last moment before the wedding ceremony was to be performed before she was even aware of its postponement She seemed to think she had sufficient reasons but what those reasons were I have never asked and do not know But do you intend to allow her to play fast and loose with me in this way Is she not to fulfil her engagement Walcott inquired with difficulty concealing his anger mister Underwood regarded him steadily for a moment mister Walcott taking all things into consideration I think perhaps we had better let things remain as they are say for a year or so My daughter is young there is no need of haste in the consummation of this marriage I have found what she is worth to me and I am in no haste to spare her from my home If she is worth having as a wife she is worth winning and I shall not force her against her wishes a second time mister Underwood spoke quietly but Walcott understood that further discussion was useless Meeting Kate a few days later in her father s office he greeted her with marked politeness After a few inquiries regarding her visit he said May I be allowed to inquire who is responsible for your sudden decision against me You and you alone are responsible she replied But I do not understand you he said Explanations are unnecessary she rejoined coldly Walcott grew angry I know very well that certain of your friends are no friends of mine If I thought that either or both of them had had a hand in this I would make it a bitter piece of work for them mister Walcott said Kate with dignity you only demean yourself by such threats No one has influenced me in this matter but you yourself You unwittingly afforded me at the last moment an insight into your real character That is enough Walcott felt that he had gone too far Perhaps I spoke hastily but surely it was pardonable considering my grievance I hope you will overlook it and allow me to see you at The Pines will you not Miss Underwood If my father sees fit to invite you to his house I will probably meet you as his guest but not otherwise Although mister Underwood had resumed charge of the downtown offices as before his illness it soon became evident to all that his active business life was practically over and that some of his varied interests involving as they did a multiplicity of cares and responsibilities must be curtailed It was therefore decided to sell the mines at Camp Bird at as early a date as practicable and mister Britton mister Underwood s partner in the mining business was summoned from a distant State to conduct negotiations for the sale He arrived early in April and from that time on he and Darrell were engaged in appraising and advertising the property embraced in the great mining and milling plant in arranging the terms of sale and in accompanying various prospective purchasers or their agents to and from the mines Darrell s work as mister Underwood s secretary had been taken up by Kate who now seldom left her father s side Between herself and Darrell there was a comradeship similar to that which existed between them previous to her engagement with Walcott only more healthful and normal being unmixed with any regret for the past or dread of the future You will remain at The Pines when the mines are sold will you not she inquired one day on his return from a trip to the camp Not unless I am needed he replied your father will need me but little longer then unless you need me I had better not remain She was silent for a moment No she said slowly I do not need you I have the assurance of your love that is enough I know you will be loyal to me as I to you wherever you may be I will feel far less regret in going away now that I know you are free from that man Walcott Darrell continued but I wish you would please answer me one question Kathie have you any fear of him Not for myself she answered but I believe he is a man to be feared and she added significantly I do sometimes fear him for my friends perhaps for that reason it is as you say better that you should not remain Have no fear for me Kathie I understand That man has been my enemy from our first meeting but have no fear I am not afraid By the latter part of May negotiations for the sale of the mines had been consummated and Camp Bird passed into the possession of strangers It was with a feeling of exile and homelessness that Darrell riding for the last time down the canyon road turned to bid the mountains farewell looking back with lingering glances into the frowning faces he had learned to love What do you propose doing now mister Britton asked of him as they were walking together the evening after his return from camp That is just what I have been asking myself Darrell replied Without arriving at any satisfactory conclusion Not as yet What would you wish to do were you given your choice What I wish to do and what I intend to do if possible is to devote the next few months to the completion of my book I can now afford to devote my entire time to it but I could not do the work justice unless amid the right surroundings and the question is where to find them I do not care to remain here and yet I shrink from going among strangers There is no need of that mister Britton interposed quickly after a pause he continued You once expressed a desire for a sort of hermit life I think by this time you have grown sufficiently out of yourself that you could safely live alone with yourself for a while How would that suit you for three or four months I should like it above all things Darrell answered enthusiastically it would be just the thing for my work but where or how could I live in such a manner I believe I agreed at that time to furnish the hermitage whenever you were ready for it Yes you said something of the kind but I never understood what you meant by it Settle up your business here pack together what things you need for a few months sojourn in the mountains be ready to start with me next week and you will soon understand What is this hermitage as you call it and where is it Darrell asked curiously The other only shook his head with a smile All right said Darrell laughing I only hope it is as secluded and beautiful as Camp Bird I am homesick to night for my old quarters You can spend your entire time if you so desire without a glimpse of a human being other than the man who will look after your needs except as I may occasionally inflict myself upon you for a day or so Good Darrell ejaculated It is amid some of the grandest scenery ever created mister Britton continued adding slowly and to me it is the most sacred spot on earth a veritable Holy of Holies some day you will know why I thank you and I beg pardon for my levity said Darrell touched by the other s manner And the two men clasped hands and parted for the night A few days later as Darrell bade his friends at The Pines good by Kate whispered You think this is a parting for three or four months I feel that it is more Something tells me that before we meet again there will be a change I cannot tell what that will involve a long separation but I know that through it all our hearts will be true to each other and that out of it will come joy to each of us God grant it Kathie Darrell murmured Chapter XXV THE HERMITAGE Deep within the heart of the Rockies a June day was drawing to its close Behind a range of snow crowned peaks the sun was sinking into a sea of fire which glowed and shimmered along the western horizon and in whose transfiguring radiance the bold outlines of the mountains extending far as the eye could reach in endless ranks were marvellously softened the nearer cliffs and crags were wrapped in a golden glory while the hoary peaks against the eastern sky wore tints of rose and amethyst and over the whole brooded the silence of the ages Less than a score of miles distant a busy city throbbed with ceaseless life and activity but these royal monarchs towering one above another their hands joined in mystic fellowship their heads white with eternal snows dwelt in the same unbroken calm in which with noiseless step the centuries had come and gone leaving their footprints in the granite rocks Amid those vast distances only two signs of human handiwork were visible Close clinging to the sides of a rugged mountain a narrow track of shining steel wound its way upward marking the pathway of civilization in its march from sea to sea while near the summit of a neighboring peak a quaint cabin of unhewn logs arranged in Gothic fashion was built into the granite ledge On a small plateau before this unique dwelling stood John Britton and John Darrell the latter absorbed in the wondrous scene the other watching with intense satisfaction the surprise and rapture of his young companion They stood thus till the sun dipped out of sight The radiance faded rose and amethyst deepened to purple the mountains grew sombre and dun their rugged outlines standing in bold relief against the evening sky A nighthawk circling above their heads broke the silence with his shrill plaintive cry and with a sigh of deep content Darrell turned to his friend What do you think of it the latter asked It is unspeakably grand was the reply in awed tones Beckoning Darrell to follow mister Britton led the way to the cabin which he unlocked and entered Welcome to the Hermitage he said smilingly as Darrell paused on the threshold with an exclamation of delight A huge fireplace blasted from solid rock extended nearly across one side of the room Over it hung antlers of moose elk and deer while skins of mountain lion bear and wolf covered the floor A large writing table stood in the centre of the room and beside it a bookcase filled with the works of some of the world s greatest authors Darrell lifted one book after another with the reverential touch of the true book lover while mister Britton hastily arranged the belongings of the room so as to render it as cosey and attractive as possible The evenings are so cool at this altitude that a fire will soon seem grateful he remarked lighting the fragrant boughs of spruce and hemlock which filled the fireplace and drawing chairs before the crackling dancing flames Duke who had accompanied them stretched himself in the firelight with a low growl of satisfaction at which both men smiled It was the first time Darrell had ever seen his friend in the role of host but mister Britton proved himself a royal entertainer His experiences of mountain life had been varied and thrilling and the cabin contained many relics and trophies of his prowess as huntsman and trapper As the evening wore on mister Britton opened a small store room built in the rock and took therefrom a tempting repast of venison and wild fowl which his forethought had ordered placed there for the occasion To Darrell sitting by the fragrant fire and listening to tales of adventure the time passed only too swiftly and he was sorry when the entrance of the man with his luggage recalled them to the lateness of the hour There is a genuine hermit for you mister Britton remarked as the man took his departure after agreeing to come to the cabin once a day to do whatever might be needed Who is he Darrell asked No one knows He goes by the name of Peter but nothing is known of his real name or history He has lived in these mountains for thirty years and has not visited a city or town of any size in that time He is a trapper but acts as guide during the summers He is very popular with tourist and hunting parties that come to the mountains but nothing will induce him to leave his haunts except as he occasionally goes to some small station for supplies Where does he live In a cabin about half way down the trail He is a good cook a faithful man every way but you will find him very reticent He is one of the many in this country whose past is buried out of sight mister Britton then led the way to two smaller rooms a kitchen equipped with a small stove table and cooking utensils and a sleeping apartment its two bunks piled with soft blankets and wolf skins As Darrell proceeded to disrobe his attention was suddenly attracted by an object in one corner of the room which he was unable to distinguish clearly in the dim light Upon going over to examine it more closely what was his astonishment to see a large crucifix of exquisite design and workmanship As he turned towards mister Britton the latter smiled to see the bewilderment depicted on his face You did not expect to find such a souvenir of old Rome in a mountain cabin did you he asked Perhaps not Darrell admitted but that of itself is not what so greatly surprises me Are you a He paused abruptly without finishing the question I will answer the question you hesitate to ask the other replied no I am not a Catholic neither am I in the strict sense of the word a Protestant or one who protests since if I were I would protest no more earnestly against the errors of the Catholic Church than against the evils existing in other so called Christian churches Darrell s eyes returned to the crucifix That continued mister Britton was given me years ago by a beloved friend of mine a priest now an archbishop in return for a few services rendered some of his people I keep it for the lessons it taught me in the years of my sorrow and whenever my burden seems greater than I can bear I come back here and look at that and beside the suffering which it symbolizes my own is dwarfed to insignificance A long silence followed then as they lay down in the darkness Darrell said in subdued tones I have never heard you say and it never before occurred to me to ask what was your religion I don t know that I have any particular religion mister Britton answered slowly I have no formulated creed I am a child of God and a disciple of Jesus the Christ Like Him I am the child of a King a son of the highest Royalty yet a servant to my fellow men that is all The following morning mister Britton awakened Darrell at an early hour Forgive me for disturbing your slumbers but I want you to see the sunrise from these heights I think you will feel repaid You could not see it at the camp you were so hemmed in by higher mountains Darrell rose and having dressed hastily stepped out into the gray twilight of the early dawn A faint flush tinged the eastern sky which deepened to a roseate hue growing moment by moment brighter and more vivid Chain after chain of mountains slumbering dark and grim against the horizon suddenly awoke blushing and smiling in the rosy light Then as rays of living flame shot upward mingling with the crimson waves and changing them to molten gold the snowy caps of the higher peaks were transformed to jewelled crowns There was a moment of transcendent beauty then in a burst of glory the sun appeared That is a sight I shall never forget and one I shall try to see often Darrell said as they retraced their steps to the cabin You will never find it twice the same mister Britton answered Nature varies her gifts so that to her true lovers they will not pall After breakfast they again strolled out into the sunlight mister Britton seating himself upon a projecting ledge of granite while Darrell threw himself down upon the mountain grass his head resting within his clasped hands What an ideal spot for my work he exclaimed mister Britton smiled I fear you would never accomplish much with me here I must return to the city soon or you will degenerate into a confirmed idler I have often thought said Darrell reflectively that when I have completed this work I would like to attempt a novel It seems as though there is plenty of material out here for a strong one Think of the lives one comes in contact with almost daily stranger than fiction every one Your own for instance mister Britton suggested Yours also Darrell replied in low tones the story of your life if rightly told would do more to uplift men s souls than nine tenths of the sermons The story of my life my son will never be told to any ear other than your own and I trust to your love for me that it will go no farther Of that you can rest assured Darrell replied As the sun climbed towards the zenith they returned to the cabin and seated themselves on a broad settee of rustic work under an overhanging vine near the cabin door I have been wondering ever since I came here said Darrell how you ever discovered such a place as this It is so unique and so appropriate to the surroundings I discovered said mister Britton with slight emphasis on the word only the surroundings The cabin is my own work What do you mean to say that you built it Yes little by little At first it was hardly more than a rude shelter but I gradually enlarged it and beautified it trying always as you say to keep it in harmony with its surroundings Then you are an artist and a genius But that is not the only work I did during the first months of my life here Come with me and I will show you He led the way along the trail farther up the mountain till a sharp turn hid him from view Darrell following closely came upon the entrance of an incline shaft leading into the mountain Just within he saw mister Britton lighting two candles which he had taken from a rocky ledge one of these he handed to Darrell and then proceeded down the shaft A mine Darrell exclaimed Yes and a valuable one were it only accessible so that it could be developed without enormous expense but that is out of the question The underground workings were not extensive but the vein was one of exceptional richness When they emerged later Darrell brought with him some specimens and a tiny nugget of gold as souvenirs The first season said mister Britton I worked the mine and built the cabin as a shelter for the coming winter The winter months I spent in hunting and trapping when I could go out in the mountains and hibernated during the long storms Early in the spring I began mining again and worked the following season By that time I was ready to start forth into the world so I gave Peter an interest in the mine and he works it from time to time doing little more than the representation each year As they descended towards the cabin mister Britton continued I have shown you this that you may the better understand the story I have to tell you before I leave you as sole occupant of the Hermitage Chapter XXVI JOHN BRITTON S STORY Evening found Darrell and his friend seated on the rocks watching the sunset mister Britton was unusually silent and Darrell through a sort of intuitive sympathy refrained from breaking the silence At last as the glow was fading from earth and sky mister Britton said I have chosen this day and this hour to tell you my story because being the anniversary of my wedding it seemed peculiarly appropriate Twenty eight years ago at sunset on such a royal day as this we were married my love and I He spoke with an unnatural calmness as though it were another s story he was telling I was young with a decided aptitude for commercial life ambitious determined to make my way in life but with little capital besides sound health and a good education She was the daughter of a wealthy man We speak in this country of mining kings he might be denominated an agricultural king He prided himself upon his hundreds of fertile acres his miles of forest his immense dairy his blooded horses his magnificent barns and granaries his beautiful home She was the younger daughter his especial pet and pride For a while as a friend and acquaintance of his two daughters I was welcome at his home later as a lover of the younger I was banished and its doors closed against me Our love was no foolish boy and girl romance and we had no word of kindly counsel only unreasoning stubborn opposition What followed was only what might have been expected Strong in our love for and trust in each other we went to a neighboring village and going to a little country parsonage were married without one thought of the madness the folly of what we were doing We found the minister and his family seated outside the house under a sort of arbor of flowering shrubs and I remember it was her wish that the ceremony be performed there Never can I forget her as she stood there her hand trembling in mine at the strangeness of the situation her cheeks flushed with excitement her lips quivering as she made the responses the slanting sunbeams kissing her hair and brow and the fragrant snowy petals of the mock orange falling about her A few weeks of unalloyed happiness followed then gradually my eyes were opened to the wrong I had done her My heart smote me as I saw her day by day performing household tasks to which she was unaccustomed subjected to petty trials and privations denying herself in many little ways in order to help me She never murmured but her very fortitude and cheerfulness were a constant reproach to me But a few months elapsed when we found that another was coming to share our home and our love We rejoiced together but my heart reproached me more bitterly than ever as I realized how ill prepared she was for what awaited her Our trials and privations brought us only closer to each other but my brain was racked with anxiety and my heart bled as day by day I saw the dawning motherhood in her eyes the growing tenderness the look of sweet wondering expectancy I grew desperate From a booming western city came reports of marvellous openings for business men of small investments bringing swift and large returns I placed my wife in the care of a good motherly woman and bade her good by while she brave heart without a tear bade me God speed I went there determined to win to make a home to which I would bring both wife and child later For three months I made money sending half to her and investing every cent which I did not absolutely need of the other half Then came tales from a mining district still farther west of fabulous fortunes made in a month a week sometimes a day What was the use of dallying where I was I hastened to the mining camp In less than a week I had struck it rich and knew that in all probability I would within a month draw out a fortune Just at this time the letters from home ceased For seven days I heard nothing and half mad with anxiety and suspense I awaited each night the incoming train to bring me tidings One night just as the train was about to leave I caught sight of a former acquaintance from a neighboring village bound for a camp yet farther west and as I greeted him he told me in few words and pitying tones of the death of my wife and child For a moment mister Britton paused and Darrell drew instinctively nearer though saying nothing I have no distinct recollection of what followed I was told afterwards that friendly hands caught me as the train started to save me from being crushed beneath the wheels For three months I wandered from one mining camp to another working mechanically with no thought or care as to success or failure An old miner from the first camp who had taken a liking to me followed me in my wanderings and worked beside me caring for me and guarding my savings as though he had been a father The old fellow never left me nor I him until his death three years later He taught me many valuable points in practical mining and I think his rough but kindly care was all that saved me from insanity during those years After his death I brooded over my grief till I became nearly frenzied I could not banish the thought that but for my rashness and foolishness in taking her from her home my wife might still have been living To myself I seemed little short of a murderer I left the camp and wandered night and day afar into the mountains I came to this mountain on which we are sitting and climbed nearly to the top God was there but like Jacob of old I knew it not But something seemed to speak to me out of the infinite silence calming my frenzied brain and soothing my troubled soul I sat there till the stars appeared and then I sank into a deep peaceful sleep the first in years When I awoke the sun was shining in my face and though the old pain still throbbed I had a sense of new strength with which to bear it I ate of the food I carried with me and drank from a mountain stream the same that trickles past us now only nearer its source The place fascinated me I dared not leave it and I spent the day in wandering up and down the rocks My steps were guided to the mine I showed you to day I saw the indications of richness there and overturning the earth with my pick found gold among the very grassroots Then followed the life of which I have already given you an outline For a while I worked in pain and anguish but gradually in the solitude of the mountains my spirit found peace against their infinity my life with its burden dwindled to an atom and from the lesson of their centuries of silent waiting I gathered strength and fortitude to await my appointed time But after a time God spoke to me and bade me go forth from my solitude into the world to comfort other sorrowing souls as I had been comforted From that time I have travelled almost constantly I have no home I wish none I want to bring comfort and help to as many of earth s sorrowing sinning children as possible but when the old wound bleeds afresh and the pain becomes more than I can bear I flee as a bird to my mountain for balm and healing Do you wonder my son that the place is sacred to me Do you understand my love for you in bringing you here Darrell sat with bowed head speechless but one hand went out to mister Britton which the latter clasped in both his own When at last he raised his head he exclaimed Strange but your story has wrung my soul It seems in some inexplicable way a part of my very life Our souls seem united by some mystic tie I cannot explain what unless it be that in some respects our sufferings have been similar Mine have been as nothing to yours Darrell replied A moment later he added I feel as one in a dream what you have told me has taken such hold upon me Night had fallen when they returned to the cabin This seems hallowed ground to me now Darrell remarked It has always seemed so to me mister Britton replied but remember so long as you have need of the place it is always open to you Until the day break and the shadows flee away Darrell responded in low tones as though to himself mister Britton caught his meaning My son he said when the day breaks for you do not forget those who still sit in darkness Chapter XXVII THE RENDING OF THE VEIL The story of mister Britton s life impressed Darrell deeply In the days following his friend s departure he would sit for hours revolving it in his mind unable to rid himself of the impression that it was in some way connected with his own life Impelled by some motive he could scarcely explain he recorded it in his journal as told by mister Britton as nearly as he could recall it Left to himself he worked with unabated ardor but his work soon grew unsatisfying The inspiring nature of his surroundings seemed to stimulate him to higher effort and loftier work which should call into play the imaginative faculties and in which the brain would be free to weave its own creations Stronger within him grew the desire to write a novel which should have in it something of the power the force of the strenuous western life something which would seem in a measure at least worthy of his surroundings His day s work ended he would walk up and down the rocks sometimes far into the night the plot for this story forming within his brain till at last its outlines grew distinct and he knew the thing that was to be as the sculptor knows what will come forth at his bidding from the lifeless marble He made a careful synopsis of the plot that nothing might escape him in the uncertain future and then began to write The order of his work was now reversed the new undertaking being given his first and best thought then when imagination wearied and refused to rise above the realms of fact he fell back upon his scientific work as a rest from the other Thus employed the weeks passed with incredible swiftness the monotony broken by an occasional visit from mister Britton until August came its hot breath turning the grasses sere and brown One evening Darrell came forth from his work at a later hour than usual His mind had been unusually active his imagination vivid but wearied at last he was compelled to stop short of the task he had set for himself The heat had been intense that day and the atmosphere seemed peculiarly oppressive The sun was sinking amid light clouds of gorgeous tints and as Darrell watched their changing outlines they seemed fit emblems of the thoughts at that moment baffling his weary brain elusive intangible presenting themselves in numberless forms yet always beyond his grasp Standing erect with arms folded his pose indicated conscious strength and the face lifted to the evening sky was one which would have commanded attention amid a sea of human faces Two years had wrought wondrous changes in it Strength and firmness were there still but sweetness was mingled with the strength and the old indomitable will was tempered with gentleness All the finer susceptibilities had been awakened and had left their impress there Introspection had done its work It was the face of a man who knew himself and had conquered himself The sculptor s work was almost complete Not a breath stirred the air which moment by moment grew more oppressive presaging a coming storm Darrell was suddenly filled with a strange unrest a presentiment of some impending catastrophe For a while he walked restlessly up and down the narrow plateau then seating himself in front of the cabin he bowed his head upon his hands shutting out all sight and thought of the present for his mind seemed teeming with vague shadowy forms of the past Duke came near and laid his head against his master s shoulder and the twilight deepened around them both Far up the neighboring mountain a mighty engine loomed out from the gathering darkness a fiery headed monster and with its long train of coaches crawled serpent like around the rocky height then vanished as it came The clouds which had been roving indolently across the western horizon suddenly formed in line and moved steadily a solid battalion upward towards the zenith while from the east another phalanx black and threatening advanced with low wrathful mutterings Unmindful of the approaching storm Darrell sat silent and motionless till a sudden peal of thunder the first note of the impending battle roused him from his revery Springing to his feet he watched the rapidly advancing armies marshalling their forces upon the battle ground Another roll of thunder and the conflict began Up and down the mountain passes the winds rushed wildly shrieking like demons Around the lofty summits the lightnings played like the burnished swords of giants in mortal combat while peal after peal resounded through the vast spaces reverberated from peak to peak echoed and re echoed till the rocks themselves seemed to tremble With quickening pulse and bated breath Darrell watched the storm fascinated entranced while emotions he could neither understand nor control surged through his breast More and more fiercely the battle waged more swift and brilliant grew the sword play while the roar of heaven s artillery grew louder and louder His spirit rose with the strife filling him with a strange sense of exaltation Suddenly the universe seemed wrapped in flame there was a deafening crash as though the eternal hills were being rent asunder and then oblivion When that instant of blinding light and deafening sound had passed John Darrell lay prostrate unconscious on the rocks Chapter XXVIII AS A DREAM WHEN ONE AWAKETH As the morning sun arose over the snowy summits of the Great Divide the sleeper on the rocks stirred restlessly then gradually awoke to consciousness a delightful consciousness of renewed life and vigor a subtle sense of revivification of body and mind The racking pain the burning fever the legions of torturing phantoms all were gone his pulse was calm his blood cool his brain clear With a sigh of deep content he opened his eyes then suddenly rose to a sitting posture and gazed about him in utter bewilderment above him only the boundless dome of heaven around him only endless mountain ranges Dazed by the strangeness the isolation of the scene he began for an instant to doubt his sanity was this a reality or a chimera of his own imagination But only for an instant for with his first movement a large collie had bounded to his side and now began licking his hands and face with the most joyful demonstrations There was something soothing and reassuring in the companionship even of the dumb brute and he caressed the noble creature confident that he would soon find some sign of human life in that strange region but the dog reading no look of recognition in the face beside him drew back and began whining piteously Perplexed but with his faculties thoroughly aroused and active the young man sprang to his feet and looking eagerly about him discovered at a little distance the cabin against the mountain ledge Hastening thither he found the door open and after vainly waiting for any response to his knocking entered The furnishings were mostly hand made but fashioned with considerable artistic skill and contributed to give the interior a most attractive appearance while etchings books and papers pages of written manuscript and a violin indicated its occupants to be a man of refined tastes and studious habits The dog had accompanied him sometimes following closely sometimes going on in advance as though to lead the way Once within the cabin he led him to the store room in the rock where was an abundance of food which the latter proceeded to divide between himself and his dumb guide Having satisfied his hunger the young man took a newspaper from the table and going outside the cabin seated himself to await the return of his unknown host Sitting there he discovered for the first time the railway winding around the sides of the lofty mountain opposite The sight filled him with delight for those slender rails gleaming in the morning sunlight seemed to connect him with the world which he remembered but from which he appeared so strangely isolated Unfolding the newspaper his attention was attracted by the date at which he gazed in consternation his eyes riveted to the page For a moment his head swam he was unable to believe his own senses Dropping the sheet and bowing his head upon his hands he went carefully over the past as he now remembered it the business on which he had been commissioned to come west his journey westward the tragedy in the sleeping car he shuddered as the memory of the murderer s face flashed before him with terrible distinctness his reception at The Pines all was as clear as though it had happened but yesterday it was in August and this was August but two years later Great God had two years dropped out of his life Again he recalled his illness the long agony the final sinking into oblivion the strange awakening in perfect health yes surely there must be a missing link but how where He rose to re enter the cabin and passing the window caught a glimpse of his face reflected there a face like and yet unlike his own and crowned with snow white hair In doubt and bewilderment he paced up and down within the cabin vainly striving to connect these fragmentary parts to reconcile the present with the past As he passed and repassed the table covered with manuscript his attention was attracted by an odd looking volume bound in flexible morocco and containing several hundred pages of written matter It lay partly open in a conspicuous place and upon the fly leaf was written in large bold characters To my Other Self should he awaken He could not banish the words from his mind they drew him with irresistible magnetism Again and again he read them until impelled by some power he could not explain he seized the volume and seating himself in the doorway of the cabin proceeded to examine it Lifting the fly leaf he read the following inscription To one from the outer world whose identity is hidden among the secrets of the past With the hope that when the veil is lifted these pages may assist him in uniting into one perfect whole the strangely disjointed portions of his life they are inscribed by JOHN DARRELL He smiled as he read the name and recalled the circumstances under which he had taken it but he no longer felt any hesitation regarding the volume in his hands and he began to read It was written as a communication from one stranger to another from the mountain recluse to one of whose life he had not the slightest knowledge but he knew without doubt that it was addressed to himself yet written by himself that writer and reader were one and the same For more than two hours he read on and on deeply absorbed in the tale of that solitary life his own heart responding to each note of joy or sorrow of hope or despair and vibrating to the undertone of loneliness and longing running through it all He strove vainly to recall the characters in the strange drama in which he had played his part but of which he had now no distinct recollection dimly they passed before his vision like the shadowy phantoms of a dream from which one has just awakened He started at the first mention of John Britton s name eagerly following each outline of that noble character his heart kindling with affection as he read his words of loving helpful counsel His face grew tender and his eyes filled at the love story so pathetically brief faithfully transcribed on those pages but of Kate Underwood he could only recall a slender girl with golden brown hair and wistful appealing brown eyes he wondered at the strength of character shown by her speech and conduct and his heart went out to this unknown love notwithstanding that memory now showed him the picture of another and earlier love in the far East But it was the story of John Britton s life which moved him most With strained eager eyes and bated breath he read that sad recital and at its termination buried his face in his hands and sobbed like a child When he had grown calm he sat for some time reviewing the past and forming plans for future action While thus absorbed in thought he heard a step and looking up saw standing before him a man of apparently sixty years with bronzed face and grizzled hair whose small piercing eyes regarded himself with keen scrutiny In response to the younger man s greeting he only bowed silently You must be Peter the hermit the young man exclaimed but whoever you are you are welcome I am glad to see a human face And you replied the other slowly you are not the same man that you were yesterday you have awakened as he said you would some day As who said the young man questioned John Britton the other replied Yes I have awakened and my life here is like a dream Sit down Peter I want to ask you some questions For half an hour they sat together the younger man asking questions the other answering in as few words as possible his keen eyes never leaving the face of his interlocutor Where is this John Britton the young man finally inquired In Ophir at a place called The Pines I know the place I remember it How far is it from here Fifteen miles by rail from the station at the foot of the mountain I must go to him at once you will show me the way How soon can we get away from here Peter glanced at the sun We cannot get down the trail in season for to day s train We will start to morrow morning Without further speech he then went into the cabin and busied himself with his accustomed duties When he reappeared he again stood silently regarding the younger man with his fixed penetrating gaze What awakened you he asked at length The abruptness of the question as well as its tenor startled the other that was a phase of the mystery surrounding himself of which he had not even thought I do not know he replied slowly that question had not occurred to me before What do you think Might it not have come about in the ordinary sequence of events Peter shook his head Not likely he muttered there must have been a shock of some kind The young man smiled brightly Well I cannot answer for yesterday s events he said having neither record nor recollection of the day but I certainly sustained a shock this morning on awaking on the bare rocks at such an altitude as this and with no trace of a human being visible On the rocks Peter repeated where Yonder said the young man indicating the direction come I will show you the exact spot He led the way to his rocky bed near one end of the plateau then watched his companion s movements as he knelt down and carefully inspected the rock then rising to his feet looked searchingly in every direction with his ferret like glance Ah the latter suddenly exclaimed with emphasis at the same time pointing to a rock almost overhanging their heads Following the direction indicated the young man saw a pine tree on the edge of the overhanging rock the entire length of its trunk split open its branches shrivelled and blackened as though by fire Peter notwithstanding his age sprang up the rocks with the agility of a panther the younger man following more slowly As he came up Peter turned from an examination of the dead tree and looked at him significantly An electric shock he said that was a living tree yesterday There was an electric storm last night the worst in years it brought death to the tree but life to you To the younger man the words of the old hermit seemed incredible but that night brought him a strange confirmation of their truth Upon disrobing for the night what was his astonishment to discover upon his right shoulder and extending downward diagonally across the right breast a long blue mark of irregular zigzag form while running parallel with it its entire length perfect as though done in India ink with an artist s pen was the outline of the very scene surrounding him where he lay that morning cliff and crag and mountain peak traced indelibly upon the living flesh an indubitable evidence of the power which had finally aroused his dormant faculties and a souvenir of the lost years which he would carry with him to his dying day Chapter XXIX JOHN DARRELL S STORY On the following morning the cabin on the mountain side was closed at an early hour and its late occupant accompanied by Peter and the collie descended the trail to the small station near the base of the mountain where he took leave of the old hermit On his arrival at Ophir he ordered a carriage and drove directly to The Pines for he was impatient to see John Britton at as early a date as possible and was fearful lest the latter with his migratory habits might escape him It was near noon when having dismissed the carriage he rang for admission He recalled the house and grounds as they appeared to him on his first arrival but he found it hard to realize that he was looking upon the scenes among which most of that strange drama of the last two years had been enacted mister Underwood himself came to the door Why Darrell my boy how do you do he exclaimed shaking hands heartily thought you d take us by surprise eh Got a little tired of living alone I guess and thought you d come back to your friends Well it s mighty good to see you come in we ll have lunch in about an hour To mister Underwood s surprise the young man did not immediately accept the invitation to come in but seemed to hesitate for a moment I am very glad to meet you mister Underwood he responded pleasantly but with a shade of reserve in his manner I remember you very well indeed and probably yours is about the only face I will be able to recall For a moment mister Underwood seemed staggered unable to comprehend the meaning of the other s words The young man continued I understand mister Britton is stopping with you is he still here or has he left He is here mister Underwood replied but good God Darrell what does this mean Before the other could reply mister Britton who was in an adjoining room and had overheard the colloquy came quickly forward He gave a swift penetrating glance into the young man s face then turning to mister Underwood said It means David that our young friend has come to his own again He is no longer of our world or of us Then turning to the young man he said I am John Britton do you wish to see me The other looked earnestly into the face of the speaker and his own features betrayed emotion as he replied I do I must see you on especially important business David you will let us have the use of your private room for a while mister Britton inquired mister Underwood nodded silently his eyes fixed with a troubled expression upon the young man s face The latter observing his distress said Don t think mister Underwood that I am insensible to all your kindness to me since my coming here two years ago I shall see you later and show you that I am not lacking in appreciation though I can never express my gratitude to you but before I can do that before I can even tell you who I am it is necessary that I see mister Britton Tut tut said mister Underwood gruffly don t talk to me of gratitude I don t want any but my God boy I had come to look on you almost as my own son And turning abruptly he left the room before either of the others could speak He is a man of very strong feelings said mister Britton leading the way to mister Underwood s room and to tell the truth this is a pretty hard blow to each of us although we should have prepared ourselves for it Be seated my son Seating himself beside the young man and again looking into his face he said I see that the day has dawned when did the light come and how Briefly the other related his awakening on the rocks and the events which followed down to his finding and reading the journal which recorded so faithfully the history of the missing years mister Britton listening with intense interest At last the young man said Of all the records of that journal there was nothing that interested me so greatly or moved me so deeply as did the story of your own life That is what brought me here to day I have come to tell you my story the story of John Darrell as you have known him and possibly you may find it in some ways a counterpart to your own I was drawn towards you in some inexplicable way from our first meeting mister Britton replied slowly you became as dear to me as a son so that I gave you in confidence the story that no other human being has ever heard It is needless to say that I appreciate this mark of your confidence in return and that you can rest assured of my deepest interest in anything concerning yourself The younger man drew his chair nearer his companion As you already know he said I am a mine expert I came out here on a commission for a large eastern syndicate and as there was likely to be lively competition and I wished to remain incognito I took the name of John Darrell which in reality was a part of my own name My home is in New York State I was a country bred boy brought up on one of those great farms which abound a little north of the central part of the State but though country bred I was not a rustic for my mother who was my principal instructor until I was about fourteen years of age was a woman of refinement and culture My mother and I lived at her father s house a beautiful country home but even while a mere child I became aware that there was some kind of an unpleasant secret in our family My grandfather would never allow my father s name mentioned and he had little love for me as his child but my earliest recollections of my mother are of her kneeling with me night after night in prayer teaching me to love and revere the father I had never known who she told me was gone away and to pray always for his welfare and for his return At fourteen I was sent away to a preparatory school and afterwards to college Then as I developed a taste for mineralogy and metallurgy I took a course in the Columbian School of Mines By this time I had learned that while it was generally supposed my mother was a widow there were those my grandfather among them who believed that my father had deserted her My first intimation of this was an insinuation to that effect by my grandfather himself soon after my graduation I was an athlete and already had a good position at a fair salary and so great was my love and reverence for my father s name that I told the old gentleman that nothing but his white hairs saved him from a sound thrashing and that at the first repetition of any such insinuation I would take my mother from under his roof and provide a home for her myself That sufficed to silence him effectually for he idolized her After this little episode I went to my mother and begged her to tell me the secret regarding my father The young man paused for a moment his dark eyes gazing earnestly into the clear gray eyes watching him intently then without shifting his gaze he continued in low tones She told me that about a year before my birth she and my father were married against her father s will his only objection to the marriage being that my father was poor She told me of their happy married life that followed but that my father was ambitious and the consciousness of poverty and the fact that he could not provide for her as he wished galled him She told me how when there was revealed to them the promise of a new love and life within their little home he redoubled his efforts to do for her and hers and then dissatisfied with what he could accomplish there went out into the new West to build a home for his little family She told of the brave loving letters that came so faithfully and the generous remittances to provide for every possible need in the coming emergency Then Fortune beckoned him still farther west and he obeyed daring the dangers of that strange wild country for the love he bore his wife and his unborn child From that country only one letter ever was received from him Just at that time I was born and my life came near costing hers who bore me For weeks she lay between life and death so low that the report of her death reached her parents bringing them broken hearted and as they supposed too late to her humble home They found her yet living and threw their love and their wealth into the battle against death In all this time no news came from the great West As soon as she could be moved my mother and her child were taken to her father s home Her father forgave her but he had no forgiveness for her husband and no love for his child He tried to make my mother believe her husband had deserted her but she was loyal in her trust in him as in her love for him She named her child for his father John but as her father would not allow the name repeated in his hearing she gave him the additional name of Darrell by which he was universally known but in those sacred hours when she told me of my father and taught me to pray for him she always called me by his name John Britton As he ceased speaking both men rose simultaneously to their feet The elder man placed his hands upon the shoulders of the younger and standing thus face to face they looked into each other s eyes as though each were reading the other s inmost soul What was your mother s name mister Britton asked in low tones Patience Patience Jewett replied the other mister Britton bowed his head with deep emotion and father and son were clasped in each other s arms When they had grown calm enough for speech mister Britton s first words were of his wife What of your mother my son was she living when you came west Yes but her health was delicate and I am fearful of the effects of my long absence it must have been a terrible strain upon her As soon as I reached the city this morning I telegraphed an old schoolmate for tidings of her and I am expecting an answer any moment They talked of the strange chain of circumstances which had brought them together and of the mysterious bond by which they had been so closely united while as yet unconscious of their relationship The summons to lunch recalled them to the present As they rose to leave the room mister Britton threw his arm affectionately about Darrell s shoulders exclaiming My son Mine and I have loved you as such from the first time I looked into your eyes If God will now only permit me to see my beloved wife again I can ask nothing more And as Darrell gazed at the noble form towering slightly above his own and looked into the depths of those gray eyes penetrating fearless yet tender as a woman s he felt that however sweet and sacred had been the friendship between them in the past it was as naught compared with the infinitely sweeter and holier relationship of father and son They passed into the dining room where mister Underwood and missus Dean awaited them a look of eager expectancy on both faces the wistful expression of missus Dean as she watched for the first token of recognition on Darrell s part being almost pathetic mister Britton who had entered slightly in advance paused half way across the room and placing his hand on Darrell s shoulder said in a voice which vibrated with emotion My dear friends missus Dean and mister Underwood allow me to introduce my son John Darrell Britton There was a moment of strained silence in which only the labored breathing of mister Underwood could be heard Do you mean that you have adopted him mister Underwood asked slowly seeming to speak with difficulty No David he is my own flesh and blood my legitimate son I will explain later missus Dean and Darrell had clasped hands and were scanning each other s faces John do you remember me she asked with trembling lips Darrell bent his head and kissed her I do missus Dean he replied She smiled at the same time wiping away a tear with the corner of her white apron I don t think I could have borne it if you hadn t she remarked simply then shaking hands with mister Britton she added I congratulate you mister Britton I congratulate you both If ever there were two who ought to be father and son you are the two mister Underwood wrung Darrell s hand I congratulate you boy and I m mighty glad to find you re not a stranger to us after all Then grasping his old time partner s hand he added Jack you old fraud You ve always got the best of me on every bargain but I forgive you this time I wanted the boy myself but you seem to have the best title so there s no use to try to jump your claim Lunch was just over as a messenger was announced and a moment later a telegram was handed to Darrell As he opened the missive his fingers trembled and mister Britton s face grew pale Darrell hastily read the contents then met his father s anxious glance with a reassuring smile She is living and in usual health though my friend says she is much more delicate than when I left We must go to her at once my boy said mister Britton how soon can you leave In a very few hours father when do you wish to start mister Britton consulted a time table The east bound express leaves at ten thirty to night can we make that Sure Darrell responded with an enthusiasm new to his western friends you can t start too soon for me and there isn t a train that travels fast enough to take me to that little mother of mine especially with the good news I have for her Half an hour later as he was hastily gathering together his possessions he came suddenly upon a picture at sight of which he paused then stood spellbound all else for the time forgotten It was a portrait of Kate Underwood taken in the gown she had worn on that night of her first reception It served as a connecting link between the past and present Gazing at it he was able to understand how the young girl whom he faintly remembered had grown into the strong sweet character delineated in the recorded story of his love He was able to recall some of the scenes portrayed there he recalled her as she stood that day on the Divide her head uncovered her gleaming hair like a halo about her face her eyes shining with a light that was not of earth He kissed the picture reverently Sweet angel of my dream he murmured come what may you hold and always will a place in my heart which no other can ever take from you I will lay your sweet face away never again to be lifted from its hiding place until I can look upon it as the face of my betrothed His trunk was packed his preparations for departure nearly complete when there came a gentle tap at his door and missus Dean entered I was afraid she said speaking with some hesitation that you might think it strange if you did not see Katherine and I wanted to explain that she is away She went out of town to be gone for a few days She will be very sorry when she returns to find that she has missed seeing you Thank you missus Dean said Darrell slowly on some accounts I would have been very glad to meet Kate but on the whole I think perhaps it is better as it is I don t suppose you remember her except as you saw her when you first came missus Dean added wistfully I should like to have you see her as she is now I think she has matured into a beautiful young woman Yes I remember her missus Dean she is beautiful Oh do you She will be glad to hear that missus Dean exclaimed with a happy smile Darrell came nearer and took her hands within his own Will you give her a message from me just as I give it to you She will understand Oh yes gladly Tell her said Darrell and his voice trembled slightly I remember her Tell her I will see her at the time appointed and that I never forget Chapter XXX AFTER MANY YEARS The evening train as it was known a local from the south was approaching the little village of Ellisburg winding its way over miles of rolling country dotted with farm houses of snowy white to the east rough rugged hills surmounted by a wall of forest while far to the west could be seen the sandy beaches and blue waters of Lake Ontario The arrival of this train formed one of the chief events in the daily life of the little town and each summer evening found a group of from twenty to fifty of the village folk awaiting its incoming To them it afforded a welcome break in the monotony of their lives a fleeting glimpse of people and things from that vague world outside the horizon bounding their own Amid the usual handful of passengers left at the station on this particular evening were two who immediately drew the attention of the crowd Two men one something over fifty years of age tall with erect form and dark hair well silvered and with a grave sweet face the other not more than seven and twenty but with hair as white as snow while his face wore an inscrutable look as though the dark piercing eyes held within their depths secrets which the sphinx like lips would not reveal Closely following them was a splendid collie trying in various ways to give expression to his delight at being released from the confinement of the baggage car There was a sudden swift movement in the crowd as a young man stepped quickly forward and grasped the younger of the two by the hand Darrell old boy is this you he exclaimed Great Scott what have you been doing to yourself these two years Plenty of time for explanations later said Darrell shaking hands heartily Ned I want you to know my father father this is my old chum now doctor Elliott The young physician s face betrayed astonishment but he shook hands with mister Britton with no remarks beyond the customary greeting Now Ned continued Darrell get us out of this mob as quickly as you can I don t want to be recognized here Not much danger with that white pate of yours but come this way my carriage is waiting I did not let out that you were coming back for I thought you wouldn t want any demonstration from the crowd here so I told no one but father he s waiting for you in the carriage You re as level headed as ever Darrell remarked They reached the carriage greetings were exchanged with mister Elliott and soon the party was driving rapidly towards the village We will go at once to my office doctor Elliott remarked to Darrell who was seated beside himself we can make arrangements there as to the best method of breaking this news to your mother You have told her nothing then Darrell inquired No life has so many uncertainties and she has already suffered so much You had a long journey before you if anything had happened to detain you it was better not to have her in suspense You were right Darrell replied you know I left all that to your own judgment Darrell old boy said the doctor inspecting his companion critically do satisfy my curiosity is that white hair genuine or a wig donned for the occasion What reason could I have for any such masquerading Darrell demanded when you come to know my experience for the past two years you will not wonder that my hair is white I beg your pardon old fellow I meant no offence We had all given you up for dead all but your mother and your telegram nearly knocked me off my feet Here the doctor drew rein and fastening the horses outside they entered his office a small one story building standing close to the street in one corner of the great dooryard of his father s home and sheltered alike from sun and storm by giant maples After brief consultation it was decided that as doctor Elliott and his father were frequent callers at the Jewett home the entire party would drive out there and in the probable event of not seeing missus Britton who was an invalid and retired at an early hour Darrell and his father would spend the night at the old homestead but their presence would not be known by the wife and mother until the following morning You see sir doctor Elliott remarked to mister Britton your coming has complicated matters a little I would not apprehend any danger from the meeting between missus Britton and her son for she has looked for his return every day but I cannot say what might be the result of the shock her nervous system would sustain in meeting you We are safe however in going out there this evening for she always retires to her room before this time Both mister Britton and Darrell grew silent as the old Jewett homestead came in view It was a wide spreading house of colonial build snowy white with green shutters and overrun with climbing roses and honeysuckle vines It stood back at a little distance from the street and a broad walk under interlacing boughs of oak elm and maple led from the street to the lofty pillared veranda across its front The full moon was rising opposite its mellow light throwing every twig and flower into bold relief Two figures could be seen seated within the veranda and as the carriage stopped doctor Elliott remarked I was right mister Jewett and his elder daughter are sitting outside but missus Britton has retired As the four men alighted and proceeded up the walk towards the house strangely varied emotions surged through the breasts of Darrell and his father To one this was his childhood s home the only home of which he had any distinct memory to the other it was the home to which long ago he had been welcomed as a friend but from which he had been banished as a lover But all reminiscent thoughts were suddenly put to flight They had advanced only about half way up the walk when one of the long old fashioned windows upon the veranda was hastily thrown open and a slender figure robed in a white dressing gown came with swift but tremulous steps down the walk to meet them crying in glad accents Oh my son my son you have come as I knew you would some day Darrell sprang forward and caught his mother in his arms and then unable to speak held her close to his breast his tears falling on her upturned face while she caressed him and crooned fond words of endearment as in the days when she had held him in her arms doctor Elliott and his father stood near nonplussed uncertain what to do or what course to take The old gentleman on the veranda left his seat and took a few steps towards the group as though to assist his daughter to the house but doctor Elliott motioned him to remain where he was mister Britton scarcely able to restrain his feelings yet fearful of agitating his wife had withdrawn slightly to one side but unconsciously was standing so that the moonlight fell full across his face At that instant missus Britton raised her head and seeing the familiar faces of doctor Elliott and his father looked at the solitary figure as though to see who it might be Their eyes met his shining with the old time love with which he had looked on her as she stood a bride on that summer evening crowned with the sunset rays only a thousand fold more tender She gave a startled glance then raised her arms to him with one shrill sweet cry the cry of the lone night bird for its mate John Patience came the responsive note deep resonant tender He held her folded within his arms until he suddenly felt the fragile form grow limp in his clasp then lifting her he bore her tenderly up the walk past the bewildered father and sister into the house doctor Elliott leading the way and laid her on a couch in her own room She was soon restored to consciousness and though able to say little lay feasting her eyes alternately upon the face of husband and son her glance however returning oftener and dwelling longer on the face of the lover who after more than twenty seven years of absence was a lover still Chapter XXXI AN EASTERN HOME Within a few days Darrell and his father were domiciled in the Jewett homestead the physicians pronouncing it unwise to attempt to remove missus Britton to another home To Experience Jewett who reigned supreme in her father s house it seemed as though two vandals had invaded her domain so ruthlessly did they open up the rooms for years jealously guarded from sunshine and dust while her cherished household gods were removed by sacrilegious hands from their time honored niches and consigned to the ignominy of obscure back chambers or the oblivion of the garret Under mister Britton s supervision soon after his arrival the great double parlors which had not been used since the funeral of missus Jewett some seven years before were thrown wide open Sally the help standing with open mouth and arms akimbo aghast at such proceedings while Miss Jewett executed a lively quick step in pursuit of a moth which startled by the unusual light was circling above her head Not only were the gayly flowered Brussels carpet and the black haircloth furniture the same as when he had been a guest in those rooms nearly thirty years before but each piece of furniture occupied the same position as then He smiled as he noted the arm chair by one of the front windows to which he had been invariably assigned and in which he had slipped and slid throughout each evening to the detriment of the crocheted tidy pinned upon its back The vases and candlesticks upon the mantel were arranged with the same mathematical precision He could detect only one change which was that to the collection of family photographs framed and hanging above the mantel there had been added a portrait of the late missus Jewett Within a week the old furnishings had been relegated to other parts of the house and modern upholstery had taken their places the soft subdued tints of which blended harmoniously forming a general impression of warmth and light Most of these innovations Miss Jewett viewed with disfavor particularly the staining of the floors preparatory to laying down two Turkish rugs of exquisite coloring and design I don t see any use in being so skimping with the carpets she remarked to Sally if I d been in his place I d have got enough to cover the whole floor while I was about it even if I d bought something a little cheaper A carpet with bare floor showing all round it puts me in mind of Dick s hat band that went part way round and stopped That s jest what it does Sally assented I wanted to lay down some strips of carpeting along the edges but he wouldn t hear to it Miss Jewett continued regretfully I s pose Sally remarked sagely it s all on account of livin out west along with them wild Injuns and cow boys so many years Western folks most always has queer ideas about things I never would have believed it to see such overturnings in my house exclaimed Miss Jewett with a sigh and if twas anybody but John Britton I wouldn t stand it I wonder if he won t be telling me how to make butter and raise chickens and turkeys next Mebbe he ll bring round one o them new fangled contrivances for hatchin chickens without hens Sally ventured with a laugh adding reflectively I wonder why when they was about it they didn t invent a machine to lay aigs as well as hatch em that would ave been a savin for a hen s keep don t amount to much when she s settin but they re powerful big eaters generally Miss Jewett prided herself upon her thrift and economy her well kept house where nothing was allowed to go to waste her spotless dairy rooms and rolls of golden butter which never failed to bring a cent and a half more a pound than any other her fine breeds of poultry which annually carried off the blue ribbons at the county fair She had achieved a local reputation of which she was quite proud she would brook no interference in her management of household affairs and as she said no one but John Britton would ever have been allowed to infringe upon her established rules and regulations There had been a time when she had shared equally with her sister John Britton s attentions It had been the only bit of romance in her life but a lingering sweetness from it still remained in her heart through all the commonplace years that had followed like the faint perfume from rose leaves faded and shrivelled but cherished as sacred mementos She had not blamed him for choosing her younger and more attractive sister and she had secretly admired her sister for braving their father s displeasure to marry him And now she was glad that he had returned glad for his own sake that the imputations cast upon him by her father and others were refuted for her sister s sake that her last days should be so brightened and glorified but deep within her heart glad for her own sake because it was good to look upon his face and hear his voice again Sally s strident tones broke in upon her retrospection There s one thing Miss Jewett I guess you needn t be afeard they ll meddle with and that s your cookin mister Darrell he was tellin me about the prices people had to pay for meals on them eatin cars diners he called em and I told him there wasn t no vittles on earth worth any such price as that and I up and asked him whether they was as good as the vittles he gets here and he laughed and said there wasn t nobody could beat his Aunt Espey at cookin Miss Jewett s eyes brightened Bless the boy s heart she exclaimed I m glad they re going to be here for Thanksgiving I ll see that they get such a dinner as they neither of them ever dreamed of Darrell had won a warm place in her heart in his baby days with his earliest efforts to speak her name Espey had been the result of his first attack on the formidable name of Experience and Aunt Espey she had been to him ever since Her father Hosea Jewett was a hale hearty man of upward of seventy hard and unyielding as the granite ledges cropping out along the hill sides of his farm and with a face gnarled and weather beaten as the oaks before his door He was scrupulously honest but exacting relentless unforgiving He was not easily reconciled to the new order of things but for his daughter s sake he held his peace Then too though he never forgave John Britton for having married his daughter yet John Britton as a man whose wealth exceeded even his own was an altogether different person from the ambitious but impecunious lover of thirty years before He had never forgiven Darrell for being John Britton s son but mingled with his long cherished animosity was a secret pride in the splendid physical and intellectual manhood of this sole representative of his own line Between the sisters there had been few points of resemblance Patience Jewett had been of an ardent emotional nature passionately fond of music a great reader and with little taste for the household tasks in which her more practical sister delighted Having a more delicate constitution she had little share in the busy routine of farm life but was allowed to follow her own inclinations She was still absorbed in her music and studies when Love found her and the woman within her awoke at his call After Darrell s birth her health was seriously impaired It seemed as though her faith in her husband her belief that he would one day return and her love for her son were the only ties holding soul and body together and with her natural religious tendencies the spiritual nature developed at the expense of the physical Since Darrell s strange disappearance she had failed rapidly With the return of her husband and son she seemed temporarily to renew her hold on life appearing stronger than for many months For the first few days much of her time was spent at her piano singing with her husband the old songs of their early love but oftenest a favorite of his which she had sung during the years of his absence and which Darrell had sung on that night at The Pines following his discovery of the violin Loyal to Love and Thee Her delight in the rooms newly fitted up for her was unbounded and against the background of their subdued warm tints she made a strikingly beautiful picture with her sweet spirituelle face crowned with waving silver hair Either Darrell or his father or both were constantly with her for they realized that the time was short in which to make amends for the missing years She loved to listen to her husband s tales of the great West or to bits which Darrell read from his journal of that strange chapter of his own life You have not yet asked after your sweetheart Darrell his mother said one evening soon after his arrival as they sat awaiting his father s return from a short stroll You are my sweetheart now little mother he replied kissing the hand that lay within his own Does that mean that you care less for Marion than before you went away she queried No Darrell answered slowly I cannot say that my regard for her has decreased I may have changed in some respects but not in my feelings towards Marion I will ask you a question mother Do you think she still cares for me as before I left home I hardly know how to answer you because as you know Marion is so silent and secretive I never could understand the girl To be candid Darrell dear I never could understand why you should care for her and I never thought she cared for you as she ought You know mother how I came to be attracted to her in the first place we were schoolmates and you know she was an exceptionally brilliant girl and different from most of the others We were interested in the same subjects and naturally there sprang up quite an intimacy between us Then we corresponded while I was at college and her letters were so bright and entertaining that my admiration for her increased I thought her the most brilliant and the best girl every way in all my acquaintance and I think so still But my dear boy his mother exclaimed admiration is not love I don t believe you ever really loved her and she always seemed to me to be all brains and no heart one of those cold silent natures incapable of loving I think you are wrong there mother Marion is silent but I don t believe she is cold or incapable of loving She may or may not be incapable of expressing it but I believe she could love very deeply and sincerely were her love once awakened You know she has taken up the study of medicine Ned Elliott told me she had been studying with doctor Parker for about a year doctor Parker tells me she is making remarkable progress I don t doubt it mother she will probably make a success of it she is just the woman to do so There never was any mention of love between you two was there or any engagement Darrell s mother asked with some hesitation after a brief silence None whatever he replied then added with a smile We considered ourselves in love at the time at least I did but as I look back now it seems a very Platonic affair but I thought I loved her and I think she loved me You say Darrell that your regard for her is unchanged Yes the same as ever But you do not think now that you love her or loved her then No mother I know I do not and did not Then Darrell my boy some one else has taught you what love really is For answer Darrell bowed his head in assent over his mother s hand For a few moments she silently stroked his hair as in his boyish days then she said in low tones Answer me one question Darrell Was she a good pure woman Darrell raised his head his eyes looking straight into the searching dark eyes so like his own My little mother he replied tenderly don t think that your teachings all the past years or the lessons of your own sweet life were lost in those two years their influence lived even when memory had failed He bent and kissed her then added She was scarcely more than a child not so brilliant perhaps as Marion but beautiful good and pure as the driven snow Hearing his father s voice outside Darrell rose and picking up his journal opened it at the story of his love and Kate s Then placing it open upon a table beside his mother he said There mother is the story of my Dream Love as I call her Read it and if you should wish to know anything further regarding it ask my father for he knows all Chapter XXXII MARION HOLMES The following day when Darrell entered his mother s rooms he found her with his journal lying open before her Looking up with a smile she said Darrell my dear I would like to meet your Kathie but that can never be in this world But you will meet her again and when you do give her a mother s love and blessing from me Then laying her hand on his arm she added I understand now your question regarding Marion As I told you it is difficult to judge anything about her real feelings For the first year after you went away she came often to see me and frequently inquired for tidings of you but this last year she has seemed different She has come here less frequently and seldom referred to you and appeared so engrossed in her studies I concluded she had little thought or care for you I may have misjudged her but even were that so and she did care for you still you would not marry her now loving another as you do would you Darrell smiled as he met his mother s eager questioning gaze If I had won the love of a girl like Marion Holmes he said I would do nothing that would seem like trifling with that love but in justice to all parties concerned herself in particular I would never marry her without first giving her enough knowledge of the facts in the case that she would thoroughly understand the situation His mother seemed satisfied Marion has brains whether she has a heart or not she replied with quiet emphasis and a girl of brains would never marry a man under such circumstances Handing him his journal she pointed with a smile to its inscription Until the day break she quoted that has been my daily watchword all these years strange that you too should have chosen it as your own Had Darrell gone to his aunt for a gauge of Marion Holmes s feelings towards himself she could have informed him more correctly than his mother She with an old love hidden so deeply in her heart that no one even suspected its existence understood the silent reticent girl far better than her emotional demonstrative sister A few days after moving into the rooms newly fitted up for her missus Britton gave what she termed a little house warming to which were invited a few old time friends of her own and mister Britton s together with some of Darrell s associates Among the latter Marion was of course included but happening at the time to be out of town she did not receive the invitation until two days afterwards Meantime Darrell who was anxious to meet the syndicate from whom he had received his western commission two years before left on the following day for New York City Consequently when Marion upon her return called on missus Britton to explain her absence Darrell was away Marion Holmes was as missus Britton had said a silent girl not from any habitual self repression but from an inherent inability to express her deeper feelings Hers was one of those dumb speechless souls that finding no means of communicating with others unable to get in touch with those about them go on their silent lonely ways no one dreaming of the depth of feeling or wealth of affection they really possess The eldest child of a widowed mother in moderate circumstances her life had been one of constant restriction and self denial Her association with Darrell marked a new epoch in the dreary years For the first time within her memory there was something each morning to which she could look forward with pleasant anticipation something to look back upon with pleasure when the day was done As their intimacy grew her happiness increased and when he returned from college with high honors her joy was unbounded Brought up in a home where there was little demonstration of affection she did not look for it here she loved and supposed herself loved in return else how could there be such an affinity between them The depth of her love for Darrell Britton she herself did not know until his strange disappearance then she learned the place he had filled in her heart and life by the void that remained As months passed without tidings of him she lost hope Unable to endure the blank monotony of her home life she took up the study of medicine partly to divert her mind and also as a means of future self support more remunerative than teaching With the news of Darrell s return hope sprang into new life and it was with a wild sweet joy which would not be stilled pulsating through her heart that she went to call on missus Britton She had a nature supersensitive and as she entered missus Britton s rooms her heart sank and her whole soul recoiled as from a blow With her limited means and her multiplicity of home duties her outings had been confined to the small towns within a short distance of her native village These rooms in such marked contrast to everything to which she had been accustomed were to her a revelation of something beyond her of which she had had no conception a revelation also that her comrade of by gone days had grown away from her beyond her beyond even her reach or ken Quietly with a strange benumbing pain she noted every detail as she answered missus Britton s inquiries but conscious of the lack of affinity between herself and Darrell s mother it seemed to her that the dark eyes regarding her so searchingly must read with what hopes she had come and how those hopes had died She was glad Darrell was not at home she could not have met him then and there But so quiet were her words and manner so like her usual demeanor that missus Britton said to herself as Marion took leave I was right she cares for Darrell only as a mere acquaintance On her return she entered the parlor of her own home and stood for some moments gazing silently about her How shabby how pitiably bare and meagre and colorless An emblem of her own life Throwing herself upon the threadbare little sofa where she and Darrell had spent so many happy hours reviewing their studies and talking of hopes and plans for the future she burst into such bitter passionate weeping as only natures like hers can know Darrell s trip proved successful beyond his anticipations He found the leading members of the syndicate to whom he explained his two years absence and into whose possession he gave the money intrusted to his keeping So delighted were they to see him after having given him up for dead and so pleased were they with his honesty and integrity that they tendered him his old position with them offering to continue his salary from the date of his western commission This offer he promptly declined declaring that he would undertake no commissions or enter into no business agreements during his mother s present state of health He had taken with him the completed manuscript of his geological work and this through the influence of one or two members of the syndicate he succeeded in placing with a publishing house making a specialty of scientific works These facts communicated to his parents soon reached Miss Jewett filling her with a pride and delight that knew no bounds Ellisburg had no daily paper but it possessed a few individuals of the gentler sex who as advertising mediums answered almost as well and whom Miss Jewett included among her acquaintance She suddenly remembered a number of calls which her household duties had hitherto prevented her returning and decided that this was the most opportune time for paying them Ordering her carriage and donning her best black silk gown she proceeded with due ceremony to make her round of calls judiciously dropping a few words here and there which like the seed sown on good ground brought forth fruit thirty sixty and a hundred fold As a result Darrell upon his return found himself a literary star of the first magnitude the cynosure of all eyes These reports reaching Marion only widened the gulf which she felt now intervened between herself and Darrell Almost immediately upon his return Darrell called upon her She was at home but sent a younger sister to admit him while she nerved herself for the dreaded interview As he awaited her coming he looked around him with a sort of wonder Each object seemed familiar and yet was it possible this was the room that used to seem so bright and pleasant as he and Marion conned their lessons together Had it changed he wondered or had he Marion s entrance put a stop to his musings He sprang to meet her she advanced slowly She had changed very little Her face unless animated was always serious determined it was a shade more determined almost stern but it had the same strong intellectual look which had always distinguished it and for which he had admired it Darrell on the contrary was greatly changed Marion gazing at the snow white hair the dark eyes with their piercing inscrutable look the firmly set mouth and noting the bearing of conscious strength and power was unable to recognize her quondam schoolmate until he spoke the voice and smile were the same as of old They clasped hands for an instant then Darrell as in the old days dropped easily into one corner of the little sofa supposing she would take her accustomed place in the other corner but instead she drew a small rocker opposite and facing him in which she seated herself His manner was cordial and free as after a few inquiries regarding herself he spoke of his absence touching lightly upon his illness and its strange consequences and expressed his joy at finding himself at home once more She was kind and sympathetic but her manner was constrained She could not banish the remembrance of her call upon his mother of the contrast between his home and hers and as he talked something indefinable in his language in his very movements and gestures revealed to her sensitive nature a contrast a difference between them he had somehow reached ground to which she could not attain He drew her out to speak of her new studies and congratulated her upon her progress but the call was not a success socially or otherwise When Darrell left the house he believed more firmly than ever that Marion had loved him in the past Whether she had ceased to love him he could not then determine time would tell During the weeks that followed there were numerous gatherings of a social and informal nature where Darrell and Marion were thrown in each other s society but though he still showed a preference for her over the girls of his acquaintance she shrank from his attentions avoiding him whenever she could do so without causing remark Thanksgiving Day came and Miss Jewett s guests were compelled to admit that she had surpassed herself The dinner was one long to be remembered Her prize turkey occupied the place of honor flanked on one side by a roast duck superbly browned and on the other by an immense chicken pie while savory vegetables crisp pickles and tempting relishes such as she only could concoct crowded the table in every direction A huge plum pudding headed the second course with an almost endless retinue of pies mince pumpkin and apple while golden custards and jellies red purple and amber of currant grape and peach brought up the rear A third course of fruits and nuts followed but by that time scarcely any one was able to do more than make a pretence of eating To this dinner were invited the minister and his wife one or two far removed cousins who usually put in an appearance at this season of the year Marion Holmes and a decrepit old lady a former friend of missus Jewett s who confided to the minister s wife that she had eaten a very light breakfast and no lunch whatever in order that she might be able to do justice to Experience s dinner Marion Holmes was not there and Darrell meeting her on the street the next day playfully took her to task Why were you not at dinner yesterday he inquired have you no more regard for my feelings than to leave me to be sandwiched between the parson s wife and old missus Pettigrew I might have gone had I known such a fate as that awaited you she replied laughing but she added with some spirit thinking it best to come to the point at once I can see no reason for thrusting myself into your family gatherings simply because you and I were good comrades in the past Were we not something more than merely good comrades Marion he asked anxious to ascertain her real feelings towards himself it seemed to me we were or at least that we thought we were That may be she answered her color rising slightly but if we thought so then that is no reason for deceiving ourselves any longer She intended to mislead him and she did Very well he replied we will not deceive ourselves we will have a good understanding with ourselves and with each other Is there any reason why we should not be at least good comrades now I know of none she answered meeting his eyes without wavering Then let us act as such and not like two silly children afraid of each other Is that a compact he asked smiling and extending his hand It is she replied smiling brightly in return as their hands clasped thus by word and act renouncing her dearest hopes without his dreaming of the sacrifice Chapter XXXIII INTO THE FULNESS OF LIFE With the opening of cold weather the seeming betterment in missus Britton s health proved but temporary As the winter advanced she failed rapidly until unable to sit up she lay on a low couch wheeled from room to room to afford all the rest and change possible Day by day her pallor grew more and more like the waxen petals of the lily while the fatal rose flush in her cheek deepened and her eyes unnaturally large and lustrous had in them the look of those who dwell in the borderland She realized her condition as fully as those about her but there was neither fear nor regret in the eyes which fixed on the glory invisible to them caught and reflected the light of the other world till in the last days those watching her saw her face as it had been the face of an angel No demonstration of sorrow marred the peace in which her soul dwelt the last days of its stay for the very room seemed hallowed a place too sacred for the intrusion of any personal grief Turning one day to her husband who seldom left her side she said My sorrow made me selfish I see it now Look at the good you have done the many you have helped what have I done what have I to show for all these years Just then Darrell passed the window before which she was lying There is your work Patience mister Britton replied tenderly you have that to show for those years of loneliness and suffering Surely love you have done noble work there work whose results will last for years probably for generations yet to come Her face lighted with a rapturous smile I had not thought of that she whispered I will not go empty handed after all Perhaps He will say of me as of one of old She hath done what she could From that time she sank rapidly sleeping lightly waking occasionally with a child like smile then lapsing again into unconsciousness One evening as the day was fading she awoke from a long sleep and looked intently into the faces gathered about her Her pastor who had known her through all the years of her sorrow was beside her Bending over her and looking into the eyes now dimmed by the approaching shadows he said You have not much longer to wait my dear sister With a significant gesture she pointed to the fading light Until the day break she murmured with difficulty He was quick to catch her meaning and bowed his head in token that he understood then raising his hand above her head as though in benediction in broken tones he slowly pronounced the words Thy sun shall no more go down neither shall thy moon withdraw itself for the Lord shall be thine everlasting light and the days of thy mourning shall be ended Her face brightened a seraphic smile burst forth irradiating every feature with a light which never faded for with a look of loving farewell into the faces of husband and son she sank into a sleep from which she did not wake and when as the day was breaking over the eastern hill tops her soul took flight the smile still lingered deepening into such perfect peace as is seldom seen on mortal faces As Darrell a few moments later stood at the window watching the stars paling one by one in the light of the coming dawn a bit of verse with which he had been familiar years before but which he had not recalled until then recurred to him with peculiar force A soul passed out on its way toward Heaven As soon as the word of release was given And the trail of the meteor swept around The lovely form of the homeward bound Glimmering shimmering there on high The stars grew dim as one passed them by And the earth was never again so bright For a soul had slipped from its place that night After missus Britton s death deprived of her companionship and of the numberless little ministrations to her comfort in which they had delighted both mister Britton and Darrell found life strangely empty They also missed the strenuous western life to which they had been accustomed with its ceaseless demands upon both muscle and brain The life around them seemed narrow and restricted the very monotony of the landscape wearied them they longed for the freedom and activity of the West the breadth and height of the mountains As both were standing one day beside the resting place of the wife and mother which mister Britton had himself chosen for her the latter said John there are no longer any ties to hold us here You may have to remain here until affairs are settled but I have no place and want none in Hosea Jewett s home I am going back to the West and I know that sooner or later you will return also for your heart is among the mountains But before we separate I want one promise from you my son Name it said Darrell you know father I would fulfil any and every wish of yours within my power It was my wish in the past when my time should come to die to be buried on the mountain side near the Hermitage But life henceforth for me will be altogether different from what it has been heretofore and I want your promise John if you outlive me that when the end comes no matter where I may be you will bring me back to her that when our souls are reunited our bodies may rest together here within sound of the river s voice and shielded by the overhanging boughs from winter s storm and summer s heat Father and son clasped hands above the newly made grave I promise you father Darrell replied but you did not need to ask the pledge When John Britton left Ellisburg a few days later a crowd of friends were gathered at the little depot to extend their sympathy and bid him farewell A few were old associates of his own some were his wife s friends and some Darrell s To those who had known him in the past he was greatly changed and none of them quite understood his quaint philosophizings his broad views or his seeming isolation from their work a day business world in which he had formerly taken so active a part They knew naught of his years of solitary life or of how lives spent in years of contemplation and reflection of retrospection and introspection become gradually lifted out of the ordinary channels of thought and out of touch with the more practical life of the world But they had had abundant evidence of his love and devotion to his wife and of his kindness and liberality towards many of their own number and for these they loved him There was not one however who mourned his departure so deeply as Experience Jewett though she gave little expression to her sorrow She had hoped that after her sister s death his home would still be with them This not from any weak sentimentality or any thought that he would ever be aught than as a brother to her but because his very presence in the home was refreshing helpful comforting and because it was a joy to be near him to hear him talk and to minister to his comfort But he was going from them as she well knew never to return and beneath the brave smiling face she carried a sore and aching heart Thus John Britton bade the East farewell and turned his face towards the great West mindful only of the grave under the elms to which the river murmured night and day and with no thought of return until he too should come to share that peaceful resting place Chapter XXXIV A WARNING Spring had come again and Walcott s probationary year with mister Underwood had nearly expired For a while he had maintained his old suavity of manner and business had been conducted satisfactorily but as months passed and Kate Underwood was unapproachable as ever and the prospect of reconciliation between them seemed more remote he grew sullen and morose and mister Underwood began to detect signs of mismanagement Determined to wait until he had abundance of evidence with which to confront him however he said nothing but continued to watch him with unceasing vigilance mister Underwood though able to attend to business had never fully recovered from the illness of the preceding year His physician advised him to retire from business as any excitement or shock would be likely to cause a second attack far more serious than the first but to this mister Underwood would not listen clinging tenaciously to the old routine to which he had been accustomed Kate realizing her father s condition guarded him with watchful solicitude from every possible worry and anxiety spending much of her time with him and even familiarizing herself with many details of his business in order to assist him In the months since Darrell s return east Kate had matured in many ways Her tall slender form was beginning to round out in symmetrical proportions and her voice always sweet had developed wonderfully in volume and range She had taken up the study of music anew both vocal and instrumental devoting her leisure hours to arduous practice her father having promised her a thorough course of study in Europe for which she was preparing herself with great enthusiasm Though no words were exchanged between mister Underwood and Walcott the latter became conscious of the other s growing disfavor and the conviction gradually forced itself upon him that all hope of gaining his partner s daughter in marriage was futile For Kate Underwood he cared little except as a means of securing a hold upon her father s wealth As he found himself compelled to abandon this scheme and saw the prize he had thus hoped to gain slipping farther and farther from his grasp his rage made him desperate and he determined to gain all or lose all in one mad venture To make ready for this would require weeks perhaps months but he set about his preparations with method and deliberation Either the boldness of his plan or his absorption in the expected outcome made him negligent of details however and slowly but surely mister Underwood gathered the proofs of his guilt with which he intended to confront him when the opportune moment arrived But even yet he did not dream the extent of his partner s frauds or the villany of which he was capable he therefore took no one into his confidence and sought no assistance Kate was quick to observe the change in Walcott s manner and to note the malignity lurking in the half closed eyes whenever they encountered her own or her father s gaze and while saying nothing to excite or worry the latter redoubled her vigilance seldom leaving him alone Affairs had reached this state when with the early spring days mister Britton returned from the East and stopped for a brief visit at The Pines In a few days he divined enough of the situation to lead him to suspect that danger of some kind threatened his old friend A hint from Kate confirmed his suspicion and he resolved to prolong his stay and await developments One afternoon soon after his arrival Kate returning from a walk while passing up the driveway met a woman coming from The Pines The latter was tall dressed in black and closely veiled a stranger yet something in her appearance seemed familiar Suddenly Kate recalled the Senora who sent the summons to Walcott on that day set for their marriage more than a year before Though she had caught only a brief glimpse of the black robed and veiled figure within the carriage she remembered a peculiarly graceful poise of the head as she had leaned forward for a final word with Walcott and by that she identified the woman now approaching her Each regarded the other closely as they met To Kate it seemed as though the woman hesitated for the fraction of a second as though about to speak but she passed on silently On reaching a turn in the driveway Kate looking back saw the woman standing near the large gates watching her but the latter finding herself observed passed through the gates to the street and walked away Perplexed and somewhat annoyed Kate proceeded on her way to the house She believed the woman to be in some way associated with Walcott and that her presence there presaged evil of some sort As she entered the sitting room her aunt looked up with a smile from her seat before the fire You have just had rather a remarkable caller Katherine That woman in black whom I just met Kate asked betraying no surprise for she felt none she was prepared at that moment for almost any announcement Who was she Aunt Marcia and what did she want with me She refused to give her name but said to tell you a friend called She seemed disappointed at not seeing you and as she was leaving she said Say to her she has a friend where she least thinks it and if she or any one she loves is in danger I will come and warn her She was very quiet appearing notwithstanding her tragic language You say you met her what do you think of her Kate had been thinking rapidly I have seen her once before auntie I am positive she is in some way connected with mister Walcott and equally positive that he has some evil designs against papa but why she should warn me against him if that is her intention I cannot imagine Is there no way of warning your father Katherine missus Dean inquired anxiously mister Britton and I have talked it over auntie We think papa suspects him and is watching him but so long as he doesn t take either of us into his confidence we don t want to excite or worry him by suggesting any danger This woman may or may not be friendly as she claims but in any event if she comes again I must see her Whatever danger there may be I want to know it then I m not afraid but that I can defend papa or myself in case of trouble For several days Kate scanned her horizon closely for portents of the coming storm She saw nothing of the mysterious woman who had styled herself a friend but on more than one occasion she had a fleeting glimpse of the man who on that memorable day brought the message from her to Walcott and Kate felt that a denouement of some kind was near Walcott s preparations were nearly perfected another week would complete them By that time the funds of the firm as well as large deposits held in trust would be where he could lay his fingers on them at a moment s notice At a given signal two trusted agents would be at the side entrance with fleet horses on which they would travel to a neighboring village and there where their appearance would excite no suspicion they were to board the late express which would carry them to a point whence they could easily reach a place of safety But his well laid plans were suddenly checked by a request one afternoon from his senior partner to meet him in his private office that evening at eight o clock The tone in which this request was preferred aroused Walcott s suspicions that an investigation might be pending and enraged at being thus checkmated he determined to strike at once At dinner mister Underwood mentioned an engagement which would he said detain him for an hour or so that evening but having never since his illness gone to the offices in the evening no one supposed it more than an ordinary business appointment with some friend He had left the house only a few moments when a caller was announced for Miss Underwood Kate s heart gave a sudden bound as on entering the reception hall she saw again the woman whose coming was to be a warning of danger She was as usual dressed in black and heavily veiled Kate was conscious of no fear rather a joy that the suspense was over that there was at last something definite and tangible to face Senorita may I see you in private The voice was sweet but somewhat muffled by the veil while the words had just enough of the Spanish accent to render them liquid and musical Kate bowed in assent and silently led the way to a small reception room of her own She motioned her caller to a seat but the latter remained standing and turned swiftly facing Kate still veiled Senorita you do not know me The words had the rising inflection of a question No Kate replied slowly I do not know you but I know that this is not your first call at The Pines I called some ten days since to see you You called Kate spoke deliberately more than a year since to see mister Walcott The woman started and drew back slightly How could you know she exclaimed surely he did not tell you I saw you There was a moment s silence when next she spoke her voice was lower and more musical Senorita I come as your friend do you believe me I want to believe you Kate answered frankly but I can tell better whether I do or not when I know more of you and of your errands here For answer the woman with a sudden swift movement threw back her veil revealing a face of unusual beauty oval in contour of a rich olive tint with waving masses of jet black hair framing a low broad forehead But her eyes were what drew Kate s attention large lustrous but dark and unfathomable as night yet with a look in them of dumb agonizing appeal The two women formed a striking contrast as they stood face to face they seemed to impersonate Hope and Despair Senorita she said in a low passionless voice I am Senor Walcott s wife Kate s very soul seemed to recoil at the words but she did not start or shrink I have the certificate of our marriage here she continued producing a paper signed by the holy father who united us Kate waved it back I do not wish to see it nor do I doubt your word she replied gently I understand now why you first came to this house What brings you here to night I come to warn you that your father is in danger My father Kate exclaimed quickly her whole manner changed Where How Senor Walcott has an engagement with him at eight o clock at their offices and he means to do him harm I know not just what but he is angry with him I know not why and he is a dangerous man when he is angry Kate touched a bell to summon a servant I will go to him at once but she added looking keenly into the woman s face how do you know of this How did you learn it Did he tell you The other shook her head with a significant gesture He tells me nothing he tells no one but Tony and Tony tells me nothing but I saw them talking together to night and he was very angry I overheard some words I heard him say he would see your father to night and make him sorry he had not done as he agreed and he showed Tony a little stiletto which he carries with him and then he laughed Kate shuddered slightly Who is Tony she asked The woman smiled with another gesture Tony is Tony that is all I know He and my husband know each other A servant appeared Kate ordered her own carriage brought to the door at once Then turning on a sudden impulse to the stranger she said Will you come with me Or are you afraid of him afraid to have him know you warned me The woman laughed bitterly I feared him once she said but I fear him no longer he fears me now Yes I will go with you Then wait here I will be ready in a moment At twenty minutes of eight Kate and the stranger passed down the hall together the woman veiled Kate attired in a trim walking suit The latter stopped to look in at the sitting room door Aunt Marcia mister Britton said he would be out but a few minutes When he comes in please tell him I want to see him at papa s office my carriage will be waiting for him here Her aunt looked her surprise but she knew Kate to be enough like her father that it was useless to ask an explanation where she herself made none Once seated in the carriage and driving rapidly down the street Kate laid her hand on the arm of her strange companion Senora she said you say you are my friend were you my friend the first time you came to the house If not then why are you now No I was not your friend for the first time there was a ring of passion in her voice I hated you for I thought he loved you that you had stolen his heart and made him forget me I travelled many miles I vowed to kill you both before you should marry him Then I found he could not marry you while I was his wife he had told me our marriage was void here because performed in another country I found he had told me wrong and I told him unless he came with me I would go to the church and tell them there I was his wife And he went away with you Kate questioned Yes and he gave me money and then he told me The woman hesitated Go on said Kate He told me that he did not love you that he only wanted to marry you that he might get money from your father and then he would leave you So when I found he wanted to make you suffer as he had me I began to pity you I came back to Ophir to see what you were like He does not know that I am here I found he was angry because you would not marry him Then I was glad I saw you many times that you did not know Your face was kind and good as though you would pity me if you knew all and I loved you I heard something about a lover you had a few years ago who died and I knew your heart must have been sad for him and I vowed he should never harm you or any one you loved They had reached the offices the carriage stopped but not before Kate s hand had sought and found the stranger s in silent token that she understood Chapter XXXV A FIEND AT BAY Kate on leaving her carriage directed the driver to go back to The Pines to await mister Britton s return and bring him immediately to the office She then unlocked the door to the room which had been Darrell s office and which opened directly upon the street and she and her companion entered and seated themselves in the darkness The room next adjoining was Walcott s private office and beyond that was mister Underwood s private office the two latter rooms being separated by a small entrance They had waited but a few moments when mister Underwood s carriage stopped before this entrance and an instant later Kate heard her father s voice directing the coachman to call for him in about an hour As the key turned in the lock she heard Walcott s voice also The two men entered and went at once into mister Underwood s private office mister Underwood immediately proceeded to business in his usual abrupt fashion
4064_12118_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 mister Walcott there is no use dallying or beating about the bush I want this partnership terminated at once 
none	none	There s no use in an honest man and a thief trying to do business together and this interview to night is to find the shortest way of dissolving the partnership I think that can be very easily and quickly done mister Underwood Walcott replied Kate who had stationed herself in the entrance where she had a view of both men saw the cruel leer that accompanied Walcott s words and understood their significance as her father did not Her hand sought the bosom of her dress for an instant then dropped quietly at her side but swift as the movement was her companion had seen in the dim light the gleam of the weapon now partially concealed by the folds of her skirt With noiseless cat like step she approached Kate and touched her arm You will not shoot 
4064_12118_000008_000001	train-clean-360	You will not kill him she breathed rather than whispered 
none	none	Kate s only reply was to lay her finger on her lips never removing her eyes from Walcott s face but even then in her absorption she noted a peculiar quality in those scarcely audible tones something that was neither fear nor love there seemed somehow an element of savagery in them Meanwhile mister Underwood was going rapidly through the evidence which he had accumulated showing mismanagement and fraud in the conduct of the business of the firm and misappropriation of some of the funds held in trust Of the wholesale robbery the plans for which Walcott had so nearly perfected he knew absolutely nothing 
4064_12118_000010_000002	train-clean-360	As Walcott listened the sneer on his face deepened 
none	none	You seem to have gone to a vast amount of labor for nothing he remarked as mister Underwood concluded I could have given you that much information off hand You have not lived up to your part of the contract and I see no reason why I should be expected to fulfil mine You promised me your daughter in marriage and then simply because she saw fit We will leave my daughter s name out of this controversy sir mister Underwood interposed sternly Were it not for the fact that your name has been publicly associated with hers I would prosecute you for the scoundrel and black leg that you are But for the sake of your daughter s name you intend to deal leniently with me Walcott sneered
4064_12118_000013_000001	train-clean-360	 Supposing we come at once to the point of dissolving our partnership it cannot be done any too quickly for me May I inquire on what terms you propose to settle 
none	none	mister Underwood went briefly over the terms which he had outlined on a sheet of paper before him on his desk Walcott seated eight or ten feet distant listened his dark face paling with anger Pardon me he said at the conclusion I think I missed a few details suppose we go over that again together He rose and advanced towards mister Underwood s chair as though to look over his shoulder at the same time thrusting his right hand within the inner pocket of his coat Before he had covered half the space however a voice rang through the room with startling clearness
4064_12118_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Not a step farther or you are a dead man 
none	none	Both men turned to see Kate Underwood standing in the doorway holding a revolver levelled at Walcott with an aim which the latter s practised eye told him to be both sure and deadly Astonishment and rage passed in quick succession over his countenance he looked for an instant as though contemplating some desperate move Stir one hair s breadth and you are a dead man she repeated He remained motionless and the hand just withdrawn from his coat disclosed to view a tiny glittering stiletto Kate s only anxious thought was for her father who too bewildered to move or speak was for the time as motionless as Walcott himself she feared lest the suddenness of the shock might prove too much for him To her relief she heard mister Britton entering He took in the situation at a glance and sprang at once to her side
4064_12118_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 I am all right she cried brightly look after papa first then we will attend to this creature 
4064_12118_000022_000000	train-clean-360	With the revolver still levelled at Walcott Kate slowly advanced towards him 
4064_12118_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Give me that weapon she demanded 
none	none	He gave a sinister smile but before she had taken another step her companion sprang into the room with a piercing cry and intercepted her No no Senorita she exclaimed do not touch it Mother of God it is poisoned a single scratch means death 
4064_12118_000026_000000	train-clean-360	At sight of her Walcott s face grew livid 
none	none	You fiend You she devil he hissed this is your doing is it and he burst into a torrent of curses and imprecations Be silent mister Britton ordered sternly and Kate accompanied the command with an ominous click of her revolver The wretch cowered into silence but his eyes glowed with fairly demoniac fury Now said mister Underwood his faculties fully restored I want to know the meaning of this let us sift this whole thing to the bottom Search your man first David said mister Britton and suiting the action to the word he approached Walcott but was warded off by the woman standing near
4064_12118_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 No no Senor a little turn of the wrist so slight you would not see would cause death 
4064_12118_000030_000001	train-clean-360	I will take it from him the viper dare not sting me 
none	none	As she extended her hand she tauntingly held her wrist close to the tiny point scarcely larger than a good sized pin Life and freedom are precious Senor she said in low mocking tones as she took the weapon from him and handed it to mister Britton who laid it carefully on a table near by and then proceeded to search Walcott s clothing saying I want you to see what you have been dealing with David To the stiletto already placed upon the table were added another of larger size two loaded revolvers several packages of valuable securities taken from the vaults of the firm that afternoon and a nearly complete set of duplicate keys to the safes and deposit boxes of the offices mister Britton then relieved Kate congratulating her warmly and stationed himself near Walcott who glowered like a wild beast that temporarily restrained by the keeper s lash only awaits opportunity for a more furious onslaught later Kate stepped at once to her father s side he turned upon her a look of affectionate pride but before he could speak she had drawn forward her companion saying
4064_12118_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Here is one papa to whom we owe much 
none	none	She has saved your life to night for I would not have known you were in danger if she had not warned me and she saved me from worse than death in preventing the carrying out of the farce of an illegal marriage with that villain by giving me a glimpse of his real character before it was too late The change that passed over mister Underwood s countenance during Kate s words was fearful to see From the kindliness and courtesy with which he had greeted the stranger his face seemed changed to granite so hard and relentless it became An illegal marriage What do you mean he demanded and there was something in his voice that no one present had ever heard there before Illegal papa because this woman is his lawful wife And Kate gave a brief explanation of the situation Is that so he appealed to the woman his tones strangely quiet
4064_12118_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes Senor I have the papers to prove it 
none	none	Do you admit it he demanded of Walcott with a glance which made the latter quail while his hand sought one of the loaded revolvers lying on the table We were married years ago but I did not know the woman was living I swear I did not I supposed she was dead until the day she came to me
4064_12118_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 How about the past year 
none	none	You have known all this time that she was living yet you have dared to press your suit for my daughter you dog Not another word he exclaimed as Walcott strove to form some excuse 
4064_12118_000046_000000	train-clean-360	He raised his hand and the revolver gleamed in the light 
none	none	mister Britton grasped him by the arm David old friend calm yourself he exclaimed
4064_12118_000047_000001	train-clean-360	 Don t be rash or foolish let the law take its course 
none	none	The law interposed mister Underwood fiercely do you think I d take a case of this kind into the courts Charges such as these against a man whose name has been publicly associated with my daughter s as her betrothed husband and the principal witness against that man his own wife Do you suppose for a moment I ll have my daughter s name dragged through such mire 
4064_12118_000048_000003	train-clean-360	No by God 
none	none	I ll blow the dog s brains out with my own hand first A fierce struggle ensued for a moment between the two men which ended in John Britton s disarming his friend Kate meanwhile keeping Walcott at bay as he sought in the momentary confusion to effect an escape Once calmed mister Underwood notwithstanding mister Britton s protestations sullenly refused to prosecute Walcott Telephoning for an attorney who was an old time and trusted friend he had an agreement drawn and signed whereby upon the repayment of the funds belonging to him after deducting an amount therefrom sufficient to replace what he had misappropriated he was to leave the country altogether You have escaped this time were mister Underwood s parting words but remember if you ever again seek to injure me or mine no power on earth can save you and I ll not go into the courts either 
4064_12118_000052_000000	train-clean-360	As Kate and her strange companion parted the former inquired Why did you ask me not to shoot him 
4064_12118_000052_000001	train-clean-360	You surely cannot love him 
none	none	Love him she exclaimed softly No but I feared you would kill him His time has not come yet Senorita but when it does this must be the hand She lifted her own right hand with a significant movement as she said this and glided out into the darkness and was gone ere Kate could recall her When Kate and her father with mister Britton s assistance before returning home for the night removed the articles taken from Walcott s pockets the tiny poisoned stiletto was nowhere to be found Chapter XXXVI SENORA MARTINEZ Although mister Underwood escaped the stroke which it was feared might follow the excitement of his final interview with Walcott it was soon apparent that his nervous system had suffered from the shock His physician became insistent in his demands that he not only retire from business but have an entire change of scene to insure absolute relaxation and rest This advice was earnestly seconded by mister Britton not alone for the sake of his friend s health but more especially because he believed it unsafe for mister Underwood or Kate to remain in that part of the country so long as Walcott had his liberty Their combined counsel and entreaties at length prevailed A responsible man was found to take charge under mister Britton s supervision of mister Underwood s business interests The Pines was closed two or three faithful servants being retained to guard and care for the property and early in April mister Underwood accompanied by his sister and daughter left Ophir ostensibly for the South They remained south however only until he had recuperated sufficiently for a longer journey and then sailed for Europe but of this fact no one in Ophir had knowledge save mister Britton During the last days of Kate s stay in Ophir she watched in vain for another glimpse of her strange friend On the morning of her departure as the train was leaving the depot she suddenly saw the olive skinned messenger of former occasions running alongside the Pullman in which she was seated Catching her eye he motioned for her to raise the window she did so whereupon he tossed a little package into her lap pointing at the same time farther down the platform and lifting his ragged sombrero vanished An instant later the Senora came into view standing at the extreme end of the platform a lace mantilla thrown about her head and shoulders the ends of which she now waved in token of farewell Kate held up the little package with a smile she responded with a deprecatory gesture indicative of its insignificance then with another wave of the lace scarf and a flutter of Kate s handkerchief they passed out of each other s sight Kate hastily undid the package a little box of ebony inlaid with pearl slipped from the wrappings which upon touching a secret spring opened disclosing a small cross of Etruscan gold of the most exquisite workmanship In her first letter to mister Britton Kate related the incident and begged him to look out for the woman and render her any assistance possible To this mister Britton needed no urging Since his first sight of her that night in mister Underwood s office he had been looking for her for a twofold purpose For a number of weeks he failed to get even a glimpse of her nor could he obtain any clew to her whereabouts One night well into the summer he came upon her unexpectedly standing in front of a cheap restaurant looking at the edibles displayed in the window She was not veiled her face was pale and haggard and there was no mistaking the expression in her eyes as she finally turned away My friend said mister Britton laying his hand gently on her shoulder are you hungry She shrank from him with a start till a glance in his face reassured her and she answered with an expressive gesture Yes Senor I have had nothing to eat to day and but little yesterday This is no fit place come with me mister Britton replied leading the way two or three blocks down the street to a first class restaurant He conducted her through the ladies entrance into a private box where he ordered a substantial dinner for two Senor she protested as the waiter left the box I have no money no way to repay you for this you understand I understand he answered quickly I want no return for this Miss Underwood wished me to find you and help you if I could Yes I know you are the Senorita s friend And your friend also if I can help you You saved his life that night Senor I do not forget the woman said with peculiar emphasis Yes I undoubtedly saved the scoundrel from a summary vengeance possibly I might not have done it had I known what the alternative would be Where is that man now he asked with sudden directness I do not know Senor he tells me nothing but I have heard he went south some time ago The entrance of the waiter with their orders put a temporary stop to conversation The woman ate silently regarding mister Britton from time to time with an expression of childlike wonder When her hunger was appeased and she seemed inclined to talk he said Tell me something of yourself When and where did you marry that man We were married in Mexico seven years ago Your home was in Mexico No Senor my father owned a big cattle ranch in Texas Senor Walcott as you call him here worked for him He wanted to marry me but my father opposed the marriage We lived close to the line so we went across one day and were married My father was very angry but I was his only child and by and by he forgave and took us back Do I understand you that Walcott is not this man s real name mister Britton interposed His name is Jose Martinez Senor But is he not a half breed I have understood his father was an Englishman His father was an Englishman but no one ever knew who he was you understand Senor Afterwards his mother married Pablo Martinez and her child took his name That was why my father opposed our marriage I understand said mister Britton but he claims heavy cattle interests in the South how did he come by them My father s all of them she replied He and my father quarrelled soon after we went there to live Then we came away north we lived for a while in this State she paused and hesitated as though fearing she had said too much but mister Britton s face betrayed nothing and she continued Then in a year or so we went south and he and my father quarrelled again My father was found dead on the plains trampled by the cattle but no one knew how it came about Then Jose took everything and told me I had nothing He went north again three years ago A year later he came back and told me I was not his wife that our marriage was void because it was not performed in this country I became very ill He took me away among strangers and left me there to die as he thought But he was mistaken I had something to live for to follow him as I have followed him and will follow him to the end The woman rose from the table mister Britton rose also and stood for a moment facing her He is a dangerous man he said how is it that you do not fear him She laughed softly He fears me Senor why should I fear him I understand mister Britton said he fears you because you know him to be a criminal because his freedom perhaps his very life is in your hands Why are you not in danger on that account What is to hinder his taking a life so inimical to his own A cunning treacherous smile crept over her face and a baleful light gleamed in her eyes as she replied If I die at his hand my secret does not die with me I have fixed that If I die to day the world knows my secret to morrow He knows it Senor and I am safe Did it never occur to you said mister Britton slowly that for the safety of others your secret should be made known now The woman s whole appearance changed she regarded mister Britton with a look of mingled anger and terror as he continued That man s life and freedom are a constant menace to other lives Are you willing to take the responsibility of the results which may follow your withholding that secret keeping it locked within your own breast The woman looked quickly for a chance of escape but mister Britton barred the only means of exit Her expression was that of a creature brought to bay I understand the meaning of your kindness to night she cried fiercely You are one of the fly men and you thought to buy my secret from me Let me tell you you will never buy it nor can you force it from me So long as he does me no harm I will never make it known and if I die a natural death it dies with me You are mistaken he replied calmly I am no detective no official of any sort My bringing you here to night was of itself wholly disinterested done for the sake of a friend who wished me to help you I have wished to meet you and talk with you as I was interested to learn your story out of sympathy for you and a desire to help you and also to shed new light on your husband s character of which I have made quite a study but I am not seeking to force you into making any disclosures against your will Her anger had subsided as quickly as it had been aroused Pardon me Senor she said I was wrong Accept my gratitude for your kindness I will not forget Don t mention it If you need help at any time let me know I do not forget that you saved my friend s life But one word in parting don t think your secret will not become known Those things always work themselves out and justice will overtake that man yet When it does your own life may not be as safe as you now think it is If you need a friend then come to me The woman regarded him silently for a moment Thank you Senor she said gently I understand Justice will yet overtake him as you say and when it does she added significantly I will need no help Chapter XXXVII THE IDENTIFICATION The following September found Darrell again in Ophir and re established in his old time quarters To his old office he had added the room formerly occupied by Walcott his increasing business demanding more office room and the presence of an assistant Before leaving the East he revisited the members of his old syndicate and informed them that he intended henceforth making his head quarters in the West and if they wished to employ him as their expert he would execute commissions from that point To this they readily agreed and also gave him letters of introduction to a number of capitalists interested in western mining properties who were only too glad to secure the services of a reliable expert who would be on the ground and familiar with existing conditions As a result Darrell had scarcely reopened business at his former quarters before he found himself with numerous eastern commissions to be executed in addition to his old work as assayer He was prepared for the changes which had taken place during the year of his absence his father having kept him thoroughly informed of all that had occurred Darrell was delighted at the story of Kate Underwood s coolness and bravery in saving her father s life and sent her a note of hearty congratulation which she kept among her cherished treasures Since that time occasional letters were exchanged between them hers bright entertaining sketches of their travels here and there with comments characteristic of herself regarding places and people his permeated with the fresh exhilarating atmosphere of the mountains and pervaded by a vigor and virility which roused Kate s admiration yet led her to wonder if this could be the same lover who had won her childish heart in those idyllic days Each realized the fact that notwithstanding their love notwithstanding their stanch comradeship at present they were little more than strangers Darrell s love for Kate was a reality but her personality so far as he could recall it was little more than a dream each letter revealed some unexpected phase of her character he found their correspondence an unfailing source of pleasure and was content to await the time of their meeting confident that he would find the real woman all and more than the ideal which he fondly cherished as his Dream Love And to Kate each letter of Darrell s brought more and more forcibly the conviction that the lover whom she remembered was as a dream compared with the reality she was to meet some day About six months had elapsed when Darrell received early one morning the following telegram from his father summoning him to Galena Come over on first train Important By the first train he would reach Galena a little before noon he had not breakfasted and had but twenty minutes in which to make it Calling a carriage he went directly to his office where he left a brief explanatory note for the clerk written on the way then drove with all possible speed to the depot arriving on time but without a minute to spare He breakfasted on the train and while running over the morning paper his attention was caught by a despatch from Galena to the effect that one of the leading banks in that city had been entered and the safe opened and robbed on the preceding night The robbers of whom there were three had been discovered by the police A fight had ensued in which one officer and one of the robbers were killed the second robber wounded while the third had made his escape with most of the plunder It was further stated that they were known to belong to the notorious band of outlaws so long the terror of that region and it was believed the wounded man was none other than the leader himself the murderer of Harry Whitcomb and the young express clerk for whom there was a standing reward of twenty five thousand dollars dead or alive The man was to have a preliminary examination that afternoon and the greatest excitement prevailed in Galena as it was rumored that others of the band would probably be present scattered throughout the crowd for the purpose of rescuing their leader In a flash Darrell understood his father s summons He let the paper fall and unmindful of his breakfast gazed abstractedly out of the window His thoughts had reverted to that scene in the sleeper on his first trip west He seemed to see it again in all its sickening detail the face of the assassin standing out before him with such startling distinctness and realism that he involuntarily placed his hand over his eyes to shut out the hateful sight At Galena he was met by his father who took a closed carriage to his hotel conducting Darrell immediately to his own room where he ordered lunch served for both Do you know why I have sent for you mister Britton inquired as soon as they were left alone together I had no idea when I started Darrell replied but on reading the morning paper on my way over I concluded you wanted me at that trial this afternoon You are correct Are you prepared to identify that face Is your recollection of it as distinct as ever Yes after reading of that bank robbery this morning the whole affair in the car that night came back to me so vividly I could see the man s face as clearly as any face on the train with me Good mister Britton ejaculated Do you think there is any likelihood of an attempt to rescue him as stated by the paper Darrell inquired rather incredulously If the leader of the band finds himself in need of help it will be forthcoming mister Britton answered with peculiar emphasis The citizens are expecting trouble and have sworn in about a dozen extra deputy sheriffs myself among the number When lunch was over mister Britton ordered a carriage at once and they proceeded to the court room What is your opinion of this man Darrell asked his father while on the way Would you have selected him as the murderer from your study of him I reserve my opinions until later mister Britton replied I want you to act from memory alone unbiased by any outside influence Arriving at the court room they found it already well filled Darrell was about to enter but his father took him into a small anteroom while he himself went to look for seats He had a little difficulty in finding the seats he wanted which delayed them so that proceedings had begun as he and Darrell entered from a side door and took their places in rather an obscure part of the room You will have a good view here mister Britton said to Darrell as they seated themselves and there is little likelihood of your being recognized from this point There is little probability of the man s recognizing me even if he is here Darrell replied for he did not give me a second thought that night and if he had I am so changed he would not know me We cannot be too cautious his father answered In a few moments the prisoner was brought in and there was a general craning of necks to see him a number of men in Darrell s vicinity standing and thus obstructing his view Wait said his father as he was about to rise with the others don t make yourself conspicuous when the man is called for examination you will have an excellent view from here Curiosity gradually subsided and the men sank back into their seats as proceedings went on Then the prisoner was called and stood up for examination Darrell drew a quick breath and leaned eagerly forward The man was of medium height and size but his movements seemed heavy and clumsy whereas Darrell had been impressed by a litheness and agility in the movements of the other He stood facing his interlocutor affording Darrell a three quarter view of his face but soon he turned in Darrell s direction scanning the crowd slowly as though in search of some one Darrell saw a squarely built colorless face surmounted by a shock of coarse straight black hair with heavy repulsive features and small bullet shaped leaden eyes of rather light blue The face was so utterly unlike what he had expected to see that he sank back into his seat with a smothered exclamation of disgust His father watching closely smiled seeming rather pleased than otherwise but Darrell was half indignant The idea of a lout like that being taken for the leader he exclaimed He is nothing but a tool and a pretty clumsy one at that Notwithstanding his vexation Darrell continued to watch the proceedings and in a few moments began to grow interested not so much in the examination as in the conduct of the prisoner The latter evidently had found the face for which he was looking for his eyes seemed glued to a certain spot Occasionally he would shift them for a moment but invariably with each new interrogatory they would turn to that particular spot as the needle to the pole not through any volition of his own but drawn by some influence against which he was temporarily powerless That man is under a spell he is being worked by some one in the crowd Darrell exclaimed to his father in a low tone Yes and by some one not very far from us I have spotted him see if you cannot Following the direction of the man s glance Darrell began to scan the faces of the crowd Suddenly his pulses gave a bound Seated at a little distance and partially facing them was a man of the same size and height as the prisoner but whose every move and poise suggested alertness He was leaning his arms on the back of the seat before him his head was lowered so that his chin rested lightly on one hand while the other hand played nervously with the seat on which he leaned His whole attitude was that of a wild beast crouched ready to spring upon his prey He had an oval face with deep olive skin wavy black hair cut close except where it curled low over his forehead and through the half closed eyes fixed upon the prisoner s face Darrell caught a glint like that of burnished steel For an instant Darrell gazed like one fascinated he had not expected such an exact reproduction of the face as he had seen it on that night His father touched him lightly he nodded significantly in reply There is your man he exclaimed You are sure You could swear to it queried his father Swear to it Yes I would have known him anywhere but sitting there watching that man his face is precisely as I saw it that night Wait a moment look The man in his agitation at some word of the prisoner s raised one hand and brushed his forehead with a nervous gesture which lifted his hair slightly disclosing one end of a scar Did you see that scar Darrell questioned eagerly You will find it almost crescent shaped rather jagged and nearly three inches in length That is all I wanted his father replied I have the warrant for his arrest with me and the examination is so nearly over I shall serve it at once Can I help you Darrell asked as his father moved away No stay where you are don t let him see you until after he is under arrest The examination of the prisoner had just ended when mister Britton accompanied by two deputies re entered the court room The man still maintained his crouching attitude intently watching proceedings mister Britton approached from the rear Seizing the man suddenly by the arms he pinioned him so that for an instant he was unable to move and one of the deputies leaning over snapped the handcuffs on him before he fairly realized what had happened Then with a swift movement mister Britton raised him to his feet and lifted him quickly out into the aisle while his voice rang authoritatively through the court room Jose Martinez alias Walcott I arrest you in the name of the State The man shouted something in Spanish evidently a signal for it was repeated in different parts of the room Instantly all was confusion A shot fired from the rear wounded one of the deputies a man seated near Darrell drew a revolver but before he could level it Darrell knocked it from his hand and felled him to the floor The officers rushed to the spot and as the outbreak subsided mister Britton brought forward his prisoner A murmur of consternation rose throughout the room for Walcott had been known years before among the business men of Galena and there were not a few citizens present who had known him as mister Underwood s partner Walcott taking advantage of the situation began to protest his innocence mister Britton unmoved at once beckoned Darrell to his side Upon seeing him Walcott s face took on a ghastly hue and he seemed for a moment on the verge of collapse but he quickly pulled himself together regarding Darrell meanwhile with a venomous malignity seldom seen on a human face Not the least surprised man in the crowd was Darrell himself Do you mean to say he asked his father that this is the Walcott of whose villany you have been writing me and that he and the murderer of Harry Whitcomb are one and the same So it seems mister Britton replied but that is no more than I have suspected all along Now I understand your fear of my being recognized it seemed inexplicable to me said Darrell If he had seen you his father replied he would have suspected your errand here at once Incredulity was apparent on many faces as Walcott s examination was begun He was morose and silent and nothing could be elicited from him When Darrell was called upon however and gave his evidence incredulity gave place to conviction As he completed his testimony with a description of the scar which upon examination was found correct the crowd became angry and threats of lynching and personal violence were heard on various sides The judge therefore ordered that the prisoners be removed from the court room to the jail before any in the audience had left their places In charge of the regular sheriff and four or five deputies the prisoners were led from the court room They had but just reached the street however when those inside heard shots fired in quick succession followed by angry cries and shouts for help The crowd surged to the doors to see the officers surrounded by a band of the outlaws who had been lying in wait for their appearance having been summoned by the signal given on the arrest of the leader With the help of the citizens the fight was soon terminated but when the melee was over it was discovered that the sheriff had been killed a number of citizens and outlaws wounded and Martinez alias Walcott had escaped Chapter XXXVIII WITHIN THE POCKET The remainder of that day and the following night were spent in fruitless efforts to determine the whereabouts of the fugitive Telegrams were sent along the various railway lines into every part of the State messengers were despatched to neighboring towns and camps but all in vain For the first thirty six hours it seemed as though the earth must have opened and swallowed him up there was not even a clue as to the direction in which he had gone The second morning after his disappearance reports began to come in from a dozen different quarters of as many different men all answering the description given of the fugitive who had been identified as the criminal Four or five posses averaging a dozen men each all armed set forth in various directions to follow the clews which seemed most worthy of credence For the next few days reports were constantly received from one posse or another to the effect that they were on the right trail the fugitive had been seen only the preceding night at a miners cabin where he had forced two men at the point of a revolver to surrender their supper of pork and beans or some lonely ranchman and his wife had entertained him at dinner the day before He was always reported as only about ten hours ahead footsore and weary but at the end of ten days they returned disorganized dilapidated and disgusted without even having had a sight of their man Other bands were sent out with instructions to separate into squads of three or four and search the ground thoroughly Some of them were more successful in that they did occasionally get sight of the fugitive but always under circumstances disadvantageous to themselves Three of them stood one day talking with a rancher who only two hours before had furnished the man under protest with a hearty dinner and a fine rifle The rancher pointed out the direction in which he had gone over a rocky road leading down a steep rough ravine as he did so his guest appeared on the other side of the ravine within good rifle range A mutual recognition followed the men started to raise their rifles but the other was too quick for them Covering them with the rifle which he carried he walked backward a distance of about forty yards and then with a mocking salute disappeared Bloodhounds were next employed but the man swam and waded streams and doubled back on his own trail till men and dogs were alike baffled This continued for about two months then all reports regarding the man ceased nothing was heard of him it was surmised that he had reached the Pocket and all efforts at further search were for the time abandoned Of all those concerned in the efforts for his capture there was not one more thoroughly disgusted with the outcome than mister Britton For months he had had this man under surveillance convinced that he was a criminal and planning to bring about his capture Through his own efforts he had been identified and by his coolness and presence of mind he had accomplished his arrest when nine out of ten others would have failed and all seemed now to have been effort thrown away He regretted the man s escape the more especially as he felt that his own life as well as that of his son was endangered so long as he was at liberty About a month after the search was abandoned mister Britton was one day surprised by a call from the wife of Martinez He had not seen her since his one interview with her months before He was sitting in mister Underwood s office looking over the books brought in for his inspection when she entered alone and unannounced She seated herself in the chair indicated by mister Britton and proceeded at once to the object of her visit Senor you told me when I last saw you that my secret would one day come out You were right it has It is my secret no longer and Jose Martinez fears me no longer You have been kind to me You saved his life once you fed me when I was hungry and asked no return I will show you I do not forget Senor there is twenty five thousand dollars reward for that man The officers will never find him but I will take you to him the reward is then yours and justice overtakes Jose Martinez as you said it would Do you accept Do you know where he is mister Britton queried somewhat surprised by the woman s proposition Yes Senor I have just come from there He is in the Pocket is he not Yes Senor but neither you nor your men could find the Pocket without a guide I know it well I have lived there What is your proposition mister Britton inquired after a brief silence how do you propose to do this I will start to morrow for the Pocket You come with me and bring the dogs I will take you to a cabin where you can stay over night while I go on alone to the Pocket to see that all is right I will leave you my veil for a scent The next morning you will set the dogs on my trail and follow them till you come to a certain place I will tell you of From there you will see me I will watch for you and give you the signal that all is right The dogs will bring you to the Pocket in half an hour The rest will be easy work Senor I promise you But isn t the place constantly guarded Not now Senor the men have gone away on another expedition but Jose does not dare go out with them at present Only one man is there beside Jose I know him well he will be asleep when you come I shall need men with me to help in bringing him back said mister Britton Bring them but I think he will give you little trouble Senor As mister Britton cared nothing for the reward himself he chose five men to accompany him to whom he thought the money would be particularly acceptable and the following morning with two blood hounds they started forth in three separate detachments to attract as little attention as possible The first part of their journey was by rail the men taking the same train as the woman herself On their arrival at the little station which she had designated conveyances for which mister Britton had privately wired a personal friend living in that vicinity were waiting to take them to their next stopping place They reached the cabin of which the woman had spoken late in the afternoon Here they picketed their horses and prepared to stay over night while she went on to the Pocket Before leaving she gave mister Britton the lace scarf which she wore about her head I shall not go in there until night she said then I can watch and find if all is right You start early to morrow morning on foot Set the dogs on my trail and follow them to the fork then turn to the left and follow them till you come to a small tree standing in the trail on which I will tie this handkerchief Straight ahead of you you will see the entrance to the Pocket Wait by the tree till you see my signal If everything is right I will wave a white signal If I wave a black signal wait till you see the white one or till I come to you Early the next morning mister Britton and his men set forth with the hounds in leash leaving the horses in charge of their drivers The dogs took the scent at once and started up the trail the men following They found it no easy task they had undertaken the trail was rough and steep and in many places so narrow they were forced to go in single file Some of the men in order to be prepared for emergencies were heavily armed and progress was necessarily slow but at last the fork was passed and then the time seemed comparatively short ere a small tree confronted them a white handkerchief fluttering among its branches They paused and drew back the hounds then looked about them Less than ten feet ahead the trail ended The rocks looked as though they had been cut in two the half on which they were standing falling perpendicularly a distance of some eighty feet while across a rocky ravine some forty feet in width the other half rose an almost perpendicular wall eighty or ninety feet in height In this massive wall of rock there was one opening visible resembling a gateway and while the men speculated as to what it might be the woman appeared waving a white handkerchief and they knew it to be the entrance to the Pocket She evidently expects us to come over there said one of the men but blamed if I can see a trail wide enough for a cat Send the dogs ahead ordered mister Britton The dogs on taking the scent plunged downward through the brush on one side bringing them out into a narrow trail leading down and across the ravine Just above on the other side they could see the woman watching their every move I ve always heard said one of the men there was no getting into this place without you had a special invitation and it looks like it Just imagine one of those fellows up there with a gun Holy Moses he d hold the place against all the men the State or the United States for that matter could send down here The ascent of the other side was difficult but the men put forth their best efforts and ere they were aware found themselves before the gateway in the rocks where the woman still awaited them She silently beckoned them to enter Emerging from a narrow pass some six feet in length they found themselves in a circular basin about two hundred feet in diameter surrounded by perpendicular walls of rock from one hundred to five hundred feet in height The bottom of the basin was level as a floor and covered with a luxuriant growth of grass while in the centre a small lake clear as crystal reflecting the blue sky which seemed to rise like a dome from the rocky walls gleamed like a sapphire in the sunlight Sheer and dark the walls rose on all sides but at one end of the basin where the rocks were more rough and jagged a silver stream fell in glistening cascades to the bottom where it disappeared among the rocks For a moment the men lost in admiration of the scene forgot that they were in the den of a notorious band of outlaws but a second glance recalled them to the situation for on all sides of the basin were caves leading into the walls of rock and evidently used as dwellings To one of these the woman now led the way At the entrance a man lay on the ground his heavy stertorous breathing proclaiming him a victim of some sleeping potion The woman regarded him with a smile of amusement I made him sleep Senor she said addressing mister Britton so he will not trouble you Still leading the way into the farther part of the cave she came to a low couch of skins at the foot of which she paused Pointing to the figure outlined upon it she said calmly He sleeps also Senor but sound so sound you will need have no fear of waking him Her words aroused a strange suspicion in mister Britton s mind The light was so dim he could not see the sleeper but a lantern burning low hung on the wall above his head Seizing the lantern he turned on the light holding it so it would strike the face of the sleeper It was the face of Jose Martinez but the features were drawn and ghastly He bent lower listening for his breath but no sound came he laid his hand upon his heart but it was still Raising himself quickly he threw the rays of the lantern full upon the woman standing before him a small crucifix clasped in her hands Under his searching gaze her face grew pale and ghastly as that upon the couch You have killed him he said slowly with terrible emphasis She made the sign of the cross Holy Mother forgive she muttered then though she still quailed beneath his look she exclaimed half defiantly I have not wronged you you have your reward and justice has overtaken him as you said it would That is not justice said mister Britton pointing to the couch it is murder and you are his murderer You should have let the law take its course The law she laughed mockingly would your law avenge my father s death or the wrongs I have suffered No My father had no son to avenge him I had no brother but I have avenged him and myself I have followed him all these years waiting till the right time should come waiting for this dreaming of it night and day I have had my revenge and it was sweet I did not kill him in his sleep Senor I wakened him just to let him know he was in my power just to hear him plead for mercy Hush said mister Britton firmly for the woman seemed to have gone mad You do not know what you are saying You must get ready to return with me She grew calm at once and her face lighted with a strange smile I am ready to go with you Senor she said at the same time clasping the crucifix suddenly to her breast With the last word she fell to the ground and a slight tremor shook her frame for an instant Quickly mister Britton lifted her and bore her to the light but life was already extinct Within her clasped hands underneath the crucifix they found the little poisoned stiletto Chapter XXXIX AT THE TIME APPOINTED For a year and a half Darrell worked uninterruptedly at Ophir his constantly increasing commissions from eastern States testifying to his marked ability as a mining expert Notwithstanding the incessant demands upon his time he still adhered to his old rule reserving a few hours out of each twenty four which he devoted to scientific or literary study as his mood impelled He soon found himself again drawn irresistibly towards the story begun during his stay at the Hermitage but temporarily laid aside on his return east He carefully reviewed the synopsis which he had written in detail and as he did he felt himself entering into the spirit of the story till it seemed once more part of his own existence He revised the work already done eliminating adding making the outlines clearer more defined then with steady unfaltering hand carried the work forward to completion Eighteen months after his re establishment at Ophir he was commissioned to go to Alaska to examine certain mining properties in a deal involving over a million dollars and anxious to be on the ground as early as possible he took the first boat north that season His story was published on the eve of his departure He received a few copies which he regarded with a half fond half whimsical air One he sent to Kate Underwood having first written his initials on the fly leaf underneath the brief petition Be merciful He then went his way his time and attention wholly occupied by his work with little thought as to whether the newly launched craft was destined to ride the waves of popularity or be engulfed beneath the waters of oblivion Months of constant travel of hard work and rough fare followed His report on the mines was satisfactory the deal was consummated and he received a handsome percentage but not content with this determined to familiarize himself with the general situation in that country and the conditions obtaining he pushed on into the interior pursuing his explorations till the return of the cold season Touching at British Columbia on his way home and finding tempting inducements there in the way of mining properties he stopped to investigate and remained during the winter and spring months It was therefore not until the following June that he found himself really homeward bound and once more within the mountain ranges guarding the approach to the busy little town of Ophir He had been gone considerably over a year he had accumulated a vast amount of information invaluable for future work along his line and he had succeeded financially beyond his anticipations Occasionally during his absence in papers picked up here and there he had seen favorable mention of his story from which he inferred that his first venture in the realms of fiction had not been quite a failure and in this opinion he was confirmed by a letter just received from his publishers which had followed him for months But all thought of these things was for the time forgotten in an almost boyish delight that he was at last on his way home As he came within sight of the familiar ranges his thoughts reverted again and again to Kate Underwood His whole soul seemed to cry out for her with a sudden insatiable longing His mail had of necessity been irregular and infrequent their letters had somehow miscarried and he had not heard directly from her for months Her last letter was from Germany she was then still engrossed in her music but her father s health was greatly improved and he was beginning to talk of home His father s latest letter had stated that the Underwoods would probably return early in July And this was June Darrell felt a twinge of disappointment He was now able to remember many incidents in their acquaintance He recalled their first meeting at The Pines on that June day five years ago How beautiful the old place must look now But without Kate s presence the charm would be lost for him He regretted he had started homeward quite so soon the time would not have seemed so long among the mining camps of the great Northwest as here where everything reminded him of her The stopping of the train at a health resort far up among the mountains a few miles from Ophir roused Darrell from his revery With a sigh he recalled his wandering thoughts and left the car for a walk up and down the platform The town perched saucily on the slopes of a heavily timbered mountain looked very attractive in the gathering twilight Though early in the season the hotel and sanitarium seemed well filled while numerous pleasure seekers were promenading the walks leading to and from the springs which gave the place its popularity Darrell felt a sudden unaccountable desire to remain Without waiting to analyze the impulse as inexplicable as it was irresistible which actuated him he hastened into the sleeper and secured his grip and top coat As the train pulled out he stepped into the station and sent a message to his father at Ophir stating that he had decided to remain over a day or two at the Springs and asking him to look after his baggage on its arrival He then took a carriage for the hotel It was not without some compunctions of conscience that Darrell wired his father of his decision and even as he rode swiftly along the winding streets he wondered what strange fancy possessed him that he should stop among strangers instead of continuing his journey home To his father it would certainly seem unaccountable as it did now to himself mister Britton however on receiving his son s message could not restrain a smile for only the preceding day he had received a telegram from Kate Underwood at the same place in which she stated that they had started home earlier than at first intended and as her father was somewhat fatigued by their long journey they had decided to stop for two or three days rest at the Springs Darrell arrived at the hotel at a late hour for dinner the dining room was therefore nearly deserted when he took his place at the table Dinner over he went out for a stroll and glad to be alone with his thoughts walked up and down the entire length of the little town His mind was constantly on Kate Again and again he seemed to see her as he loved best to recall her standing on the summit of the Divide her wind tossed hair blown about her brow her eyes shining as she predicted their reunion and perfect love Over and over he seemed to hear her words and his heart burned with desire for their fulfilment He had waited patiently he had shown what he could achieve how he could win but all achievements all victories were worthless without her love and presence The moon was just rising as he returned to the hotel but it was still early His decision was taken he would go to Ophir by the morning train learn Kate s whereabouts from his father and go to meet her and accompany her home He had chosen a path leading through a secluded portion of the grounds and as he approached the hotel his attention was arrested by some one singing Glancing in the direction whence the song came he saw one of the private parlors brightly lighted the long low window open upon the veranda Something in the song held him entranced spell bound The voice was incomparably rich possessing wonderful range and power of expression but this alone was not what especially appealed to him Through all and underlying all was a quality so strangely sweetly familiar which thrilled his soul to its very depths whether with joy or pain he could not have told it seemed akin to both Still held as by a spell he drew nearer the window until he heard the closing words of the refrain words which had been ringing with strange persistency in his mind for the last two or three hours Some time some time and that will be God s own good time for you and me His heart leaped wildly With a bound swift and noiseless he was on the veranda just as the singer with tender lingering emphasis repeated the words so low as to be barely audible to Darrell standing before the open window But even while he listened he gazed in astonishment at the singer could that magnificent woman be his girl love She was superbly formed splendidly proportioned the rich warm blood glowed in her cheeks and her hair gleamed in the light like spun gold He stood motionless he would not retreat he dared not advance As the last words of the song died away a slight sound caused the singer to turn facing him and their eyes met That was enough in that one glance the memory of his love returned to him like an overwhelming flood She was no longer his Dream Love but a splendid living reality only more beautiful than his dreams or his imagination had portrayed her He stretched out his arms towards her with the one word Kathie She had already risen a great unspeakable joy illumining her face but at the sound of that name vibrating with the pent up emotion the concentrated love of all the years of their separation she came swiftly forward her bosom palpitating her eyes shining with the love called forth by his cry He stepped through the low window within the room In an instant his arms were clasped about her and holding her close to his breast his dark eyes told her more eloquently than words of his heart s hunger for her while in her eyes and in the blushes running riot in her cheeks he read his welcome He kissed her hair and brow with a sort of reverence then hearing voices in the corridor and rooms adjoining he seized a light wrap from a chair near by and threw it about her shoulders Come outside sweetheart he whispered and drawing her arm within his own led her out onto the veranda and down the path along which he had just come In the first transport of their joy they were silent each almost fearing to break the spell which seemed laid upon them The moon had risen transforming the sombre scene to one of beauty but to them Love s radiance had suddenly made the world inexpressibly fair the very flowers as they passed breathed perfume like incense in their path and the trees whispered benedictions upon them Darrell first broke the silence I would have been in Ophir to night but some mysterious irresistible impulse led me to stop here Did you weave a spell about me you sweet sorceress he asked gazing tenderly into her face I think it must have been some higher influence than mine she replied with sweet gravity for I was also under the spell I supposed you many miles away yet as I sang to night it seemed as though you were close to me as though if I turned I should see you just as I did she concluded with a radiant smile But how did you find me How does the night bird find its mate he queried in low vibrant tones then as her color deepened he continued with passionate earnestness I was here where we are now my very soul crying out for you when I heard your song It thrilled me I felt as though waking from a dream but I knew my love was near Down through the years I heard her soul calling mine following that call I found my love and listening heard the very words which my own heart had been repeating over and over to itself alone and in the darkness Almost unconsciously they had stopped at a turn in the path Darrell paused a moment for tears were trembling on the golden lashes Drawing her closer he whispered Kathie do you remember our parting on the Divide Do you think I ever could forget she asked You predicted we would one day stand reunited on the heights of such love as we had not dreamed of then I asked you when that day would be do you remember your answer I do He continued in impassioned tones Are not the conditions fulfilled sweetheart My love for you then was as a dream a myth compared with that I bring you to day and looking in your eyes I need no words to tell me that your love has broadened and deepened with the years Kathie is not this the time appointed It must be she replied there could be none other like this Holding her head against his breast and raising her face to his he said You gave me your heart that day Kathie to hold in trust I have been faithful to that trust through all these years do you give it me now for my very own Yes she answered slowly with sweet solemnity to have and to hold forever He sealed the promise with a long rapturous kiss but what followed the broken disjointed phrases the mutual pledges the tokens of love given and received are all among the secrets which the mountains never told As they retraced their steps towards the hotel Darrell said We have waited long sweetheart Yes but the waiting has brought us good of itself she answered Think of all you have accomplished I know better than you think for your father has kept me posted and better yet what these years have fitted you for accomplishing in the future To me that was the best part of your work in your story It was strong and cleverly told but what pleased me most was the evidence that it was but the beginning the promise of something better yet to come If only I could persuade all critics to see it through your eyes Darrell replied with a smile Do you wish to know she asked with sudden seriousness what will always remain to me the noblest most heroic act of your life Most assuredly I do he answered her own gravity checking the laughing reply which rose to his lips The fight you made and won alone in the mountains the day that you renounced our love for honor s sake I can see now that the stand you took and maintained so nobly formed the turning point in both our lives I did not look at it then as you did I would have married you then and there and gone with you to the ends of the earth rather than sacrifice your love but you upheld my honor with your own You fought against heavy odds and won and to me no other victory will compare with it since greater they who on life s battle field With unseen foes and fierce temptations fight Darrell silently drew her nearer himself feeling that even in this foretaste of joy he had received ample compensation for the past A few days later there was a quiet wedding at the Springs The beautiful church on the mountain side had been decorated for the occasion and at an early hour while yet the robins were singing their matins the little wedding party gathered about the altar where John Darrell Britton and Kate Underwood plighted their troth for life Above the jubilant bird songs above the low subdued tones of the organ the words of the grand old marriage service rang out with impressiveness Besides the rector and his wife there were present only mister Underwood missus Dean and mister Britton It had been Kate s wish with which Darrell had gladly coincided thus to be quietly married surrounded only by their immediate relatives Let our wedding be a fit consummation of our betrothal she had said to him without publicity unhampered by conventionalities so it will always seem the sweeter and more sacred That evening found them all at The Pines assembled on the veranda watching the sunset the old home seeming wonderfully restful and peaceful to the returned travellers The years which had come and gone since Darrell first came to the Pines told heaviest on mister Underwood His hair was nearly white and he had aged in many ways appearing older than mister Britton who was considerably his senior but age had brought its compensations for the stern immobile face had softened and the deep set eyes glowed with a kindly beneficent light mister Britton s hair was well silvered but his face bore evidence of the great joy which had come into his life and as his eyes rested upon his son he seemed to live anew in that glorious young life To missus Dean the years had brought only a few silver threads in the brown hair and an added serenity to the placid unfurrowed brow Calm and undemonstrative as ever but with a smile of deep content she sat in her accustomed place her knitting needles flashing and clicking with their old time regularity Duke who had been left in mister Britton s care during Darren s absence occupied his old place on the top stair but even his five years of added dignity could not restrain him from occasional demonstrations of joy at finding himself again at The Pines and with his beloved master and mistress As the twilight began to deepen Kate suggested that they go inside and led the way not to the family sitting room but to a spacious room on the eastern side a room which had originally been intended as a library but never furnished as such It was beautifully decorated with palms and flowers while the fireplace had been filled with light boughs of spruce and fir As they entered the room Kate slipping her arm within mister Britton s led him before the fireplace My dear father she said we have chosen this evening as the one most appropriate for your formal installation in our family circle and our home I say formal because you have really been one of ourselves for years you have shared our joys and our sorrows we have had no secrets from you but from this time we want you to take your place in our home as you did long ago in our hearts We have prepared this room for you to be your sanctum sanctorum and have placed in it a few little tokens of our love for you and gratitude to you which we beg you to accept as such She bent towards the fireplace The hearthstone is ever an emblem of home In lighting the fires upon this hearthstone we dedicate it to your use and christen this our father s room The flames burst upward as she finished speaking sending a resinous fragrance into the air and revealing a room fitted with such loving thought and care that nothing which could add to his comfort had been omitted Near the centre of the room stood a desk of solid oak a gift from mister Underwood beside it a reclining chair from missus Dean while on the wall opposite occupying nearly a third of that side of the room was a superb painting of the Hermitage standing out in the firelight with wonderful realism perfect in its bold outlines and sombre coloring the united gift of his son and daughter which Darrell had ordered executed before his departure for Alaska With loving congratulations the rest of the group gathered about mister Britton who was nearly speechless with emotion As mister Underwood wrung his hand he exclaimed with assumed gruffness Jack old partner you thought you d got a monopoly on that boy of yours but I ve got in on the deal at last You haven t got any the best of me Dave mister Britton retorted smiling through his tears for I ve got a share now in the sweetest daughter on earth Yes papa Kate laughingly rejoined there are three of us Brittons now the Underwoods are in the minority Which though a new view of the situation to that gentleman seemed eminently satisfactory Later as Kate found Darrell at a window looking thoughtfully out into the moonlit night she asked Of what are you thinking John Of what the years have done for us Kathie of how much better fitted for each other we are now than when we first loved Yes she whispered as their eyes met God s own good time was the best THE END FAMOUS COPYRIGHT BOOKS IN POPULAR PRICED EDITIONS Re issues of the great literary successes of the time Library size Printed on
