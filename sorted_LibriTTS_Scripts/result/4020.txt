Great Fight for Clean Government CHAPTER ONE A Little Dinner with mister Lucullus Fyshe The Mausoleum Club stands on the quietest corner of the best residential street in the City It is a Grecian building of white stone About it are great elm trees with birds the most expensive kind of birds singing in the branches The street in the softer hours of the morning has an almost reverential quiet Great motors move drowsily along it with solitary chauffeurs returning at ten point thirty after conveying the earlier of the millionaires to their downtown offices The sunlight flickers through the elm trees illuminating expensive nurse maids wheeling valuable children in little perambulators Some of the children are worth millions and millions In Europe no doubt you may see in the Unter den Linden avenue or the Champs Elysees a little prince or princess go past with a clattering military guard of honour But that is nothing It is not half so impressive in the real sense as what you may observe every morning on Plutoria Avenue beside the Mausoleum Club in the quietest part of the city Here you may see a little toddling princess in a rabbit suit who owns fifty distilleries in her own right There in a lacquered perambulator sails past a little hooded head that controls from its cradle an entire New Jersey corporation The United States attorney general is suing her as she sits in a vain attempt to make her dissolve herself into constituent companies Near by is a child of four in a khaki suit who represents the merger of two trunk line railways You may meet in the flickered sunlight any number of little princes and princesses far more real than the poor survivals of Europe Incalculable infants wave their fifty dollar ivory rattles in an inarticulate greeting to one another A million dollars of preferred stock laughs merrily in recognition of a majority control going past in a go cart drawn by an imported nurse And through it all the sunlight falls through the elm trees and the birds sing and the motors hum so that the whole world as seen from the boulevard of Plutoria Avenue is the very pleasantest place imaginable Just below Plutoria Avenue and parallel with it the trees die out and the brick and stone of the City begins in earnest Even from the Avenue you see the tops of the sky scraping buildings in the big commercial streets and can hear or almost hear the roar of the elevated railway earning dividends And beyond that again the City sinks lower and is choked and crowded with the tangled streets and little houses of the slums In fact if you were to mount to the roof of the Mausoleum Club itself on Plutoria Avenue you could almost see the slums from there But why should you And on the other hand if you never went up on the roof but only dined inside among the palm trees you would never know that the slums existed which is much better There are broad steps leading up to the club so broad and so agreeably covered with matting that the physical exertion of lifting oneself from one s motor to the door of the club is reduced to the smallest compass The richer members are not ashamed to take the steps one at a time first one foot and then the other and at tight money periods when there is a black cloud hanging over the Stock Exchange you may see each and every one of the members of the Mausoleum Club dragging himself up the steps after this fashion his restless eyes filled with the dumb pathos of a man wondering where he can put his hand on half a million dollars But at gayer times when there are gala receptions at the club its steps are all buried under expensive carpet soft as moss and covered over with a long pavilion of red and white awning to catch the snowflakes and beautiful ladies are poured into the club by the motorful Then indeed it is turned into a veritable Arcadia and for a beautiful pastoral scene such as would have gladdened the heart of a poet who understood the cost of things commend me to the Mausoleum Club on just such an evening Its broad corridors and deep recesses are filled with shepherdesses such as you never saw dressed in beautiful shimmering gowns and wearing feathers in their hair that droop off sideways at every angle known to trigonometry And there are shepherds too with broad white waistcoats and little patent leather shoes and heavy faces and congested cheeks And there is dancing and conversation among the shepherds and shepherdesses with such brilliant flashes of wit and repartee about the rise in Wabash and the fall in Cement that the soul of Louis Quatorze would leap to hear it And later there is supper at little tables when the shepherds and shepherdesses consume preferred stocks and gold interest bonds in the shape of chilled champagne and iced asparagus and great platefuls of dividends and special quarterly bonuses are carried to and fro in silver dishes by Chinese philosophers dressed up to look like waiters But on ordinary days there are no ladies in the club but only the shepherds You may see them sitting about in little groups of two and three under the palm trees drinking whiskey and soda though of course the more temperate among them drink nothing but whiskey and Lithia water and those who have important business to do in the afternoon limit themselves to whiskey and Radnor or whiskey and Magi water There are as many kinds of bubbling gurgling mineral waters in the caverns of the Mausoleum Club as ever sparkled from the rocks of Homeric Greece And when you have once grown used to them it is as impossible to go back to plain water as it is to live again in the forgotten house in a side street that you inhabited long before you became a member Thus the members sit and talk in undertones that float to the ear through the haze of Havana smoke You may hear the older men explaining that the country is going to absolute ruin and the younger ones explaining that the country is forging ahead as it never did before but chiefly they love to talk of great national questions such as the protective tariff and the need of raising it the sad decline of the morality of the working man the spread of syndicalism and the lack of Christianity in the labour class and the awful growth of selfishness among the mass of the people So they talk except for two or three that drop off to directors meetings till the afternoon fades and darkens into evening and the noiseless Chinese philosophers turn on soft lights here and there among the palm trees Presently they dine at white tables glittering with cut glass and green and yellow Rhine wines and after dinner they sit again among the palm trees half hidden in the blue smoke still talking of the tariff and the labour class and trying to wash away the memory and the sadness of it in floods of mineral waters So the evening passes into night and one by one the great motors come throbbing to the door and the Mausoleum Club empties and darkens till the last member is borne away and the Arcadian day ends in well earned repose I want you to give me your opinion very very frankly said mister Lucullus Fyshe on one side of the luncheon table to the reverend Fareforth Furlong on the other By all means said mister Furlong mister Fyshe poured out a wineglassful of soda and handed it to the rector to drink Now tell me very truthfully he said is there too much carbon in it By no means said mister Furlong And quite frankly not too much hydrogen Oh decidedly not And you would not say that the percentage of sodium bicarbonate was too great for the ordinary taste I certainly should not said mister Furlong and in this he spoke the truth Very good then said mister Fyshe I shall use it for the Duke of Dulham this afternoon He uttered the name of the Duke with that quiet democratic carelessness which meant that he didn t care whether half a dozen other members lunching at the club could hear or not After all what was a duke to a man who was president of the People s Traction and Suburban company and the Republican Soda and Siphon company operative and chief director of the People s District Loan and Savings If a man with a broad basis of popular support like that was proposing to entertain a duke surely there could be no doubt about his motives None at all Naturally too if a man manufactures soda himself he gets a little over sensitive about the possibility of his guests noticing the existence of too much carbon in it In fact ever so many of the members of the Mausoleum Club manufacture things or cause them to be manufactured or what is the same thing merge them when they are manufactured This gives them their peculiar chemical attitude towards their food One often sees a member suddenly call the head waiter at breakfast to tell him that there is too much ammonia in the bacon and another one protest at the amount of glucose in the olive oil and another that there is too high a percentage of nitrogen in the anchovy A man of distorted imagination might think this tasting of chemicals in the food a sort of nemesis of fate upon the members But that would be very foolish for in every case the head waiter who is the chief of the Chinese philosophers mentioned above says that he ll see to it immediately and have the percentage removed And as for the members themselves they are about as much ashamed of manufacturing and merging things as the Marquis of Salisbury is ashamed of the founders of the Cecil family What more natural therefore than that mister Lucullus Fyshe before serving the soda to the Duke should try it on somebody else And what better person could be found for this than mister Furlong the saintly young rector of saint Asaph s who had enjoyed the kind of expensive college education calculated to develop all the faculties Moreover a rector of the Anglican Church who has been in the foreign mission field is the kind of person from whom one can find out more or less incidentally how one should address and converse with a duke and whether you call him Your Grace or His Grace or just Grace or Duke or what All of which things would seem to a director of the People s Bank and the president of the Republican Soda company so trivial in importance that he would scorn to ask about them So that was why mister Fyshe had asked mister Furlong to lunch with him and to dine with him later on in the same day at the Mausoleum Club to meet the Duke of Dulham And mister Furlong realizing that a clergyman must be all things to all men and not avoid a man merely because he is a duke had accepted the invitation to lunch and had promised to come to dinner even though it meant postponing the Willing Workers Tango Class of saint Asaph s until the following Friday Thus it had come about that mister Fyshe was seated at lunch consuming a cutlet and a pint of Moselle in the plain downright fashion of a man so democratic that he is practically a revolutionary socialist and doesn t mind saying so and the young rector of saint Asaph s was sitting opposite to him in a religious ecstasy over a salmi of duck The Duke arrived this morning did he not said mister Furlong From New York said mister Fyshe He is staying at the Grand Palaver I sent a telegram through one of our New York directors of the Traction and his Grace has very kindly promised to come over here to dine Is he here for pleasure asked the rector I understand he is mister Fyshe was going to say about to invest a large part of his fortune in American securities but he thought better of it Even with the clergy it is well to be careful So he substituted is very much interested in studying American conditions Does he stay long asked mister Furlong Had mister Lucullus Fyshe replied quite truthfully he would have said Not if I can get his money out of him quickly but he merely answered That I don t know He will find much to interest him went on the rector in a musing tone The position of the Anglican Church in America should afford him an object of much consideration I understand he added feeling his way that his Grace is a man of deep piety Very deep said mister Fyshe And of great philanthropy Very great And I presume said the rector taking a devout sip of the unfinished soda that he is a man of immense wealth I suppose so answered mister Fyshe quite carelessly All these fellows are mister Fyshe generally referred to the British aristocracy as these fellows Land you know feudal estates sheer robbery I call it How the working class the proletariat stand for such tyranny is more than I can see Mark my words Furlong some day they ll rise and the whole thing will come to a sudden end mister Fyshe was here launched upon his favourite topic but he interrupted himself just for a moment to speak to the waiter What the devil do you mean he said by serving asparagus half cold Very sorry sir said the waiter shall I take it out Take it out Of course take it out and see that you don t serve me stuff of that sort again or I ll report you Very sorry sir said the waiter mister Fyshe looked at the vanishing waiter with contempt upon his features These pampered fellows are getting unbearable he said By Gad if I had my way I d fire the whole lot of them lock em out put em on the street That would teach em Yes Furlong you ll live to see it that the whole working class will one day rise against the tyranny of the upper classes and society will be overwhelmed But if mister Fyshe had realized that at that moment in the kitchen of the Mausoleum Club in those sacred precincts themselves there was a walking delegate of the Waiters International Union leaning against a sideboard with his bowler hat over one corner of his eye and talking to a little group of the Chinese philosophers he would have known that perhaps the social catastrophe was a little nearer than even he suspected Are you inviting anyone else tonight asked mister Furlong I should have liked to ask your father said mister Fyshe but unfortunately he is out of town What mister Fyshe really meant was I am extremely glad not to have to ask your father whom I would not introduce to the Duke on any account Indeed mister Furlong senior the father of the rector of saint Asaph s who was President of the New Amalgamated Hymnal Corporation and Director of the Hosanna Pipe and Steam Organ Limited was entirely the wrong man for mister Fyshe s present purpose In fact he was reputed to be as smart a man as ever sold a Bible At this moment he was out of town busied in New York with the preparation of the plates of his new Hindu Testament copyright but had he learned that a duke with several millions to invest was about to visit the city he would not have left it for the whole of Hindustan I suppose you are asking mister Boulder said the rector No answered mister Fyshe very decidedly dismissing the name absolutely Indeed there was even better reason not to introduce mister Boulder to the Duke mister Fyshe had made that sort of mistake once and never intended to make it again It was only a year ago on the occasion of the visit of young Viscount FitzThistle to the Mausoleum Club that mister Fyshe had introduced mister Boulder to the Viscount and had suffered grievously thereby For mister Boulder had no sooner met the Viscount than he invited him up to his hunting lodge in Wisconsin and that was the last thing known of the investment of the FitzThistle fortune This mister Boulder of whom mister Fyshe spoke might indeed have been seen at that moment at a further table of the lunch room eating a solitary meal an oldish man with a great frame suggesting broken strength with a white beard and with falling under eyelids that made him look as if he were just about to cry His eyes were blue and far away and his still mournful face and his great bent shoulders seemed to suggest all the power and mystery of high finance Gloom indeed hung over him For when one heard him talk of listed stocks and cumulative dividends there was as deep a tone in his quiet voice as if he spoke of eternal punishment and the wages of sin Under his great hands a chattering viscount or a sturdy duke or a popinjay Italian marquis was as nothing mister Boulder s methods with titled visitors investing money in America were deep He never spoke to them of money not a word He merely talked of the great American forest he had been born sixty five years back in a lumber state and when he spoke of primeval trees and the howl of the wolf at night among the pines there was the stamp of reality about it that held the visitor spellbound and when he fell to talking of his hunting lodge far away in the Wisconsin timber duke earl or baron that had ever handled a double barrelled express rifle listened and was lost I have a little place mister Boulder would say in his deep tones that seemed almost like a sob a sort of shooting box I think you d call it up in Wisconsin just a plain place he would add almost crying made of logs Oh really the visitor would interject made of logs By Jove how interesting All titled people are fascinated at once with logs and mister Boulder knew it at least subconsciously Yes logs he would continue still in deep sorrow just the plain cedar not squared you know the old original timber I had them cut right out of the forest By this time the visitor s excitement was obvious And is there game there he would ask We have the timber wolf said mister Boulder his voice half choking at the sadness of the thing and of course the jack wolf and the lynx And are they ferocious Oh extremely so quite uncontrollable On which the titled visitor was all excitement to start for Wisconsin at once even before mister Boulder s invitation was put in words And when he returned a week later all tanned and wearing bush whackers boots and covered with wolf bites his whole available fortune was so completely invested in mister Boulder s securities that you couldn t have shaken twenty five cents out of him upside down Yet the whole thing had been done merely incidentally round a big fire under the Wisconsin timber with a dead wolf or two lying in the snow So no wonder that mister Fyshe did not propose to invite mister Boulder to his little dinner No indeed In fact his one aim was to keep mister Boulder and his log house hidden from the Duke And equally no wonder that as soon as mister Boulder read of the Duke s arrival in New York and saw by the Commercial Echo and Financial Undertone that he might come to the City looking for investments he telephoned at once to his little place in Wisconsin which had of course a primeval telephone wire running to it and told his steward to have the place well aired and good fires lighted and he especially enjoined him to see if any of the shanty men thereabouts could catch a wolf or two as he might need them Is no one else coming then asked the rector Oh yes President Boomer of the University We shall be a party of four I thought the Duke might be interested in meeting Boomer He may care to hear something of the archaeological remains of the continent If the Duke did so care he certainly had a splendid chance in meeting the gigantic doctor Boomer the president of Plutoria University If he wanted to know anything of the exact distinction between the Mexican Pueblo and the Navajo tribal house he had his opportunity right now If he was eager to hear a short talk say half an hour on the relative antiquity of the Neanderthal skull and the gravel deposits of the Missouri his chance had come He could learn as much about the stone age and the bronze age in America from President Boomer as he could about the gold age and the age of paper securities from mister Fyshe and mister Boulder So what better man to meet a duke than an archaeological president And if the Duke should feel inclined as a result of his American visit for doctor Boomer who knew everything understood what the Duke had come for inclined let us say to endow a chair in Primitive Anthropology or do any useful little thing of the sort that was only fair business all round or if he even was willing to give a moderate sum towards the general fund of Plutoria University enough let us say to enable the president to dismiss an old professor and hire a new one that surely was reasonable enough The president therefore had said yes to mister Fyshe s invitation with alacrity and had taken a look through the list of his more incompetent professors to refresh his memory The Duke of Dulham had landed in New York five days before and had looked round eagerly for a field of turnips but hadn t seen any He had been driven up Fifth Avenue and had kept his eyes open for potatoes but there were none Nor had he seen any shorthorns in Central Park nor any Southdowns on Broadway For the Duke of course like all dukes was agricultural from his Norfolk jacket to his hobnailed boots At his restaurant he had cut a potato in two and sent half of it to the head waiter to know if it was Bermudian It had all the look of an early Bermudian but the Duke feared from the shading of it that it might be only a late Trinidad And the head waiter sent it to the chef mistaking it for a complaint and the chef sent it back to the Duke with a message that it was not a Bermudian but a Prince Edward Island And the Duke sent his compliments to the chef and the chef sent his compliments to the Duke And the Duke was so pleased at learning this that he had a similar potato wrapped up for him to take away and tipped the head waiter twenty five cents feeling that in an extravagant country the only thing to do is to go the people one better So the Duke carried the potato round for five days in New York and showed it to everybody But beyond this he got no sign of agriculture out of the place at all No one who entertained him seemed to know what the beef that they gave him had been fed on no one even in what seemed the best society could talk rationally about preparing a hog for the breakfast table People seemed to eat cauliflower without distinguishing the Denmark variety from the Oldenburg and few if any knew Silesian bacon even when they tasted it And when they took the Duke out twenty five miles into what was called the country there were still no turnips but only real estate and railway embankments and advertising signs so that altogether the obvious and visible decline of American agriculture in what should have been its leading centre saddened the Duke s heart Thus the Duke passed four gloomy days Agriculture vexed him and still more of course the money concerns which had brought him to America Money is a troublesome thing But it has got to be thought about even by those who were not brought up to it If on account of money matters one has been driven to come over to America in the hope of borrowing money the awkwardness of how to go about it naturally makes one gloomy and preoccupied Had there been broad fields of turnips to walk in and Holstein cattle to punch in the ribs one might have managed to borrow it in the course of gentlemanly intercourse as from one cattle man to another But in New York amid piles of masonry and roaring street traffic and glittering lunches and palatial residences one simply couldn t do it Herein lay the truth about the Duke of Dulham s visit and the error of mister Lucullus Fyshe mister Fyshe was thinking that the Duke had come to lend money In reality he had come to borrow it In fact the Duke was reckoning that by putting a second mortgage on Dulham Towers for twenty thousand sterling and by selling his Scotch shooting and leasing his Irish grazing and sub letting his Welsh coal rent he could raise altogether a hundred thousand pounds This for a duke is an enormous sum If he once had it he would be able to pay off the first mortgage on Dulham Towers buy in the rights of the present tenant of the Scotch shooting and the claim of the present mortgagee of the Irish grazing and in fact be just where he started This is ducal finance which moves always in a circle In other words the Duke was really a poor man not poor in the American sense where poverty comes as a sudden blighting stringency taking the form of an inability to get hold of a quarter of a million dollars no matter how badly one needs it and where it passes like a storm cloud and is gone but poor in that permanent and distressing sense known only to the British aristocracy The Duke s case of course was notorious and mister Fyshe ought to have known of it The Duke was so poor that the Duchess was compelled to spend three or four months every year at a fashionable hotel on the Riviera simply to save money and his eldest son the young Marquis of Beldoodle had to put in most of his time shooting big game in Uganda with only twenty or twenty five beaters and with so few carriers and couriers and such a dearth of elephant men and hyena boys that the thing was a perfect scandal The Duke indeed was so poor that a younger son simply to add his efforts to those of the rest was compelled to pass his days in mountain climbing in the Himalayas and the Duke s daughter was obliged to pay long visits to minor German princesses putting up with all sorts of hardship And while the ducal family wandered about in this way climbing mountains and shooting hyenas and saving money the Duke s place or seat Dulham Towers was practically shut up with no one in it but servants and housekeepers and gamekeepers and tourists and the picture galleries except for artists and visitors and villagers were closed and the town house except for the presence of servants and tradesmen and secretaries was absolutely shut But the Duke knew that rigid parsimony of this sort if kept up for a generation or two will work wonders and this sustained him and the Duchess knew it and it sustained her in fact all the ducal family knowing that it was only a matter of a generation or two took their misfortune very cheerfully The only thing that bothered the Duke was borrowing money This was necessary from time to time when loans or mortgages fell in but he hated it It was beneath him His ancestors had often taken money but had never borrowed it and the Duke chafed under the necessity There was something about the process that went against the grain To sit down in pleasant converse with a man perhaps almost a gentleman and then lead up to the subject and take his money from him seemed to the Duke s mind essentially low He could have understood knocking a man over the head with a fire shovel and taking his money but not borrowing it So the Duke had come to America where borrowing is notoriously easy Any member of the Mausoleum Club for instance would borrow fifty cents to buy a cigar or fifty thousand dollars to buy a house or five millions to buy a railroad with complete indifference and pay it back too if he could and think nothing of it In fact ever so many of the Duke s friends were known to have borrowed money in America with magical ease pledging for it their seats or their pictures or one of their daughters anything So the Duke knew it must be easy And yet incredible as it may seem he had spent four days in New York entertained everywhere and made much of and hadn t borrowed a cent He had been asked to lunch in a Riverside palace and fool that he was had come away without so much as a dollar to show for it He had been asked to a country house on the Hudson and like an idiot he admitted it himself hadn t asked his host for as much as his train fare He had been driven twice round Central Park in a motor and had been taken tamely back to his hotel not a dollar the richer The thing was childish and he knew it But to save his life the Duke didn t know how to begin None of the things that he was able to talk about seemed to have the remotest connection with the subject of money The Duke was able to converse reasonably well over such topics as the approaching downfall of England they had talked of it at Dulham Towers for sixty years or over the duty of England towards China or the duty of England to Persia or its duty to aid the Young Turk Movement and its duty to check the Old Servia agitation The Duke became so interested in these topics and in explaining that while he had never been a Little Englander he had always been a Big Turk and that he stood for a Small Bulgaria and a Restricted Austria that he got further and further away from the topic of money which was what he really wanted to come to and the Duke rose from his conversations with a look of such obvious distress on his face that everybody realized that his anxiety about England was killing him And then suddenly light had come It was on his fourth day in New York that he unexpectedly ran into the Viscount Belstairs they had been together as young men in Nigeria and as middle aged men in saint Petersburg and Belstairs who was in abundant spirits and who was returning to England on the Gloritania at noon the next day explained to the Duke that he had just borrowed fifty thousand pounds on security that wouldn t be worth a halfpenny in England And the Duke said with a sigh How the deuce do you do it Belstairs Do what Borrow it said the Duke How do you manage to get people to talk about it Here I am wanting to borrow a hundred thousand and I m hanged if I can even find an opening At which the Viscount had said Pooh pooh you don t need any opening Just borrow it straight out ask for it across a dinner table just as you d ask for a match they think nothing of it here Across the dinner table repeated the Duke who was a literal man Certainly said the Viscount Not too soon you know say after a second glass of wine I assure you it s absolutely nothing And it was just at that moment that a telegram was handed to the Duke from mister Lucullus Fyshe praying him as he was reported to be visiting the next day the City where the Mausoleum Club stands to make acquaintance with him by dining at that institution And the Duke being as I say a literal man decided that just as soon as mister Fyshe should give him a second glass of wine that second glass should cost mister Fyshe a hundred thousand pounds sterling And oddly enough at about the same moment mister Fyshe was calculating that provided he could make the Duke drink a second glass of the Mausoleum champagne that glass would cost the Duke about five million dollars So the very morning after that the Duke had arrived on the New York express in the City and being an ordinary democratic commercial sort of place absorbed in its own affairs it made no fuss over him whatever The morning edition of the Plutopian Citizen simply said We understand that the Duke of Dulham arrives at the Grand Palaver this morning after which it traced the Duke s pedigree back to Jock of Ealing in the twelfth century and let the matter go at that and the noon edition of the People s Advocate merely wrote We learn that Duke Dulham is in town He is a relation of Jack Ealing But the Commercial Echo and Financial Undertone appearing at four o clock printed in its stock market columns the announcement We understand that the Duke of Dulham who arrives in town today is proposing to invest a large sum of money in American Industrials And of course that announcement reached every member of the Mausoleum Club within twenty minutes The Duke of Dulham entered the Mausoleum Club that evening at exactly seven of the clock He was a short thick man with a shaven face red as a brick and grizzled hair and from the look of him he could have got a job at sight in any lumber camp in Wisconsin He wore a dinner jacket just like an ordinary person but even without his Norfolk coat and his hobnailed boots there was something in the way in which he walked up the long main hall of the Mausoleum Club that every imported waiter in the place recognized in an instant The Duke cast his eye about the club and approved of it It seemed to him a modest quiet place very different from the staring ostentation that one sees too often in a German hof or an Italian palazzo He liked it mister Fyshe and mister Furlong were standing in a deep alcove or bay where there was a fire and india rubber trees and pictures with shaded lights and a whiskey and soda table There the Duke joined them mister Fyshe he had met already that afternoon at the Palaver and he called him Fyshe as if he had known him forever and indeed after a few minutes he called the rector of saint Asaph s simply Furlong for he had been familiar with the Anglican clergy in so many parts of the world that he knew that to attribute any peculiar godliness to them socially was the worst possible taste By Jove said the Duke turning to tap the leaf of a rubber tree with his finger that fellow s a Nigerian isn t he I hardly know said mister Fyshe I imagine so and he added You ve been in Nigeria Duke Oh some years ago said the Duke after big game you know fine place for it Did you get any asked mister Fyshe Not much said the Duke a hippo or two Ah said mister Fyshe And of course now and then a giro the Duke went on and added My sister was luckier though she potted a rhino one day straight out of a doolie I call that rather good mister Fyshe called it that too Ah now here s a good thing the Duke went on looking at a picture He carried in his waistcoat pocket an eyeglass that he used for pictures and for Tamworth hogs and he put it to his eye with one hand keeping the other in the left pocket of his jacket and this this is a very good thing I believe so said mister Fyshe You really have some awfully good things here continued the Duke He had seen far too many pictures in too many places ever to speak of values or compositions or anything of that sort The Duke merely looked at a picture and said Now here s a good thing or Ah here now is a very good thing or I say here s a really good thing No one could get past this sort of criticism The Duke had long since found it bullet proof They showed me some rather good things in New York he went on but really the things you have here seem to be awfully good things Indeed the Duke was truly pleased with the pictures for something in their composition or else in the soft expensive light that shone on them enabled him to see in the distant background of each a hundred thousand sterling And that is a very beautiful picture indeed When you come to our side of the water Fyshe said the Duke I must show you my Botticelli Had mister Fyshe who knew nothing of art expressed his real thought he would have said Show me your which But he only answered I shall be delighted to see it In any case there was no time to say more for at this moment the portly figure and the great face of doctor Boomer president of Plutoria University loomed upon them And with him came a great burst of conversation that blew all previous topics into fragments He was introduced to the Duke and shook hands with mister Furlong and talked to both of them and named the kind of cocktail that he wanted all in one breath and in the very next he was asking the Duke about the Babylonian hieroglyphic bricks that his grandfather the thirteenth Duke had brought home from the Euphrates and which every archaeologist knew were preserved in the Duke s library at Dulham Towers And though the Duke hadn t known about the bricks himself he assured doctor Boomer that his grandfather had collected some really good things quite remarkable And the Duke having met a man who knew about his grandfather felt in his own element In fact he was so delighted with doctor Boomer and the Nigerian rubber tree and the shaded pictures and the charm of the whole place and the certainty that half a million dollars was easily findable in it that he put his eyeglass back in his pocket and said A charming club you have here really most charming Yes said mister Fyshe in a casual tone a comfortable place we like to think But if he could have seen what was happening below in the kitchens of the Mausoleum Club mister Fyshe would have realized that just then it was turning into a most uncomfortable place For the walking delegate with his hat on sideways who had haunted it all day was busy now among the assembled Chinese philosophers writing down names and distributing strikers cards of the International Union and assuring them that the boys of the Grand Palaver had all walked out at seven and that all the boys of the Commercial and the Union and of every restaurant in town were out an hour ago And the philosophers were taking their cards and hanging up their waiters coats and putting on shabby jackets and bowler hats worn sideways and changing themselves by a wonderful transformation from respectable Chinese to slouching loafers of the lowest type But mister Fyshe being in an alcove and not in the kitchens saw nothing of these things Not even when the head waiter shaking with apprehension appeared with cocktails made by himself in glasses that he himself had had to wipe did mister Fyshe absorbed in the easy urbanity of the Duke notice that anything was amiss Neither did his guests For doctor Boomer having discovered that the Duke had visited Nigeria was asking him his opinion of the famous Bimbaweh remains of the lower Niger The Duke confessed that he really hadn t noticed them and the Doctor assured him that Strabo had indubitably mentioned them he would show the Duke the very passage and that they apparently lay if his memory served him about halfway between Oohat and Ohat whether above Oohat and below Ohat or above Ohat and below Oohat he would not care to say for a certainty for that the Duke must wait till the president had time to consult his library And the Duke was fascinated forthwith with the president s knowledge of Nigerian geography and explained that he had once actually descended from below Timbuctoo to Oohat in a doolie manned only by four swats So presently having drunk the cocktails the party moved solemnly in a body from the alcove towards the private dining room upstairs still busily talking of the Bimbaweh remains and the swats and whether the doolie was or was not the original goatskin boat of the book of Genesis And when they entered the private dining room with its snow white table and cut glass and flowers as arranged by a retreating philosopher now heading towards the Gaiety Theatre with his hat over his eyes the Duke again exclaimed Really you have a most comfortable club delightful So they sat down to dinner over which mister Furlong offered up a grace as short as any that are known even to the Anglican clergy And the head waiter now in deep distress for he had been sending out telephone messages in vain to the Grand Palaver and the Continental like the captain of a sinking ship served oysters that he had opened himself and poured Rhine wine with a trembling hand For he knew that unless by magic a new chef and a waiter or two could be got from the Palaver all hope was lost But the guests still knew nothing of his fears doctor Boomer was eating his oysters as a Nigerian hippo might eat up the crew of a doolie in great mouthfuls and commenting as he did so upon the luxuriousness of modern life And in the pause that followed the oysters he illustrated for the Duke with two pieces of bread the essential difference in structure between the Mexican pueblo and the tribal house of the Navajos and lest the Duke should confound either or both of them with the adobe hut of the Bimbaweh tribes he showed the difference at once with a couple of olives By this time of course the delay in the service was getting noticeable mister Fyshe was directing angry glances towards the door looking for the reappearance of the waiter and growling an apology to his guests But the president waved the apology aside In my college days he said I should have considered a plate of oysters an ample meal I should have asked for nothing more We eat he said too much This of course started mister Fyshe on his favourite topic Luxury he exclaimed I should think so It is the curse of the age The appalling growth of luxury the piling up of money the ease with which huge fortunes are made Good thought the Duke here we are coming to it these are the things that are going to ruin us Mark my words the whole thing is bound to end in a tremendous crash I don t mind telling you Duke my friends here I am sure know it already that I am more or less a revolutionary socialist I am absolutely convinced sir that our modern civilization will end in a great social catastrophe Mark what I say and here mister Fyshe became exceedingly impressive a great social catastrophe Some of us may not live to see it perhaps but you for instance Furlong are a younger man you certainly will But here mister Fyshe was understating the case They were all going to live to see it right on the spot For it was just at this moment when mister Fyshe was talking of the social catastrophe and explaining with flashing eyes that it was bound to come that it came and when it came it lit of all places in the world right there in the private dining room of the Mausoleum Club For the gloomy head waiter re entered and leaned over the back of mister Fyshe s chair and whispered to him Eh what said mister Fyshe The head waiter his features stricken with inward agony whispered again The infernal damn scoundrels said mister Fyshe starting back in his chair On strike in this club It s an outrage I m very sorry sir I didn t like to tell you sir I d hoped I might have got help from the outside but it seems sir the hotels are all the same way Do you mean to say said mister Fyshe speaking very slowly that there is no dinner I m sorry sir moaned the waiter It appears the chef hadn t even cooked it Beyond what s on the table sir there s nothing The social catastrophe had come mister Fyshe sat silent with his fist clenched doctor Boomer with his great face transfixed stared at the empty oyster shells thinking perhaps of his college days The Duke with his hundred thousand dashed from his lips in the second cup of champagne that was never served thought of his politeness first and murmured something about taking them to his hotel But there is no need to follow the unhappy details of the unended dinner mister Fyshe s one idea was to be gone he was too true an artist to think that finance could be carried on over the table cloth of a second rate restaurant or on an empty stomach in a deserted club The thing must be done over again he must wait his time and begin anew And so it came about that the little dinner party of mister Lucullus Fyshe dissolved itself into its constituent elements like broken pieces of society in the great cataclysm portrayed by mister Fyshe himself The Duke was bowled home in a snorting motor to the brilliant rotunda of the Grand Palaver itself waiterless and supperless The rector of saint Asaph s wandered off home to his rectory musing upon the contents of its pantry And mister Fyshe and the gigantic Doctor walked side by side homewards along Plutoria Avenue beneath the elm trees Nor had they gone any great distance before doctor Boomer fell to talking of the Duke A charming man he said delightful I feel extremely sorry for him No worse off I presume than any of the rest of us growled mister Fyshe who was feeling in the sourest of democratic moods a man doesn t need to be a duke to have a stomach Oh pooh pooh said the president waving the topic aside with his hand in the air I don t refer to that Oh not at all I was thinking of his financial position an ancient family like the Dulhams it seems too bad altogether For of course to an archaeologist like doctor Boomer an intimate acquaintance with the pedigree and fortunes of the greater ducal families from Jock of Ealing downwards was nothing It went without saying As beside the Neanderthal skull and the Bimbaweh ruins it didn t count mister Fyshe stopped absolutely still in his tracks His financial position he questioned quick as a lynx Certainly said doctor Boomer I had taken it for granted that you knew The Dulham family are practically ruined The Duke I imagine is under the necessity of mortgaging his estates indeed I should suppose he is here in America to raise money mister Fyshe was a man of lightning action Any man accustomed to the Stock Exchange learns to think quickly One moment he cried I see we are right at your door May I just run in and use your telephone I want to call up Boulder for a moment Two minutes later mister Fyshe was saying into the telephone Oh is that you Boulder I was looking for you in vain today wanted you to meet the Duke of Dulham who came in quite unexpectedly from New York felt sure you d like to meet him Wanted you at the club for dinner and now it turns out that the club s all upset waiters strike or some such rascality and the Palaver so I hear is in the same fix Could you possibly Here mister Fyshe paused listening a moment and then went on Yes yes an excellent idea most kind of you Pray do send your motor to the hotel and give the Duke a bite of dinner No I wouldn t join you thanks Most kind Good night And within a few minutes more the motor of mister Boulder was rolling down from Plutoria Avenue to the Grand Palaver Hotel What passed between mister Boulder and the Duke that evening is not known That they must have proved congenial company to one another there is no doubt In fact it would seem that dissimilar as they were in many ways they found a common bond of interest in sport And it is quite likely that mister Boulder may have mentioned that he had a hunting lodge what the Duke would call a shooting box in Wisconsin woods and that it was made of logs rough cedar logs not squared and that the timber wolves and others which surrounded it were of a ferocity without parallel Those who know the Duke best could measure the effect of that upon his temperament At any rate it is certain that mister Lucullus Fyshe at his breakfast table next morning chuckled with suppressed joy to read in the Plutopian Citizen the item We learn that the Duke of Dulham who has been paying a brief visit to the City leaves this morning with mister Asmodeus Boulder for the Wisconsin woods We understand that mister Boulder intends to show his guest who is an ardent sportsman something of the American wolf And so the Duke went whirling westwards and northwards with mister Boulder in the drawing room end of a Pullman car that was all littered up with double barrelled express rifles and leather game bags and lynx catchers and wolf traps and Heaven knows what And the Duke had on his very roughest sporting suit made apparently of alligator hide and as he sat there with a rifle across his knees while the train swept onwards through open fields and broken woods the real country at last towards the Wisconsin forest there was such a light of genial happiness in his face that had not been seen there since he had been marooned in the mud jungles of Upper Burmah And opposite mister Boulder looked at him with fixed silent eyes and murmured from time to time some renewed information of the ferocity of the timber wolf But of wolves other than the timber wolf and fiercer still into whose hands the Duke might fall in America he spoke never a word Nor is it known in the record what happened in Wisconsin and to the Mausoleum Club the Duke and his visit remained only as a passing and a pleasant memory CHAPTER TWO The Wizard of Finance Down in the City itself just below the residential street where the Mausoleum Club is situated there stands overlooking Central Square the Grand Palaver Hotel It is in truth at no great distance from the club not half a minute in one s motor In fact one could almost walk it But in Central Square the quiet of Plutoria Avenue is exchanged for another atmosphere There are fountains that splash unendingly and mingle their music with the sound of the motor horns and the clatter of the cabs There are real trees and little green benches with people reading yesterday s newspaper and grass cut into plots among the asphalt There is at one end a statue of the first governor of the state life size cut in stone and at the other a statue of the last ever so much larger than life cast in bronze And all the people who pass by pause and look at this statue and point at it with walking sticks because it is of extraordinary interest in fact it is an example of the new electro chemical process of casting by which you can cast a state governor any size you like no matter what you start from Those who know about such things explain what an interesting contrast the two statues are for in the case of the governor of a hundred years ago one had to start from plain rough material and work patiently for years to get the effect whereas now the material doesn t matter at all and with any sort of scrap treated in the gas furnace under tremendous pressure one may make a figure of colossal size like the one in Central Square So naturally Central Square with its trees and its fountains and its statues is one of the places of chief interest in the City But especially because there stands along one side of it the vast pile of the Grand Palaver Hotel It rises fifteen stories high and fills all one side of the square It has overlooking the trees in the square twelve hundred rooms with three thousand windows and it would have held all George Washington s army Even people in other cities who have never seen it know it well from its advertising the most homelike hotel in America so it is labelled in all the magazines the expensive ones on the continent In fact the aim of the company that owns the Grand Palaver and they do not attempt to conceal it is to make the place as much a home as possible Therein lies its charm It is a home You realize that when you look up at the Grand Palaver from the square at night when the twelve hundred guests have turned on the lights of the three thousand windows You realize it at theatre time when the great string of motors come sweeping to the doors of the Palaver to carry the twelve hundred guests to twelve hundred seats in the theatres at four dollars a seat But most of all do you appreciate the character of the Grand Palaver when you step into its rotunda Aladdin s enchanted palace was nothing to it It has a vast ceiling with a hundred glittering lights and within it night and day is a surging crowd that is never still and a babel of voices that is never hushed and over all there hangs an enchanted cloud of thin blue tobacco smoke such as might enshroud the conjured vision of a magician of Baghdad or Damascus In and through the rotunda there are palm trees to rest the eye and rubber trees in boxes to soothe the mind and there are great leather lounges and deep armchairs and here and there huge brass ash bowls as big as Etruscan tear jugs Along one side is a counter with grated wickets like a bank and behind it are five clerks with flattened hair and tall collars dressed in long black frock coats all day like members of a legislature They have great books in front of them in which they study unceasingly and at their lightest thought they strike a bell with the open palm of their hand and at the sound of it a page boy in a monkey suit with G P stamped all over him in brass bounds to the desk and off again shouting a call into the unheeding crowd vociferously The sound of it fills for a moment the great space of the rotunda it echoes down the corridors to the side it floats softly melodious through the palm trees of the ladies palm room it is heard fainter and fainter in the distant grill and in the depths of the barber shop below the level of the street the barber arrests a moment the drowsy hum of his shampoo brushes to catch the sound as might a miner in the sunken galleries of a coastal mine cease in his toil a moment to hear the distant murmur of the sea And the clerks call for the pages the pages call for the guests and the guests call for the porters the bells clang the elevators rattle till home itself was never half so homelike A call for mister Tomlinson A call for mister Tomlinson So went the sound echoing through the rotunda And as the page boy found him and handed him on a salver a telegram to read the eyes of the crowd about him turned for a moment to look upon the figure of Tomlinson the Wizard of Finance There he stood in his wide awake hat and his long black coat his shoulders slightly bent with his fifty eight years Anyone who had known him in the olden days on his bush farm beside Tomlinson s Creek in the country of the Great Lakes would have recognized him in a moment There was still on his face that strange puzzled look that it habitually wore only now of course the financial papers were calling it unfathomable There was a certain way in which his eye roved to and fro inquiringly that might have looked like perplexity were it not that the Financial Undertone had recognized it as the searching look of a captain of industry One might have thought that for all the goodness in it there was something simple in his face were it not that the Commercial and Pictorial Review had called the face inscrutable and had proved it so with an illustration that left no doubt of the matter Indeed the face of Tomlinson of Tomlinson s Creek now Tomlinson the Wizard of Finance was not commonly spoken of as a face by the paragraphers of the Saturday magazine sections but was more usually referred to as a mask and it would appear that Napoleon the First had had one also The Saturday editors were never tired of describing the strange impressive personality of Tomlinson the great dominating character of the newest and highest finance From the moment when the interim prospectus of the Erie Auriferous Consolidated had broken like a tidal wave over Stock Exchange circles the picture of Tomlinson the sleeping shareholder of uncomputed millions had filled the imagination of every dreamer in a nation of poets They all described him And when each had finished he began again The face so wrote the editor of the Our Own Men section of Ourselves Monthly is that of a typical American captain of finance hard yet with a certain softness broad but with a certain length ductile but not without its own firmness The mouth so wrote the editor of the Success column of Brains is strong but pliable the jaw firm and yet movable while there is something in the set of the ear that suggests the swift eager mind of the born leader of men So from state to state ran the portrait of Tomlinson of Tomlinson s Creek drawn by people who had never seen him so did it reach out and cross the ocean till the French journals inserted a picture which they used for such occasions and called it Monsieur Tomlinson nouveau capitaine de la haute finance en Amerique and the German weeklies inserting also a suitable picture from their stock marked it Herr Tomlinson Amerikanischer Industrie und Finanzcapitan Thus did Tomlinson float from Tomlinson s Creek beside Lake Erie to the very banks of the Danube and the Drave Some writers grew lyric about him What visions they asked could one but read them must lie behind the quiet dreaming eyes of that inscrutable face They might have read them easily enough had they but had the key Anyone who looked upon Tomlinson as he stood there in the roar and clatter of the great rotunda of the Grand Palaver with the telegram in his hand fumbling at the wrong end to open it might have read the visions of the master mind had he but known their nature They were simple enough For the visions in the mind of Tomlinson Wizard of Finance were for the most part those of a wind swept hillside farm beside Lake Erie where Tomlinson s Creek runs down to the low edge of the lake and where the off shore wind ripples the rushes of the shallow water that and the vision of a frame house and the snake fences of the fourth concession road where it falls to the lakeside And if the eyes of the man are dreamy and abstracted it is because there lies over the vision of this vanished farm an infinite regret greater in its compass than all the shares the Erie Auriferous Consolidated has ever thrown upon the market When Tomlinson had opened the telegram he stood with it for a moment in his hand looking the boy full in the face His look had in it that peculiar far away quality that the newspapers were calling Napoleonic abstraction In reality he was wondering whether to give the boy twenty five cents or fifty The message that he had just read was worded Morning quotations show preferred A G falling rapidly recommend instant sale no confidence send instructions The Wizard of Finance took from his pocket a pencil it was a carpenter s pencil and wrote across the face of the message Buy me quite a bit more of the same yours truly This he gave to the boy Take it over to him he said pointing to the telegraph corner of the rotunda Then after another pause he mumbled Here sonny and gave the boy a dollar With that he turned to walk towards the elevator and all the people about him who had watched the signing of the message knew that some big financial deal was going through a coup in fact they called it The elevator took the Wizard to the second floor As he went up he felt in his pocket and gripped a quarter then changed his mind and felt for a fifty cent piece and finally gave them both to the elevator boy after which he walked along the corridor till he reached the corner suite of rooms a palace in itself for which he was paying a thousand dollars a month ever since the Erie Auriferous Consolidated Company had begun tearing up the bed of Tomlinson s Creek in Cahoga County with its hydraulic dredges Well mother he said as he entered There was a woman seated near the window a woman with a plain homely face such as they wear in the farm kitchens of Cahoga County and a set of fashionable clothes upon her such as they sell to the ladies of Plutoria Avenue This was mother the wife of the Wizard of Finance and eight years younger than himself And she too was in the papers and the public eye and whatsoever the shops had fresh from Paris at fabulous prices that they sold to mother They had put a Balkan hat upon her with an upright feather and they had hung gold chains on her and everything that was most expensive they had hung and tied on mother You might see her emerging any morning from the Grand Palaver in her beetle back jacket and her Balkan hat a figure of infinite pathos And whatever she wore the lady editors of Spring Notes and Causerie du Boudoir wrote it out in French and one paper had called her a belle chatelaine and another had spoken of her as a grande dame which the Tomlinsons thought must be a misprint But in any case for Tomlinson the Wizard of Finance it was a great relief to have as his wife a woman like mother because he knew that she had taught school in Cahoga County and could hold her own in the city with any of them So mother spent her time sitting in her beetle jacket in the thousand dollar suite reading new novels in brilliant paper covers And the Wizard on his trips up and down to the rotunda brought her the very best the ones that cost a dollar fifty because he knew that out home she had only been able to read books like Nathaniel Hawthorne and Walter Scott that were only worth ten cents How s Fred said the Wizard laying aside his hat and looking towards the closed door of an inner room Is he better Some said mother He s dressed but he s lying down Fred was the son of the Wizard and mother In the inner room he lay on a sofa a great hulking boy of seventeen in a flowered dressing gown fancying himself ill There was a packet of cigarettes and a box of chocolates on a chair beside him and he had the blind drawn and his eyes half closed to impress himself Yet this was the same boy that less than a year ago on Tomlinson s Creek had worn a rough store suit and set his sturdy shoulders to the buck saw At present Fortune was busy taking from him the golden gifts which the fairies of Cahoga County Lake Erie had laid in his cradle seventeen years ago The Wizard tip toed into the inner room and from the open door his listening wife could hear the voice of the boy saying in a tone as of one distraught with suffering Is there any more of that jelly Could he have any do you suppose asked Tomlinson coming back It s all right said mother if it will sit on his stomach For this in the dietetics of Cahoga County is the sole test All those things can be eaten which will sit on the stomach Anything that won t sit there is not eatable Do you suppose I could get them to get any questioned Tomlinson Would it be all right to telephone down to the office or do you think it would be better to ring Perhaps said his wife it would be better to look out into the hall and see if there isn t someone round that would tell them This was the kind of problem with which Tomlinson and his wife in their thousand dollar suite in the Grand Palaver grappled all day And when presently a tall waiter in dress clothes appeared and said Jelly Yes sir immediately sir would you like sir Maraschino sir or Portovino sir Tomlinson gazed at him gloomily wondering if he would take five dollars What does the doctor say is wrong with Fred asked Tomlinson when the waiter had gone He don t just say said mother he said he must keep very quiet He looked in this morning for a minute or two and he said he d look in later in the day again But he said to keep Fred very quiet Exactly In other words Fred had pretty much the same complaint as the rest of doctor Slyder s patients on Plutoria Avenue and was to be treated in the same way doctor Slyder who was the most fashionable practitioner in the City spent his entire time moving to and fro in an almost noiseless motor earnestly advising people to keep quiet You must keep very quiet for a little while he would say with a sigh as he sat beside a sick bed As he drew on his gloves in the hall below he would shake his head very impressively and say You must keep him very quiet and so pass out quite soundlessly By this means doctor Slyder often succeeded in keeping people quiet for weeks It was all the medicine that he knew But it was enough And as his patients always got well there being nothing wrong with them his reputation was immense Very naturally the Wizard and his wife were impressed with him They had never seen such therapeutics in Cahoga County where the practice of medicine is carried on with forceps pumps squirts splints and other instruments of violence The waiter had hardly gone when a boy appeared at the door This time he presented to Tomlinson not one telegram but a little bundle of them The Wizard read them with a lengthening face The first ran something like this Congratulate you on your daring market turned instantly and the next Your opinion justified market rose have sold at twenty points profit and a third Your forecast entirely correct C P rose at once send further instructions These and similar messages were from brokers offices and all of them were in the same tone one told him that C P was up and another T G P had passed one hundred twenty nine and another that T C R R had risen ten all of which things were imputed to the wonderful sagacity of Tomlinson Whereas if they had told him that X Y Z had risen to the moon he would have been just as wise as to what it meant Well said the wife of the Wizard as her husband finished looking through the reports how are things this morning Are they any better No said Tomlinson and he sighed as he said it this is the worst day yet It s just been a shower of telegrams and mostly all the same I can t do the figuring of it like you can but I reckon I must have made another hundred thousand dollars since yesterday 
3982_182255_000040_000001	train-clean-100	You don t say 
none	none	so said mother and they looked at one another gloomily And half a million last week wasn t it said Tomlinson as he sank into a chair I m afraid mother he continued it s no good We don t know how We weren t brought up to it All of which meant that if the editor of the Monetary Afternoon or Financial Sunday had been able to know what was happening with the two wizards he could have written up a news story calculated to electrify all America For the truth was that Tomlinson the Wizard of Finance was attempting to carry out a coup greater than any as yet attributed to him by the Press He was trying to lose his money That in the sickness of his soul crushed by the Grand Palaver overwhelmed with the burden of high finance had become his aim to be done with it to get rid of his whole fortune But if you own a fortune that is computed anywhere from fifty millions up with no limit at the top if you own one half of all the preferred stock of an Erie Auriferous Consolidated that is digging gold in hydraulic bucketfuls from a quarter of a mile of river bed the task of losing it is no easy matter There are men no doubt versed in finance who might succeed in doing it But they have a training that Tomlinson lacked Invest it as he would in the worst securities that offered the most rickety of stock the most fraudulent bonds back it came to him When he threw a handful away back came two in its place And at every new coup the crowd applauded the incomparable daring the unparalleled prescience of the Wizard Like the touch of Midas his hand turned everything to gold Mother he repeated it s no use It s like this here Destiny as the books call it The great fortune that Tomlinson the Wizard of Finance was trying his best to lose had come to him with wonderful suddenness As yet it was hardly six months old As to how it had originated there were all sorts of stories afloat in the weekly illustrated press They agreed mostly on the general basis that Tomlinson had made his vast fortune by his own indomitable pluck and dogged industry Some said that he had been at one time a mere farm hand who by sheer doggedness had fought his way from the hay mow to the control of the produce market of seventeen states Others had it that he had been a lumberjack who by sheer doggedness had got possession of the whole lumber forest of the Lake district Others said that he had been a miner in a Lake Superior copper mine who had by the doggedness of his character got a practical monopoly of the copper supply These Saturday articles at any rate made the Saturday reader rigid with sympathetic doggedness himself which was all that the editor who was doggedly trying to make the paper pay wanted to effect But in reality the making of Tomlinson s fortune was very simple The recipe for it is open to anyone It is only necessary to own a hillside farm beside Lake Erie where the uncleared bush and the broken fields go straggling down to the lake and to have running through it a creek such as that called Tomlinson s brawling among the stones and willows and to discover in the bed of a creek a gold mine That is all Nor is it necessary in these well ordered days to discover the gold for one s self One might have lived a lifetime on the farm as Tomlinson s father had and never discover it for one s self For that indeed the best medium of destiny is a geologist let us say the senior professor of geology at Plutoria University That was how it happened The senior professor so it chanced was spending his vacation near by on the shores of the lake and his time was mostly passed for how better can a man spend a month of pleasure in looking for outcroppings of Devonian rock of the post tertiary period For which purpose he carried a vacation hammer in his pocket and made from time to time a note or two as he went along or filled his pockets with the chippings of vacation rocks So it chanced that he came to Tomlinson s Creek at the very point where a great slab of Devonian rock bursts through the clay of the bank When the senior professor of geology saw it and noticed a stripe like a mark on a tiger s back a fault he called it that ran over the face of the block he was at it in an instant beating off fragments with his little hammer Tomlinson and his boy Fred were logging in the underbrush near by with a long chain and yoke of oxen but the geologist was so excited that he did not see them till the sound of his eager hammer had brought them to his side They took him up to the frame house in the clearing where the chatelaine was hoeing a potato patch with a man s hat on her head and they gave him buttermilk and soda cakes but his hand shook so that he could hardly eat them The geologist left Cahoga station that night for the City with a newspaper full of specimens inside his suit case and he knew that if any person or persons would put up money enough to tear that block of rock away and follow the fissure down there would be found there something to astonish humanity geologists and all After that point in the launching of a gold mine the rest is easy Generous warm hearted men interested in geology were soon found There was no stint of money The great rock was torn sideways from its place and from beneath it the crumbled glittering rock dust that sparkled in the sun was sent in little boxes to the testing laboratories of Plutoria University There the senior professor of geology had sat up with it far into the night in a darkened laboratory with little blue flames playing underneath crucibles as in a magician s cavern and with the door locked And as each sample that he tested was set aside and tied in a cardboard box by itself he labelled it aur p seventy five and the pen shook in his hand as he marked it For to professors of geology those symbols mean this is seventy five per cent pure gold So it was no wonder that the senior professor of geology working far into the night among the blue flames shook with excitement not of course for the gold s sake as money he had no time to think of that but because if this thing was true it meant that an auriferous vein had been found in what was Devonian rock of the post tertiary stratification and if that was so it upset enough geology to spoil a textbook It would mean that the professor could read a paper at the next Pan Geological Conference that would turn the whole assembly into a bedlam It pleased him too to know that the men he was dealing with were generous They had asked him to name his own price or the tests that he made and when he had said two dollars per sample they had told him to go right ahead The professor was not I suppose a mercenary man but it pleased him to think that he could clean up sixteen dollars in a single evening in his laboratory It showed at any rate that businessmen put science at its proper value Strangest of all was the fact that the men had told him that even this ore was apparently nothing to what there was it had all come out of one single spot in the creek not the hundredth part of the whole claim Lower down where they had thrown the big dam across to make the bed dry they were taking out this same stuff and even better so they said in cartloads The hydraulic dredges were tearing it from the bed of the creek all day and at night a great circuit of arc lights gleamed and sputtered over the roaring labour of the friends of geological research Thus had the Erie Auriferous Consolidated broken in a tidal wave over financial circles On the Stock Exchange in the downtown offices and among the palm trees of the Mausoleum Club they talked of nothing else And so great was the power of the wave that it washed Tomlinson and his wife along on the crest of it and landed them fifty feet up in their thousand dollar suite in the Grand Palaver And as a result of it mother wore a beetle back jacket and Tomlinson received a hundred telegrams a day and Fred quit school and ate chocolates But in the business world the most amazing thing about it was the wonderful shrewdness of Tomlinson The first sign of it had been that he had utterly refused to allow the Erie Auriferous Consolidated as the friends of geology called themselves to take over the top half of the Tomlinson farm For the bottom part he let them give him one half of the preferred stock in the company in return for their supply of development capital This was their own proposition in fact they reckoned that in doing this they were trading about two hundred thousand dollars worth of machinery for say ten million dollars of gold But it frightened them when Tomlinson said Yes to the offer and when he said that as to common stock they might keep it it was no use to him they were alarmed and uneasy till they made him take a block of it for the sake of market confidence But the top end of the farm he refused to surrender and the friends of applied geology knew that there must be something pretty large behind this refusal the more so as the reason that Tomlinson gave was such a simple one He said that he didn t want to part with the top end of the place because his father was buried on it beside the creek and so he didn t want the dam higher up not for any consideration This was regarded in business circles as a piece of great shrewdness Says his father is buried there eh Devilish shrewd that It was so long since any of the members of the Exchange or the Mausoleum Club had wandered into such places as Cahoga County that they did not know that there was nothing strange in what Tomlinson said His father was buried there on the farm itself in a grave overgrown with raspberry bushes and with a wooden headstone encompassed by a square of cedar rails and slept as many another pioneer of Cahoga is sleeping Devilish smart idea they said and forthwith half the financial men of the city buried their fathers or professed to have done so in likely places along the prospective right of way of a suburban railway for example in fact in any place that marked them out for the joyous resurrection of an expropriation purchase Thus the astounding shrewdness of Tomlinson rapidly became a legend the more so as he turned everything he touched to gold They narrated little stories of him in the whiskey and soda corners of the Mausoleum Club I put it to him in a casual way related for example mister Lucullus Fyshe casually but quite frankly I said See here this is just a bagatelle to you no doubt but to me it might be of some use T C bonds I said have risen twenty two and a half in a week You know as well as I do that they are only collateral trust and that the stock underneath never could and never can earn a par dividend Now I said mister Tomlinson tell me what all that means Would you believe it the fellow looked me right in the face in that queer way he has and he said I don t know He said he didn t know repeated the listener in a tone of amazement and respect By Jove eh he said he didn t know The man s a wizard And he looked as if he didn t went on mister Fyshe That s the deuce of it That man when he wants to can put on a look sir that simply means nothing absolutely nothing In this way Tomlinson had earned his name of the Wizard of American Finance And meantime Tomlinson and his wife within their suite at the Grand Palaver had long since reached their decision For there was one aspect and only one in which Tomlinson was really and truly a wizard He saw clearly that for himself and his wife the vast fortune that had fallen to them was of no manner of use What did it bring them The noise and roar of the City in place of the silence of the farm and the racket of the great rotunda to drown the remembered murmur of the waters of the creek So Tomlinson had decided to rid himself of his new wealth save only such as might be needed to make his son a different kind of man from himself For Fred of course he said it s different But out of such a lot as that it ll be easy to keep enough for him It ll be a grand thing for Fred this money He won t have to grow up like you and me He ll have opportunities we never got He was getting them already The opportunity to wear seven dollar patent leather shoes and a bell shaped overcoat with a silk collar to lounge into moving picture shows and eat chocolates and smoke cigarettes all these opportunities he was gathering immediately Presently when he learned his way round a little he would get still bigger ones He s improving fast said mother She was thinking of his patent leather shoes He s popular said his father I notice it downstairs He sasses any of them just as he likes and no matter how busy they are as soon as they see it s Fred they re all ready to have a laugh with him Certainly they were as any hotel clerk with plastered hair is ready to laugh with the son of a multimillionaire It s a certain sense of humour that they develop But for us mother said the Wizard we ll be rid of it The gold is there It s not right to keep it back But we ll just find a way to pass it on to folks that need it worse than we do For a time they had thought of giving away the fortune But how Who did they know that would take it It had crossed their minds for who could live in the City a month without observing the imposing buildings of Plutoria University as fine as any departmental store in town that they might give it to the college But there it seemed the way was blocked You see mother said the puzzled Wizard we re not known We re strangers I d look fine going up there to the college and saying I want to give you people a million dollars They d laugh at me But don t one read it in the papers his wife had protested where mister Carnegie gives ever so much to the colleges more than all we ve got and they take it That s different said the Wizard He s in with them They all know him Why he s a sort of chairman of different boards of colleges and he knows all the heads of the schools and the professors so it s no wonder that if he offers to give a pension or anything they take it Just think of me going up to one of the professors up there in the middle of his teaching and saying I d like to give you a pension for life

none	none	Think what he d say But the Tomlinsons couldn t imagine it which was just as well So it came about that they had embarked on their system Mother who knew most arithmetic was the leading spirit She tracked out all the stocks and bonds in the front page of the Financial Undertone and on her recommendation the Wizard bought They knew the stocks only by their letters but this itself gave a touch of high finance to their deliberations I d buy some of this R O P if I was you said mother it s gone down from one hundred twenty seven to one hundred seven in two days and I reckon it ll be all gone in ten days or so Wouldn t G G deb be better It goes down quicker Well it s a quick one she assented but it don t go down so steady You can t rely on it You take ones like R O P and T R R pfd they go down all the time and you know where you are As a result of which Tomlinson would send his instructions He did it all from the rotunda in a way of his own that he had evolved with a telegraph clerk who told him the names of brokers and he dealt thus through brokers whom he never saw As a result of this the sluggish R O P and T R R would take as sudden a leap into the air as might a mule with a galvanic shock applied to its tail At once the word was whispered that the Tomlinson interests were after the R O P to reorganize it and the whole floor of the Exchange scrambled for the stock And so it was that after a month or two of these operations the Wizard of Finance saw himself beaten It s no good mother he repeated it s just a kind of Destiny Destiny perhaps it was But if the Wizard of Finance had known it at this very moment when he sat with the Aladdin s palace of his golden fortune reared so strangely about him Destiny was preparing for him still stranger things Destiny so it would seem was devising Its own ways and means of dealing with Tomlinson s fortune As one of the ways and means Destiny was sending at this moment as its special emissaries two huge portly figures wearing gigantic goloshes and striding downwards from the halls of Plutoria University to the Grand Palaver Hotel And one of these was the gigantic doctor Boomer the president of the college and the other was his professor of Greek almost as gigantic as himself And they carried in their capacious pockets bundles of pamphlets on Archaeological Remains of Mitylene and the Use of the Greek Pluperfect and little treatises such as Education and Philanthropy by doctor Boomer and The Excavation of Mitylene An Estimate of Cost by doctor Boyster Boomer on the Foundation and Maintenance of Chairs et cetera Many a man in city finance who had seen doctor Boomer enter his office with a bundle of these monographs and a fighting glitter in his eyes had sunk back in his chair in dismay For it meant that doctor Boomer had tracked him out for a benefaction to the University and that all resistance was hopeless When doctor Boomer once laid upon a capitalist s desk his famous pamphlet on the Use of the Greek Pluperfect it was as if an Arabian sultan had sent the fatal bow string to a condemned pasha or Morgan the buccaneer had served the death sign on a shuddering pirate So they came nearer and nearer shouldering the passers by The sound of them as they talked was like the roaring of the sea as Homer heard it Never did Castor and Pollux come surging into battle as doctor Boomer and doctor Boyster bore down upon the Grand Palaver Hotel Tomlinson the Wizard of Finance had hesitated about going to the university The university was coming to him As for those millions of his he could take his choice dormitories apparatus campuses buildings endowment anything he liked but choose he must And if he feared that after all his fortune was too vast even for such a disposal doctor Boomer would show him how he might use it in digging up ancient Mitylene or modern Smyrna or the lost cities of the Plain of Pactolus If the size of the fortune troubled him doctor Boomer would dig him up the whole African Sahara from Alexandria to Morocco and ask for more But if Destiny held all this for Tomlinson in its outstretched palm before it it concealed stranger things still beneath the folds of its toga There were enough surprises there to turn the faces of the whole directorate of the Erie Auriferous Consolidated as yellow as the gold they mined For at this very moment while the president of Plutoria University drew nearer and nearer to the Grand Palaver Hotel the senior professor of geology was working again beside the blue flames in his darkened laboratory And this time there was no shaking excitement over him Nor were the labels that he marked as sample followed sample in the tests the same as those of the previous marking Not by any means And his grave face as he worked in silence was as still as the stones of the post tertiary period CHAPTER THREE The Arrested Philanthropy of mister Tomlinson This mister Tomlinson is our campus said President Boomer as they passed through the iron gates of Plutoria University For camping said the Wizard Not exactly answered the president though it would of course suit for that Nihil humunum alienum eh and he broke into a loud explosive laugh while his spectacles irradiated that peculiar form of glee derived from a Latin quotation by those able to enjoy it doctor Boyster walking on the other side of mister Tomlinson joined in the laugh in a deep reverberating chorus The two had the Wizard of Finance between them and they were marching him up to the University He was taken along much as is an arrested man who has promised to go quietly They kept their hands off him but they watched him sideways through their spectacles At the least sign of restlessness they doused him with Latin The Wizard of Finance having been marked out by doctor Boomer and doctor Boyster as a prospective benefactor was having Latin poured over him to reduce him to the proper degree of plasticity They had already put him through the first stage They had three days ago called on him at the Grand Palaver and served him with a pamphlet on The Excavation of Mitylene as a sort of writ Tomlinson and his wife had looked at the pictures of the ruins and from the appearance of them they judged that Mitylene was in Mexico and they said that it was a shame to see it in that state and that the United States ought to intervene As the second stage on the path of philanthropy the Wizard of Finance was now being taken to look at the university doctor Boomer knew by experience that no rich man could look at it without wanting to give it money And here the president had found that there is no better method of dealing with businessmen than to use Latin on them For other purposes the president used other things For example at a friendly dinner at the Mausoleum Club where light conversation was in order doctor Boomer chatted as has been seen on the archaeological remains of the Navajos In the same way at missus Rasselyer Brown s Dante luncheons he generally talked of the Italian cinquecentisti and whether Gian Gobbo della Scala had left a greater name than Can Grande della Spiggiola But such talk as that was naturally only for women Businessmen are much too shrewd for that kind of thing in fact so shrewd are they as President Boomer had long since discovered that nothing pleases them so much as the quiet firm assumption that they know Latin It is like writing them up an asset So it was that doctor Boomer would greet a business acquaintance with a roaring salutation of Terque quaterque beatus or stand wringing his hand off to the tune of Oh et presidium et dulce decus meum This caught them every time You don t said Tomlinson the Wizard in a hesitating tone as he looked at the smooth grass of the campus I suppose raise anything on it No no this is only for field sports said the president sunt quos curriculo To which doctor Boyster on the other side added like a chorus pulverem Olympicum This was their favourite quotation It always gave President Boomer a chance to speak of the final letter m in Latin poetry and to say that in his opinion the so called elision of the final m was more properly a dropping of the vowel with a repercussion of the two last consonants He supported this by quoting Ammianus at which doctor Boyster exclaimed Pooh Ammianus more dog Latin and appealed to mister Tomlinson as to whether any rational man nowadays cared what Ammianus thought To all of which Tomlinson answered never a word but looked steadily first at one and then at the other doctor Boomer said afterwards that the penetration of Tomlinson was wonderful and that it was excellent to see how Boyster tried in vain to draw him and Boyster said afterwards that the way in which Tomlinson quietly refused to be led on by Boomer was delicious and that it was a pity that Aristophanes was not there to do it justice All of which was happening as they went in at the iron gates and up the elm avenue of Plutoria University The university as everyone knows stands with its great gates on Plutoria Avenue and with its largest buildings those of the faculties of industrial and mechanical science fronting full upon the street These buildings are exceptionally fine standing fifteen stories high and comparing favourably with the best departmental stores or factories in the City Indeed after nightfall when they are all lighted up for the evening technical classes and when their testing machinery is in full swing and there are students going in and out in overall suits people have often mistaken the university or this newer part of it for a factory A foreign visitor once said that the students looked like plumbers and President Boomer was so proud of it that he put the phrase into his next Commencement address and from there the newspapers got it and the Associated Press took it up and sent it all over the United States with the heading Have Appearance of Plumbers Plutoria University Congratulated on Character of Students and it was a proud day indeed for the heads of the Industrial Science faculty But the older part of the university stands so quietly and modestly at the top end of the elm avenue so hidden by the leaves of it that no one could mistake it for a factory This indeed was once the whole university and had stood there since colonial days under the name Concordia College It had been filled with generations of presidents and professors of the older type with long white beards and rusty black clothes and salaries of fifteen hundred dollars But the change both of name and of character from Concordia College to Plutoria University was the work of President Boomer He had changed it from an old fashioned college of the by gone type to a university in the true modern sense At Plutoria they now taught everything Concordia College for example had no teaching of religion except lectures on the Bible Now they had lectures also on Confucianism Mohammedanism Buddhism with an optional course on atheism for students in the final year And of course they had long since admitted women and there were now beautiful creatures with Cleo de Merode hair studying astronomy at oaken desks and looking up at the teacher with eyes like comets The university taught everything and did everything It had whirling machines on the top of it that measured the speed of the wind and deep in its basements it measured earthquakes with a seismograph it held classes on forestry and dentistry and palmistry it sent life classes into the slums and death classes to the city morgue It offered such a vast variety of themes topics and subjects to the students that there was nothing that a student was compelled to learn while from its own presses in its own press building it sent out a shower of bulletins and monographs like driven snow from a rotary plough In fact it had become as President Boomer told all the businessmen in town not merely a university but a universitas in the true sense and every one of its faculties was now a facultas in the real acceptance of the word and its studies properly and truly studia indeed if the businessmen would only build a few more dormitories and put up enough money to form an adequate fondatum or fundum then the good work might be looked upon as complete As the three walked up the elm avenue there met them a little stream of students with college books and female students with winged victory hats and professors with last year s overcoats And some went past with a smile and others with a shiver That s Professor Withers said the president in a sympathetic voice as one of the shivering figures went past poor Withers and he sighed What s wrong with him said the Wizard is he sick No not sick said the president quietly and sadly merely inefficient Inefficient Unfortunately so Mind you I don t mean inefficient in every sense By no means If anyone were to come to me and say Boomer can you put your hand for me on a first class botanist I d say Take Withers I d say it in a minute This was true He would have In fact if anyone had made this kind of rash speech doctor Boomer would have given away half the professoriate Well what s wrong with him repeated Tomlinson I suppose he ain t quite up to the mark in some ways eh Precisely said the president not quite up to the mark a very happy way of putting it Capax imperii nisi imperasset as no doubt you are thinking to yourself The fact is that Withers though an excellent fellow can t manage large classes With small classes he is all right but with large classes the man is lost He can t handle them He can t eh said the Wizard No But what can I do There he is I can t dismiss him I can t pension him I ve no money for it Here the president slackened a little in his walk and looked sideways at the prospective benefactor But Tomlinson gave no sign A second professorial figure passed them on the other side There again said the president that s another case of inefficiency Professor Shottat our senior professor of English What s wrong with him asked the Wizard He can t handle small classes said the president With large classes he is really excellent but with small ones the man is simply hopeless In this fashion before mister Tomlinson had measured the length of the avenue he had had ample opportunity to judge of the crying need of money at Plutoria University and of the perplexity of its president He was shown professors who could handle the first year but were powerless with the second others who were all right with the second but broke down with the third while others could handle the third but collapsed with the fourth There were professors who were all right in their own subject but perfectly impossible outside of it others who were so occupied outside of their own subject that they were useless inside of it others who knew their subject but couldn t lecture and others again who lectured admirably but didn t know their subject In short it was clear as it was meant to be that the need of the moment was a sum of money sufficient to enable the president to dismiss everybody but himself and doctor Boyster The latter stood in a class all by himself He had known the president for forty five years ever since he was a fat little boy with spectacles in a classical academy stuffing himself on irregular Greek verbs as readily as if on oysters But it soon appeared that the need for dismissing the professors was only part of the trouble There were the buildings to consider This I am ashamed to say said doctor Boomer as they passed the imitation Greek portico of the old Concordia College building is our original home the fons et origo of our studies our faculty of arts It was indeed a dilapidated building yet there was a certain majesty about it too especially when one reflected that it had been standing there looking much the same at the time when its students had trooped off in a flock to join the army of the Potomac and much the same indeed three generations before that when the classes were closed and the students clapped three cornered hats on their heads and were off to enlist as minute men with flintlock muskets under General Washington But doctor Boomer s one idea was to knock the building down and to build on its site a real facultas ten storeys high with elevators in it Tomlinson looked about him humbly as he stood in the main hall The atmosphere of the place awed him There were bulletins and time tables and notices stuck on the walls that gave evidence of the activity of the place Professor Slithers will be unable to meet his classes today ran one of them and another Professor Withers will not meet his classes this week and another Owing to illness Professor Shottat will not lecture this month while still another announced Owing to the indisposition of Professor Podge all botanical classes are suspended but Professor Podge hopes to be able to join in the Botanical Picnic Excursion to Loon Lake on Saturday afternoon You could judge of the grinding routine of the work from the nature of these notices Anyone familiar with the work of colleges would not heed it but it shocked Tomlinson to think how often the professors of the college were stricken down by overwork Here and there in the hall set into niches were bronze busts of men with Roman faces and bare necks and the edge of a toga cast over each shoulder Who would these be asked Tomlinson pointing at them Some of the chief founders and benefactors of the faculty answered the president and at this the hopes of Tomlinson sank in his heart For he realized the class of man one had to belong to in order to be accepted as a university benefactor A splendid group of men are they not said the president We owe them much This is the late mister Hogworth a man of singularly large heart Here he pointed to a bronze figure wearing a wreath of laurel and inscribed GULIEMUS HOGWORTH LITT DOC He had made a great fortune in the produce business and wishing to mark his gratitude to the community he erected the anemometer the wind measure on the roof of the building attaching to it no other condition than that his name should be printed in the weekly reports immediately beside the velocity of the wind The figure beside him is the late mister Underbugg who founded our lectures on the Four Gospels on the sole stipulation that henceforth any reference of ours to the four gospels should be coupled with his name What s that after his name asked Tomlinson Litt Doc said the president Doctor of Letters our honorary degree We are always happy to grant it to our benefactors by a vote of the faculty Here doctor Boomer and doctor Boyster wheeled half round and looked quietly and steadily at the Wizard of Finance To both their minds it was perfectly plain that an honourable bargain was being struck Yes mister Tomlinson said the president as they emerged from the building no doubt you begin to realize our unhappy position Money money money he repeated half musingly If I had the money I d have that whole building down and dismantled in a fortnight From the central building the three passed to the museum building where Tomlinson was shown a vast skeleton of a Diplodocus Maximus and was specially warned not to confuse it with the Dinosaurus Perfectus whose bones however could be bought if anyone any man of large heart would come to the university and say straight out Gentlemen what can I do for you Better still it appeared the whole museum which was hopelessly antiquated being twenty five years old could be entirely knocked down if a sufficient sum was forthcoming and its curator who was as ancient as the Dinosaurus itself could be dismissed on half pay if any man had a heart large enough for the dismissal From the museum they passed to the library where there were full length portraits of more founders and benefactors in long red robes holding scrolls of paper and others sitting holding pens and writing on parchment with a Greek temple and a thunderstorm in the background And here again it appeared that the crying need of the moment was for someone to come to the university and say Gentlemen what can I do for you On which the whole library for it was twenty years old and out of date might be blown up with dynamite and carted away But at all this the hopes of Tomlinson sank lower and lower The red robes and the scrolls were too much for him From the library they passed to the tall buildings that housed the faculty of industrial and mechanical science And here again the same pitiful lack of money was everywhere apparent For example in the physical science department there was a mass of apparatus for which the university was unable to afford suitable premises and in the chemical department there were vast premises for which the university was unable to buy apparatus and so on Indeed it was part of doctor Boomer s method to get himself endowed first with premises too big for the apparatus and then by appealing to public spirit to call for enough apparatus to more than fill the premises by means of which system industrial science at Plutoria University advanced with increasing and gigantic strides But most of all the electric department interested the Wizard of Finance And this time his voice lost its hesitating tone and he looked straight at doctor Boomer as he began I have a boy Ah said doctor Boomer with a huge ejaculation of surprise and relief you have a boy There were volumes in his tone What it meant was Now indeed we have got you where we want you and he exchanged a meaning look with the professor of Greek Within five minutes the president and Tomlinson and doctor Boyster were gravely discussing on what terms and in what way Fred might be admitted to study in the faculty of industrial science The president on learning that Fred had put in four years in Cahoga County Section No three School and had been head of his class in ciphering nodded his head gravely and said it would simply be a matter of a pro tanto that in fact he felt sure that Fred might be admitted ad eundem But the real condition on which they meant to admit him was of course not mentioned One door only in the faculty of industrial and mechanical science they did not pass a heavy oak door at the end of a corridor bearing the painted inscription Geological and Metallurgical Laboratories Stuck in the door was a card with the words they were conceived in the courteous phrases of mechanical science which is almost a branch of business in the real sense Busy keep out doctor Boomer looked at the card Ah yes he said Gildas is no doubt busy with his tests We won t disturb him The president was always proud to find a professor busy it looked well But if doctor Boomer had known what was going on behind the oaken door of the Department of Geology and Metallurgy he would have felt considerably disturbed himself For here again Gildas senior professor of geology was working among his blue flames at a final test on which depended the fate of the Erie Auriferous Consolidated and all connected with it Before him there were some twenty or thirty packets of crumpled dust and splintered ore that glittered on the testing table It had been taken up from the creek along its whole length at even spaces twenty yards apart by an expert sent down in haste by the directorate after Gildas s second report and heavily bribed to keep his mouth shut And as Professor Gildas stood and worked at the samples and tied them up after analysis in little white cardboard boxes he marked each one very carefully and neatly with the words PYRITES WORTHLESS Beside the professor worked a young demonstrator of last year s graduation class It was he in fact who had written the polite notice on the card What is the stuff anyway he asked A sulphuret of iron said the professor or iron pyrites In colour and appearance it is practically identical with gold Indeed in all ages he went on dropping at once into the classroom tone and adopting the professional habit of jumping backwards twenty centuries in order to explain anything properly it has been readily mistaken for the precious metal The ancients called it fool s gold Martin Frobisher brought back four shiploads of it from Baffin Land thinking that he had discovered an Eldorado There are large deposits of it in the mines of Cornwall and it is just possible here the professor measured his words as if speaking of something that he wouldn t promise that the Cassiterides of the Phoenicians contained deposits of the same sulphuret Indeed I defy anyone he continued for he was piqued in his scientific pride to distinguish it from gold without a laboratory test In large quantities I concede its lack of weight would betray it to a trained hand but without testing its solubility in nitric acid or the fact of its burning with a blue flame under the blow pipe it cannot be detected In short when crystallized in dodecahedrons Is it any good broke in the demonstrator Good said the professor Oh you mean commercially Not in the slightest Much less valuable than let us say ordinary mud or clay In fact it is absolutely good for nothing They were silent for a moment watching the blue flames above the brazier Then Gildas spoke again Oddly enough he said the first set of samples were undoubtedly pure gold not the faintest doubt of that That is the really interesting part of the matter These gentlemen concerned in the enterprise will of course lose their money and I shall therefore decline to accept the very handsome fee which they had offered me for my services But the main feature the real point of interest in this matter remains Here we have undoubtedly a sporadic deposit what miners call a pocket of pure gold in a Devonian formation of the post tertiary period This once established we must revise our entire theory of the distribution of igneous and aqueous rocks In fact I am already getting notes together for a paper for the Pan Geological under the heading Auriferous Excretions in the Devonian Strata a Working Hypothesis I hope to read it at the next meeting The young demonstrator looked at the professor with one eye half closed I don t think I would if I were you he said Now this young demonstrator knew nothing or practically nothing of geology because he came of one of the richest and best families in town and didn t need to But he was a smart young man dressed in the latest fashion with brown boots and a crosswise tie and he knew more about money and business and the stock exchange in five minutes than Professor Gildas in his whole existence Why not said the professor Why don t you see what s happened Eh said Gildas What happened to those first samples When that bunch got interested and planned to float the company Don t you see Somebody salted them on you Salted them on me repeated the professor mystified Yes salted them Somebody got wise to what they were and swopped them on you for the real thing so as to get your certified report that the stuff was gold I begin to see muttered the professor Somebody exchanged the samples some person no doubt desirous of establishing the theory that a sporadic outcropping of the sort might be found in a post tertiary formation I see I see No doubt he intended to prepare a paper on it and prove his thesis by these tests I see it all The demonstrator looked at the professor with a sort of pity You re on he said and he laughed softly to himself Well said doctor Boomer after Tomlinson had left the university what do you make of him The president had taken doctor Boyster over to his house beside the campus and there in his study had given him a cigar as big as a rope and taken another himself This was a sign that doctor Boomer wanted doctor Boyster s opinion in plain English without any Latin about it Remarkable man said the professor of Greek wonderful penetration and a man of very few words Of course his game is clear enough Entirely so asserted doctor Boomer It s clear enough that he means to give the money on two conditions Exactly said the president First that we admit his son who is quite unqualified to the senior studies in electrical science and second that we grant him the degree of Doctor of Letters Those are his terms Can we meet them Oh certainly As to the son there is no difficulty of course as to the degree it s only a question of getting the faculty to vote it I think we can manage it Vote it they did that very afternoon True if the members of the faculty had known the things that were being whispered and more than whispered in the City about Tomlinson and his fortune no degree would ever have been conferred on him But it so happened that at that moment the whole professoriate was absorbed in one of those great educational crises which from time to time shake a university to its base The meeting of the faculty that day bid fair to lose all vestige of decorum in the excitement of the moment For as Dean Elderberry Foible the head of the faculty said the motion that they had before them amounted practically to a revolution The proposal was nothing less than the permission of the use of lead pencils instead of pen and ink in the sessional examinations of the university Anyone conversant with the inner life of a college will realize that to many of the professoriate this was nothing less than a last wild onslaught of socialistic democracy against the solid bulwarks of society They must fight it back or die on the walls To others it was one more step in the splendid progress of democratic education comparable only to such epoch making things as the abandonment of the cap and gown and the omission of the word sir in speaking to a professor No wonder that the fight raged Elderberry Foible his fluffed white hair almost on end beat in vain with his gavel for order Finally Chang of Physiology who was a perfect dynamo of energy and was known frequently to work for three or four hours at a stretch proposed that the faculty should adjourn the question and meet for its further discussion on the following Saturday morning This revolutionary suggestion involving work on Saturday reduced the meeting to a mere turmoil in the midst of which Elderberry Foible proposed that the whole question of the use of lead pencils should be adjourned till that day six months and that meantime a new special committee of seventeen professors with power to add to their number to call witnesses and if need be to hear them should report on the entire matter de novo This motion after the striking out of the words de novo and the insertion of ab initio was finally carried after which the faculty sank back completely exhausted into its chair the need of afternoon tea and toast stamped on every face And it was at this moment that President Boomer who understood faculties as few men have done quietly entered the room laid his silk hat on a volume of Demosthenes and proposed the vote of a degree of Doctor of Letters for Edward Tomlinson He said that there was no need to remind the faculty of Tomlinson s services to the nation they knew them Of the members of the faculty indeed some thought that he meant the Tomlinson who wrote the famous monologue on the Iota Subscript while others supposed that he referred to the celebrated philosopher Tomlinson whose new book on the Indivisibility of the Inseparable was just then maddening the entire world In any case they voted the degree without a word still faint with exhaustion But while the university was conferring on Tomlinson the degree of Doctor of Letters all over the City in business circles they were conferring on him far other titles Idiot Scoundrel Swindler were the least of them Every stock and share with which his name was known to be connected was coming down with a run wiping out the accumulated profits of the Wizard at the rate of a thousand dollars a minute They not only questioned his honesty but they went further and questioned his business capacity The man said mister Lucullus Fyshe sitting in the Mausoleum Club and breathing freely at last after having disposed of all his holdings in the Erie Auriferous is an ignoramus I asked him only the other day quite casually a perfectly simple business question I said to him T C Bonds have risen twenty two and a half in a week You know and I know that they are only collateral trust and that the stock underneath never could and never would earn a par dividend Now I said for I wanted to test the fellow tell me what that means Would you believe me he looked me right in the face in that stupid way of his and he said I don t know He said he didn t know repeated the listener contemptuously the man is a damn fool The reason of all this was that the results of the researches of the professor of geology were being whispered among the directorate of the Erie Auriferous And the directors and chief shareholders were busily performing the interesting process called unloading Nor did ever a farmer of Cahoga County in haying time with a thunderstorm threatening unload with greater rapidity than did the major shareholders of the Auriferous mister Lucullus Fyshe traded off a quarter of his stock to an unwary member of the Mausoleum Club at a drop of thirty per cent and being too prudent to hold the rest on any terms he conveyed it at once as a benefaction in trust to the Plutorian Orphans and Foundlings Home while the purchaser of mister Fyshe s stock learning too late of his folly rushed for his lawyers to have the shares conveyed as a gift to the Home for Incurables mister Asmodeus Boulder transferred his entire holdings to the Imbeciles Relief Society and mister Furlong senior passed his over to a Chinese mission as fast as pen could traverse paper Down at the office of Skinyer and Beatem the lawyers of the company they were working overtime drawing up deeds and conveyances and trusts in perpetuity with hardly time to put them into typewriting Within twenty four hours the entire stock of the company bid fair to be in the hands of Idiots Orphans Protestants Foundlings Imbeciles Missionaries Chinese and other unfinancial people with Tomlinson the Wizard of Finance as the senior shareholder and majority control And whether the gentle Wizard as he sat with mother planning his vast benefaction to Plutoria University would have felt more at home with his new group of fellow shareholders than his old it were hard to say But meantime at the office of Skinyer and Beatem all was activity For not only were they drafting the conveyances of the perpetual trusts as fast as legal brains working overtime could do it but in another part of the office a section of the firm were busily making their preparations against the expected actions for fraud and warrants of distraint and injunctions against disposal of assets and the whole battery of artillery which might open on them at any moment And they worked like a corps of military engineers fortifying an escarpment with the joy of battle in their faces The storm might break at any moment Already at the office of the Financial Undertone the type was set for a special extra with a heading three inches high COLLAPSE OF THE ERIE CONSOLIDATED ARREST OF THE MAN TOMLINSON EXPECTED THIS AFTERNOON Skinyer and Beatem had paid the editor who was crooked two thousand dollars cash to hold back that extra for twenty four hours and the editor had paid the reporting staff who were crooked twenty five dollars each to keep the news quiet and the compositors who were also crooked ten dollars per man to hold their mouths shut till the morning with the result that from editors and sub editors and reporters and compositors the news went seething forth in a flood that the Erie Auriferous Consolidated was going to shatter into fragments like the bursting of a dynamite bomb It rushed with a thousand whispering tongues from street to street till it filled the corridors of the law courts and the lobbies of the offices and till every honest man that held a share of the stock shivered in his tracks and reached out to give sell or destroy it Only the unwinking Idiots and the mild Orphans and the calm Deaf mutes and the impassive Chinese held tight to what they had So gathered the storm till all the town like the great rotunda of the Grand Palaver was filled with a silent call for mister Tomlinson voiceless and ominous And while all this was happening and while at Skinyer and Beatem s they worked with frantic pens and clattering type there came a knock at the door hesitant and uncertain and before the eyes of the astounded office there stood in his wide awake hat and long black coat the figure of the man Tomlinson himself And Skinyer the senior partner no sooner heard what Tomlinson wanted than he dashed across the outer office to his partner s room with his hyena face all excitement as he said Beatem Beatem come over to my room This man is absolutely the biggest thing in America For sheer calmness and nerve I never heard of anything to approach him What do you think he wants to do What said Beatem Why he s giving his entire fortune to the university By Gad ejaculated Beatem and the two lawyers looked at one another lost in admiration of the marvellous genius and assurance of Tomlinson Yet what had happened was very simple Tomlinson had come back from the university filled with mingled hope and hesitation The university he saw needed the money and he hoped to give it his entire fortune to put doctor Boomer in a position to practically destroy the whole place But like many a modest man he lacked the assurance to speak out He felt that up to the present the benefactors of the university had been men of an entirely different class from himself It was mother who solved the situation for him Well father she said there s one thing I ve learned already since we ve had money If you want to get a thing done you can always find people to do it for you if you pay them Why not go to those lawyers that manage things for the company and get them to arrange it all for you with the college As a result Tomlinson had turned up at the door of the Skinyer and Beatem office Quite so mister Tomlinson said Skinyer with his pen already dipped in the ink a perfectly simple matter I can draw up a draft of conveyance with a few strokes of the pen In fact we can do it on the spot What he meant was In fact we can do it so fast that I can pocket a fee of five hundred dollars right here and now while you have the money to pay me Now then he continued let us see how it is to run Well said Tomlinson I want you to put it that I give all my stock in the company to the university All of it said Skinyer with a quiet smile to Beatem Every cent of it sir said Tomlinson just write down that I give all of it to the college Very good said Skinyer and he began to write I so and so and so and so of the county of so and so Cahoga I think you said mister Tomlinson Yes sir said the Wizard I was raised there do hereby give assign devise transfer and the transfer is hereby given devised and assigned all those stocks shares hereditaments et cetera which I hold in the et cetera et cetera all several and whatever you will observe mister Tomlinson I am expressing myself with as great brevity as possible to that institution academy college school university now known and reputed to be Plutoria University of the city of et cetera et cetera He paused a moment Now what special objects or purposes shall I indicate he asked Whereupon Tomlinson explained as best he could and Skinyer working with great rapidity indicated that the benefaction was to include a Demolition Fund for the removal of buildings a Retirement Fund for the removal of professors an Apparatus Fund for the destruction of apparatus and a General Sinking Fund for the obliteration of anything not otherwise mentioned And I d like to do something if I could for mister Boomer himself just as man to man said Tomlinson All right said Beatem and he could hardly keep his face straight Give him a chunk of the stock give him half a million I will said Tomlinson he deserves it Undoubtedly said mister Skinyer And within a few minutes the whole transaction was done and Tomlinson filled with joy was wringing the hands of Skinyer and Beatem and telling them to name their own fee They had meant to anyway Is that legal do you suppose said Beatem to Skinyer after the Wizard had gone Will it hold water Oh I don t think so said Skinyer not for a minute In fact rather the other way If they make an arrest for fraudulent flotation this conveyance I should think would help to send him to the penitentiary But I very much doubt if they can arrest him Mind you the fellow is devilish shrewd You know and I know that he planned this whole flotation with a full knowledge of the fraud You and I know it very good but we know it more from our trained instinct in such things than by any proof The fellow has managed to surround himself with such an air of good faith from start to finish that it will be deuced hard to get at him What will he do now said Beatem I tell you what he ll do Mark my words Within twenty four hours he ll clear out and be out of the state and if they want to get him they ll have to extradite I tell you he s a man of extraordinary capacity The rest of us are nowhere beside him In which perhaps there was some truth Well mother said the Wizard when he reached the thousand dollar suite after his interview with Skinyer and Beatem his face irradiated with simple joy it s done I ve put the college now in a position it never was in before nor any other college the lawyers say so themselves That s good said mother Yes and it s a good thing I didn t lose the money when I tried to You see mother what I hadn t realized was the good that could be done with all that money if a man put his heart into it They can start in as soon as they like and tear down those buildings My but it s just wonderful what you can do with money I m glad I didn t lose it So they talked far into the evening That night they slept in an Aladdin s palace filled with golden fancies And in the morning the palace and all its visions fell tumbling about their heads in sudden and awful catastrophe For with Tomlinson s first descent to the rotunda it broke The whole great space seemed filled with the bulletins and the broadside sheets of the morning papers the crowd surging to and fro buying the papers men reading them as they stood and everywhere in great letters there met his eye COLLAPSE OF THE ERIE AURIFEROUS THE GREAT GOLD SWINDLE ARREST OF THE MAN TOMLINSON EXPECTED THIS MORNING So stood the Wizard of Finance beside a pillar the paper fluttering in his hand his eyes fixed while about him a thousand eager eyes and rushing tongues sent shame into his stricken heart And there his boy Fred sent from upstairs found him and at the sight of the seething crowd and his father s stricken face aged as it seemed all in a moment the boy s soul woke within him What had happened he could not tell only that his father stood there dazed beaten and staring at him on every side in giant letters ARREST OF THE MAN TOMLINSON Come father come upstairs he said and took him by the arm dragging him through the crowd In the next half hour as they sat and waited for the arrest in the false grandeur of the thousand dollar suite Tomlinson his wife and Fred the boy learnt more than all the teaching of the industrial faculty of Plutoria University could have taught him in a decade Adversity laid its hand upon him and at its touch his adolescent heart turned to finer stuff than the salted gold of the Erie Auriferous As he looked upon his father s broken figure waiting meekly for arrest and his mother s blubbered face a great wrath burned itself into his soul When the sheriff comes said Tomlinson and his lip trembled as he spoke He had no other picture of arrest than that They can t arrest you father broke out the boy You ve done nothing You never swindled them I tell you if they try to arrest you I ll and his voice broke and stopped upon a sob and his hands clenched in passion You stay here you and mother I ll go down Give me your money and I ll go and pay them and we ll get out of this and go home They can t stop us there s nothing to arrest you for Nor was there Fred paid the bill unmolested save for the prying eyes and babbling tongues of the rotunda And a few hours from that while the town was still ringing with news of his downfall the Wizard with his wife and son walked down from their thousand dollar suite into the corridor their hands burdened with their satchels A waiter with something between a sneer and an obsequious smile upon his face reached out for the valises wondering if it was still worth while You get to hell out of that said Fred He had put on again his rough store suit in which he had come from Cahoga County and there was a dangerous look about his big shoulders and his set jaw And the waiter slunk back So did they pass unarrested and unhindered through corridor and rotunda to the outer portals of the great hotel Beside the door of the Palaver as they passed out was a tall official with a uniform and a round hat He was called by the authorities a chasseur or a commissionaire or some foreign name to mean that he did nothing At the sight of him the Wizard s face flushed for a moment with a look of his old perplexity I wonder he began to murmur how much I ought Not a damn cent father said Fred as he shouldered past the magnificent chasseur let him work With which admirable doctrine the Wizard and his son passed from the portals of the Grand Palaver Nor was there any arrest either then or later In spite of the expectations of the rotunda and the announcements of the Financial Undertone the man Tomlinson was not arrested neither as he left the Grand Palaver nor as he stood waiting at the railroad station with Fred and mother for the outgoing train for Cahoga County There was nothing to arrest him for That was not the least strange part of the career of the Wizard of Finance For when all the affairs of the Erie Auriferous Consolidated were presently calculated up by the labours of Skinyer and Beatem and the legal representatives of the Orphans and the Idiots and the Deaf mutes they resolved themselves into the most beautiful and complete cipher conceivable The salted gold about paid for the cost of the incorporation certificate the development capital had disappeared and those who lost most preferred to say the least about it and as for Tomlinson if one added up his gains on the stock market before the fall and subtracted his bill at the Grand Palaver and the thousand dollars which he gave to Skinyer and Beatem to recover his freehold on the lower half of his farm and the cost of three tickets to Cahoga station the debit and credit account balanced to a hair Thus did the whole fortune of Tomlinson vanish in a night even as the golden palace seen in the mirage of a desert sunset may fade before the eyes of the beholder and leave no trace behind It was some months after the collapse of the Erie Auriferous that the university conferred upon Tomlinson the degree of Doctor of Letters in absentia A university must keep its word and Dean Elderberry Foible who was honesty itself had stubbornly maintained that a vote of the faculty of arts once taken and written in the minute book became as irrefragable as the Devonian rock itself So the degree was conferred And Dean Elderberry Foible standing in a long red gown before doctor Boomer seated in a long blue gown read out after the ancient custom of the college the Latin statement of the award of the degree of Doctor of Letters Eduardus Tomlinsonius vir clarrisimus doctissimus praestissimus and a great many other things all ending in issimus But the recipient was not there to receive He stood at that moment with his boy Fred on a windy hillside beside Lake Erie where Tomlinson s Creek ran again untrammelled to the lake Nor was the scene altered to the eye for Tomlinson and his son had long since broken a hole in the dam with pickaxe and crowbar and day by day the angry water carried down the vestiges of the embankment till all were gone The cedar poles of the electric lights had been cut into fence rails the wooden shanties of the Italian gang of Auriferous workers had been torn down and split into fire wood and where they had stood the burdocks and the thistles of the luxuriant summer conspired to hide the traces of their shame Nature reached out its hand and drew its coverlet of green over the grave of the vanished Eldorado And as the Wizard and his son stood upon the hillside they saw nothing but the land sloping to the lake and the creek murmuring again to the willows while the off shore wind rippled the rushes of the shallow water CHAPTER FOUR The Yahi Bahi Oriental Society of missus Rasselyer Brown missus Rasselyer Brown lived on Plutoria Avenue in a vast sandstone palace in which she held those fashionable entertainments which have made the name of Rasselyer Brown what it is mister Rasselyer Brown lived there also The exterior of the house was more or less a model of the facade of an Italian palazzo of the sixteenth century If one questioned missus Rasselyer Brown at dinner in regard to this which was only a fair return for drinking five dollar champagne she answered that the facade was cinquecentisti but that it reproduced also the Saracenic mullioned window of the Siennese School But if the guest said later in the evening to mister Rasselyer Brown that he understood that his house was cinquecentisti he answered that he guessed it was After which remark and an interval of silence mister Rasselyer Brown would probably ask the guest if he was dry So from that one can tell exactly the sort of people the Rasselyer Browns were In other words mister Rasselyer Brown was a severe handicap to missus Rasselyer Brown He was more than that the word isn t strong enough He was as missus Rasselyer Brown herself confessed to her confidential circle of three hundred friends a drag He was also a tie and a weight and a burden and in missus Rasselyer Brown s religious moments a crucifix Even in the early years of their married life some twenty or twenty five years ago her husband had been a drag on her by being in the coal and wood business It is hard for a woman to have to realize that her husband is making a fortune out of coal and wood and that people know it It ties one down What a woman wants most of all this of course is merely a quotation from missus Rasselyer Brown s own thoughts as expressed to her three hundred friends is room to expand to grow The hardest thing in the world is to be stifled and there is nothing more stifling than a husband who doesn t know a Giotto from a Carlo Dolci but who can distinguish nut coal from egg and is never asked to dinner without talking about the furnace These of course were early trials They had passed to some extent or were at any rate garlanded with the roses of time But the drag remained Even when the retail coal and wood stage was long since over it was hard to have to put up with a husband who owned a coal mine and who bought pulp forests instead of illuminated missals of the twelfth century A coal mine is a dreadful thing at a dinner table It humbles one so before one s guests It wouldn t have been so bad this missus Rasselyer Brown herself admitted if mister Rasselyer Brown did anything This phrase should be clearly understood It meant if there was any one thing that he did For instance if he had only collected anything Thus there was mister Lucullus Fyshe who made soda water but at the same time everybody knew that he had the best collection of broken Italian furniture on the continent there wasn t a sound piece among the lot And there was the similar example of old mister Feathertop He didn t exactly collect things he repudiated the name He was wont to say Don t call me a collector I m not I simply pick things up Just where I happen to be Rome Warsaw Bucharest anywhere and it is to be noted what fine places these are to happen to be And to think that mister Rasselyer Brown would never put his foot outside of the United States Whereas mister Feathertop would come back from what he called a run to Europe and everybody would learn in a week that he had picked up the back of a violin in Dresden actually discovered it in a violin shop and the lid of an Etruscan kettle he had lighted on it by pure chance in a kettle shop in Etruria and missus Rasselyer Brown would feel faint with despair at the nonentity of her husband So one can understand how heavy her burden was My dear she often said to her bosom friend Miss Snagg I shouldn t mind things so much the things she wouldn t mind were let us say the two million dollars of standing timber which Brown Limited the ominous business name of mister Rasselyer Brown were buying that year if mister Rasselyer Brown did anything But he does nothing Every morning after breakfast off to his wretched office and never back till dinner and in the evening nothing but his club or some business meeting One would think he would have more ambition How I wish I had been a man It was certainly a shame So it came that in almost everything she undertook missus Rasselyer Brown had to act without the least help from her husband Every Wednesday for instance when the Dante Club met at her house they selected four lines each week to meditate on and then discussed them at lunch missus Rasselyer Brown had to carry the whole burden of it her very phrase the whole burden alone Anyone who has carried four lines of Dante through a Moselle lunch knows what a weight it is In all these things her husband was useless quite useless It is not right to be ashamed of one s husband And to do her justice missus Rasselyer Brown always explained to her three hundred intimates that she was not ashamed of him in fact that she refused to be But it was hard to see him brought into comparison at their own table with superior men Put him for instance beside mister Sikleigh Snoop the sex poet and where was he Nowhere He couldn t even understand what mister Snoop was saying And when mister Snoop would stand on the hearth rug with a cup of tea balanced in his hand and discuss whether sex was or was not the dominant note in Botticelli missus Rasselyer Brown would be skulking in a corner in his ill fitting dress suit His wife would often catch with an agonized ear such scraps of talk as When I was first in the coal and wood business or It s a coal that burns quicker than egg but it hasn t the heating power of nut or even in a low undertone the words If you re feeling dry while he s reading And this at a time when everybody in the room ought to have been listening to mister Snoop Nor was even this the whole burden of missus Rasselyer Brown There was another part of it which was perhaps more real though missus Rasselyer Brown herself never put it into words In fact of this part of her burden she never spoke even to her bosom friend Miss Snagg nor did she talk about it to the ladies of the Dante Club nor did she make speeches on it to the members of the Women s Afternoon Art Society nor to the Monday Bridge Club But the members of the Bridge Club and the Art Society and the Dante Club all talked about it among themselves Stated very simply it was this mister Rasselyer Brown drank It was not meant that he was a drunkard or that he drank too much or anything of that sort He drank That was all There was no excess about it mister Rasselyer Brown of course began the day with an eye opener and after all what alert man does not wish his eyes well open in the morning He followed it usually just before breakfast with a bracer and what wiser precaution can a businessman take than to brace his breakfast On his way to business he generally had his motor stopped at the Grand Palaver for a moment if it was a raw day and dropped in and took something to keep out the damp If it was a cold day he took something to keep out the cold and if it was one of those clear sunny days that are so dangerous to the system he took whatever the bartender a recognized health expert suggested to tone the system up After which he could sit down in his office and transact more business and bigger business in coal charcoal wood pulp pulpwood and woodpulp in two hours than any other man in the business could in a week Naturally so For he was braced and propped and toned up and his eyes had been opened and his brain cleared till outside of very big business indeed few men were on a footing with him In fact it was business itself which had compelled mister Rasselyer Brown to drink It is all very well for a junior clerk on twenty dollars a week to do his work on sandwiches and malted milk In big business it is not possible When a man begins to rise in business as mister Rasselyer Brown had begun twenty five years ago he finds that if he wants to succeed he must cut malted milk clear out In any position of responsibility a man has got to drink No really big deal can be put through without it If two keen men sharp as flint get together to make a deal in which each intends to outdo the other the only way to succeed is for them to adjourn to some such place as the luncheon room of the Mausoleum Club and both get partially drunk This is what is called the personal element in business And beside it plodding industry is nowhere Most of all do these principles hold true in such manly out of door enterprises as the forest and timber business where one deals constantly with chief rangers and pathfinders and wood stalkers whose very names seem to suggest a horn of whiskey under a hemlock tree But let it be repeated and carefully understood there was no excess about mister Rasselyer Brown s drinking Indeed whatever he might be compelled to take during the day and at the Mausoleum Club in the evening after his return from his club at night mister Rasselyer Brown made it a fixed rule to take nothing He might perhaps as he passed into the house step into the dining room and take a very small drink at the sideboard But this he counted as part of the return itself and not after it And he might if his brain were over fatigued drop down later in the night in his pajamas and dressing gown when the house was quiet and compose his mind with a brandy and water or something suitable to the stillness of the hour But this was not really a drink mister Rasselyer Brown called it a nip and of course any man may need a nip at a time when he would scorn a drink But after all a woman may find herself again in her daughter There at least is consolation For as missus Rasselyer Brown herself admitted her daughter Dulphemia was herself again There were of course differences certain differences of face and appearance mister Snoop had expressed this fact exquisitely when he said that it was the difference between a Burne Jones and a Dante Gabriel Rossetti But even at that the mother and daughter were so alike that people certain people were constantly mistaking them on the street And as everybody that mistook them was apt to be asked to dine on five dollar champagne there was plenty of temptation towards error There is no doubt that Dulphemia Rasselyer Brown was a girl of remarkable character and intellect So is any girl who has beautiful golden hair parted in thick bands on her forehead and deep blue eyes soft as an Italian sky Even the oldest and most serious men in town admitted that in talking to her they were aware of a grasp a reach a depth that surprised them Thus old Judge Longerstill who talked to her at dinner for an hour on the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission felt sure from the way in which she looked up in his face at intervals and said How interesting that she had the mind of a lawyer And mister Brace the consulting engineer who showed her on the table cloth at dessert with three forks and a spoon the method in which the overflow of the spillway of the Gatun Dam is regulated felt assured from the way she leaned her face on her hand sideways and said How extraordinary that she had the brain of an engineer Similarly foreign visitors to the social circles of the city were delighted with her Viscount FitzThistle who explained to Dulphemia for half an hour the intricacies of the Irish situation was captivated at the quick grasp she showed by asking him at the end without a second s hesitation And which are the Nationalists This kind of thing represents female intellect in its best form Every man that is really a man is willing to recognize it at once As to the young men of course they flocked to the Rasselyer Brown residence in shoals There were batches of them every Sunday afternoon at five o clock encased in long black frock coats sitting very rigidly in upright chairs trying to drink tea with one hand One might see athletic young college men of the football team trying hard to talk about Italian music and Italian tenors from the Grand Opera doing their best to talk about college football There were young men in business talking about art and young men in art talking about religion and young clergymen talking about business Because of course the Rasselyer Brown residence was the kind of cultivated home where people of education and taste are at liberty to talk about things they don t know and to utter freely ideas that they haven t got It was only now and again when one of the professors from the college across the avenue came booming into the room that the whole conversation was pulverized into dust under the hammer of accurate knowledge The whole process was what was called by those who understood such things a salon Many people said that missus Rasselyer Brown s afternoons at home were exactly like the delightful salons of the eighteenth century and whether the gatherings were or were not salons of the eighteenth century there is no doubt that mister Rasselyer Brown under whose care certain favoured guests dropped quietly into the back alcove of the dining room did his best to put the gathering on a par with the best saloons of the twentieth Now it so happened that there had come a singularly slack moment in the social life of the City The Grand Opera had sung itself into a huge deficit and closed There remained nothing of it except the efforts of a committee of ladies to raise enough money to enable Signor Puffi to leave town and the generous attempt of another committee to gather funds in order to keep Signor Pasti in the City Beyond this opera was dead though the fact that the deficit was nearly twice as large as it had been the year before showed that public interest in music was increasing It was indeed a singularly trying time of the year It was too early to go to Europe and too late to go to Bermuda It was too warm to go south and yet still too cold to go north In fact one was almost compelled to stay at home which was dreadful As a result missus Rasselyer Brown and her three hundred friends moved backwards and forwards on Plutoria Avenue seeking novelty in vain They washed in waves of silk from tango teas to bridge afternoons They poured in liquid avalanches of colour into crowded receptions and they sat in glittering rows and listened to lectures on the enfranchisement of the female sex But for the moment all was weariness Now it happened whether by accident or design that just at this moment of general ennui missus Rasselyer Brown and her three hundred friends first heard of the presence in the city of mister Yahi Bahi the celebrated Oriental mystic He was so celebrated that nobody even thought of asking who he was or where he came from They merely told one another and repeated it that he was the celebrated Yahi Bahi They added for those who needed the knowledge that the name was pronounced Yahhy Bahhy and that the doctrine taught by mister Yahi Bahi was Boohooism This latter if anyone inquired further was explained to be a form of Shoodooism only rather more intense In fact it was esoteric on receipt of which information everybody remarked at once how infinitely superior the Oriental peoples are to ourselves Now as missus Rasselyer Brown was always a leader in everything that was done in the best circles on Plutoria Avenue she was naturally among the first to visit mister Yahi Bahi My dear she said in describing afterwards her experience to her bosom friend Miss Snagg it was most interesting We drove away down to the queerest part of the City and went to the strangest little house imaginable up the narrowest stairs one ever saw quite Eastern in fact just like a scene out of the Koran How fascinating said Miss Snagg But as a matter of fact if mister Yahi Bahi s house had been inhabited as it might have been by a streetcar conductor or a railway brakesman missus Rasselyer Brown wouldn t have thought it in any way peculiar or fascinating It was all hung with curtains inside she went on with figures of snakes and Indian gods perfectly weird And did you see mister Yahi Bahi asked Miss Snagg Oh no my dear I only saw his assistant mister Ram Spudd such a queer little round man a Bengalee I believe He put his back against a curtain and spread out his arms sideways and wouldn t let me pass He said that mister Yahi Bahi was in meditation and mustn t be disturbed How delightful echoed Miss Snagg But in reality mister Yahi Bahi was sitting behind the curtain eating a ten cent can of pork and beans What I like most about eastern people went on missus Rasselyer Brown is their wonderful delicacy of feeling After I had explained about my invitation to mister Yahi Bahi to come and speak to us on Boohooism and was going away I took a dollar bill out of my purse and laid it on the table You should have seen the way mister Ram Spudd took it He made the deepest salaam and said Isis guard you beautiful lady Such perfect courtesy and yet with the air of scorning the money As I passed out I couldn t help slipping another dollar into his hand and he took it as if utterly unaware of it and muttered Osiris keep you O flower of women And as I got into the motor I gave him another dollar and he said Osis and Osiris both prolong your existence O lily of the ricefield and after he had said it he stood beside the door of the motor and waited without moving till I left He had such a strange rapt look as if he were still expecting something How exquisite murmured Miss Snagg It was her business in life to murmur such things as this for missus Rasselyer Brown On the whole reckoning Grand Opera tickets and dinners she did very well out of it Is it not said missus Rasselyer Brown So different from our men I felt so ashamed of my chauffeur our new man you know he seemed such a contrast beside Ram Spudd The rude way in which the opened the door and the rude way in which he climbed on to his own seat and the rudeness with which he turned on the power I felt positively ashamed And he so managed it I am sure he did it on purpose that the car splashed a lot of mud over mister Spudd as it started Yet oddly enough the opinion of other people on this new chauffeur that of Miss Dulphemia Rasselyer Brown herself for example to whose service he was specially attached was very different The great recommendation of him in the eyes of Miss Dulphemia and her friends and the thing that gave him a touch of mystery was and what higher qualification can a chauffeur want that he didn t look like a chauffeur at all My dear Dulphie whispered Miss Philippa Furlong the rector s sister who was at that moment Dulphemia s second self as they sat behind the new chauffeur don t tell me that he is a chauffeur because he isn t He can chauffe of course but that s nothing For the new chauffeur had a bronzed face hard as metal and a stern eye and when he put on a chauffeur s overcoat some how it seemed to turn into a military greatcoat and even when he put on the round cloth cap of his profession it was converted straightway into a military shako And by Miss Dulphemia and her friends it was presently reported or was invented that he had served in the Philippines which explained at once the scar upon his forehead which must have been received at Iloilo or Huila Huila or some other suitable place But what affected Miss Dulphemia Brown herself was the splendid rudeness of the chauffeur s manner It was so different from that of the young men of the salon Thus when mister Sikleigh Snoop handed her into the car at any time he would dance about saying Allow me and Permit me and would dive forward to arrange the robes But the Philippine chauffeur merely swung the door open and said to Dulphemia Get in and then slammed it This of course sent a thrill up the spine and through the imagination of Miss Dulphemia Rasselyer Brown because it showed that the chauffeur was a gentleman in disguise She thought it very probable that he was a British nobleman a younger son very wild of a ducal family and she had her own theories as to why he had entered the service of the Rasselyer Browns To be quite candid about it she expected that the Philippine chauffeur meant to elope with her and every time he drove her from a dinner or a dance she sat back luxuriously wishing and expecting the elopement to begin But for the time being the interest of Dulphemia as of everybody else that was anybody at all centred round mister Yahi Bahi and the new cult of Boohooism After the visit of missus Rasselyer Brown a great number of ladies also in motors drove down to the house of mister Yahi Bahi And all of them whether they saw mister Yahi Bahi himself or his Bengalee assistant mister Ram Spudd came back delighted Such exquisite tact said one Such delicacy As I was about to go I laid a five dollar gold piece on the edge of the little table mister Spudd scarcely seemed to see it He murmured Osiris help you and pointed to the ceiling I raised my eyes instinctively and when I lowered them the money had disappeared I think he must have caused it to vanish Oh I m sure he did said the listener Others came back with wonderful stories of mister Yahi Bahi s occult powers especially his marvellous gift of reading the future missus Buncomhearst who had just lost her third husband by divorce had received from mister Yahi Bahi a glimpse into the future that was almost uncanny in its exactness She had asked for a divination and mister Yahi Bahi had effected one by causing her to lay six ten dollar pieces on the table arranged in the form of a mystic serpent Over these he had bent and peered deeply as if seeking to unravel their meaning and finally he had given her the prophecy Many things are yet to happen before others begin How does he do it asked everybody As a result of all this it naturally came about that mister Yahi Bahi and mister Ram Spudd were invited to appear at the residence of missus Rasselyer Brown and it was understood that steps would be taken to form a special society to be known as the Yahi Bahi Oriental Society mister Sikleigh Snoop the sex poet was the leading spirit in the organization He had a special fitness for the task he had actually resided in India In fact he had spent six weeks there on a stop over ticket of a round the world six hundred thirty five dollar steamship pilgrimage and he knew the whole country from Jehumbapore in Bhootal to Jehumbalabad in the Carnatic So he was looked upon as a great authority on India China Mongolia and all such places by the ladies of Plutoria Avenue Next in importance was missus Buncomhearst who became later by a perfectly natural process the president of the society She was already president of the Daughters of the Revolution a society confined exclusively to the descendants of Washington s officers and others she was also president of the Sisters of England an organization limited exclusively to women born in England and elsewhere of the Daughters of Kossuth made up solely of Hungarians and friends of Hungary and other nations and of the Circle of Franz Joseph which was composed exclusively of the partisans and others of Austria In fact ever since she had lost her third husband missus Buncomhearst had thrown herself that was her phrase into outside activities Her one wish was on her own statement to lose herself So very naturally missus Rasselyer Brown looked at once to missus Buncomhearst to preside over the meetings of the new society The large dining room at the Rasselyer Browns had been cleared out as a sort of auditorium and in it some fifty or sixty of missus Rasselyer Brown s more intimate friends had gathered The whole meeting was composed of ladies except for the presence of one or two men who represented special cases There was of course little mister Spillikins with his vacuous face and football hair who was there as everybody knew on account of Dulphemia and there was old Judge Longerstill who sat leaning on a gold headed stick with his head sideways trying to hear some fraction of what was being said He came to the gathering in the hope that it would prove a likely place for seconding a vote of thanks and saying a few words half an hour s talk perhaps on the constitution of the United States Failing that he felt sure that at least someone would call him this eminent old gentleman and even that was better than staying at home But for the most part the audience was composed of women and they sat in a little buzz of conversation waiting for mister Yahi Bahi I wonder called missus Buncomhearst from the chair if some lady would be good enough to write minutes Miss Snagg I wonder if you would be kind enough to write minutes Could you I shall be delighted said Miss Snagg but I m afraid there s hardly time to write them before we begin is there Oh but it would be all right to write them afterwards chorussed several ladies who understood such things it s quite often done that way And I should like to move that we vote a constitution said a stout lady with a double eye glass Is that carried said missus Buncomhearst All those in favour please signify Nobody stirred Carried said the president And perhaps you would be good enough missus Fyshe she said turning towards the stout lady to write the constitution Do you think it necessary to write it said missus Fyshe I should like to move if I may that I almost wonder whether it is necessary to write the constitution unless of course anybody thinks that we really ought to Ladies said the president you have heard the motion All those against it There was no sign All those in favour of it There was still no sign Lost she said Then looking across at the clock on the mantel piece and realizing that mister Yahi Bahi must have been delayed and that something must be done she said And now ladies as we have in our midst a most eminent gentleman who probably has thought more deeply about constitutions than All eyes turned at once towards Judge Longerstill but as fortune had it at this very moment mister Sikleigh Snoop entered followed by mister Yahi Bahi and mister Ram Spudd mister Yahi Bahi was tall His drooping Oriental costume made him taller still He had a long brown face and liquid brown eyes of such depth that when he turned them full upon the ladies before him a shiver of interest and apprehension followed in the track of his glance My dear said Miss Snagg afterwards he seemed simply to see right through us This was correct He did mister Ram Spudd presented a contrast to his superior He was short and round with a dimpled mahogany face and eyes that twinkled in it like little puddles of molasses His head was bound in a turban and his body was swathed in so many bands and sashes that he looked almost circular The clothes of both mister Yahi Bahi and Ram Spudd were covered with the mystic signs of Buddha and the seven serpents of Vishnu It was impossible of course for mister Yahi Bahi or mister Ram Spudd to address the audience Their knowledge of English was known to be too slight for that Their communications were expressed entirely through the medium of mister Snoop and even he explained afterwards that it was very difficult The only languages of India which he was able to speak he said with any fluency were Gargamic and Gumaic both of these being old Dravidian dialects with only two hundred and three words in each and hence in themselves very difficult to converse in mister Yahi Bahi answered in what mister Snoop understood to be the Iramic of the Vedas a very rich language but one which unfortunately he did not understand The dilemma is one familiar to all Oriental scholars All of this mister Snoop explained in the opening speech which he proceeded to make And after this he went on to disclose amid deep interest the general nature of the cult of Boohooism He said that they could best understand it if he told them that its central doctrine was that of Bahee Indeed the first aim of all followers of the cult was to attain to Bahee Anybody who could spend a certain number of hours each day say sixteen in silent meditation on Boohooism would find his mind gradually reaching a condition of Bahee The chief aim of Bahee itself was sacrifice a true follower of the cult must be willing to sacrifice his friends or his relatives and even strangers in order to reach Bahee In this way one was able fully to realize oneself and enter into the Higher Indifference Beyond this further meditation and fasting by which was meant living solely on fish fruit wine and meat one presently attained to complete Swaraj or Control of Self and might in time pass into the absolute Nirvana or the Negation of Emptiness the supreme goal of Boohooism As a first step to all this mister Snoop explained each neophyte or candidate for holiness must after searching his own heart send ten dollars to mister Yahi Bahi Gold it appeared was recognized in the cult of Boohooism as typifying the three chief virtues whereas silver or paper money did not even national banknotes were only regarded as do or a halfway palliation and outside currencies such as Canadian or Mexican bills were looked upon as entirely boo or contemptible The Oriental view of money said mister Snoop was far superior to our own but it also might be attained by deep thought and as a beginning by sending ten dollars to mister Yahi Bahi After this mister Snoop in conclusion read a very beautiful Hindu poem translating it as he went along It began O cow standing beside the Ganges and apparently without visible occupation and it was voted exquisite by all who heard it The absence of rhyme and the entire removal of ideas marked it as far beyond anything reached as yet by Occidental culture When mister Snoop had concluded the president called upon Judge Longerstill for a few words of thanks which he gave followed by a brief talk on the constitution of the United States After this the society was declared constituted mister Yahi Bahi made four salaams one to each point of the compass and the meeting dispersed And that evening over fifty dinner tables everybody discussed the nature of Bahee and tried in vain to explain it to men too stupid to understand Now it so happened that on the very afternoon of this meeting at missus Rasselyer Brown s the Philippine chauffeur did a strange and peculiar thing He first asked mister Rasselyer Brown for a few hours leave of absence to attend the funeral of his mother in law This was a request which mister Rasselyer Brown on principle never refused to a man servant Whereupon the Philippine chauffeur no longer attired as one visited the residence of mister Yahi Bahi He let himself in with a marvellous little key which he produced from a very wonderful bunch of such He was in the house for nearly half an hour and when he emerged the notebook in his breast pocket had there been an eye to read it would have been seen to be filled with stranger details in regard to Oriental mysticism than even mister Yahi Bahi had given to the world So strange were they that before the Philippine chauffeur returned to the Rasselyer Brown residence he telegraphed certain and sundry parts of them to New York But why he should have addressed them to the head of a detective bureau instead of to a college of Oriental research it passes the imagination to conceive But as the chauffeur duly reappeared at motor time in the evening the incident passed unnoticed It is beyond the scope of the present narrative to trace the progress of Boohooism during the splendid but brief career of the Yahi Bahi Oriental Society There could be no doubt of its success Its principles appealed with great strength to all the more cultivated among the ladies of Plutoria Avenue There was something in the Oriental mysticism of its doctrines which rendered previous belief stale and puerile The practice of the sacred rites began at once The ladies counters of the Plutorian banks were inundated with requests for ten dollar pieces in exchange for banknotes At dinner in the best houses nothing was eaten except a thin soup or bru followed by fish succeeded by meat or by game especially such birds as are particularly pleasing to Buddha as the partridge the pheasant and the woodcock After this except for fruits and wine the principle of Swaraj or denial of self was rigidly imposed Special Oriental dinners of this sort were given followed by listening to the reading of Oriental poetry with closed eyes and with the mind as far as possible in a state of Stoj or Negation of Thought By this means the general doctrine of Boohooism spread rapidly Indeed a great many of the members of the society soon attained to a stage of Bahee or the Higher Indifference that it would have been hard to equal outside of Juggapore or Jumbumbabad For example when missus Buncomhearst learned of the remarriage of her second husband she had lost him three years before owing to a difference of opinion on the emancipation of women she showed the most complete Bahee possible And when Miss Snagg learned that her brother in Venezuela had died a very sudden death brought on by drinking rum for seventeen years and had left her ten thousand dollars the Bahee which she exhibited almost amounted to Nirvana In fact the very general dissemination of the Oriental idea became more and more noticeable with each week that passed Some members attained to so complete a Bahee or Higher Indifference that they even ceased to attend the meetings of the society others reached a Swaraj or Control of Self so great that they no longer read its pamphlets while others again actually passed into Nirvana to a Complete Negation of Self so rapidly that they did not even pay their subscriptions But features of this sort of course are familiar wherever a successful occult creed makes its way against the prejudices of the multitude The really notable part of the whole experience was the marvellous demonstration of occult power which attended the final seance of the society the true nature of which is still wrapped in mystery For some weeks it had been rumoured that a very special feat or demonstration of power by mister Yahi Bahi was under contemplation In fact the rapid spread of Swaraj and of Nirvana among the members rendered such a feat highly desirable Just what form the demonstration would take was for some time a matter of doubt It was whispered at first that mister Yahi Bahi would attempt the mysterious eastern rite of burying Ram Spudd alive in the garden of the Rasselyer Brown residence and leaving him there in a state of Stoj or Suspended Inanition for eight days But this project was abandoned owing to some doubt apparently in the mind of mister Ram Spudd as to his astral fitness for the high state of Stoj necessitated by the experiment At last it became known to the members of the Poosh or Inner Circle under the seal of confidence that mister Yahi Bahi would attempt nothing less than the supreme feat of occultism namely a reincarnation or more correctly a reastralization of Buddha The members of the Inner Circle shivered with a luxurious sense of mystery when they heard of it Has it ever been done before they asked of mister Snoop Only a few times he said once I believe by Jam bum the famous Yogi of the Carnatic once perhaps twice by Boohoo the founder of the sect But it is looked upon as extremely rare mister Yahi tells me that the great danger is that if the slightest part of the formula is incorrectly observed the person attempting the astralization is swallowed up into nothingness However he declares himself willing to try The seance was to take place at missus Rasselyer Brown s residence and was to be at midnight At midnight said each member in surprise And the answer was Yes at midnight You see midnight here is exactly midday in Allahabad in India This explanation was of course ample Midnight repeated everybody to everybody else is exactly midday in Allahabad That made things perfectly clear Whereas if midnight had been midday in Timbuctoo the whole situation would have been different Each of the ladies was requested to bring to the seance some ornament of gold but it must be plain gold without any setting of stones It was known already that according to the cult of Boohooism gold plain gold is the seat of the three virtues beauty wisdom and grace Therefore according to the creed of Boohooism anyone who has enough gold plain gold is endowed with these virtues and is all right All that is needed is to have enough of it the virtues follow as a consequence But for the great experiment the gold used must not be set with stones with the one exception of rubies which are known to be endowed with the three attributes of Hindu worship modesty loquacity and pomposity In the present case it was found that as a number of ladies had nothing but gold ornaments set with diamonds a second exception was made especially as mister Yahi Bahi on appeal decided that diamonds though less pleasing to Buddha than rubies possessed the secondary Hindu virtues of divisibility movability and disposability On the evening in question the residence of missus Rasselyer Brown might have been observed at midnight wrapped in utter darkness No lights were shown A single taper brought by Ram Spudd from the Taj Mohal and resembling in its outer texture those sold at the five and ten store near mister Spudd s residence burned on a small table in the vast dining room The servants had been sent upstairs and expressly enjoined to retire at half past ten Moreover mister Rasselyer Brown had had to attend that evening at the Mausoleum Club a meeting of the trustees of the Church of saint Asaph and he had come home at eleven o clock as he always did after diocesan work of this sort quite used up in fact so fatigued that he had gone upstairs to his own suite of rooms sideways his knees bending under him So utterly used up was he with his church work that as far as any interest in what might be going on in his own residence he had attained to a state of Bahee or Higher Indifference that even Buddha might have envied The guests as had been arranged arrived noiselessly and on foot All motors were left at least a block away They made their way up the steps of the darkened house and were admitted without ringing the door opening silently in front of them mister Yahi Bahi and mister Ram Spudd who had arrived on foot carrying a large parcel were already there and were behind a screen in the darkened room reported to be in meditation At a whispered word from mister Snoop who did duty at the door all furs and wraps were discarded in the hall and laid in a pile Then the guests passed silently into the great dining room There was no light in it except the dim taper which stood on a little table On this table each guest as instructed laid an ornament of gold and at the same time was uttered in a low voice the word Ksvoo This means O Buddha I herewith lay my unworthy offering at thy feet take it and keep it for ever It was explained that this was only a form What is he doing whispered the assembled guests as they saw mister Yahi Bahi pass across the darkened room and stand in front of the sideboard Hush said mister Snoop he s laying the propitiatory offering for Buddha It s an Indian rite whispered missus Rasselyer Brown mister Yahi Bahi could be seen dimly moving to and fro in front of the sideboard There was a faint clinking of glass He has to set out a glass of Burmese brandy powdered over with nutmeg and aromatics whispered missus Rasselyer Brown I had the greatest hunt to get it all for him He said that nothing but Burmese brandy would do because in the Hindu religion the god can only be invoked with Burmese brandy or failing that Hennessy s with three stars which is not entirely displeasing to Buddha The aromatics whispered mister Snoop are supposed to waft a perfume or incense to reach the nostrils of the god The glass of propitiatory wine and the aromatic spices are mentioned in the Vishnu Buddayat mister Yahi Bahi his preparations completed was now seen to stand in front of the sideboard bowing deeply four times in an Oriental salaam The light of the single taper had by this time burned so dim that his movements were vague and uncertain His body cast great flickering shadows on the half seen wall From his throat there issued a low wail in which the word wah wah could be distinguished The excitement was intense What does wah mean whispered mister Spillikins Hush said mister Snoop it means O Buddha wherever thou art in thy lofty Nirvana descend yet once in astral form before our eyes mister Yahi Bahi rose He was seen to place one finger on his lips and then silently moving across the room he disappeared behind the screen Of what mister Ram Spudd was doing during this period there is no record It was presumed that he was still praying The stillness was now absolute We must wait in perfect silence whispered mister Snoop from the extreme tips of his lips Everybody sat in strained intensity silent looking towards the vague outline of the sideboard The minutes passed No one moved All were spellbound in expectancy Still the minutes passed The taper had flickered down till the great room was almost in darkness Could it be that by some neglect in the preparations the substitution perhaps of the wrong brandy the astralization could not be effected But no Quite suddenly it seemed everybody in the darkened room was aware of a presence That was the word as afterwards repeated in a hundred confidential discussions A presence One couldn t call it a body It wasn t It was a figure an astral form a presence Buddha they gasped as they looked at it Just how the figure entered the room the spectators could never afterwards agree Some thought it appeared through the wall deliberately astralizing itself as it passed through the bricks Others seemed to have seen it pass in at the farther door of the room as if it had astralized itself at the foot of the stairs in the back of the hall outside Be that as it may there it stood before them the astralized shape of the Indian deity so that to every lip there rose the half articulated word Buddha or at least to every lip except that of missus Rasselyer Brown From her there came no sound The figure as afterwards described was attired in a long shirak such as is worn by the Grand Llama of Tibet and resembling if the comparison were not profane a modern dressing gown The legs if one might so call them of the apparition were enwrapped in loose punjahamas a word which is said to be the origin of the modern pyjamas while the feet if they were feet were encased in loose slippers Buddha moved slowly across the room Arrived at the sideboard the astral figure paused and even in the uncertain light Buddha was seen to raise and drink the propitiatory offering That much was perfectly clear Whether Buddha spoke or not is doubtful Certain of the spectators thought that he said Must a fagotnit which is Hindustanee for Blessings on this house To missus Rasselyer Brown s distracted mind it seemed as if Buddha said I must have forgotten it But this wild fancy she never breathed to a soul Silently Buddha recrossed the room slowly wiping one arm across his mouth after the Hindu gesture of farewell For perhaps a full minute after the disappearance of Buddha not a soul moved Then quite suddenly missus Rasselyer Brown unable to stand the tension any longer pressed an electric switch and the whole room was flooded with light There sat the affrighted guests staring at one another with pale faces But to the amazement and horror of all the little table in the centre stood empty not a single gem not a fraction of the gold that had lain upon it was left All had disappeared The truth seemed to burst upon everyone at once There was no doubt of what had happened The gold and the jewels had been deastralized Under the occult power of the vision they had been demonetized engulfed into the astral plane along with the vanishing Buddha Filled with the sense of horror still to come somebody pulled aside the little screen They fully expected to find the lifeless bodies of mister Yahi Bahi and the faithful Ram Spudd What they saw before them was more dreadful still The outer Oriental garments of the two devotees lay strewn upon the floor The long sash of Yahi Bahi and the thick turban of Ram Spudd were side by side near them almost sickening in its repulsive realism was the thick black head of hair of the junior devotee apparently torn from his scalp as if by lightning and bearing a horrible resemblance to the cast off wig of an actor The truth was too plain They are engulfed cried a dozen voices at once It was realized in a flash that Yahi Bahi and Ram Spudd had paid the penalty of their daring with their lives Through some fatal neglect against which they had fairly warned the participants of the seance the two Orientals had been carried bodily in the astral plane How dreadful murmured mister Snoop We must have made some awful error Are they deastralized murmured missus Buncomhearst Not a doubt of it said mister Snoop And then another voice in the group was heard to say We must hush it up We can t have it known On which a chorus of voices joined in everybody urging that it must be hushed up Couldn t you try to reastralize them said somebody to mister Snoop No no said mister Snoop still shaking Better not try to We must hush it up if we can And the general assent to this sentiment showed that after all the principles of Bahee or Indifference to Others had taken a real root in the society Hush it up cried everybody and there was a general move towards the hall Good Heavens exclaimed missus Buncomhearst our wraps Deastralized said the guests There was a moment of further consternation as everybody gazed at the spot where the ill fated pile of furs and wraps had lain Never mind said everybody let s go without them don t stay Just think if the police should And at the word police all of a sudden there was heard in the street the clanging of a bell and the racing gallop of the horses of the police patrol wagon The police cried everybody Hush it up Hush it up For of course the principles of Bahee are not known to the police In another moment the doorbell of the house rang with a long and violent peal and in a second as it seemed the whole hall was filled with bulky figures uniformed in blue It s all right missus Rasselyer Brown cried a loud firm voice from the sidewalk We have them both Everything is here We got them before they d gone a block But if you don t mind the police must get a couple of names for witnesses in the warrant It was the Philippine chauffeur But he was no longer attired as such He wore the uniform of an inspector of police and there was the metal badge of the Detective Department now ostentatiously outside his coat And beside him one on each side of him there stood the deastralized forms of Yahi Bahi and Ram Spudd They wore long overcoats doubtless the contents of the magic parcels and the Philippine chauffeur had a grip of iron on the neck of each as they stood mister Spudd had lost his Oriental hair and the face of mister Yahi Bahi perhaps in the struggle which had taken place had been scraped white in patches They were making no attempt to break away Indeed mister Spudd with that complete Bahee or Submission to Fate which is attained only by long services in state penitentiaries was smiling and smoking a cigarette We were waiting for them explained a tall police officer to the two or three ladies who now gathered round him with a return of courage They had the stuff in a hand cart and were pushing it away The chief caught them at the corner and rang the patrol from there You ll find everything all right I think ladies he added as a burly assistant was seen carrying an armload of furs up the steps Somehow many of the ladies realized at the moment what cheery safe reliable people policemen in blue are and what a friendly familiar shelter they offer against the wiles of Oriental occultism Are they old criminals someone asked Yes ma am They ve worked this same thing in four cities already and both of them have done time and lots of it They ve only been out six months No need to worry over them he concluded with a shrug of the shoulders So the furs were restored and the gold and the jewels parcelled out among the owners and in due course mister Yahi Bahi and mister Ram Spudd were lifted up into the patrol wagon where they seated themselves with a composure worthy of the best traditions of Jehumbabah and Bahoolapore In fact mister Spudd was heard to address the police as boys and to remark that they had got them good that time So the seance ended and the guests vanished and the Yahi Bahi Society terminated itself without even a vote of dissolution And in all the later confidential discussions of the episode only one point of mysticism remained After they had time really to reflect on it free from all danger of arrest the members of the society realized that on one point the police were entirely off the truth of things For mister Yahi Bahi whether a thief or not and whether he came from the Orient or as the police said from Missouri had actually succeeded in reastralizing Buddha Nor was anyone more emphatic on this point than missus Rasselyer Brown herself For after all she said if it was not Buddha who was it And the question was never answered CHAPTER FIVE The Love Story of mister Peter Spillikins Almost any day on Plutoria Avenue or thereabouts you may see little mister Spillikins out walking with his four tall sons who are practically as old as himself To be exact mister Spillikins is twenty four and Bob the oldest of the boys must be at least twenty Their exact ages are no longer known because by a dreadful accident their mother forgot them This was at a time when the boys were all at mister Wackem s Academy for Exceptional Youths in the foothills of Tennessee and while their mother missus Everleigh was spending the winter on the Riviera and felt that for their own sake she must not allow herself to have the boys with her But now of course since missus Everleigh has remarried and become missus Everleigh Spillikins there is no need to keep them at mister Wackem s any longer mister Spillikins is able to look after them mister Spillikins generally wears a little top hat and an English morning coat The boys are in Eton jackets and black trousers which at their mother s wish are kept just a little too short for them This is because missus Everleigh Spillikins feels that the day will come some day say fifteen years hence when the boys will no longer be children and meantime it is so nice to feel that they are still mere boys Bob is the eldest but Sib the youngest is the tallest whereas Willie the third boy is the dullest although this has often been denied by those who claim that Gib the second boy is just a trifle duller Thus at any rate there is a certain equality and good fellowship all round missus Everleigh Spillikins is not to be seen walking with them She is probably at the race meet being taken there by Captain Cormorant of the United States navy which mister Spillikins considers very handsome of him Every now and then the captain being in the navy is compelled to be at sea for perhaps a whole afternoon or even several days in which case missus Everleigh Spillikins is very generally taken to the Hunt Club or the Country Club by Lieutenant Hawk which mister Spillikins regards as awfully thoughtful of him Or if Lieutenant Hawk is also out of town for the day as he sometimes has to be because he is in the United States army missus Everleigh Spillikins is taken out by old Colonel Shake who is in the State militia and who is at leisure all the time During their walks on Plutoria Avenue one may hear the four boys addressing mister Spillikins as father and dad in deep bull frog voices Say dad drawls Bob couldn t we all go to the ball game No Say dad says Gib let s all go back to the house and play five cent pool in the billiard room All right boys says mister Spillikins And a few minutes later one may see them all hustling up the steps of the Everleigh Spillikins s mansion quite eager at the prospect and all talking together Now the whole of this daily panorama to the eye that can read it represents the outcome of the tangled love story of mister Spillikins which culminated during the summer houseparty at Castel Casteggio the woodland retreat of mister and missus Newberry But to understand the story one must turn back a year or so to the time when mister Peter Spillikins used to walk on Plutoria Avenue alone or sit in the Mausoleum Club listening to the advice of people who told him that he really ought to get married In those days the first thing that one noticed about mister Peter Spillikins was his exalted view of the other sex Every time he passed a beautiful woman in the street he said to himself I say Even when he met a moderately beautiful one he murmured By Jove When an Easter hat went sailing past or a group of summer parasols stood talking on a leafy corner mister Spillikins ejaculated My word At the opera and at tango teas his projecting blue eyes almost popped out of his head Similarly if he happened to be with one of his friends he would murmur I say do look at that beautiful girl or would exclaim I say don t look but isn t that an awfully pretty girl across the street or at the opera Old man don t let her see you looking but do you see that lovely girl in the box opposite One must add to this that mister Spillikins in spite of his large and bulging blue eyes enjoyed the heavenly gift of short sight As a consequence he lived in a world of amazingly beautiful women And as his mind was focused in the same way as his eyes he endowed them with all the virtues and graces which ought to adhere to fifty dollar flowered hats and cerise parasols with ivory handles Nor to do him justice did mister Spillikins confine his attitude to his view of women alone He brought it to bear on everything Every time he went to the opera he would come away enthusiastic saying By Jove isn t it simply splendid Of course I haven t the ear to appreciate it I m not musical you know but even with the little that I know it s great it absolutely puts me to sleep And of each new novel that he bought he said It s a perfectly wonderful book Of course I haven t the head to understand it so I didn t finish it but it s simply thrilling Similarly with painting It s one of the most marvellous pictures I ever saw he would say Of course I ve no eye for pictures and I couldn t see anything in it but it s wonderful The career of mister Spillikins up to the point of which we are speaking had hitherto not been very satisfactory or at least not from the point of view of mister Boulder who was his uncle and trustee mister Boulder s first idea had been to have mister Spillikins attend the university doctor Boomer the president had done his best to spread abroad the idea that a university education was perfectly suitable even for the rich that it didn t follow that because a man was a university graduate he need either work or pursue his studies any further that what the university aimed to do was merely to put a certain stamp upon a man That was all And this stamp according to the tenor of the president s convocation addresses was perfectly harmless No one ought to be afraid of it As a result a great many of the very best young men in the City who had no need for education at all were beginning to attend college It marked said doctor Boomer a revolution mister Spillikins himself was fascinated with his studies The professors seemed to him living wonders By Jove he said the professor of mathematics is a marvel You ought to see him explaining trigonometry on the blackboard You can t understand a word of it He hardly knew which of his studies he liked best Physics he said is a wonderful study I got five per cent in it But by Jove I had to work for it I d go in for it altogether if they d let me But that was just the trouble they wouldn t And so in course of time mister Spillikins was compelled for academic reasons to abandon his life work His last words about it were Gad I nearly passed in trigonometry and he always said afterwards that he had got a tremendous lot out of the university After that as he had to leave the university his trustee mister Boulder put mister Spillikins into business It was of course his own business one of the many enterprises for which mister Spillikins ever since he was twenty one had already been signing documents and countersigning cheques So mister Spillikins found himself in a mahogany office selling wholesale oil And he liked it He said that business sharpened one up tremendously I m afraid mister Spillikins a caller in the mahogany office would say that we can t meet you at five dollars Four seventy is the best we can do on the present market My dear chap said mister Spillikins that s all right After all thirty cents isn t much eh what Dash it old man we won t fight about thirty cents How much do you want Well at four seventy we ll take twenty thousand barrels By Jove said mister Spillikins twenty thousand barrels Gad you want a lot don t you Pretty big sale eh for a beginner like me I guess uncle ll be tickled to death So tickled was he that after a few weeks of oil selling mister Boulder urged mister Spillikins to retire and wrote off many thousand dollars from the capital value of his estate So after this there was only one thing for mister Spillikins to do and everybody told him so namely to get married Spillikins said his friends at the club after they had taken all his loose money over the card table you ought to get married Think so said mister Spillikins Goodness knows he was willing enough In fact up to this point mister Spillikins s whole existence had been one long aspiring sigh directed towards the joys of matrimony In his brief college days his timid glances had wandered by an irresistible attraction towards the seats on the right hand side of the class room where the girls of the first year sat with golden pigtails down their backs doing trigonometry He would have married any of them But when a girl can work out trigonometry at sight what use can she possibly have for marriage None mister Spillikins knew this and it kept him silent And even when the most beautiful girl in the class married the demonstrator and thus terminated her studies in her second year Spillikins realized that it was only because the man was undeniably a demonstrator and knew things Later on when Spillikins went into business and into society the same fate pursued him He loved for at least six months Georgiana McTeague the niece of the presbyterian minister of saint Osoph s He loved her so well that for her sake he temporarily abandoned his pew at saint Asaph s which was episcopalian and listened to fourteen consecutive sermons on hell But the affair got no further than that Once or twice indeed Spillikins walked home with Georgiana from church and talked about hell with her and once her uncle asked him into the manse for cold supper after evening service and they had a long talk about hell all through the meal and upstairs in the sitting room afterwards But somehow Spillikins could get no further with it He read up all he could about hell so as to be able to talk with Georgiana but in the end it failed a young minister fresh from college came and preached at saint Osoph s six special sermons on the absolute certainty of eternal punishment and he married Miss McTeague as a result of it And meantime mister Spillikins had got engaged or practically so to Adelina Lightleigh not that he had spoken to her but he considered himself bound to her For her sake he had given up hell altogether and was dancing till two in the morning and studying action bridge out of a book For a time he felt so sure that she meant to have him that he began bringing his greatest friend Edward Ruff of the college football team of whom Spillikins was very proud up to the Lightleighs residence He specially wanted Adelina and Edward to be great friends so that Adelina and he might ask Edward up to the house after he was married And they got to be such great friends and so quickly that they were married in New York that autumn After which Spillikins used to be invited up to the house by Edward and Adelina They both used to tell him how much they owed him and they too used to join in the chorus and say You know Peter you re awfully silly not to get married Now all this had happened and finished at about the time when the Yahi Bahi Society ran its course At its first meeting mister Spillikins had met Dulphemia Rasselyer Brown At the very sight of her he began reading up the life of Buddha and a translation of the Upanishads so as to fit himself to aspire to live with her Even when the society ended in disaster mister Spillikins s love only burned the stronger Consequently as soon as he knew that mister and missus Rasselyer Brown were going away for the summer and that Dulphemia was to go to stay with the Newberrys at Castel Casteggio this latter place the summer retreat of the Newberrys became the one spot on earth for mister Peter Spillikins Naturally therefore mister Spillikins was presently transported to the seventh heaven when in due course of time he received a note which said We shall be so pleased if you can come out and spend a week or two with us here We will send the car down to the Thursday train to meet you We live here in the simplest fashion possible in fact as mister Newberry says we are just roughing it but I am sure you don t mind for a change Dulphemia is with us but we are quite a small party The note was signed Margaret Newberry and was written on heavy cream paper with a silver monogram such as people use when roughing it The Newberrys like everybody else went away from town in the summertime mister Newberry being still in business after a fashion it would not have looked well for him to remain in town throughout the year It would have created a bad impression on the market as to how much he was making In fact in the early summer everybody went out of town The few who ever revisited the place in August reported that they hadn t seen a soul on the street It was a sort of longing for the simple life for nature that came over everybody Some people sought it at the seaside where nature had thrown out her broad plank walks and her long piers and her vaudeville shows Others sought it in the heart of the country where nature had spread her oiled motor roads and her wayside inns Others like the Newberrys preferred to rough it in country residences of their own Some of the people as already said went for business reasons to avoid the suspicion of having to work all the year round Others went to Europe to avoid the reproach of living always in America Others perhaps most people went for medical reasons being sent away by their doctors Not that they were ill but the doctors of Plutoria Avenue such as Doctor Slyder always preferred to send all their patients out of town during the summer months No well to do doctor cares to be bothered with them And of course patients even when they are anxious to go anywhere on their own account much prefer to be sent there by their doctor My dear madam doctor Slyder would say to a lady who as he knew was most anxious to go to Virginia there s really nothing I can do for you Here he spoke the truth It s not a case of treatment It s simply a matter of dropping everything and going away Now why don t you go for a month or two to some quiet place where you will simply do nothing She never as he knew did anything anyway What do you say to Hot Springs Virginia absolute quiet good golf not a soul there plenty of tennis Or else he would say My dear madam you re simply worn out Why don t you just drop everything and go to Canada perfectly quiet not a soul there and I believe nowadays quite fashionable Thus after all the patients had been sent away doctor Slyder and his colleagues of Plutoria Avenue managed to slip away themselves for a month or two heading straight for Paris and Vienna There they were able so they said to keep in touch with what continental doctors were doing They probably were Now it so happened that both the parents of Miss Dulphemia Rasselyer Brown had been sent out of town in this fashion missus Rasselyer Brown s distressing experience with Yahi Bahi had left her in a condition in which she was utterly fit for nothing except to go on a Mediterranean cruise with about eighty other people also fit for nothing mister Rasselyer Brown himself though never exactly an invalid had confessed that after all the fuss of the Yahi Bahi business he needed bracing up needed putting into shape and had put himself into doctor Slyder s hands The doctor had examined him questioned him searchingly as to what he drank and ended by prescribing port wine to be taken firmly and unflinchingly during the evening and for the daytime at any moment of exhaustion a light cordial such as rye whiskey or rum and Vichy water In addition to which doctor Slyder had recommended mister Rasselyer Brown to leave town Why don t you go down to Nagahakett on the Atlantic he said Is that in Maine said mister Rasselyer Brown in horror Oh dear me no answered the doctor reassuringly It s in New Brunswick Canada excellent place most liberal licence laws first class cuisine and a bar in the hotel No tourists no golf too cold to swim just the place to enjoy oneself So mister Rasselyer Brown had gone away also and as a result Dulphemia Rasselyer Brown at the particular moment of which we speak was declared by the Boudoir and Society column of the Plutorian Daily Dollar to be staying with mister and missus Newberry at their charming retreat Castel Casteggio The Newberrys belonged to the class of people whose one aim in the summer is to lead the simple life mister Newberry himself said that his one idea of a vacation was to get right out into the bush and put on old clothes and just eat when he felt like it This was why he had built Castel Casteggio It stood about forty miles from the city out among the wooded hills on the shore of a little lake Except for the fifteen or twenty residences like it that dotted the sides of the lake it was entirely isolated The only way to reach it was by the motor road that wound its way among leafy hills from the railway station fifteen miles away Every foot of the road was private property as all nature ought to be The whole country about Castel Casteggio was absolutely primeval or at any rate as primeval as Scotch gardeners and French landscape artists could make it The lake itself lay like a sparkling gem from nature s workshop except that they had raised the level of it ten feet stone banked the sides cleared out the brush and put a motor road round it Beyond that it was pure nature Castel Casteggio itself a beautiful house of white brick with sweeping piazzas and glittering conservatories standing among great trees with rolling lawns broken with flower beds as the ground sloped to the lake was perhaps the most beautiful house of all at any rate it was an ideal spot to wear old clothes in to dine early at seven point thirty and except for tennis parties motor boat parties lawn teas and golf to live absolutely to oneself It should be explained that the house was not called Castel Casteggio because the Newberrys were Italian they were not nor because they owned estates in Italy they didn t nor had travelled there they hadn t Indeed for a time they had thought of giving it a Welsh name or a Scotch But the beautiful country residence of the Asterisk Thomsons had stood close by in the same primeval country was already called Penny gw rydd and the woodland retreat of the Hyphen Joneses just across the little lake was called Strathythan na Clee and the charming chalet of the Wilson Smiths was called Yodel Dudel so it seemed fairer to select an Italian name By Jove Miss Furlong how awfully good of you to come down The little suburban train two cars only both first class for the train went nowhere except out into the primeval wilderness had drawn up at the diminutive roadside station mister Spillikins had alighted and there was Miss Philippa Furlong sitting behind the chauffeur in the Newberrys motor She was looking as beautiful as only the younger sister of a High Church episcopalian rector can look dressed in white the colour of saintliness on a beautiful morning in July There was no doubt about Philippa Furlong Her beauty was of that peculiar and almost sacred kind found only in the immediate neighbourhood of the High Church clergy It was admitted by all who envied or admired her that she could enter a church more gracefully move more swimmingly up the aisle and pray better than any girl on Plutoria Avenue mister Spillikins as he gazed at her in her white summer dress and wide picture hat with her parasol nodding above her head realized that after all religion as embodied in the younger sisters of the High Church clergy fills a great place in the world By Jove he repeated how awfully good of you Not a bit said Philippa Hop in Dulphemia was coming but she couldn t Is that all you have with you The last remark was ironical It referred to the two quite large steamer trunks of mister Spillikins that were being loaded together with his suit case tennis racket and golf kit on to the fore part of the motor mister Spillikins as a young man of social experience had roughed it before He knew what a lot of clothes one needs for it So the motor sped away and went bowling noiselessly over the oiled road and turning corners where the green boughs of the great trees almost swished in their faces and rounding and twisting among curves of the hills as it carried Spillikins and Philippa away from the lower domain or ordinary fields and farms up into the enchanted country of private property and the magic castles of Casteggio and Penny gw rydd mister Spillikins must have assured Philippa at least a dozen times in starting off how awfully good it was of her to come down in the motor and he was so pleased at her coming to meet him that Philippa never even hinted that the truth was that she had expected somebody else on the same train For to a girl brought up in the principles of the High Church the truth is a very sacred thing She keeps it to herself And naturally with such a sympathetic listener it was not long before mister Spillikins had begun to talk of Dulphemia and his hopes I don t know whether she really cares for me or not said mister Spillikins but I have pretty good hope The other day or at least about two months ago at one of the Yahi Bahi meetings you were not in that were you he said breaking off Only just at the beginning said Philippa we went to Bermuda Oh yes I remember Do you know I thought it pretty rough at the end especially on Ram Spudd I liked him I sent him two pounds of tobacco to the penitentiary last week you can get it in to them you know if you know how But what were you going to say asked Philippa Oh yes said mister Spillikins And he realized that he had actually drifted off the topic of Dulphemia a thing that had never happened to him before I was going to say that at one of the meetings you know I asked her if I might call her Dulphemia And what did she say to that asked Philippa She said she didn t care what I called her So I think that looks pretty good don t you Awfully good said Philippa And a little after that I took her slippers home from the Charity Ball at the Grand Palaver Archie Jones took her home herself in his car but I took her slippers She d forgotten them I thought that a pretty good sign wasn t it You wouldn t let a chap carry round your slippers unless you knew him pretty well would you Miss Philippa Oh no nobody would said Philippa This of course was a standing principle of the Anglican Church And a little after that Dulphemia and Charlie Mostyn and I were walking to missus Buncomhearst s musical and we d only just started along the street when she stopped and sent me back for her music me mind you not Charlie That seems to me awfully significant It seems to speak volumes said Philippa Doesn t it said mister Spillikins You don t mind my telling you all about this Miss Philippa he added Incidentally mister Spillikins felt that it was all right to call her Miss Philippa because she had a sister who was really Miss Furlong so it would have been quite wrong as mister Spillikins realized to have called Miss Philippa by her surname In any case the beauty of the morning was against it I don t mind a bit said Philippa I think it s awfully nice of you to tell me about it She didn t add that she knew all about it already You see said mister Spillikins you re so awfully sympathetic It makes it so easy to talk to you With other girls especially with clever ones even with Dulphemia I often feel a perfect jackass beside them But I don t feel that way with you at all Don t you really said Philippa but the honest admiration in mister Spillikin s protruding blue eyes forbade a sarcastic answer By Jove said mister Spillikins presently with complete irrelevance I hope you don t mind my saying it but you look awfully well in white stunning He felt that a man who was affianced or practically so was allowed the smaller liberty of paying honest compliments Oh this old thing laughed Philippa with a contemptuous shake of her dress But up here you know we just wear anything She didn t say that this old thing was only two weeks old and had cost eighty dollars or the equivalent of one person s pew rent at saint Asaph s for six months And after that they had only time so it seemed to mister Spillikins for two or three remarks and he had scarcely had leisure to reflect what a charming girl Philippa had grown to be since she went to Bermuda the effect no doubt of the climate of those fortunate islands when quite suddenly they rounded a curve into an avenue of nodding trees and there were the great lawn and wide piazzas and the conservatories of Castel Casteggio right in front of them Here we are said Philippa and there s mister Newberry out on the lawn Now here mister Newberry was saying a little later waving his hand is where you get what I think the finest view of the place He was standing at the corner of the lawn where it sloped dotted with great trees to the banks of the little lake and was showing mister Spillikins the beauties of Castel Casteggio mister Newberry wore on his short circular person the summer costume of a man taking his ease and careless of dress plain white flannel trousers not worth more than six dollars a leg an ordinary white silk shirt with a rolled collar that couldn t have cost more than fifteen dollars and on his head an ordinary Panama hat say forty dollars By Jove said mister Spillikins as he looked about him at the house and the beautiful lawn with its great trees it s a lovely place Isn t it said mister Newberry But you ought to have seen it when I took hold of it To make the motor road alone I had to dynamite out about a hundred yards of rock and then I fetched up cement tons and tons of it and boulders to buttress the embankment Did you really said mister Spillikins looking at mister Newberry with great respect Yes and even that was nothing to the house itself Do you know I had to go at least forty feet for the foundations First I went through about twenty feet of loose clay after that I struck sand and I d no sooner got through that than by George I landed in eight feet of water I had to pump it out I think I took out a thousand gallons before I got clear down to the rock Then I took my solid steel beams in fifty foot lengths here mister Newberry imitated with his arms the action of a man setting up a steel beam and set them upright and bolted them on the rock After that I threw my steel girders across clapped on my roof rafters all steel in sixty foot pieces and then just held it easily just supported it a bit and let it sink gradually to its place mister Newberry illustrated with his two arms the action of a huge house being allowed to sink slowly to a firm rest You don t say so said mister Spillikins lost in amazement at the wonderful physical strength that mister Newberry must have Excuse me just a minute broke off mister Newberry while I smooth out the gravel where you re standing You ve rather disturbed it I m afraid Oh I m awfully sorry said mister Spillikins Oh not at all not at all said his host I don t mind in the least It s only on account of McAlister Who asked mister Spillikins My gardener He doesn t care to have us walk on the gravel paths It scuffs up the gravel so But sometimes one forgets It should be said here for the sake of clearness that one of the chief glories of Castel Casteggio lay in its servants All of them it goes without saying had been brought from Great Britain The comfort they gave to mister and missus Newberry was unspeakable In fact as they themselves admitted servants of the kind are simply not to be found in America Our Scotch gardener missus Newberry always explained is a perfect character I don t know how we could get another like him Do you know my dear he simply won t allow us to pick the roses and if any of us walk across the grass he is furious And he positively refuses to let us use the vegetables He told me quite plainly that if we took any of his young peas or his early cucumbers he would leave We are to have them later on when he s finished growing them How delightful it is to have servants of that sort the lady addressed would murmur so devoted and so different from servants on this side of the water Just imagine my dear my chauffeur when I was in Colorado actually threatened to leave me merely because I wanted to reduce his wages I think it s these wretched labour unions I m sure it is Of course we have trouble with McAlister at times but he s always very reasonable when we put things in the right light Last week for example I was afraid that we had gone too far with him He is always accustomed to have a quart of beer every morning at half past ten the maids are told to bring it out to him and after that he goes to sleep in the little arbour beside the tulip bed And the other day when he went there he found that one of our guests who hadn t been told was actually sitting in there reading Of course he was furious I was afraid for the moment that he would give notice on the spot What would you have done Positively my dear I don t know But we explained to him at once that it was only an accident and that the person hadn t known and that of course it wouldn t occur again After that he was softened a little but he went off muttering to himself and that evening he dug up all the new tulips and threw them over the fence We saw him do it but we didn t dare say anything Oh no echoed the other lady if you had you might have lost him Exactly And I don t think we could possibly get another man like him at least not on this side of the water But come said mister Newberry after he had finished adjusting the gravel with his foot there are missus Newberry and the girls on the verandah Let s go and join them A few minutes later mister Spillikins was talking with missus Newberry and Dulphemia Rasselyer Brown and telling missus Newberry what a beautiful house she had Beside them stood Philippa Furlong and she had her arm around Dulphemia s waist and the picture that they thus made with their heads close together Dulphemia s hair being golden and Philippa s chestnut brown was such that mister Spillikins had no eyes for missus Newberry nor for Castel Casteggio nor for anything So much so that he practically didn t see at all the little girl in green that stood unobtrusively on the further side of missus Newberry Indeed though somebody had murmured her name in introduction he couldn t have repeated it if asked two minutes afterwards His eyes and his mind were elsewhere But hers were not For the Little Girl in Green looked at mister Spillikins with wide eyes and when she looked at him she saw all at once such wonderful things about him as nobody had ever seen before For she could see from the poise of his head how awfully clever he was and from the way he stood with his hands in his side pockets she could see how manly and brave he must be and of course there was firmness and strength written all over him In short she saw as she looked such a Peter Spillikins as truly never existed or could exist or at least such a Peter Spillikins as no one else in the world had ever suspected before All in a moment she was ever so glad that she accepted missus Newberry s invitation to Castel Casteggio and hadn t been afraid to come For the Little Girl in Green whose Christian name was Norah was only what is called a poor relation of missus Newberry and her father was a person of no account whatever who didn t belong to the Mausoleum Club or to any other club and who lived with Norah on a street that nobody who was anybody lived upon Norah had been asked up a few days before out of the City to give her air which is the only thing that can be safely and freely given to poor relations Thus she had arrived at Castel Casteggio with one diminutive trunk so small and shabby that even the servants who carried it upstairs were ashamed of it In it were a pair of brand new tennis shoes at ninety cents reduced to seventy five and a white dress of the kind that is called almost evening and such few other things as poor relations might bring with fear and trembling to join in the simple rusticity of the rich Thus stood Norah looking at mister Spillikins As for him such is the contrariety of human things he had no eyes for her at all What a perfectly charming house this is mister Spillikins was saying He always said this on such occasions but it seemed to the Little Girl in Green that he spoke with wonderful social ease I am so glad you think so said missus Newberry this was what she always answered you ve no idea what work it has been This year we put in all this new glass in the east conservatory over a thousand panes Such a tremendous business I was just telling mister Spillikins said mister Newberry about the work we had blasting out the motor road You can see the gap where it lies better from here I think Spillikins I must have exploded a ton and a half of dynamite on it By Jove said mister Spillikins it must be dangerous work eh I wonder you aren t afraid of it One simply gets used to it that s all said Newberry shrugging his shoulders but of course it is dangerous I blew up two Italians on the last job He paused a minute and added musingly Hardy fellows the Italians I prefer them to any other people for blasting Did you blow them up yourself asked mister Spillikins I wasn t here answered mister Newberry In fact I never care to be here when I m blasting We go to town But I had to foot the bill for them all the same Quite right too The risk of course was mine not theirs that s the law you know They cost me two thousand each But come said missus Newberry I think we must go and dress for dinner Franklin will be frightfully put out if we re late Franklin is our butler she went on seeing that mister Spillikins didn t understand the reference and as we brought him out from England we have to be rather careful With a good man like Franklin one is always so afraid of losing him and after last night we have to be doubly careful Why last night asked mister Spillikins Oh it wasn t much said missus Newberry In fact it was merely an accident Only it just chanced that at dinner quite late in the meal when we had had nearly everything we dine very simply here mister Spillikins mister Newberry who was thirsty and who wasn t really thinking what he was saying asked Franklin to give him a glass of hock Franklin said at once I m very sorry sir I don t care to serve hock after the entree And of course he was right said Dulphemia with emphasis Exactly he was perfectly right They know you know We were afraid that there might be trouble but mister Newberry went and saw Franklin afterwards and he behaved very well over it But suppose we go and dress It s half past six already and we ve only an hour In this congenial company mister Spillikins spent the next three days Life at Castel Casteggio as the Newberrys loved to explain was conducted on the very simplest plan Early breakfast country fashion at nine o clock after that nothing to eat till lunch unless one cared to have lemonade or bottled ale sent out with a biscuit or a macaroon to the tennis court Lunch itself was a perfectly plain midday meal lasting till about one point thirty and consisting simply of cold meats say four kinds and salads with perhaps a made dish or two and for anybody who cared for it a hot steak or a chop or both After that one had coffee and cigarettes in the shade of the piazza and waited for afternoon tea This latter was served at a wicker table in any part of the grounds that the gardener was not at that moment clipping trimming or otherwise using Afternoon tea being over one rested or walked on the lawn till it was time to dress for dinner This simple routine was broken only by irruptions of people in motors or motor boats from Penny gw rydd or Yodel Dudel Chalet The whole thing from the point of view of mister Spillikins or Dulphemia or Philippa represented rusticity itself To the Little Girl in Green it seemed as brilliant as the Court of Versailles especially evening dinner a plain home meal as the others thought it when she had four glasses to drink out of and used to wonder over such problems as whether you were supposed when Franklin poured out wine to tell him to stop or to wait till he stopped without being told to stop and other similar mysteries such as many people before and after have meditated upon During all this time mister Spillikins was nerving himself to propose to Dulphemia Rasselyer Brown In fact he spent part of his time walking up and down under the trees with Philippa Furlong and discussing with her the proposal that he meant to make together with such topics as marriage in general and his own unworthiness He might have waited indefinitely had he not learned on the third day of his visit that Dulphemia was to go away in the morning to join her father at Nagahakett That evening he found the necessary nerve to speak and the proposal in almost every aspect of it was most successful By Jove Spillikins said to Philippa Furlong next morning in explaining what had happened she was awfully nice about it I think she must have guessed in a way don t you what I was going to say But at any rate she was awfully nice let me say everything I wanted and when I explained what a fool I was she said she didn t think I was half such a fool as people thought me But it s all right It turns out that she isn t thinking of getting married I asked her if I might always go on thinking of her and she said I might And that morning when Dulphemia was carried off in the motor to the station mister Spillikins without exactly being aware how he had done it had somehow transferred himself to Philippa Isn t she a splendid girl he said at least ten times a day to Norah the Little Girl in Green And Norah always agreed because she really thought Philippa a perfectly wonderful creature There is no doubt that but for a slight shift of circumstances mister Spillikins would have proposed to Miss Furlong Indeed he spent a good part of his time rehearsing little speeches that began Of course I know I m an awful ass in a way or Of course I know that I m not at all the sort of fellow and so on But not one of them ever was delivered For it so happened that on the Thursday one week after mister Spillikins s arrival Philippa went again to the station in the motor And when she came back there was another passenger with her a tall young man in tweed and they both began calling out to the Newberrys from a distance of at least a hundred yards And both the Newberrys suddenly exclaimed Why it s Tom and rushed off to meet the motor And there was such a laughing and jubilation as the two descended and carried Tom s valises to the verandah that mister Spillikins felt as suddenly and completely out of it as the Little Girl in Green herself especially as his ear had caught among the first things said the words Congratulate us missus Newberry we re engaged After which mister Spillikins had the pleasure of sitting and listening while it was explained in wicker chairs on the verandah that Philippa and Tom had been engaged already for ever so long in fact nearly two weeks only they had agreed not to say a word to anybody till Tom had gone to North Carolina and back to see his people And as to who Tom was or what was the relation between Tom and the Newberrys mister Spillikins neither knew or cared nor did it interest him in the least that Philippa had met Tom in Bermuda and that she hadn t known that he even knew the Newberry s nor any other of the exuberant disclosures of the moment In fact if there was any one period rather than another when mister Spillikins felt corroborated in his private view of himself it was at this moment So the next day Tom and Philippa vanished together We shall be quite a small party now said missus Newberry in fact quite by ourselves till missus Everleigh comes and she won t be here for a fortnight At which the heart of the Little Girl in Green was glad because she had been afraid that other girls might be coming whereas she knew that missus Everleigh was a widow with four sons and must be ever so old past forty The next few days were spent by mister Spillikins almost entirely in the society of Norah He thought them on the whole rather pleasant days but slow To her they were an uninterrupted dream of happiness never to be forgotten The Newberrys left them to themselves not with any intent it was merely that they were perpetually busy walking about the grounds of Castel Casteggio blowing up things with dynamite throwing steel bridges over gullies and hoisting heavy timber with derricks Nor were they to blame for it For it had not always been theirs to command dynamite and control the forces of nature There had been a time now long ago when the two Newberrys had lived both of them on twenty dollars a week and missus Newberry had made her own dresses and mister Newberry had spent vigorous evenings in making hand made shelves for their sitting room That was long ago and since then mister Newberry like many other people of those earlier days had risen to wealth and Castel Casteggio while others like Norah s father had stayed just where they were So the Newberrys left Peter and Norah to themselves all day Even after dinner in the evening mister Newberry was very apt to call to his wife in the dusk from some distant corner of the lawn Margaret come over here and tell me if you don t think we might cut down this elm tear the stump out by the roots and throw it into the ravine And the answer was One minute Edward just wait till I get a wrap Before they came back the dusk had grown to darkness and they had redynamited half the estate During all of which time mister Spillikins sat with Norah on the piazza He talked and she listened He told her for instance all about his terrific experiences in the oil business and about his exciting career at college or presently they went indoors and Norah played the piano and mister Spillikins sat and smoked and listened In such a house as the Newberry s where dynamite and the greater explosives were everyday matters a little thing like the use of tobacco in the drawing room didn t count As for the music Go right ahead said mister Spillikins I m not musical but I don t mind music a bit In the daytime they played tennis There was a court at one end of the lawn beneath the trees all chequered with sunlight and mingled shadow very beautiful Norah thought though mister Spillikins explained that the spotted light put him off his game In fact it was owing entirely to this bad light that mister Spillikins s fast drives wonderful though they were somehow never got inside the service court Norah of course thought mister Spillikins a wonderful player She was glad in fact it suited them both when he beat her six to nothing She didn t know and didn t care that there was no one else in the world that mister Spillikins could beat like that Once he even said to her By Gad you don t play half a bad game you know I think you know with practice you d come on quite a lot After that the games were understood to be more or less in the form of lessons which put mister Spillikins on a pedestal of superiority and allowed any bad strokes on his part to be viewed as a form of indulgence Also as the tennis was viewed in this light it was Norah s part to pick up the balls at the net and throw them back to mister Spillikins He let her do this not from rudeness for it wasn t in him but because in such a primeval place as Castel Casteggio the natural primitive relation of the sexes is bound to reassert itself But of love mister Spillikins never thought He had viewed it so eagerly and so often from a distance that when it stood here modestly at his very elbow he did not recognize its presence His mind had been fashioned as it were to connect love with something stunning and sensational with Easter hats and harem skirts and the luxurious consciousness of the unattainable Even at that there is no knowing what might have happened Tennis in the chequered light of sun and shadow cast by summer leaves is a dangerous game There came a day when they were standing one each side of the net and mister Spillikins was explaining to Norah the proper way to hold a racquet so as to be able to give those magnificent backhand sweeps of his by which he generally drove the ball halfway to the lake and explaining this involved putting his hand right over Norah s on the handle of the racquet so that for just half a second her hand was clasped tight in his and if that half second had been lengthened out into a whole second it is quite possible that what was already subconscious in his mind would have broken its way triumphantly to the surface and Norah s hand would have stayed in his how willingly for the rest of their two lives But just at that moment mister Spillikins looked up and he said in quite an altered tone By Jove who s that awfully good looking woman getting out of the motor And their hands unclasped Norah looked over towards the house and said Why it s missus Everleigh I thought she wasn t coming for another week I say said mister Spillikins straining his short sight to the uttermost what perfectly wonderful golden hair eh Why it s Norah began and then she stopped It didn t seem right to explain that missus Everleigh s hair was dyed And who s that tall chap standing beside her said mister Spillikins I think it s Captain Cormorant but I don t think he s going to stay He s only brought her up in the motor from town By Jove how good of him said Spillikins and this sentiment in regard to Captain Cormorant though he didn t know it was to become a keynote of his existence I didn t know she was coming so soon said Norah and there was weariness already in her heart Certainly she didn t know it still less did she know or anyone else that the reason of missus Everleigh s coming was because mister Spillikins was there She came with a set purpose and she sent Captain Cormorant directly back in the motor because she didn t want him on the premises Oughtn t we to go up to the house said Norah All right said mister Spillikins with great alacrity let s go Now as this story began with the information that missus Everleigh is at present missus Everleigh Spillikins there is no need to pursue in detail the stages of mister Spillikins s wooing Its course was swift and happy mister Spillikins having seen the back of missus Everleigh s head had decided instantly that she was the most beautiful woman in the world and that impression is not easily corrected in the half light of a shaded drawing room nor across a dinner table lighted only with candles with deep red shades nor even in the daytime through a veil In any case it is only fair to state that if missus Everleigh was not and is not a singularly beautiful woman mister Spillikins still doesn t know it And in point of attraction the homage of such experts as Captain Cormorant and Lieutenant Hawk speaks for itself So the course of mister Spillikins s love for love it must have been ran swiftly to its goal Each stage of it was duly marked by his comments to Norah She is a splendid woman he said so sympathetic She always seems to know just what one s going to say So she did for she was making him say it By Jove he said a day later missus Everleigh s an awfully fine woman isn t she I was telling her about my having been in the oil business for a little while and she thinks that I d really be awfully good in money things She said she wished she had me to manage her money for her This also was quite true except that missus Everleigh had not made it quite clear that the management of her money was of the form generally known as deficit financing In fact her money was very crudely stated nonexistent and it needed a lot of management A day or two later mister Spillikins was saying I think missus Everleigh must have had great sorrow don t you Yesterday she was showing me a photograph of her little boy she has a little boy you know Yes I know said Norah She didn t add that she knew that missus Everleigh had four and she was saying how awfully rough it is having him always away from her at doctor Something s academy where he is And very soon after that mister Spillikins was saying with quite a quaver in his voice By Jove yes I m awfully lucky I never thought for a moment that she d have me you know a woman like her with so much attention and everything I can t imagine what she sees in me Which was just as well And then mister Spillikins checked himself for he noticed this was on the verandah in the morning that Norah had a hat and jacket on and that the motor was rolling towards the door I say he said are you going away Yes didn t you know Norah said I thought you heard them speaking of it at dinner last night I have to go home father s alone you know Oh I m awfully sorry said mister Spillikins we shan t have any more tennis Goodbye said Norah and as she said it and put out her hand there were tears brimming up into her eyes But mister Spillikins being short of sight didn t see them Goodbye he said Then as the motor carried her away he stood for a moment in a sort of reverie Perhaps certain things that might have been rose unformed and inarticulate before his mind And then a voice called from the drawing room within in a measured and assured tone Peter darling where are you Coming cried mister Spillikins and he came On the second day of the engagement missus Everleigh showed to Peter a little photograph in a brooch This is Gib my second little boy she said mister Spillikins started to say I didn t know and then checked himself and said By Gad what a fine looking little chap eh I m awfully fond of boys Dear little fellow isn t he said missus Everleigh He s really rather taller than that now because this picture was taken a little while ago And the next day she said This is Willie my third boy and on the day after that she said This is Sib my youngest boy I m sure you ll love him I m sure I shall said mister Spillikins He loved him already for being the youngest And so in the fulness of time nor was it so very full either in fact only about five weeks Peter Spillikins and missus Everleigh were married in saint Asaph s Church on Plutoria Avenue And the wedding was one of the most beautiful and sumptuous of the weddings of the September season There were flowers and bridesmaids in long veils and tall ushers in frock coats and awnings at the church door and strings of motors with wedding favours on imported chauffeurs and all that goes to invest marriage on Plutoria Avenue with its peculiar sacredness The face of the young rector mister Fareforth Furlong wore the added saintliness that springs from a five hundred dollar fee The whole town was there or at least everybody that was anybody and if there was one person absent one who sat by herself in the darkened drawing room of a dull little house on a shabby street who knew or cared So after the ceremony the happy couple for were they not so left for New York There they spent their honeymoon They had thought of going it was mister Spillikins s idea to the coast of Maine But missus Everleigh Spillikins said that New York was much nicer so restful whereas as everyone knows the coast of Maine is frightfully noisy Moreover it so happened that before the Everleigh Spillikinses had been more than four or five days in New York the ship of Captain Cormorant dropped anchor in the Hudson and when the anchor of that ship was once down it generally stayed there So the captain was able to take the Everleigh Spillikinses about in New York and to give a tea for missus Everleigh Spillikins on the deck of his vessel so that she might meet the officers and another tea in a private room of a restaurant on Fifth Avenue so that she might meet no one but himself And at this tea Captain Cormorant said among other things Did he kick up rough at all when you told him about the money And missus Everleigh now missus Everleigh Spillikins said Not he I think he is actually pleased to know that I haven t any Do you know Arthur he s really an awfully good fellow and as she said it she moved her hand away from under Captain Cormorant s on the tea table I say said the Captain don t get sentimental over him So that is how it is that the Everleigh Spillikinses came to reside on Plutoria Avenue in a beautiful stone house with a billiard room in an extension on the second floor Through the windows of it one can almost hear the click of the billiard balls and a voice saying Hold on father you had your shot CHAPTER SIX The Rival Churches of saint Asaph and saint Osoph The church of saint Asaph more properly call saint Asaph s in the Fields stands among the elm trees of Plutoria Avenue opposite the university its tall spire pointing to the blue sky Its rector is fond of saying that it seems to him to point as it were a warning against the sins of a commercial age More particularly does he say this in his Lenten services at noonday when the businessmen sit in front of him in rows their bald heads uncovered and their faces stamped with contrition as they think of mergers that they should have made and real estate that they failed to buy for lack of faith The ground on which saint Asaph s stands is worth seven dollars and a half a foot The mortgagees as they kneel in prayer in their long frock coats feel that they have built upon a rock It is a beautifully appointed church There are windows with priceless stained glass that were imported from Normandy the rector himself swearing out the invoices to save the congregation the grievous burden of the customs duty There is a pipe organ in the transept that cost ten thousand dollars to install The debenture holders as they join in the morning anthem love to hear the dulcet notes of the great organ and to reflect that it is as good as new Just behind the church is saint Asaph s Sunday School with a ten thousand dollar mortgage of its own And below that again on the side street is the building of the Young Men s Guild with a bowling alley and a swimming bath deep enough to drown two young men at a time and a billiard room with seven tables It is the rector s boast that with a Guild House such as that there is no need for any young man of the congregation to frequent a saloon Nor is there And on Sunday mornings when the great organ plays and the mortgagees and the bond holders and the debenture holders and the Sunday school teachers and the billiard markers all lift up their voices together there is emitted from saint Asaph s a volume of praise that is practically as fine and effective as paid professional work saint Asaph s is episcopal As a consequence it has in it and about it all those things which go to make up the episcopal church brass tablets let into its walls blackbirds singing in its elm trees parishioners who dine at eight o clock and a rector who wears a little crucifix and dances the tango On the other hand there stands upon the same street not a hundred yards away the rival church of saint Osoph presbyterian down to its very foundations in bed rock thirty feet below the level of the avenue It has a short squat tower and a low roof and its narrow windows are glazed with frosted glass It has dark spruce trees instead of elms crows instead of blackbirds and a gloomy minister with a shovel hat who lectures on philosophy on week days at the university He loves to think that his congregation are made of the lowly and the meek in spirit and to reflect that lowly and meek as they are there are men among them that could buy out half the congregation of saint Asaph s saint Osoph s is only presbyterian in a special sense It is in fact too presbyterian to be any longer connected with any other body whatsoever It seceded some forty years ago from the original body to which it belonged and later on with three other churches it seceded from the group of seceding congregations Still later it fell into a difference with the three other churches on the question of eternal punishment the word eternal not appearing to the elders of saint Osoph s to designate a sufficiently long period The dispute ended in a secession which left the church of saint Osoph practically isolated in a world of sin whose approaching fate it neither denied nor deplored In one respect the rival churches of Plutoria Avenue had had a similar history Each of them had moved up by successive stages from the lower and poorer parts of the city Forty years ago saint Asaph s had been nothing more than a little frame church with a tin spire away in the west of the slums and saint Osoph s a square diminutive building away in the east But the site of saint Asaph s had been bought by a brewing company and the trustees shrewd men of business themselves rising into wealth had rebuilt it right in the track of the advancing tide of a real estate boom The elders of saint Osoph quiet men but illumined by an inner light had followed suit and moved their church right against the side of an expanding distillery Thus both the churches as decade followed decade made their way up the slope of the City till saint Asaph s was presently gloriously expropriated by the street railway company and planted its spire in triumph on Plutoria Avenue itself But saint Osoph s followed With each change of site it moved nearer and nearer to saint Asaph s Its elders were shrewd men With each move of their church they took careful thought in the rebuilding In the manufacturing district it was built with sixteen windows on each side and was converted at a huge profit into a bicycle factory On the residential street it was made long and deep and was sold to a moving picture company without the alteration of so much as a pew As a last step a syndicate formed among the members of the congregation themselves bought ground on Plutoria Avenue and sublet it to themselves as a site for the church at a nominal interest of five per cent per annum payable nominally every three months and secured by a nominal mortgage As the two churches moved their congregations or at least all that was best of them such members as were sharing in the rising fortunes of the City moved also and now for some six or seven years the two churches and the two congregations had confronted one another among the elm trees of the Avenue opposite to the university But at this point the fortunes of the churches had diverged saint Asaph s was a brilliant success saint Osoph s was a failure Even its own trustees couldn t deny it At a time when saint Asaph s was not only paying its interest but showing a handsome surplus on everything it undertook the church of saint Osoph was moving steadily backwards There was no doubt of course as to the cause Everybody knew it It was simply a question of men and as everybody said one had only to compare the two men conducting the churches to see why one succeeded and the other failed The Reverend Edward Fareforth Furlong of saint Asaph s was a man who threw his whole energy into his parish work The subtleties of theological controversy he left to minds less active than his own His creed was one of works rather than of words and whatever he was doing he did it with his whole heart Whether he was lunching at the Mausoleum Club with one of his church wardens or playing the flute which he played as only the episcopal clergy can play it accompanied on the harp by one of the fairest of the ladies of his choir or whether he was dancing the new episcopal tango with the younger daughters of the elder parishioners he threw himself into it with all his might He could drink tea more gracefully and play tennis better than any clergyman on this side of the Atlantic He could stand beside the white stone font of saint Asaph s in his long white surplice holding a white robed infant worth half a million dollars looking as beautifully innocent as the child itself and drawing from every matron of the congregation with unmarried daughters the despairing cry What a pity that he has no children of his own Equally sound was his theology No man was known to preach shorter sermons or to explain away the book of Genesis more agreeably than the rector of saint Asaph s and if he found it necessary to refer to the Deity he did so under the name of Jehovah or Jah or even Yaweh in a manner calculated not to hurt the sensitiveness of any of the parishioners People who would shudder at brutal talk of the older fashion about the wrath of God listened with well bred interest to a sermon on the personal characteristics of Jah In the same way mister Furlong always referred to the devil not as Satan but as Su or Swa which took all the sting out of him Beelzebub he spoke of as Behel Zawbab which rendered him perfectly harmless The Garden of Eden he spoke of as the Paradeisos which explained it entirely the flood as the Diluvium which cleared it up completely and Jonah he named after the correct fashion Jon Nah which put the whole situation his being swallowed by Baloo or the Great Lizard on a perfectly satisfactory footing Hell itself was spoken of as She ol and it appeared that it was not a place of burning but rather of what one might describe as moral torment This settled She ol once and for all nobody minds moral torment In short there was nothing in the theological system of mister Furlong that need have occasioned in any of his congregation a moment s discomfort There could be no greater contrast with mister Fareforth Furlong than the minister of saint Osoph s the reverend doctor McTeague who was also honorary professor of philosophy at the university The one was young the other was old the one could dance the other could not the one moved about at church picnics and lawn teas among a bevy of disciples in pink and blue sashes the other moped around under the trees of the university campus with blinking eyes that saw nothing and an abstracted mind that had spent fifty years in trying to reconcile Hegel with saint Paul and was still busy with it mister Furlong went forward with the times doctor McTeague slid quietly backwards with the centuries doctor McTeague was a failure and all his congregation knew it He is not up to date they said That was his crowning sin He don t go forward any said the business members of the congregation That old man believes just exactly the same sort of stuff now that he did forty years ago What s more he preaches it You can t run a church that way can you His trustees had done their best to meet the difficulty They had offered doctor McTeague a two years vacation to go and see the Holy Land He refused he said he could picture it They reduced his salary by fifty per cent he never noticed it They offered him an assistant but he shook his head saying that he didn t know where he could find a man to do just the work that he was doing Meantime he mooned about among the trees concocting a mixture of saint Paul with Hegel three parts to one for his Sunday sermon and one part to three for his Monday lecture No doubt it was his dual function that was to blame for his failure And this perhaps was the fault of doctor Boomer the president of the university doctor Boomer like all university presidents of today belonged to the presbyterian church or rather to state it more correctly he included presbyterianism within himself He was of course a member of the board of management of saint Osoph s and it was he who had urged very strongly the appointment of doctor McTeague then senior professor of philosophy as minister A saintly man he said the very man for the post If you should ask me whether he is entirely at home as a professor of philosophy on our staff at the university I should be compelled to say no We are forced to admit that as a lecturer he does not meet our views He appears to find it difficult to keep religion out of his teaching In fact his lectures are suffused with a rather dangerous attempt at moral teaching which is apt to contaminate our students But in the Church I should imagine that would be if anything an advantage Indeed if you were to come to me and say Boomer we wish to appoint doctor McTeague as our minister I should say quite frankly Take him So doctor McTeague had been appointed Then to the surprise of everybody he refused to give up his lectures in philosophy He said he felt a call to give them The salary he said was of no consequence He wrote to mister Furlong senior the father of the episcopal rector and honorary treasurer of the Plutoria University and stated that he proposed to give his lectures for nothing The trustees of the college protested they urged that the case might set a dangerous precedent which other professors might follow While fully admitting that doctor McTeague s lectures were well worth giving for nothing they begged him to reconsider his offer But he refused and from that day on in spite of all offers that he should retire on double his salary that he should visit the Holy Land or Syria or Armenia where the dreadful massacres of Christians were taking place doctor McTeague clung to his post with a tenacity worthy of the best traditions of Scotland His only internal perplexity was that he didn t see how when the time came for him to die twenty or thirty years hence they would ever be able to replace him Such was the situation of the two churches on a certain beautiful morning in June when an unforeseen event altered entirely the current of their fortunes No thank you Juliana said the young rector to his sister across the breakfast table and there was something as near to bitterness in his look as his saintly smooth shaven face was capable of reflecting no thank you no more porridge Prunes no no thank you I don t think I care for any And by the way he added don t bother to keep any lunch for me I have a great deal of business that is of work in the parish to see to and I must just find time to get a bite of something to eat when and where I can In his own mind he was resolving that the place should be the Mausoleum Club and the time just as soon as the head waiter would serve him After which the Reverend Edward Fareforth Furlong bowed his head for a moment in a short silent blessing the one prescribed by the episcopal church in America for a breakfast of porridge and prunes It was their first breakfast together and it spoke volumes to the rector He knew what it implied It stood for his elder sister Juliana s views on the need of personal sacrifice as a means of grace The rector sighed as he rose He had never missed his younger sister Philippa now married and departed so keenly Philippa had had opinions of her own on bacon and eggs and on lamb chops with watercress as a means of stimulating the soul But Juliana was different The rector understood now exactly why it was that his father had exclaimed on the news of Philippa s engagement without a second s hesitation Then of course Juliana must live with you Nonsense my dear boy nonsense It s my duty to spare her to you After all I can always eat at the club they can give me a bite of something or other surely To a man of my age Edward food is really of no consequence No no Juliana must move into the rectory at once The rector s elder sister rose She looked tall and sallow and forbidding in the plain black dress that contrasted sadly with the charming clerical costumes of white and pink and the broad episcopal hats with flowers in them that Philippa used to wear for morning work in the parish For what time shall I order dinner she asked You and Philippa used to have it at half past seven did you not Don t you think that rather too late A trifle perhaps said the rector uneasily He didn t care to explain to Juliana that it was impossible to get home any earlier from the kind of the dansant that everybody was giving just now But don t trouble about dinner I may be working very late If I need anything to eat I shall get a biscuit and some tea at the Guild Rooms or He didn t finish the sentence but in his mind he added or else a really first class dinner at the Mausoleum Club or at the Newberrys or the Rasselyer Browns anywhere except here If you are going then said Juliana may I have the key of the church A look of pain passed over the rector s face He knew perfectly well what Juliana wanted the key for She meant to go into his church and pray in it The rector of saint Asaph s was he trusted as broad minded a man as an Anglican clergyman ought to be He had no objection to any reasonable use of his church for a thanksgiving festival or for musical recitals for example but when it came to opening up the church and using it to pray in the thing was going a little too far What was more he had an idea from the look on Juliana s face that she meant to pray for him This for a clergy man was hard to bear Philippa like the good girl that she was had prayed only for herself and then only at the proper times and places and in a proper praying costume The rector began to realize what difficulties it might make for a clergyman to have a religious sister as his house mate But he was never a man for unseemly argument It is hanging in my study he said And with that the reverend Fareforth Furlong passed into the hall took up the simple silk hat the stick and gloves of the working clergyman and walked out on to the avenue to begin his day s work in the parish The rector s parish viewed in its earthly aspect was a singularly beautiful place For it extended all along Plutoria Avenue where the street is widest and the elm trees are at their leafiest and the motors at their very drowsiest It lay up and down the shaded side streets of the residential district darkened with great chestnuts and hushed in a stillness that was almost religion itself There was not a house in the parish assessed at less than twenty five thousand and in very heart of it the Mausoleum Club with its smooth white stone and its Grecian architecture carried one back to the ancient world and made one think of Athens and of Paul preaching on Mars Hill It was all considered a splendid thing to fight sin in such a parish and to keep it out of it For kept out it was One might look the length and breadth of the broad avenue and see no sign of sin all along it There was certainly none in the smooth faces of the chauffeurs trundling their drowsy motors no sign of it in the expensive children paraded by imported nursemaids in the chequered light of the shaded street least of all was there any sign of it in the Stock Exchange members of the congregation as they walked along side by side to their lunch at the Mausoleum Club their silk hats nodding together in earnest colloquy on Shares Preferred and Profits Undivided So might have walked so must have walked the very Fathers of the Church themselves Whatever sin there was in the City was shoved sideways into the roaring streets of commerce where the elevated railway ran and below that again into the slums Here there must have been any quantity of sin The rector of saint Asaph s was certain of it Many of the richer of his parishioners had been down in parties late at night to look at it and the ladies of his congregation were joined together into all sorts of guilds and societies and bands of endeavour for stamping it out and driving it under or putting it into jail till it surrendered But the slums lay outside the rector s parish He had no right to interfere They were under the charge of a special mission or auxiliary a remnant of the saint Asaph s of the past placed under the care of a divinity student at four hundred dollars per annum His charge included all the slums and three police courts and two music halls and the City jail One Sunday afternoon in every three months the rector and several ladies went down and sang hymns for him in his mission house But his work was really very easy A funeral for example at the mission was a simple affair meaning nothing more than the preparation of a plain coffin and a glassless hearse and the distribution of a few artificial everlasting flowers to women crying in their aprons a thing easily done whereas in saint Asaph s parish where all the really important souls were a funeral was a large event requiring taste and tact and a nice shading of delicacy in distinguishing mourners from beneficiaries and private grief from business representation at the ceremony A funeral with a plain coffin and a hearse was as nothing beside an interment with a casket smothered in hot house syringas borne in a coach and followed by special reporters from the financial papers It appeared to the rector afterwards as almost a shocking coincidence that the first person whom he met upon the avenue should have been the reverend doctor McTeague himself mister Furlong gave him the form of amiable good morning that the episcopal church always extends to those in error But he did not hear it The minister s head was bent low his eyes gazed into vacancy and from the movements of his lips and from the fact that he carried a leather case of notes he was plainly on his way to his philosophical lecture But the rector had no time to muse upon the abstracted appearance of his rival For as always happened to him he was no sooner upon the street than his parish work of the day began In fact he had hardly taken a dozen steps after passing doctor McTeague when he was brought up standing by two beautiful parishioners with pink parasols Oh mister Furlong exclaimed one of them so fortunate to happen to catch you we were just going into the rectory to consult you Should the girls for the lawn tea for the Guild on Friday you know wear white dresses with light blue sashes all the same or do you think we might allow them to wear any coloured sashes that they like What do you think This was an important problem In fact there was a piece of parish work here that it took the Reverend Fareforth half an hour to attend to standing the while in earnest colloquy with the two ladies under the shadow of the elm trees But a clergyman must never be grudging of his time Goodbye then they said at last Are you coming to the Browning Club this morning Oh so sorry but we shall see you at the musicale this afternoon shall we not Oh I trust so said the rector How dreadfully hard he works said the ladies to one another as they moved away Thus slowly and with many interruptions the rector made his progress along the avenue At times he stopped to permit a pink cheeked infant in a perambulator to beat him with a rattle while he inquired its age of an episcopal nurse gay with flowing ribbons He lifted his hat to the bright parasols of his parishioners passing in glistening motors bowed to episcopalians nodded amiably to presbyterians and even acknowledged with his lifted hat the passing of persons of graver forms of error Thus he took his way along the avenue and down a side street towards the business district of the City until just at the edge of it where the trees were about to stop and the shops were about to begin he found himself at the door of the Hymnal Supply Corporation Limited The premises as seen from the outside combined the idea of an office with an ecclesiastical appearance The door was as that of a chancel or vestry there was a large plate glass window filled with Bibles and Testaments all spread open and showing every variety of language in their pages These were marked Arabic Syriac Coptic Ojibway Irish and so forth On the window in small white lettering were the words HYMNAL SUPPLY CORPORATION and below that HOSANNA PIPE AND STEAM ORGAN INCORPORATED and Still lower the legend BIBLE SOCIETY OF THE GOOD SHEPHERD LIMITED There was no doubt of the sacred character of the place Here laboured mister Furlong senior the father of the reverend Edward Fareforth He was a man of many activities president and managing director of the companies just mentioned trustee and secretary of saint Asaph s honorary treasurer of the university et cetera and each of his occupations and offices was marked by something of a supramundane character something higher than ordinary business His different official positions naturally overlapped and brought him into contact with himself from a variety of angles Thus he sold himself hymn books at a price per thousand made as a business favour to himself negotiated with himself the purchase of the ten thousand dollar organ making a price on it to himself that he begged himself to regard as confidential and as treasurer of the college he sent himself an informal note of enquiry asking if he knew of any sound investment for the annual deficit of the college funds a matter of some sixty thousand dollars a year which needed very careful handling Any man and there are many such who has been concerned with business dealings of this sort with himself realizes that they are more satisfactory than any other kind To what better person then could the rector of saint Asaph s bring the quarterly accounts and statements of his church than to mister Furlong senior The outer door was opened to the rector by a sanctified boy with such a face as is only found in the choirs of the episcopal church In an outer office through which the rector passed were two sacred stenographers with hair as golden as the daffodils of Sheba copying confidential letters on absolutely noiseless typewriters They were making offers of Bibles in half car load lots at two and a half per cent reduction offering to reduce saint Mark by two cents on condition of immediate export and to lay down saint John f o b San Francisco for seven cents while regretting that they could deliver fifteen thousand Rock of Ages in Missouri on no other terms than cash The sacred character of their work lent them a preoccupation beautiful to behold In the room beyond them was a white haired confidential clerk venerable as the Song of Solomon and by him mister Fareforth Furlong was duly shown into the office of his father Good morning Edward said mister Furlong senior as he shook hands I was expecting you And while I 
3982_182255_000024_000004	train-clean-100	think of it 
none	none	I have just had a letter from Philippa She and Tom will be home in two or three weeks She writes from Egypt She wishes me to tell you as no doubt you have already anticipated that she thinks she can hardly continue to be a member of the congregation when they come back No doubt you felt this yourself Oh entirely said the rector Surely in matters of belief a wife must follow her husband Exactly especially as Tom s uncles occupy the position they do with regard to mister Furlong jerked his head backwards and pointed with his thumb over his shoulder in a way that his son knew was meant to indicate saint Osoph s Church The Overend brothers who were Tom s uncles his name being Tom Overend were as everybody knew among the principal supporters of saint Osoph s Not that they were by origin presbyterians But they were self made men which put them once and for all out of sympathy with such a place as saint Asaph s We made ourselves the two brothers used to repeat in defiance of the catechism of the Anglican Church They never wearied of explaining how mister Dick the senior brother had worked overtime by day to send mister George the junior brother to school by night and how mister George had then worked overtime by night to send mister Dick to school by day Thus they had come up the business ladder hand over hand landing later on in life on the platform of success like two corpulent acrobats panting with the strain of it For years mister George would explain we had father and mother to keep as well then they died and Dick and me saw daylight By which he meant no harm at all but only stated a fact and concealed the virtue of it And being self made men they made it a point to do what they could to lessen the importance of such an institution as saint Asaph s Church By the same contrariety of nature the two Overend brothers their business name was Overend Brothers Limited were supporters of the dissentient Young Men s Guild and the second or rival University Settlement and of anything or everything that showed a likelihood of making trouble On this principle they were warm supporters and friends of the reverend doctor McTeague The minister had even gone so far as to present to the brothers a copy of his philosophical work McTeague s Exposition of the Kantian Hypothesis and the two brothers had read it through in the office devoting each of them a whole morning to it mister Dick the senior brother had said that he had never seen anything like it and mister George the junior had declared that a man who could write that was capable of anything On the whole it was evident that the relations between the Overend family and the presbyterian religion were too intimate to allow missus Tom Overend formerly Miss Philippa Furlong to sit anywhere else of a Sunday than under doctor McTeague Philippa writes continued mister Furlong that under the circumstances she and Tom would like to do something for your church She would like yes I have the letter here to give you as a surprise of course either a new font or a carved pulpit or perhaps a cheque she wishes me on no account to mention it to you directly but to ascertain indirectly from you what would be the better surprise Oh a cheque I think said the rector one can do so much more with it after all Precisely said his father he was well aware of many things that can be done with a cheque that cannot possibly be done with a font That s settled then resumed mister Furlong and now I suppose you want me to run my eye over your quarterly statements do you not before we send them in to the trustees That is what you ve come for is it not Yes said the rector drawing a bundle of blue and white papers from his pocket I have everything with me Our showing is I believe excellent though I fear I fail to present it as clearly as it might be done mister Furlong senior spread the papers on the table before him and adjusted his spectacles to a more convenient angle He smiled indulgently as he looked at the documents before him I am afraid you would never make an accountant Edward he said I fear not said the rector Your items said his father are entered wrongly Here for example in the general statement you put down Distribution of Coals to the Poor to your credit In the same way Bibles and Prizes to the Sunday School you again mark to your credit Why Don t you see my boy that these things are debits When you give out Bibles or distribute fuel to the poor you give out something for which you get no return It is a debit On the other hand such items as Church Offertory Scholars Pennies et cetera are pure profit Surely the principle is clear I think I see it better now said the reverend Edward Perfectly plain isn t it his father went on And here again Paupers Burial Fund a loss enter it as such Christmas Gift to Verger and Sexton an absolute loss you get nothing in return Widows Mite Fines inflicted in Sunday School et cetera these are profit write them down as such By this method you see in ordinary business we can tell exactly where we stand anything which we give out without return or reward we count as a debit all that we take from others without giving in return we count as so much to our credit Ah yes murmured the rector I begin to understand Very good But after all Edward I mustn t quarrel with the mere form of your accounts the statement is really a splendid showing I see that not only is our mortgage and debenture interest all paid to date but that a number of our enterprises are making a handsome return I notice for example that the Girls Friendly Society of the church not only pays for itself but that you are able to take something out of its funds and transfer it to the Men s Book Club Excellent And I observe that you have been able to take a large portion of the Soup Kitchen Fund and put it into the Rector s Picnic Account Very good indeed In this respect your figures are a model for church accounts anywhere mister Furlong continued his scrutiny of the accounts Excellent he murmured and on the whole an annual surplus I see of several thousands But stop a bit he continued checking himself what s this Are you aware Edward that you are losing money on your Foreign Missions Account I feared as much said Edward It s incontestable Look at the figures for yourself missionary s salary so much clothes and books to converts so much voluntary and other offerings of converts so much why you re losing on it Edward exclaimed mister Furlong and he shook his head dubiously at the accounts before him I thought protested his son that in view of the character of the work itself Quite so answered his father quite so I fully admit the force of that I am only asking you is it worth it Mind you I am not speaking now as a Christian but as a businessman Is it worth it I thought that perhaps in view of the fact of our large surplus in other directions Exactly said his father a heavy surplus It is precisely on that point that I wished to speak to you this morning You have at present a large annual surplus and there is every prospect under Providence in fact I think in any case of it continuing for years to come If I may speak very frankly I should say that as long as our reverend friend doctor McTeague continues in his charge of saint Osoph s and I trust that he may be spared for many years to come you are likely to enjoy the present prosperity of your church Very good The question arises what disposition are we to make of our accumulating funds Yes said the rector hesitating I am speaking to you now said his father not as the secretary of your church but as president of the Hymnal Supply Company which I represent here Now please understand Edward I don t want in any way to force or control your judgment I merely wish to show you certain shall I say certain opportunities that present themselves for the disposal of our funds The matter can be taken up later formally by yourself and the trustees of the church As a matter of fact I have already written to myself as secretary in the matter and I have received what I consider a quite encouraging answer Let me explain what I propose mister Furlong senior rose and opening the door of the office Everett he said to the ancient clerk kindly give me a Bible It was given to him mister Furlong stood with the Bible poised in his hand Now we he went on I mean the Hymnal Supply Corporation have an idea for bringing out an entirely new Bible A look of dismay appeared on the saintly face of the rector A new Bible he gasped Precisely said his father a new Bible This one and we find it every day in our business is all wrong All wrong said the rector with horror in his face My dear boy exclaimed his father pray pray do not misunderstand me Don t imagine for a moment that I mean wrong in a religious sense Such a thought could never I hope enter my mind All that I mean is that this Bible is badly made up Badly made up repeated his son as mystified as ever I see that you do not understand me What I mean is this Let me try to make myself quite clear For the market of today this Bible and he poised it again on his hand as if to test its weight is too heavy The people of today want something lighter something easier to get hold of Now if But what mister Furlong was about to say was lost forever to the world For just at this juncture something occurred calculated to divert not only mister Furlong s sentence but the fortunes and the surplus of saint Asaph s itself At the very moment when mister Furlong was speaking a newspaper delivery man in the street outside handed to the sanctified boy the office copy of the noonday paper And the boy had no sooner looked at its headlines than he said How dreadful Being sanctified he had no stronger form of speech than that But he handed the paper forthwith to one of the stenographers with hair like the daffodils of Sheba and when she looked at it she exclaimed How awful And she knocked at once at the door of the ancient clerk and gave the paper to him and when he looked at it and saw the headline the ancient clerk murmured Ah in the gentle tone in which very old people greet the news of catastrophe or sudden death But in his turn he opened mister Furlong s door and put down the paper laying his finger on the column for a moment without a word mister Furlong stopped short in his sentence Dear me he said as his eyes caught the item of news How very dreadful What is it said the rector doctor McTeague answered his father He has been stricken with paralysis How shocking said the rector aghast But when I saw him only this morning It has just happened said his father following down the column of the newspaper as he spoke this morning at the university in his classroom at a lecture Dear me how dreadful I must go and see the president at once mister Furlong was about to reach for his hat and stick when at that moment the aged clerk knocked at the door doctor Boomer he announced in a tone of solemnity suited to the occasion doctor Boomer entered shook hands in silence and sat down You have heard our sad news I suppose he said He used the word our as between the university president and his honorary treasurer How did it happen asked mister Furlong Most distressing said the president doctor McTeague it seems had just entered his ten o clock class the hour was about ten twenty and was about to open his lecture when one of his students rose in his seat and asked a question It is a practice continued doctor Boomer which I need hardly say we do not encourage the young man I believe was a newcomer in the philosophy class At any rate he asked doctor McTeague quite suddenly it appears how he could reconcile his theory of transcendental immaterialism with a scheme of rigid moral determinism doctor McTeague stared for a moment his mouth so the class assert painfully open The student repeated the question and poor McTeague fell forward over his desk paralysed Is he dead gasped mister Furlong No said the president But we expect his death at any moment doctor Slyder I may say is with him now and is doing all he can In any case I suppose he could hardly recover enough to continue his college duties said the young rector Out of the question said the president I should not like to state that of itself mere paralysis need incapacitate a professor doctor Thrum our professor of the theory of music is as you know paralysed in his ears and mister Slant our professor of optics is paralysed in his right eye But this is a case of paralysis of the brain I fear it is incompatible with professorial work Then I suppose said mister Furlong senior we shall have to think of the question of a successor They had both been thinking of it for at least three minutes We must said the president For the moment I feel too stunned by the sad news to act I have merely telegraphed to two or three leading colleges for a locum tenens and sent out a few advertisements announcing the chair as vacant But it will be difficult to replace McTeague He was a man added doctor Boomer rehearsing in advance unconsciously no doubt his forthcoming oration over doctor McTeague s death of a singular grasp a breadth of culture and he was able as few men are to instil what I might call a spirit of religion into his teaching His lectures indeed were suffused with moral instruction and exercised over his students an influence second only to that of the pulpit itself He paused Ah yes the pulpit said mister Furlong there indeed you will miss him That said doctor Boomer very reverently is our real loss deep irreparable I suppose indeed I am certain we shall never again see such a man in the pulpit of saint Osoph s Which reminds me he added more briskly I must ask the newspaper people to let it be known that there will be service as usual the day after tomorrow and that doctor McTeague s death will of course make no difference that is to say I must see the newspaper people at once That afternoon all the newspaper editors in the City were busy getting their obituary notices ready for the demise of doctor McTeague The death of doctor McTeague wrote the editor of the Commercial and Financial Undertone a paper which had almost openly advocated the minister s dismissal for five years back comes upon us as an irreparable loss His place will be difficult nay impossible to fill Whether as a philosopher or a divine he cannot be replaced We have no hesitation in saying so wrote the editor of the Plutorian Times a three cent morning paper which was able to take a broad or three cent point of view of men and things that the loss of doctor McTeague will be just as much felt in Europe as in America To Germany the news that the hand that penned McTeague s Shorter Exposition of the Kantian Hypothesis has ceased to write will come with the shock of poignant anguish while to France The editor left the article unfinished at that point After all he was a ready writer and he reflected that there would be time enough before actually going to press to consider from what particular angle the blow of McTeague s death would strike down the people of France So ran in speech and in writing during two or three days the requiem of doctor McTeague Altogether there were more kind things said of him in the three days during which he was taken for dead than in thirty years of his life which seemed a pity And after it all at the close of the third day doctor McTeague feebly opened his eyes But when he opened them the world had already passed on and left him behind CHAPTER SEVEN The Ministrations of the reverend Uttermust Dumfarthing Well then gentlemen I think we have all agreed upon our man mister Dick Overend looked around the table as he spoke at the managing trustees of saint Osoph s church They were assembled in an upper committee room of the Mausoleum Club Their official place of meeting was in a board room off the vestry of the church But they had felt a draught in it some four years ago which had wafted them over to the club as their place of assembly In the club there were no draughts mister Dick Overend sat at the head of the table his brother George beside him and doctor Boomer at the foot Beside them were mister Boulder mister Skinyer of Skinyer and Beatem and the rest of the trustees You are agreed then on the Reverend Uttermust Dumfarthing Quite agreed murmured several trustees together A most remarkable man said doctor Boomer I heard him preach in his present church He gave utterance to thoughts that I have myself been thinking for years I never listened to anything so sound or so scholarly I heard him the night he preached in New York said mister Boulder He preached a sermon to the poor He told them they were no good I never heard outside of a Scotch pulpit such splendid invective Is he Scotch said one of the trustees Of Scotch parentage said the university president I believe he is one of the Dumfarthings of Dunfermline Dumfries Everybody said Oh and there was a pause Is he married asked one of the trustees I understand answered doctor Boomer that he is a widower with one child a little girl Does he make any conditions None whatever said the chairman consulting a letter before him except that he is to have absolute control and in regard to salary These two points settled he says he places himself entirely in our hands And the salary asked someone Ten thousand dollars said the chairman payable quarterly in advance A chorus of approval went round the table Good Excellent A first class man muttered the trustees just what we want I am sure gentlemen said mister Dick Overend voicing the sentiments of everybody we do not want a cheap man Several of the candidates whose names have been under consideration here have been in many respects in point of religious qualification let us say most desirable men The name of doctor McSkwirt for example has been mentioned with great favour by several of the trustees But he s a cheap man I feel we don t want him What is mister Dumfarthing getting where he is asked mister Boulder Nine thousand nine hundred said the chairman And doctor McSkwirt Fourteen hundred dollars Well that settles it exclaimed everybody with a burst of enlightenment And so it was settled In fact nothing could have been plainer I suppose said mister George Overend as they were about to rise that we are quite justified in taking it for granted that doctor McTeague will never be able to resume work Oh absolutely for granted said doctor Boomer Poor McTeague I hear from Slyder that he was making desperate efforts this morning to sit up in bed His nurse with difficulty prevented him Is his power of speech gone asked mister Boulder Practically so in any case doctor Slyder insists on his not using it In fact poor McTeague s mind is a wreck His nurse was telling me that this morning he was reaching out his hand for the newspaper and seemed to want to read one of the editorials It was quite pathetic concluded doctor Boomer shaking his head So the whole matter was settled and next day all the town knew that saint Osoph s Church had extended a call to the reverend Uttermust Dumfarthing and that he had accepted it Within a few weeks of this date the Reverend Uttermust Dumfarthing moved into the manse of saint Osoph s and assumed his charge And forthwith he became the sole topic of conversation on Plutoria Avenue Have you seen the new minister of saint Osoph s everybody asked Have you been to hear doctor Dumfarthing Were you at saint Osoph s Church on Sunday morning Ah you really should go most striking sermon I ever listened to The effect of him was absolute and instantaneous there was no doubt of it My dear said missus Buncomhearst to one of her friends in describing how she had met him I never saw a more striking man Such power in his face mister Boulder introduced him to me on the avenue and he hardly seemed to see me at all simply scowled I was never so favourably impressed with any man On his very first Sunday he preached to his congregation on eternal punishment leaning forward in his black gown and shaking his fist at them doctor McTeague had never shaken his fist in thirty years and as for the reverend Fareforth Furlong he was incapable of it But the reverend Uttermust Dumfarthing told his congregation that he was convinced that at least seventy per cent of them were destined for eternal punishment and he didn t call it by that name but labelled it simply and forcibly hell The word had not been heard in any church in the better part of the City for a generation The congregation was so swelled next Sunday that the minister raised the percentage to eighty five and everybody went away delighted Young and old flocked to saint Osoph s Before a month had passed the congregation at the evening service at saint Asaph s Church was so slender that the offertory as mister Furlong senior himself calculated was scarcely sufficient to pay the overhead charge of collecting it The presence of so many young men sitting in serried files close to the front was the only feature of his congregation that extorted from the reverend mister Dumfarthing something like approval It is a joy to me to see he remarked to several of his trustees that there are in the City so many godly young men whatever the elders may be But there may have been a secondary cause at work for among the godly young men of Plutoria Avenue the topic of conversation had not been Have you heard the new presbyterian minister but Have you seen his daughter You haven t Well say For it turned out that the child of doctor Uttermust Dumfarthing so called by the trustees was the kind of child that wears a little round hat straight from Paris with an upright feather in it and a silk dress in four sections and shoes with high heels that would have broken the heart of John Calvin Moreover she had the distinction of being the only person on Plutoria Avenue who was not one whit afraid of the Reverend Uttermust Dumfarthing She even amused herself in violation of all rules by attending evening service at saint Asaph s where she sat listening to the Reverend Edward and feeling that she had never heard anything so sensible in her life I m simply dying to meet your brother she said to missus Tom Overend otherwise Philippa he s such a complete contrast with father She knew no higher form of praise Father s sermons are always so frightfully full of religion And Philippa promised that meet him she should But whatever may have been the effect of the presence of Catherine Dumfarthing there is no doubt the greater part of the changed situation was due to doctor Dumfarthing himself Everything he did was calculated to please He preached sermons to the rich and told them they were mere cobwebs and they liked it he preached a special sermon to the poor and warned them to be mighty careful he gave a series of weekly talks to workingmen and knocked them sideways and in the Sunday School he gave the children so fierce a talk on charity and the need of giving freely and quickly that such a stream of pennies and nickels poured into Catherine Dumfarthing s Sunday School Fund as hadn t been seen in the church in fifty years Nor was mister Dumfarthing different in his private walk of life He was heard to speak openly of the Overend brothers as men of wrath and they were so pleased that they repeated it to half the town It was the best business advertisement they had had for years doctor Boomer was captivated with the man True scholarship he murmured as doctor Dumfarthing poured undiluted Greek and Hebrew from the pulpit scorning to translate a word of it Under doctor Boomer s charge the minister was taken over the length and breadth of Plutoria University and reviled it from the foundations up Our library said the president two hundred thousand volumes Aye said the minister a powerful heap of rubbish I ll be bound The photograph of our last year s graduating class said the president A poor lot to judge by the faces of them said the minister This doctor Dumfarthing is our new radiographic laboratory mister Spiff our demonstrator is preparing slides which I believe actually show the movements of the atom itself do they not mister Spiff Ah said the minister piercing mister Spiff from beneath his dark brows it will not avail you young man doctor Boomer was delighted Poor McTeague he said and by the way Boyster I hear that McTeague is trying to walk again a great error it shouldn t be allowed poor McTeague knew nothing of science The students themselves shared in the enthusiasm especially after doctor Dumfarthing had given them a Sunday afternoon talk in which he showed that their studies were absolutely futile As soon as they knew this they went to work with a vigour that put new life into the college Meantime the handsome face of the Reverend Edward Fareforth Furlong began to wear a sad and weary look that had never been seen on it before He watched the congregation drifting from saint Asaph s to saint Osoph s and was powerless to prevent it His sadness reached its climax one bright afternoon in the late summer when he noticed that even his episcopal blackbirds were leaving his elms and moving westward to the spruce trees of the manse He stood looking at them with melancholy on his face Why Edward cried his sister Philippa as her motor stopped beside him how doleful you look Get into the car and come out into the country for a ride Let the parish teas look after themselves for today Tom Philippa s husband was driving his own car he was rich enough to be able to and seated with Philippa in the car was an unknown person as prettily dressed as Philippa herself To the rector she was presently introduced as Miss Catherine Something he didn t hear the rest of it Nor did he need to It was quite plain that her surname whatever it was was a very temporary and transitory affair So they sped rapidly out of the City and away out into the country mile after mile through cool crisp air and among woods with the touch of autumn bright already upon them and with blue sky and great still clouds white overhead And the afternoon was so beautiful and so bright that as they went along there was no talk about religion at all nor was there any mention of Mothers Auxiliaries or Girls Friendly Societies nor any discussion of the poor It was too glorious a day But they spoke instead of the new dances and whether they had come to stay and of such sensible topics as that Then presently as they went on still further Philippa leaned forwards and talked to Tom over his shoulder and reminded him that this was the very road to Castel Casteggio and asked him if he remembered coming up it with her to join the Newberry s ever so long ago Whatever it was that Tom answered it is not recorded but it is certain that it took so long in the saying that the Reverend Edward talked in tete a tete with Catherine for fifteen measured miles and was unaware that it was more than five minutes Among other things he said and she agreed or she said and he agreed that for the new dances it was necessary to have always one and the same partner and to keep that partner all the time And somehow simple sentiments of that sort when said direct into a pair of listening blue eyes behind a purple motor veil acquire an infinite significance Then not much after that say three or four minutes they were all of a sudden back in town again running along Plutoria Avenue and to the rector s surprise the motor was stopping outside the manse and Catherine was saying Oh thank you ever so much Philippa it was just heavenly which showed that the afternoon had had its religious features after all What said the rector s sister as they moved off again didn t you know That s Catherine Dumfarthing When the reverend Fareforth Furlong arrived home at the rectory he spent an hour or so in the deepest of deep thought in an armchair in his study Nor was it any ordinary parish problem that he was revolving in his mind He was trying to think out some means by which his sister Juliana might be induced to commit the sin of calling on the daughter of a presbyterian minister The thing had to be represented as in some fashion or other an act of self denial a form of mortification of the flesh Otherwise he knew Juliana would never do it But to call on Miss Catherine Dumfarthing seemed to him such an altogether delightful and unspeakably blissful process that he hardly knew how to approach the topic So when Juliana presently came home the rector could find no better way of introducing the subject than by putting it on the ground of Philippa s marriage to Miss Dumfarthing s father s trustee s nephew Juliana he said don t you think that perhaps on account of Philippa and Tom you ought or at least it might be best for you to call on Miss Dumfarthing Juliana turned to her brother as he laid aside her bonnet and her black gloves I ve just been there this afternoon she said There was something as near to a blush on her face as her brother had ever seen But she was not there he said No answered Juliana but mister Dumfarthing was I stayed and talked some time with him waiting for her The rector gave a sort of whistle or rather that blowing out of air which is the episcopal symbol for it Didn t you find him pretty solemn he said Solemn answered his sister Surely Edward a man in such a calling as his ought to be solemn I don t mean that exactly said the rector I mean er hard bitter so to speak Edward exclaimed Juliana how can you speak so mister Dumfarthing hard mister Dumfarthing bitter Why Edward the man is gentleness and kindness itself I don t think I ever met anyone so full of sympathy of compassion with suffering Juliana s face had flushed It was quite plain that she saw things in the Reverend Uttermust Dumfarthing as some one woman does in every man that no one else could see The Reverend Edward was abashed I wasn t thinking of his character he said I was thinking rather of his doctrines Wait till you have heard him preach Juliana flushed more deeply still I heard him last Sunday evening she said The rector was silent and his sister as if impelled to speak went on And I don t see Edward how anyone could think him a hard or bigoted man in his creed He walked home with me to the gate just now and he was speaking of all the sin in the world and of how few how very few people can be saved and how many will have to be burned as worthless and he spoke so beautifully He regrets it Edward regrets it deeply It is a real grief to him On which Juliana half in anger withdrew and her brother the rector sat back in his chair with smiles rippling all over his saintly face For he had been wondering whether it would be possible even remotely possible to get his sister to invite the Dumfarthings to high tea at the rectory some day at six o clock evening dinner was out of the question and now he knew within himself that the thing was as good as done While such things as these were happening and about to happen there were many others of the congregation of saint Asaph s beside the rector to whom the growing situation gave cause for serious perplexities Indeed all who were interested in the church the trustees and the mortgagees and the underlying debenture holders were feeling anxious For some of them underlay the Sunday School whose scholars offerings had declined forty per cent and others underlay the new organ not yet paid for while others were lying deeper still beneath the ground site of the church with seven dollars and a half a square foot resting on them I don t like it said mister Lucullus Fyshe to mister Newberry they were both prominent members of the congregation I don t like the look of things I took up a block of Furlong s bonds on his Guild building from what seemed at the time the best of motives The interest appeared absolutely certain Now it s a month overdue on the last quarter I feel alarmed Neither do I like it said mister Newberry shaking his head and I m sorry for Fareforth Furlong An excellent fellow Fyshe excellent I keep wondering Sunday after Sunday if there isn t something I can do to help him out One might do something further perhaps in the way of new buildings or alterations I have in fact offered by myself I mean and without other aid to dynamite out the front of his church underpin it and put him in a Norman gateway either that or blast out the back of it where the choir sit just as he likes I was thinking about it last Sunday as they were singing the anthem and realizing what a lot one might do there with a few sticks of dynamite I doubt it said mister Fyshe In fact Newberry to speak very frankly I begin to ask myself Is Furlong the man for the post Oh surely said mister Newberry in protest Personally a charming fellow went on mister Fyshe but is he all said and done quite the man to conduct a church In the first place he is not a businessman No said mister Newberry reluctantly that I admit Very good And secondly even in the matter of his religion itself one always feels as if he were too little fixed too unstable He simply moves with the times That at least is what people are beginning to say of him that he is perpetually moving with the times It doesn t do Newberry it doesn t do Whereupon mister Newberry went away troubled and wrote to Fareforth Furlong a confidential letter with a signed cheque in it for the amount of mister Fyshe s interest and with such further offerings of dynamite of underpinning and blasting as his conscience prompted When the rector received and read the note and saw the figures of the cheque there arose such a thankfulness in his spirit as he hadn t felt for months and he may well have murmured for the repose of mister Newberry s soul a prayer not found in the rubric of King James All the more cause had he to feel light at heart for as it chanced it was on that same evening that the Dumfarthings father and daughter were to take tea at the rectory Indeed a few minutes before six o clock they might have been seen making their way from the manse to the rectory On their way along the avenue the minister took occasion to reprove his daughter for the worldliness of her hat it was a little trifle from New York that she had bought out of the Sunday School money a temporary loan and a little further on he spoke to her severely about the parasol she carried and further yet about the strange fashion specially condemned by the Old Testament in which she wore her hair So Catherine knew in her heart from this that she must be looking her very prettiest and went into the rectory radiant The tea was of course an awkward meal at the best There was an initial difficulty about grace not easily surmounted And when the reverend mister Dumfarthing sternly refused tea as a pernicious drink weakening to the system the Anglican rector was too ignorant of the presbyterian system to know enough to give him Scotch whiskey But there were bright spots in the meal as well The rector was even able to ask Catherine sideways as a personal question if she played tennis and she was able to whisper behind her hand Not allowed and to make a face in the direction of her father who was absorbed for the moment in a theological question with Juliana Indeed before the conversation became general again the rector had contrived to make a rapid arrangement with Catherine whereby she was to come with him to the Newberry s tennis court the day following and learn the game with or without permission So the tea was perhaps a success in its way And it is noteworthy that Juliana spent the days that followed it in reading Calvin s Institutes specially loaned to her and Dumfarthing on the Certainty of Damnation a gift and in praying for her brother a task practically without hope During which same time the rector in white flannels and Catherine in a white duck skirt and blouse were flying about on the green grass of the Newberrys court and calling love love all to one another so gaily and so brazenly that even mister Newberry felt that there must be something in it But all these things came merely as interludes in the moving currents of greater events for as the summer faded into autumn and autumn into winter the anxieties of the trustees of saint Asaph s began to call for action of some sort Edward said the rector s father on the occasion of their next quarterly discussion I cannot conceal from you that the position of things is very serious Your statements show a falling off in every direction Your interest is everywhere in arrears your current account overdrawn to the limit At this rate you know the end is inevitable Your debenture and bondholders will decide to foreclose and if they do you know there is no power that can stop them Even with your limited knowledge of business you are probably aware that there is no higher power that can influence or control the holder of a first mortgage I fear so said the reverend Edward very sadly Do you not think perhaps that some of the shortcoming lies with yourself continued mister Furlong Is it not possible that as a preacher you fail somewhat do not as it were deal sufficiently with fundamental things as others do You leave untouched the truly vital issues such things as the creation death and if I may refer to it the life beyond the grave As a result of which the Reverend Edward preached a series of special sermons on the creation for which he made a special and arduous preparation in the library of Plutoria University He said that it had taken a million possibly a hundred million years of quite difficult work to accomplish and that though when we looked at it all was darkness still we could not be far astray if we accepted and held fast to the teachings of Sir Charles Lyell The book of Genesis he said was not to be taken as meaning a day when it said a day but rather something other than a mere day and the word light meant not exactly light but possibly some sort of phosphorescence and that the use of the word darkness was to be understood not as meaning darkness but to be taken as simply indicating obscurity And when he had quite finished the congregation declared the whole sermon to be mere milk and water It insulted their intelligence they said After which a week later the reverend doctor Dumfarthing took up the same subject and with the aid of seven plain texts pulverized the rector into fragments One notable result of the controversy was that Juliana Furlong refused henceforth to attend her brother s church and sat even at morning service under the minister of saint Osoph s The sermon was I fear a mistake said mister Furlong senior perhaps you had better not dwell too much on such topics We must look for aid in another direction In fact Edward I may mention to you in confidence that certain of your trustees are already devising ways and means that may help us out of our dilemma Indeed although the Reverend Edward did not know it a certain idea or plan was already germinating in the minds of the most influential supporters of saint Asaph s Such was the situation of the rival churches of saint Asaph and saint Osoph as the autumn slowly faded into winter during which time the elm trees on Plutoria Avenue shivered and dropped their leaves and the chauffeurs of the motors first turned blue in their faces and then when the great snows came were suddenly converted into liveried coachmen with tall bearskins and whiskers like Russian horseguards changing back again to blue nosed chauffeurs the very moment of a thaw During this time also the congregation of the Reverend Fareforth Furlong was diminishing month by month and that of the Reverend Uttermust Dumfarthing was so numerous that they filled up the aisles at the back of the church Here the worshippers stood and froze for the minister had abandoned the use of steam heat in saint Osoph s on the ground that he could find no warrant for it During the same period other momentous things were happening such as that Juliana Furlong was reading under the immediate guidance of doctor Dumfarthing the History of the Progress of Disruption in the Churches of Scotland in ten volumes such also as that Catherine Dumfarthing was wearing a green and gold winter suit with Russian furs and a Balkan hat and a Circassian feather which cut a wide swath of destruction among the young men on Plutoria Avenue every afternoon as she passed Moreover by the strangest of coincidences she scarcely ever seemed to come along the snow covered avenue without meeting the Reverend Edward a fact which elicited new exclamations of surprise from them both every day and by an equally strange coincidence they generally seemed although coming in different directions to be bound for the same place towards which they wandered together with such slow steps and in such oblivion of the passers by that even the children on the avenue knew by instinct whither they were wandering It was noted also that the broken figure of doctor McTeague had reappeared upon the street leaning heavily upon a stick and greeting those he met with such a meek and willing affability as if in apology for his stroke of paralysis that all who talked with him agreed that McTeague s mind was a wreck He stood and spoke to me about the children for at least a quarter of an hour related one of his former parishioners asking after them by name and whether they were going to school yet and a lot of questions like that He never used to speak of such things Poor old McTeague I m afraid he is getting soft in the head I know said the person addressed His mind is no good He stopped me the other day to say how sorry he was to hear about my brother s illness I could see from the way he spoke that his brain is getting feeble He s losing his grip He was speaking of how kind people had been to him after his accident and there were tears in his eyes I think he s getting batty Nor were even these things the most momentous happenings of the period For as winter slowly changed to early spring it became known that something of great portent was under way It was rumoured that the trustees of saint Asaph s Church were putting their heads together This was striking news The last time that the head of mister Lucullus Fyshe for example had been placed side by side with that of mister Newberry there had resulted a merger of four soda water companies bringing what was called industrial peace over an area as big as Texas and raising the price of soda by three peaceful cents per bottle And the last time that mister Furlong senior s head had been laid side by side with those of mister Rasselyer Brown and mister Skinyer they had practically saved the country from the horrors of a coal famine by the simple process of raising the price of nut coal seventy five cents a ton and thus guaranteeing its abundance Naturally therefore when it became known that such redoubtable heads as those of the trustees and the underlying mortgagees of saint Asaph s were being put together it was fully expected that some important development would follow It was not accurately known from which of the assembled heads first proceeded the great idea which was presently to solve the difficulties of the church It may well have come from that of mister Lucullus Fyshe Certainly a head which had brought peace out of civil war in the hardware business by amalgamating ten rival stores and had saved the very lives of five hundred employees by reducing their wages fourteen per cent was capable of it At any rate it was mister Fyshe who first gave the idea a definite utterance It s the only thing Furlong he said across the lunch table at the Mausoleum Club It s the one solution The two churches can t live under the present conditions of competition We have here practically the same situation as we had with two rum distilleries the output is too large for the demand One or both of the two concerns must go under It s their turn just now but these fellows are business men enough to know that it may be ours tomorrow We ll offer them a business solution We ll propose a merger I ve been thinking of it said mister Furlong senior I suppose it s feasible Feasible exclaimed mister Fyshe Why look what s being done every day everywhere from the Standard Oil Company downwards You would hardly I think said mister Furlong with a quiet smile compare the Standard Oil Company to a church Well no I suppose not said mister Fyshe and he too smiled in fact he almost laughed The notion was too ridiculous One could hardly compare a mere church to a thing of the magnitude and importance of the Standard Oil Company But on a lesser scale continued mister Fyshe it s the same sort of thing As for the difficulties of it I needn t remind you of the much greater difficulties we had to grapple with in the rum merger There you remember a number of the women held out as a matter of principle It was not mere business with them Church union is different In fact it is one of the ideas of the day and everyone admits that what is needed is the application of the ordinary business principles of harmonious combination with a proper er restriction of output and general economy of operation Very good said mister Furlong I m sure if you re willing to try the rest of us are All right said mister Fyshe I thought of setting Skinyer of Skinyer and Beatem to work on the form of the organization As you know he is not only a deeply religious man but he has already handled the Tin Pot Combination and the United Hardware and the Associated Tanneries He ought to find this quite simple Within a day or two mister Skinyer had already commenced his labours I must first he said get an accurate idea of the existing legal organization of the two churches For which purpose he approached the rector of saint Asaph s I just want to ask you mister Furlong said the lawyer a question or two as to the exact constitution the form so to speak of your church What is it Is it a single corporate body I suppose said the rector thoughtfully one would define it as an indivisible spiritual unit manifesting itself on earth Quite so interrupted mister Skinyer but I don t mean what it is in the religious sense I mean in the real sense I fail to understand said mister Furlong Let me put it very clearly said the lawyer Where does it get its authority From above said the rector reverently Precisely said mister Skinyer no doubt but I mean its authority in the exact sense of the term It was enjoined on saint Peter began the rector but mister Skinyer interrupted him That I am aware of he said but what I mean is where does your church get its power for example to hold property to collect debts to use distraint against the property of others to foreclose its mortgages and to cause judgement to be executed against those who fail to pay their debts to it You will say at once that it has these powers direct from Heaven No doubt that is true and no religious person would deny it But we lawyers are compelled to take a narrower a less elevating point of view Are these powers conferred on you by the state legislature or by some higher authority Oh by a higher authority I hope said the rector very fervently Whereupon mister Skinyer left him without further questioning the rector s brain being evidently unfit for the subject of corporation law On the other hand he got satisfaction from the reverend doctor Dumfarthing at once The church of saint Osoph said the minister is a perpetual trust holding property as such under a general law of the state and able as such to be made the object of suit or distraint I speak with some assurance as I had occasion to enquire into the matter at the time when I was looking for guidance in regard to the call I had received to come here It s a quite simple matter mister Skinyer presently reported to mister Fyshe One of the churches is a perpetual trust the other practically a state corporation Each has full control over its property provided nothing is done by either to infringe the purity of its doctrine Just what does that mean asked mister Fyshe It must maintain its doctrine absolutely pure Otherwise if certain of its trustees remain pure and the rest do not those who stay pure are entitled to take the whole of the property This I believe happens every day in Scotland where of course there is great eagerness to remain pure in doctrine And what do you define as pure doctrine asked mister Fyshe If the trustees are in dispute said mister Skinyer the courts decide but any doctrine is held to be a pure doctrine if all the trustees regard it as a pure doctrine I see said mister Fyshe thoughtfully it s the same thing as what we called permissible policy on the part of directors in the Tin Pot Combination Exactly assented mister Skinyer and it means that for the merger we need nothing I state it very frankly except general consent The preliminary stages of the making of the merger followed along familiar business lines The trustees of saint Asaph s went through the process known as approaching the trustees of saint Osoph s First of all for example mister Lucullus Fyshe invited mister Asmodeus Boulder of saint Osoph s to lunch with him at the Mausoleum Club the cost of the lunch as is usual in such cases was charged to the general expense account of the church Of course nothing whatever was said during the lunch about the churches or their finances or anything concerning them Such discussion would have been a gross business impropriety A few days later the two brothers Overend dined with mister Furlong senior the dinner being charged directly to the contingencies account of saint Asaph s After which mister Skinyer and his partner mister Beatem went to the spring races together on the Profit and Loss account of saint Osoph s and Philippa Overend and Catherine Dumfarthing were taken by the Unforeseen Disbursements Account to the grand opera followed by a midnight supper All of these things constituted what was called the promotion of the merger and were almost exactly identical with the successive stages of the making of the Amalgamated Distilleries and the Associated Tin Pot Corporation which was considered a most hopeful sign Do you think they ll go into it asked mister Newberry of mister Furlong senior anxiously After all what inducement have they Every inducement said mister Furlong All said and done they ve only one large asset doctor Dumfarthing We re really offering to buy up doctor Dumfarthing by pooling our assets with theirs And what does doctor Dumfarthing himself say to it Ah there I am not so sure said mister Furlong that may be a difficulty So far there hasn t been a word from him and his trustees are absolutely silent about his views However we shall soon know all about it Skinyer is asking us all to come together one evening next week to draw up the articles of agreement Has he got the financial basis arranged then I believe so said mister Furlong His idea is to form a new corporation to be known as the United Church Limited or by some similar name All the present mortgagees will be converted into unified bondholders the pew rents will be capitalized into preferred stock and the common stock drawing its dividend from the offertory will be distributed among all members in standing Skinyer says that it is really an ideal form of church union one that he thinks is likely to be widely adopted It has the advantage of removing all questions of religion which he says are practically the only remaining obstacle to a union of all the churches In fact it puts the churches once and for all on a business basis But what about the question of doctrine of belief asked mister Newberry Skinyer says he can settle it answered mister Furlong About a week after the above conversation the united trustees of saint Asaph s and saint Osoph s were gathered about a huge egg shaped table in the board room of the Mausoleum Club They were seated in intermingled fashion after the precedent of the recent Tin Pot Amalgamation and were smoking huge black cigars specially kept by the club for the promotion of companies and chargeable to expenses of organization at fifty cents a cigar There was an air of deep peace brooding over the assembly as among men who have accomplished a difficult and meritorious task Well then said mister Skinyer who was in the chair with a pile of documents in front of him I think that our general basis of financial union may be viewed as settled A murmur of assent went round the meeting The terms are set forth in the memorandum before us which you have already signed Only one other point a minor one remains to be considered I refer to the doctrines or the religious belief of the new amalgamation Is it necessary to go into that asked mister Boulder Not entirely perhaps said mister Skinyer Still there have been as you all know certain points I won t say of disagreement but let us say of friendly argument between the members of the different churches such things for example here he consulted his papers as the theory of the creation the salvation of the soul and so forth have been mentioned in this connection I have a memorandum of them here though the points escape me for the moment These you may say are not matters of first importance especially as compared with the intricate financial questions which we have already settled in a satisfactory manner Still I think it might be well if I were permitted with your unanimous approval to jot down a memorandum or two to be afterwards embodied in our articles There was a general murmur of approval Very good said mister Skinyer settling himself back in his chair Now first in regard to the creation here he looked all round the meeting in a way to command attention Is it your wish that we should leave that merely to a gentlemen s agreement or do you want an explicit clause I think it might be well said mister Dick Overend to leave no doubt about the theory of the creation Good said mister Skinyer I am going to put it down then something after this fashion On and after let us say August first proximo the process of the creation shall be held and is hereby held to be such and such only as is acceptable to a majority of the holders of common and preferred stock voting pro rata Is that agreed Carried cried several at once Carried repeated mister Skinyer Now let us pass on here he consulted his notes to item two eternal punishment I have made a memorandum as follows Should any doubts arise on or after August first proximo as to the existence of eternal punishment they shall be settled absolutely and finally by a pro rata vote of all the holders of common and preferred stock Is that agreed One moment said mister Fyshe do you think that quite fair to the bondholders After all as the virtual holders of the property they are the persons most interested I should like to amend your clause and make it read I am not phrasing it exactly but merely giving the sense of it that eternal punishment should be reserved for the mortgagees and bondholders At this there was an outbreak of mingled approval and dissent several persons speaking at once In the opinion of some the stockholders of the company especially the preferred stockholders had as good a right to eternal punishment as the bondholders Presently mister Skinyer who had been busily writing notes held up his hand for silence Gentlemen he said will you accept this as a compromise We will keep the original clause but merely add to it the words but no form of eternal punishment shall be declared valid if displeasing to a three fifths majority of the holders of bonds Carried carried cried everybody To which I think we need only add said mister Skinyer a clause to the effect that all other points of doctrine belief or religious principle may be freely altered amended reversed or entirely abolished at any general annual meeting There was a renewed chorus of Carried carried and the trustees rose from the table shaking hands with one another and lighting fresh cigars as they passed out of the club into the night air The only thing that I don t understand said mister Newberry to doctor Boomer as they went out from the club arm in arm for they might now walk in that fashion with the same propriety as two of the principals in a distillery merger the only thing that I don t understand is why the Reverend mister Dumfarthing should be willing to consent to the amalgamation Do you really not know said doctor Boomer No You have heard nothing Not a word said mister Newberry Ah rejoined the president I see that our men have kept it very quiet naturally so in view of the circumstances The truth is that the Reverend mister Dumfarthing is leaving us Leaving saint Osoph s exclaimed mister Newberry in utter astonishment To our great regret He has had a call a most inviting field of work he says a splendid opportunity They offered him ten thousand one hundred we were only giving him ten thousand here though of course that feature of the situation would not weigh at all with a man like Dumfarthing Oh no of course not said mister Newberry As soon as we heard of the call we offered him ten thousand three hundred not that that would make any difference to a man of his character Indeed Dumfarthing was still waiting and looking for guidance when they offered him eleven thousand We couldn t meet it It was beyond us though we had the consolation of knowing that with such a man as Dumfarthing the money made no difference And he has accepted the call Yes He accepted it today He sent word to mister Dick Overend our chairman that he would remain in his manse looking for light until two thirty after which if we had not communicated with him by that hour he would cease to look for it Dear me said mister Newberry deep in reflection so that when your trustees came to the meeting Exactly said doctor Boomer and something like a smile passed across his features for a moment doctor Dumfarthing had already sent away his telegram of acceptance Why then said mister Newberry at the time of our discussion tonight you were in the position of having no minister Not at all We had already appointed a successor A successor Certainly It will be in tomorrow morning s papers The fact is that we decided to ask doctor McTeague to resume his charge doctor McTeague repeated mister Newberry in amazement But surely his mind is understood to be Oh not at all interrupted doctor Boomer His mind appears if anything to be clearer and stronger than ever doctor Slyder tells us that paralysis of the brain very frequently has this effect it soothes the brain clears it as it were so that very often intellectual problems which occasioned the greatest perplexity before present no difficulty whatever afterwards doctor McTeague I believe finds no trouble now in reconciling saint Paul s dialectic with Hegel as he used to He says that so far as he can see they both mean the same thing Well well said mister Newberry and will doctor McTeague also resume his philosophical lectures at the university We think it wiser not said the president While we feel that doctor McTeague s mind is in admirable condition for clerical work we fear that professorial duties might strain it In order to get the full value of his remarkable intelligence we propose to elect him to the governing body of the university There his brain will be safe from any shock As a professor there would always be the fear that one of his students might raise a question in his class This of course is not a difficulty that arises in the pulpit or among the governors of the university Of course not said mister Newberry Thus was constituted the famous union or merger of the churches of saint Asaph and saint Osoph viewed by many of those who made it as the beginning of a new era in the history of the modern church There is no doubt that it has been in every way an eminent success Rivalry competition and controversies over points of dogma have become unknown on Plutoria Avenue The parishioners of the two churches may now attend either of them just as they like As the trustees are fond of explaining it doesn t make the slightest difference The entire receipts of the churches being now pooled are divided without reference to individual attendance At each half year there is issued a printed statement which is addressed to the shareholders of the United Churches Limited and is hardly to be distinguished in style or material from the annual and semi annual reports of the Tin Pot Amalgamation and the United Hardware and other quasi religious bodies of the sort Your directors the last of these documents states are happy to inform you that in spite of the prevailing industrial depression the gross receipts of the corporation have shown such an increase as to justify the distribution of a stock dividend of special Offertory Stock Cumulative which will be offered at par to all holders of common or preferred shares You will also be gratified to learn that the directors have voted unanimously in favour of a special presentation to the reverend Uttermust Dumfarthing on the occasion of his approaching marriage It was earnestly debated whether this gift should take the form as at first suggested of a cash presentation or as afterwards suggested of a written testimonial in the form of an address The latter course was finally adopted as being more fitting to the circumstances and the address has accordingly been prepared setting forth to the reverend doctor Dumfarthing in old English lettering and wording the opinion which is held of him by his former parishioners The approaching marriage referred of course to doctor Dumfarthing s betrothal to Juliana Furlong It was not known that he had ever exactly proposed to her But it was understood that before giving up his charge he drew her attention in very severe terms to the fact that as his daughter was now leaving him he must either have someone else to look after his manse or else be compelled to incur the expense of a paid housekeeper This latter alternative he said was not one that he cared to contemplate He also reminded her that she was now at a time of life when she could hardly expect to pick and choose and that her spiritual condition was one of at least great uncertainty These combined statements are held under the law of Scotland at any rate to be equivalent to an offer of marriage Catherine Dumfarthing did not join her father in his new manse She first remained behind him as the guest of Philippa Overend for a few weeks while she was occupied in packing up her things After that she stayed for another two or three weeks to unpack them This had been rendered necessary by a conversation held with the Reverend Edward Fareforth Furlong in a shaded corner of the Overend s garden After which in due course of time Catherine and Edward were married the ceremony being performed by the Reverend doctor McTeague whose eyes filled with philosophical tears as he gave them his blessing So the two churches of saint Asaph and saint Osoph stand side by side united and at peace Their bells call softly back and forward to one another on Sunday mornings and such is the harmony between them that even the episcopal rooks in the elm trees of saint Asaph s and the presbyterian crows in the spruce trees of saint Osoph s are known to exchange perches on alternate Sundays CHAPTER EIGHT The Great Fight for Clean Government
3982_182255_000001_000000	train-clean-100	 As to the government of this city said mister Newberry leaning back in a leather armchair at the Mausoleum Club and lighting a second cigar it s rotten that s all 
none	none	Absolutely rotten assented mister Dick Overend ringing the bell for a second whiskey and soda Corrupt said mister Newberry between two puffs of his cigar Full of graft said mister Overend flicking his ashes into the grate Crooked aldermen said mister Newberry
3982_182255_000006_000000	train-clean-100	 A bum city solicitor said mister Overend and an infernal grafter for treasurer 
3982_182255_000007_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes assented mister Newberry and then leaning forwards in his chair and looking carefully about the corridors of the club he spoke behind his hand and said And the mayor s the biggest grafter of the lot 
none	none	And what s more he added sinking his voice to a whisper the time has come to speak out about it fearlessly mister Overend nodded
3982_182255_000008_000001	train-clean-100	 It s a tyranny he said 
none	none	Worse than Russia rejoined mister Newberry They had been sitting in a quiet corner of the club it was on a Sunday evening and had fallen into talking first of all of the present rottenness of the federal politics of the United States not argumentatively or with any heat but with the reflective sadness that steals over an elderly man when he sits in the leather armchair of a comfortable club smoking a good cigar and musing on the decadence of the present day The rottenness of the federal government didn t anger them It merely grieved them They could remember both of them how different everything was when they were young men just entering on life When mister Newberry and mister Dick Overend were young men went into congress from pure patriotism there was no such thing as graft or crookedness as they both admitted in those days and as for the United States Senate here their voices were almost hushed in awe why when they were young the United States Senate But no neither of them could find a phrase big enough for their meaning They merely repeated as for the United States Senate and then shook their heads and took long drinks of whiskey and soda Then naturally speaking of the rottenness of the federal government had led them to talk of the rottenness of the state legislature How different from the state legislatures that they remembered as young men 
3982_182255_000014_000002	train-clean-100	Not merely different in the matter of graft but different so mister Newberry said in the calibre of the men 
none	none	He recalled how he had been taken as a boy of twelve by his father to hear a debate He would never forget it 
3982_182255_000014_000005	train-clean-100	Giants he said that was what they were 
none	none	In fact the thing was more like a Witenagemot than a legislature He said he distinctly recalled a man whose name he didn t recollect speaking on a question he didn t just remember what either for or against he just couldn t recall which it thrilled him He would never forget it It stayed in his memory as if it were yesterday 
3982_182255_000015_000000	train-clean-100	But as for the present legislature here mister Dick Overend sadly nodded assent in advance to what he knew was coming as for the present legislature well mister 
none	none	Newberry had had he said occasion to visit the state capital a week before in connection with a railway bill that he was trying to that is that he was anxious to in short in connection with a railway bill and when he looked about him at the men in the legislature positively he felt ashamed he could put it no other way than that ashamed After which from speaking of the crookedness of the state government mister Newberry and mister Dick Overend were led to talk of the crookedness of the city government And they both agreed as above that things were worse than in Russia What secretly irritated them both most was that they had lived and done business under this infernal corruption for thirty or forty years and hadn t noticed it They had been too busy The fact was that their conversation reflected not so much their own original ideas as a general wave of feeling that was passing over the whole community 
3982_182255_000018_000000	train-clean-100	There had come a moment quite suddenly it seemed when it occurred to everybody at the same time that the whole government of the city was rotten 
3982_182255_000018_000001	train-clean-100	The word is a strong one 
none	none	But it is the one that was used Look at the aldermen they said rotten Look at the city solicitor rotten And as for the mayor himself phew The thing came like a wave 
3982_182255_000019_000001	train-clean-100	Everybody felt it at once 
none	none	People wondered how any sane intelligent community could tolerate the presence of a set of corrupt scoundrels like the twenty aldermen of the city Their names it was said were simply a byword throughout the United States for rank criminal corruption This was said so widely that everybody started hunting through the daily papers to try to find out who in blazes were aldermen anyhow 
3982_182255_000019_000005	train-clean-100	Twenty names are hard to remember and as a matter of fact at the moment when this wave of feeling struck the city nobody knew or cared who were aldermen anyway 
none	none	To tell the truth the aldermen had been much the same persons for about fifteen or twenty years Some were in the produce business others were butchers two were grocers and all of them wore blue checkered waistcoats and red ties and got up at seven in the morning to attend the vegetable and other markets 
3982_182255_000020_000002	train-clean-100	Nobody had ever really thought about them that is to say nobody on Plutoria Avenue 
3982_182255_000020_000003	train-clean-100	Sometimes one saw a picture in the paper and wondered for a moment who the person was but on looking more closely and noticing what was written under it one said Oh I see an alderman and turned to something else 
none	none	Whose funeral is that a man would sometimes ask on Plutoria Avenue Oh just one of the city aldermen a passerby would answer hurriedly Oh I see I beg your pardon I thought it might be somebody important At which both laughed It was not just clear how and where this movement of indignation had started People said that it was part of a new wave of public morality that was sweeping over the entire United States Certainly it was being remarked in almost every section of the country Chicago newspapers were attributing its origin to the new vigour and the fresh ideals of the middle west In Boston it was said to be due to a revival of the grand old New England spirit 
3982_182255_000023_000005	train-clean-100	In Philadelphia they called it the spirit of William Penn 
none	none	In the south it was said to be the reassertion of southern chivalry making itself felt against the greed and selfishness of the north while in the north they recognized it at once as a protest against the sluggishness and ignorance of the south In the west they spoke of it as a revolt against the spirit of the east and in the east they called it a reaction against the lawlessness of the west But everywhere they hailed it as a new sign of the glorious unity of the country If therefore mister Newberry and mister Overend were found to be discussing the corrupt state of their city they only shared in the national sentiments of the moment In fact in the same city hundreds of other citizens as disinterested as themselves were waking up to the realization of what was going on 
3982_182255_000024_000002	train-clean-100	As soon as people began to look into the condition of things in the city they were horrified at what they found 
none	none	It was discovered for example that Alderman Schwefeldampf was an undertaker Think of it 
3982_182255_000024_000005	train-clean-100	In a city with a hundred and fifty deaths a week and sometimes even better an undertaker sat on the council 
none	none	A city that was about to expropriate land and to spend four hundred thousand dollars for a new cemetery had an undertaker on the expropriation committee itself 
3982_182255_000024_000007	train-clean-100	And worse than that 
none	none	Alderman Undercutt was a butcher 
3982_182255_000024_000009	train-clean-100	In a city that consumed a thousand tons of meat every week 
none	none	And Alderman O Hooligan it leaked out was an Irishman Imagine it An Irishman sitting on the police committee of the council in a city where thirty eight and a half out of every hundred policemen were Irish either by birth or parentage 
3982_182255_000024_000013	train-clean-100	The thing was monstrous 
3982_182255_000025_000000	train-clean-100	So when mister Newberry said It s worse than Russia he meant it every word 
none	none	Now just as mister Newberry and mister Dick Overend were finishing their discussion the huge bulky form of Mayor McGrath came ponderously past them as they sat He looked at them sideways out of his eyes he had eyes like plums in a mottled face and being a born politician he knew by the very look of them that they were talking of something that they had no business to be talking about But being a politician he merely said Good evening gentlemen without a sign of disturbance Good evening mister Mayor said mister Newberry rubbing his hands feebly together and speaking in an ingratiating tone There is no more pitiable spectacle than an honest man caught in the act of speaking boldly and fearlessly of the evil doer Good evening mister Mayor echoed mister Dick Overend also rubbing his hands warm evening is it not The mayor gave no other answer than that deep guttural grunt which is technically known in municipal interviews as refusing to commit oneself Did he hear whispered mister Newberry as the mayor passed out of the club I don t care if he did whispered mister Dick Overend Half an hour later Mayor McGrath entered the premises of the Thomas Jefferson Club which was situated in the rear end of a saloon and pool room far down in the town Boys he said to Alderman O Hooligan and Alderman Gorfinkel who were playing freeze out poker in a corner behind the pool tables you want to let the boys know to keep pretty dark and go easy There s a lot of talk I don t like about the elections going round the town 
3982_182255_000033_000002	train-clean-100	Let the boys know that just for a while the darker they keep the better 
none	none	Whereupon the word was passed from the Thomas Jefferson Club to the George Washington Club and thence to the Eureka Club coloured and to the Kossuth Club Hungarian and to various other centres of civic patriotism in the lower parts of the city And forthwith such a darkness began to spread over them that not even honest Diogenes with his lantern could have penetrated their doings If them stiffs wants to make trouble said the president of the George Washington Club to Mayor McGrath a day or two later they won t never know what they ve bumped up against
3982_182255_000036_000000	train-clean-100	 Well said the heavy mayor speaking slowly and cautiously and eyeing his henchman with quiet scrutiny you want to go pretty easy now I tell you 
none	none	The look which the mayor directed at his satellite was much the same glance that Morgan the buccaneer might have given to one of his lieutenants before throwing him overboard Meantime the wave of civic enthusiasm as reflected in the conversations of Plutoria Avenue grew stronger with every day The thing is a scandal said mister Lucullus Fyshe Why these fellows down at the city hall are simply a pack of rogues I had occasion to do some business there the other day it was connected with the assessment of our soda factories and do you know I actually found that these fellows take money I say said mister Peter Spillikins to whom he spoke I say You don t say
3982_182255_000041_000000	train-clean-100	 It s a fact repeated mister Fyshe 
3982_182255_000041_000001	train-clean-100	 They take money 
none	none	I took the assistant treasurer aside and I said I want such and such done and I slipped a fifty dollar bill into his hand 
3982_182255_000041_000003	train-clean-100	And the fellow took it took it like a shot 
none	none	He took it gasped mister Spillikins
3982_182255_000043_000000	train-clean-100	 He did said mister Fyshe 
3982_182255_000043_000001	train-clean-100	 There ought to be a criminal law for that sort of thing 
none	none	I say exclaimed mister Spillikins they ought to go to jail for a thing like that
3982_182255_000045_000000	train-clean-100	 And the infernal insolence of them mister Fyshe continued 
3982_182255_000045_000001	train-clean-100	 I went down the next day to see the deputy assistant about a thing connected with the same matter told him what I wanted and passed a fifty dollar bill across the counter and the fellow fairly threw it back at me in a perfect rage 
3982_182255_000045_000002	train-clean-100	He refused it 
3982_182255_000046_000000	train-clean-100	 Refused it gasped mister Spillikins I say 
none	none	Conversations such as this filled up the leisure and divided the business time of all the best people in the city In the general gloomy outlook however one bright spot was observable The wave had evidently come just at the opportune moment For not only were civic elections pending but just at this juncture four or five questions of supreme importance would be settled by the incoming council There was for instance the question of the expropriation of the Traction Company a matter involving many millions there was the decision as to the renewal of the franchise of the Citizens Light Company a vital question there was also the four hundred thousand dollar purchase of land for the new addition to the cemetery a matter that must be settled And it was felt especially on Plutoria Avenue to be a splendid thing that the city was waking up in the moral sense at the very time when these things were under discussion All the shareholders of the Traction Company and the Citizens Light and they included the very best the most high minded people in the city felt that what was needed now was a great moral effort to enable them to lift the city up and carry it with them or if not all of it at any rate as much of it as they could
3982_182255_000049_000000	train-clean-100	 It s a splendid movement said mister Fyshe he was a leading shareholder and director of the Citizens Light what a splendid thing to think that we shan t have to deal for our new franchise with a set of corrupt rapscallions like these present aldermen 
none	none	Do you know Furlong that when we approached them first with a proposition for a renewal for a hundred and fifty years they held us up 
3982_182255_000049_000002	train-clean-100	Said it was too long 
none	none	Imagine that 
3982_182255_000049_000004	train-clean-100	A hundred and fifty years only a century and a half too long for the franchise 
none	none	They expect us to install all our poles string our wires set up our transformers in their streets and then perhaps at the end of a hundred years find ourselves compelled to sell out at a beggarly valuation 
3982_182255_000049_000006	train-clean-100	Of course we knew what they wanted They meant us to hand them over fifty dollars each to stuff into their rascally pockets 
3982_182255_000050_000000	train-clean-100	 Outrageous said mister Furlong 
none	none	And the same thing with the cemetery land deal went on mister Lucullus Fyshe Do you realize that if the movement hadn t come along and checked them those scoundrels would have given that rogue Schwefeldampf four hundred thousand dollars for his fifty acres 
3982_182255_000051_000002	train-clean-100	Just think of it 
none	none	I don t know said mister Furlong with a thoughtful look upon his face that four hundred thousand dollars is an excessive price in and of itself for that amount of land
3982_182255_000053_000000	train-clean-100	 Certainly not said mister Fyshe very quietly and decidedly looking at mister Furlong in a searching way as he spoke 
none	none	It is not a high price It seems to me speaking purely as an outsider a very fair reasonable price for fifty acres of suburban land if it were the right land If for example it were a case of making an offer for that very fine stretch of land about twenty acres is it not which I believe your Corporation owns on the other side of the cemetery I should say four hundred thousand is a most modest price mister Furlong nodded his head reflectively
3982_182255_000055_000000	train-clean-100	 You had thought had you not of offering it to the city said mister Fyshe 
3982_182255_000056_000000	train-clean-100	 We did said mister Furlong at a more or less nominal sum four hundred thousand or whatever it might be 
3982_182255_000056_000001	train-clean-100	We felt that for such a purpose almost sacred as it were one would want as little bargaining as possible 
none	none	Oh none at all assented mister Fyshe
3982_182255_000058_000000	train-clean-100	 Our feeling was went on mister Furlong that if the city wanted our land for the cemetery extension it might have it at its own figure four hundred thousand half a million in fact at absolutely any price from four hundred thousand up that they cared to put on it We didn t regard it as a commercial transaction at all 
3982_182255_000058_000001	train-clean-100	Our reward lay merely in the fact of selling it to them 
none	none	Exactly said mister Fyshe and of course your land was more desirable from every point of view Schwefeldampf s ground is encumbered with a growth of cypress and evergreens and weeping willows which make it quite unsuitable for an up to date cemetery whereas yours as I remember it is bright and open a loose sandy soil with no trees and very little grass to overcome Yes said mister Furlong
3982_182255_000060_000001	train-clean-100	 We thought too that our ground having the tanneries and the chemical factory along the farther side of it was an ideal place for he paused seeking a mode of expressing his thought 
none	none	For the dead said mister Fyshe with becoming reverence And after this conversation mister Fyshe and mister Furlong senior understood one another absolutely in regard to the new movement It was astonishing in fact how rapidly the light spread Is Rasselyer Brown with us asked someone of mister Fyshe a few days later
3982_182255_000064_000000	train-clean-100	 Heart and soul answered mister Fyshe 
none	none	He s very bitter over the way these rascals have been plundering the city on its coal supply 
3982_182255_000064_000002	train-clean-100	He says that the city has been buying coal wholesale at the pit mouth at three fifty utterly worthless stuff he tells me 
none	none	He has heard it said that everyone of these scoundrels has been paid from twenty five to fifty dollars a winter to connive at it Dear me said the listener
3982_182255_000066_000000	train-clean-100	 Abominable is it not said mister Fyshe 
none	none	But as I said to Rasselyer Brown what can one do if the citizens themselves take no interest in these things
3982_182255_000066_000002	train-clean-100	 Take your own case I said to him how is it that you a coal man are not helping the city in this matter 
3982_182255_000066_000003	train-clean-100	Why don t you supply the city He shook his head I wouldn t do it at three fifty he said 
none	none	No I answered but will you at five He looked at me for a moment and then he said Fyshe I ll do it at five or at anything over that they like to name 
3982_182255_000066_000005	train-clean-100	If we get a new council in they may name their own figure Good I said 
none	none	I hope all the other businessmen will be animated with the same spirit 
3982_182255_000067_000000	train-clean-100	Thus it was that the light broke and spread and illuminated in all directions 
none	none	People began to realize the needs of the city as they never had before 
3982_182255_000067_000002	train-clean-100	mister Boulder who owned among other things a stone quarry and an asphalt company felt that the paving of the streets was a disgrace 
none	none	mister Skinyer of Skinyer and Beatem shook his head and said that the whole legal department of the city needed reorganization it needed he said new blood But he added always in a despairing tone how could one expect to run a department with the head of it drawing only six thousand dollars the thing was impossible If he argued they could superannuate the present chief solicitor and get a man a good man mister Skinyer laid emphasis on this at say fifteen thousand there might be some hope Of course said mister Skinyer to mister Newberry in discussing the topic one would need to give him a proper staff of assistants so as to take off his hands all the routine work the mere appearance in court the preparation of briefs the office consultation the tax revision and the purely legal work In that case he would have his hands free to devote himself entirely to those things which in fact to turn his attention in whatever direction he might feel it was advisable to turn it Within a week or two the public movement had found definite expression and embodied itself in the Clean Government Association This was organized by a group of leading and disinterested citizens who held their first meeting in the largest upstairs room of the Mausoleum Club mister Lucullus Fyshe mister Boulder and others keenly interested in obtaining simply justice for the stockholders of the Traction and the Citizens Light were prominent from the start 
3982_182255_000069_000002	train-clean-100	mister Rasselyer Brown mister Furlong senior and others were there not from special interest in the light or traction questions but as they said themselves from pure civic spirit 
none	none	doctor Boomer was there to represent the university with three of his most presentable professors cultivated men who were able to sit in a first class club and drink whiskey and soda and talk as well as any businessman present mister Skinyer mister Beatem and others represented the bar 
3982_182255_000069_000005	train-clean-100	doctor McTeague blinking in the blue tobacco smoke was there to stand for the church 
none	none	There were all round enthusiasts as well such as mister Newberry and the Overend brothers and mister Peter Spillikins
3982_182255_000070_000000	train-clean-100	 Isn t it fine whispered mister Spillikins to mister Newberry to see a set of men like these all going into a thing like this not thinking of their own interests a bit 
none	none	mister Fyshe as chairman addressed the meeting He told them they were there to initiate a great free voluntary movement of the people It had been thought wise he said to hold it with closed doors and to keep it out of the newspapers This would guarantee the league against the old underhand control by a clique that had hitherto disgraced every part of the administration of the city He wanted he said to see everything done henceforth in broad daylight and for this purpose he had summoned them there at night to discuss ways and means of action After they were once fully assured of exactly what they wanted to do and how they meant to do it the league he said would invite the fullest and freest advice from all classes in the city There were none he said amid great applause that were so lowly that they would not be invited once the platform of the league was settled to advise and company operate All might help even the poorest Subscription lists would be prepared which would allow any sum at all from one to five dollars to be given to the treasurer The league was to be democratic or nothing The poorest might contribute as little as one dollar even the richest would not be allowed to give more than five Moreover he gave notice that he intended to propose that no actual official of the league should be allowed under its by laws to give anything He himself if they did him the honour to make him president as he had heard it hinted was their intention would be the first to bow to this rule He would efface himself He would obliterate himself content in the interests of all to give nothing He was able to announce similar pledges from his friends mister Boulder mister Furlong doctor Boomer and a number of others Quite a storm of applause greeted these remarks by mister Fyshe who flushed with pride as he heard it Now gentlemen he went on this meeting is open for discussion Remember it is quite informal anyone may speak I as chairman make no claim to control or monopolize the discussion Let everyone understand Well then mister Chairman began mister Dick Overend One minute mister Overend said mister Fyshe I want everyone to understand that he may speak as May I say then began mister Newberry Pardon me mister Newberry said mister Fyshe I was wishing first to explain that not only may all participate but that we invite In that case began mister Newberry Before you speak interrupted mister Fyshe let me add one word We must make our discussion as brief and to the point as possible I have a great number of things which I wish to say to the meeting and it might be well if all of you would speak as briefly and as little as possible Has anybody anything to say Well said mister Newberry what about organization and officers We have thought of it said mister Fyshe We were anxious above all things to avoid the objectionable and corrupt methods of a slate and a prepared list of officers which has disgraced every part of our city politics until the present time mister Boulder mister Furlong and mister Skinyer and myself have therefore prepared a short list of offices and officers which we wish to submit to your fullest freest consideration It runs thus honorable President mister L Fyshe honorable Vice president mister A Boulder honorable Secretary mister Furlong honorable Treasurer mister O Skinyer et cetera I needn t read it all You ll see it posted in the hall later Is that carried Carried Very good said mister Fyshe There was a moment s pause while mister Furlong and mister Skinyer moved into seats beside mister Fyshe and while mister Furlong drew from his pocket and arranged the bundle of minutes of the meeting which he had brought with him As he himself said he was too neat and methodical a writer to trust to jotting them down on the spot Don t you think said mister Newberry I speak as a practical man that we ought to do something to get the newspapers with us Most important assented several members What do you think doctor Boomer asked mister Fyshe of the university president will the newspapers be with us doctor Boomer shook his head doubtfully It s an important matter he said There is no doubt that we need more than anything the support of a clean wholesome unbiassed press that can t be bribed and is not subject to money influence I think on the whole our best plan would be to buy up one of the city newspapers Might it not be better simply to buy up the editorial staff said mister Dick Overend We might do that admitted doctor Boomer There is no doubt that the corruption of the press is one of the worst factors that we have to oppose But whether we can best fight it by buying the paper itself or buying the staff is hard to say Suppose we leave it to a committee with full power to act said mister Fyshe Let us direct them to take whatever steps may in their opinion be best calculated to elevate the tone of the press the treasurer being authorized to second them in every way I for one am heartily sick of old underhand connection between city politics and the city papers If we can do anything to alter and elevate it it will be a fine work gentlemen well worth whatever it costs us Thus after an hour or two of such discussion the Clean Government League found itself organized and equipped with a treasury and a programme and a platform The latter was very simple As mister Fyshe and mister Boulder said there was no need to drag in specific questions or try to define the action to be taken towards this or that particular detail such as the hundred and fifty year franchise beforehand The platform was simply expressed as Honesty Purity Integrity This as mister Fyshe said made a straight flat clean issue between the league and all who opposed it This first meeting was of course confidential But all that it did was presently done over again with wonderful freshness and spontaneity at a large public meeting open to all citizens There was a splendid impromptu air about everything For instance when somebody away back in the hall said I move that mister Lucullus Fyshe be president of the league mister Fyshe lifted his hand in unavailing protest as if this were the newest idea he had ever heard in his life After all of which the Clean Government League set itself to fight the cohorts of darkness It was not just known where these were But it was understood that they were there all right somewhere In the platform speeches of the epoch they figured as working underground working in the dark working behind the scenes and so forth But the strange thing was that nobody could state with any exactitude just who or what it was that the league was fighting It stood for honesty purity and integrity That was all you could say about it Take for example the case of the press At the inception of the league it has been supposed that such was the venality and corruption of the city newspapers that it would be necessary to buy one of them But the word clean government had been no sooner uttered than it turned out that every one of the papers in the city was in favour of it in fact had been working for it for years They vied with one another now in giving publicity to the idea The Plutorian Times printed a dotted coupon on the corner of its front sheet with the words Are you in favour of Clean Government If so send us ten cents with this coupon and your name and address The Plutorian Citizen and Home Advocate went even further It printed a coupon which said Are you out for a clean city If so send us twenty five cents to this office We pledge ourselves to use it The newspapers did more than this They printed from day to day such pictures as the portrait of mister Fyshe with the legend below mister Lucullus Fyshe who says that government ought to be by the people from the people for the people and to the people and the next day another labelled mister P Spillikins who says that all men are born free and equal and the next day a picture with the words Tract of ground offered for cemetery by mister Furlong showing rear of tanneries with head of mister Furlong inserted It was of course plain enough that certain of the aldermen of the old council were to be reckoned as part of the cohort of darkness That at least was clear We want no more men in control of the stamp of Alderman Gorfinkel and Alderman Schwefeldampf so said practically every paper in the city The public sense revolts at these men They are vultures who have feasted too long on the prostrate corpses of our citizens And so on The only trouble was to discover who or what had ever supported Alderman Gorfinkel and Alderman Schwefeldampf The very organizations that might have seemed to be behind them were evidently more eager for clean government than the league itself The Thomas Jefferson Club Out for Clean Government so ran the newspaper headings of one day and of the next Will help to clean up City Government Eureka Club Coloured endorses the League Is done with Darkness and the day after that Sons of Hungary Share in Good Work Kossuth Club will vote with the League So strong indeed was the feeling against the iniquitous aldermen that the public demand arose to be done with a council of aldermen altogether and to substitute government by a Board The newspapers contained editorials on the topic each day and it was understood that one of the first efforts of the league would be directed towards getting the necessary sanction of the legislature in this direction To help to enlighten the public on what such government meant Professor Proaser of the university he was one of the three already referred to gave a public lecture on the growth of Council Government He traced it from the Amphictionic Council of Greece as far down as the Oligarchical Council of Venice it was thought that had the evening been longer he would have traced it clean down to modern times But most amazing of all was the announcement that was presently made and endorsed by mister Lucullus Fyshe in an interview that Mayor McGrath himself would favour clean government and would become the official nominee of the league itself This certainly was strange But it would perhaps have been less mystifying to the public at large had they been able to listen to certain of the intimate conversations of mister Fyshe and mister Boulder You say then said mister Boulder to let McGrath s name stand We can t do without him said mister Fyshe he has seven of the wards in the hollow of his hand If we take his offer he absolutely pledges us every one of them Can you rely on his word said mister Boulder I think he means to play fair with us answered mister Fyshe I put it to him as a matter of honour between man and man a week ago Since then I have had him carefully dictaphoned and I m convinced he s playing straight How far will he go with us said mister Boulder He is willing to throw overboard Gorfinkel Schwefeldampf and Undercutt He says he must find a place for O Hooligan The Irish he says don t care for clean government they want Irish Government I see said mister Boulder very thoughtfully and in regard to the renewal of the franchise and the expropriation tell me just exactly what his conditions are But mister Fyshe s answer to this was said so discreetly and in such a low voice that not even the birds listening in the elm trees outside the Mausoleum Club could hear it No wonder then that if even the birds failed to know everything about the Clean Government League there were many things which such good people as mister Newberry and mister Peter Spillikins never heard at all and never guessed Each week and every day brought fresh triumphs to the onward march of the movement Yes gentlemen said mister Fyshe to the assembled committee of the Clean Government League a few days later I am glad to be able to report our first victory mister Boulder and I have visited the state capital and we are able to tell you definitely that the legislature will consent to change our form of government so as to replace our council by a Board Hear hear cried all the committee men together We saw the governor said mister Fyshe Indeed he was good enough to lunch with us at the Pocahontas Club He tells us that what we are doing is being done in every city and town of the state He says that the days of the old fashioned city council are numbered They are setting up boards everywhere Excellent said mister Newberry The governor assures us that what we want will be done The chairman of the Democratic State Committee he was good enough to dine with us at the Buchanan Club has given us the same assurance So also does the chairman of the Republican State Committee who was kind enough to be our guest in a box at the Lincoln Theatre It is most gratifying concluded mister Fyshe to feel that the legislature will give us such a hearty such a thoroughly American support You are sure of this are you questioned mister Newberry You have actually seen the members of the legislature It was not necessary said mister Fyshe The governor and the different chairmen have them so well fixed that is to say they have such confidence in the governor and their political organizers that they will all be prepared to give us what I have described as thoroughly American support You are quite sure persisted mister Newberry about the governor and the others you mentioned mister Fyshe paused a moment and then he said very quietly We are quite sure and he exchanged a look with mister Boulder that meant volumes to those who would read it I hope you didn t mind my questioning you in that fashion said mister Newberry as he and mister Fyshe strolled home from the club The truth is I didn t feel sure in my own mind just what was meant by a Board and getting them to give us government by a Board I know I m speaking like an ignoramus I ve really not paid as much attention in the past to civic politics as I ought to have But what is the difference between a council and a board The difference between a council and a board repeated mister Fyshe Yes said mister Newberry the difference between a council and a board Or call it said mister Fyshe reflectively the difference between a board and a council Precisely said mister Newberry It s not altogether easy to explain said mister Fyshe One chief difference is that in the case of a board sometimes called a Commission the salary is higher You see the salary of an alderman or councillor in most cities is generally not more than fifteen hundred or two thousand dollars The salary of a member of a board or commission is at least ten thousand That gives you at once a very different class of men As long as you only pay fifteen hundred you get your council filled up with men who will do any kind of crooked work for fifteen hundred dollars as soon as you pay ten thousand you get men with larger ideas I see said mister Newberry If you have a fifteen hundred dollar man mister Fyshe went on you can bribe him at any time with a fifty dollar bill On the other hand your ten thousand dollar man has a wider outlook If you offer him fifty dollars for his vote on the board he d probably laugh at you Ah yes said mister Newberry I see the idea A fifteen hundred dollar salary is so low that it will tempt a lot of men into office merely for what they can get out of it That s it exactly answered mister Fyshe From all sides support came to the new league The women of the city there were fifty thousand of them on the municipal voters list were not behind the men Though not officials of the league they rallied to its cause mister Fyshe said missus Buncomhearst who called at the office of the president of the league with offers of support tell me what we can do I represent fifty thousand women voters of this city This was a favourite phrase of missus Buncomhearst s though it had never been made quite clear how or why she represented them We want to help we women You know we ve any amount of initiative if you ll only tell us what to do You know mister Fyshe we ve just as good executive ability as you men if you ll just tell us what to do Couldn t we hold a meeting of our own all our own to help the league along An excellent idea said mister Fyshe And could you not get three or four men to come and address it so as to stir us up asked missus Buncomhearst anxiously Oh certainly said mister Fyshe So it was known after this that the women were working side by side with the men The tea rooms of the Grand Palaver and the other hotels were filled with them every day busy for the cause One of them even invented a perfectly charming election scarf to be worn as a sort of badge to show one s allegiance and its great merit was that it was so fashioned that it would go with anything Yes said mister Fyshe to his committee one of the finest signs of our movement is that the women of the city are with us Whatever we may think gentlemen of the question of woman s rights in general and I think we know what we do think there is no doubt that the influence of women makes for purity in civic politics I am glad to inform the committee that missus Buncomhearst and her friends have organized all the working women of the city who have votes They tell me that they have been able to do this at a cost as low as five dollars per woman Some of the women foreigners of the lower classes whose sense of political morality is as yet imperfectly developed have been organized at a cost as low as one dollar per vote But of course with our native American women with a higher standard of education and morality we can hardly expect to do it as low as that Nor were the women the only element of support added to the league Gentlemen reported doctor Boomer the president of the university at the next committee meeting I am glad to say that the spirit which animates us has spread to the students of the university They have organized entirely by themselves and on their own account a Students Fair Play League which has commenced its activities I understand that they have already ducked Alderman Gorfinkel in a pond near the university I believe they are looking for Alderman Schwefeldampf tonight I understand they propose to throw him into the reservoir The leaders of them a splendid set of young fellows have given me a pledge that they will do nothing to bring discredit on the university I think I heard them on the street last night said mister Newberry I believe they had a procession said the president Yes I heard them they were shouting Rah rah rah Clean Government Clean Government Rah rah It was really inspiring to hear them Yes said the president they are banded together to put down all the hoodlumism and disturbance on the street that has hitherto disgraced our municipal elections Last night as a demonstration they upset two streetcars and a milk wagon I heard that two of them were arrested said mister Dick Overend Only by an error said the president There was a mistake It was not known that they were students The two who were arrested were smashing the windows of the car after it was upset with their hockey sticks A squad of police mistook them for rioters As soon as they were taken to the police station the mistake was cleared up at once The chief of police telephoned an apology to the university I believe the league is out again tonight looking for Alderman Schwefeldampf But the leaders assure me there will be no breach of the peace whatever As I say I think their idea is to throw him into the reservoir In the face of such efforts as these opposition itself melted rapidly away The Plutorian Times was soon able to announce that various undesirable candidates were abandoning the field Alderman Gorfinkel it said who it will be recalled was thrown into a pond last week by the students of the college was still confined to his bed when interviewed by our representative mister Gorfinkel stated that he should not offer himself as a candidate in the approaching election He was he said weary of civic honours He had had enough He felt it incumbent on him to step out and make way for others who deserved their turn as well as himself in future he proposed to confine his whole attention to his Misfit Semi Ready Establishment which he was happy to state was offering as nobby a line of early fall suiting as was ever seen at the price There is no need to recount here in detail the glorious triumph of the election day itself It will always be remembered as the purest cleanest election ever held in the precincts of the city The citizens organization turned out in overwhelming force to guarantee that it should be so Bands of doctor Boomer s students armed with baseball bats surrounded the polls to guarantee fair play Any man wishing to cast an unclean vote was driven from the booth all those attempting to introduce any element of brute force or rowdyism into the election were cracked over the head In the lower part of the town scores of willing workers recruited often from the humblest classes kept order with pickaxes In every part of the city motor cars supplied by all the leading businessmen lawyers and doctors of the city acted as patrols to see that no unfair use should be made of other vehicles in carrying voters to the polls It was a foregone victory from the first overwhelming and complete The cohorts of darkness were so completely routed that it was practically impossible to find them As it fell dusk the streets were filled with roaring and surging crowds celebrating the great victory for clean government while in front of every newspaper office huge lantern pictures of Mayor McGrath the Champion of Pure Government and O Skinyer the People s Solicitor and the other nominees of the league called forth cheer after cheer of frenzied enthusiasm They held that night in celebration a great reception at the Mausoleum Club on Plutoria Avenue given at its own suggestion by the city The city indeed insisted on it Nor was there ever witnessed even in that home of art and refinement a scene of greater charm In the spacious corridor of the club a Hungarian band wafted Viennese music from Tyrolese flutes through the rubber trees There was champagne bubbling at a score of sideboards where noiseless waiters poured it into goblets as broad and flat as floating water lily leaves And through it all moved the shepherds and shepherdesses of that beautiful Arcadia the shepherds in their Tuxedo jackets with vast white shirt fronts broad as the map of Africa with spotless white waistcoats girdling their equators wearing heavy gold watch chains and little patent shoes blacker than sin itself and the shepherdesses in foaming billows of silks of every colour of the kaleidoscope their hair bound with glittering headbands or coiled with white feathers the very symbol of municipal purity One would search in vain the pages of pastoral literature to find the equal of it And as they talked the good news spread from group to group that it was already known that the new franchise of the Citizens Light was to be made for two centuries so as to give the company a fair chance to see what it could do At the word of it the grave faces of manly bondholders flushed with pride and the soft eyes of listening shareholders laughed back in joy For they had no doubt or fear now that clean government had come They knew what the company could do Thus all night long outside of the club the soft note of the motor horns arriving and departing wakened the sleeping leaves of the elm trees with their message of good tidings And all night long within its lighted corridors the bubbling champagne whispered to the listening rubber trees of the new salvation of the city So the night waxed and waned till the slow day broke dimming with its cheap prosaic glare the shaded beauty of the artificial light and the people of the city the best of them drove home to their well earned sleep and the others in the lower parts of the city rose to their daily toil END End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Arcadian Adventures with the Idle Rich by
