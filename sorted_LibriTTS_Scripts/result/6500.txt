Produced by David Widger Illustration Frontispiece Illustration Titlepage THE LOG CABIN LADY An Anonymous Autobiography PREFACE The story of The Log Cabin Lady is one of the annals of America It is a moving record of the conquest of self consciousness and fear through mastery of manners and customs It has been written by one who has not sacrificed the strength and honesty of her pioneer girlhood but who added to these qualities that graciousness and charm which have given her distinction on two continents I have been asked to tell how the story of The Log Cabin Lady came to be written At a luncheon given at the Colony Club in nineteen twenty I was invited to talk about Madame Curie There were at that table a group of important women When I had finished the story of the great scientist whose service to humanity was halted by lack of laboratory equipment and of the very radium which she had herself discovered one guest asked Why do you spend your life with a woman s magazine when you could do big work like serving Madame Curie I believe I replied that a woman s magazine is one of the biggest services that can be rendered in this country My challenge was met with scorn by one of the women upon whose education and accomplishments a fortune had been spent It is stupid she said to print articles about bringing up children and furnishing houses setting tables and feeding families or whether it is good form for the host to suggest another service at the dinner table There are twenty million homes in America I answered Only eight per cent of these have servants in them In the other ninety two per cent the women do their own housework bring up their own children and take an active part in the life and growth of America They are the people who help make this country the great nation that it is After luncheon one of the guests a woman of great social prominence distinguished both in her own country and abroad asked me to drive downtown with her When we entered her car she said with much feeling You must go on with the thing you are doing Believing she referred to the Curie campaign I replied that I had committed myself to the work and could not abandon it I was not referring to the Curie campaign she replied but to the Delineator You are right it is of vital importance to serve the great masses of people I know It will probably surprise you to learn that when I was fourteen years old I had never seen a table napkin My family were pioneers in the Northwest and were struggling for mere existence There was no time for the niceties of life And yet people like my family and myself are worth serving and saving I have known what it means to lie awake all night suffering with shame because of some stupid social blunder which had made me appear ridiculous before my husband s family or his friends This was a most amazing statement from a woman known socially on two continents and famed for her savoir faire There were tears in her eyes when she made her confession She was stirred by a very real and deep emotion It had been years she said since the old recollections had come back to her but she had been moved by my plea for service to home women and to the great mass of ordinary American people She told me that while living abroad she had often met American girls intelligent women well bred the finest stuff in the world who suffered under a disadvantage because they lacked a little training in the social amenities It has been a satisfaction and a compensation to me she added to be able sometimes to serve these fellow country women of mine And right there was born the idea which culminated in the writing of this little book I suggested that a million women could be helped by the publishing of her own story The thought was abhorrent to her Her experience was something she had never voiced in words It would be too intimate a discussion of herself and her family She was sure her relatives would bitterly oppose such a confession It took nearly a year to persuade this remarkable woman to put down on paper from her recollections and from her old letters home this simple story of a fine American life She consented finally to write fragments of her life anonymously We were pledged not to reveal her identity A few changes in geography and time were made in her manuscript but otherwise the story is true to life laden with adventure spirit and the American philosophy She has refused to accept any remuneration for the magazine publication or for royalties on the book rights The money accruing from her labor is being set aside in The Central Union Trust Company of New York City as a trust fund to be used in some charitable work She has given her book to the public solely because she believes that it contains a helpful message for other women It is the gracious gift of a woman who has a deep and passionate love for her country and a tender responsiveness to the needs of her own sex MARIE M MELONEY September one nineteen twenty two THE LOG CABIN LADY I I was born in a log cabin I came to my pioneer mother in one of Wisconsin s bitterest winters Twenty one years later I was sailing for England the wife of a diplomat who was one of Boston s wealthy and aristocratic sons The road between well let it speak for itself Merely to set this story on paper opens old wounds deep but mercifully healed these many years Yet if other women may find here comfort and illumination and a certain philosophy I am glad and I shall feel repaid The first thing I remember is being grateful for windows I was three years old My mother had set me to play on a mattress carefully placed in the one ray of sunlight streaming through the one glass window of our log cabin Baby as I was I had ached in the agonizing cold of a pioneer winter Lying there warmed by that blessed sunshine I was suddenly aware of wonder and joy and gratitude It was gratitude for glass which could keep out the biting cold and let in the warm sun To this day windows give me pleasure My father was a school teacher from New England where his family had taught the three R s and the American Constitution since the days of Ben Franklin s study club My mother was the daughter of a hardworking Scotch immigrant Father s family set store on ancestry Mother s side was more practical The year before my birth these two young people started West in a prairie schooner to stake a homestead claim Father s sea man s chest held a dictionary Bancroft s History of the United States several books of mathematics Plutarch s Lives a history of Massachusetts a leather bound file of Civil War records Thackeray s Vanity Fair Shakespeare in two volumes and the Legend of Sleepy Hollow My mother took a Bible I can still quote pages from every one of those books Until I was fourteen I saw no others except a primer homemade to teach me my letters Because Vanity Fair contained simpler words than the others it was given me first so at the age of seven I was spelling out pages of the immortal Becky My mother did not approve but father laughed and protested that the child might as well begin with good things After mother s eighth and last baby she lay ill for a year The care of the children fell principally on my young shoulders One day I found her crying Mary she said with a tenderness that was rare if I die you must take care of all your brothers and sisters You will be the only woman within eighteen miles I was ten years old That night and many other nights I lay awake trembling at the possibility of being left the only woman within eighteen miles But mother did not die I must have been a sturdy child for with the little help father and his homestead partner could spare I kept that home going until she was strong again Every fall the shoemaker made his rounds through the country reaching our place last for beyond us lay only virgin forest and wild beasts His visit thrilled us more than the arrival of any king to day We had been cut off from the world for months The shoemaker brought news from neighbors eighteen forty sixty even a hundred and fifty miles away Usually he brought a few newspapers too treasured afterward for months He remained a royal guest for many days until all the family was shod Up to my tenth birthday we could not afford the newspaper subscription But after that times were a little better and the Boston Transcript began to come at irregular intervals It formed our only tie with civilization except for the occasional purely personal letter from back home When I was fourteen three tremendous events had marked my life sunlight through a window pane the logrolling on the river when father added two rooms to our cabin and the night I thought mother would die and leave me the only woman in eighteen miles But the fourth event was the most tremendous One night father hurried in without even waiting to unload or water his team He seemed excited and handed my mother a letter Our Great Aunt Martha had willed father her household goods and personal belongings and a modest sum that to us was a fortune Some one back East awaited his instructions Followed many discussions but in the end my mother gained her way Great Aunt Martha s house goods were sold at auction Father however insisted that her personal belongings be shipped to Wisconsin After a long long wait one day father and I rose at daybreak and rode thirty six miles in a springless wagon over ranchmen s roads the giant s vertebrae Jim Hill s men called it to the nearest express station returning with a trunk and two packing cases It was a solemn moment when the first box was opened Then mother gave a cry of delight Sheets and bedspreads edged with lace Real linen pillowcases with crocheted edgings Soft woolen blankets and bright handmade quilts Two heavy lustrous table cloths and two dozen napkins one white set hemmed and one red and white bordered with a soft fringe What the world calls wealth has come to me in after years Nothing ever equaled in my eyes the priceless value of Great Aunt Martha s personal belongings I was in a seventh heaven of delight My father picked up the books and began to read paying no attention to our ecstasies over dresses and ribbons the boxful of laces or the little shell covered case holding a few ornaments in gold and silver and jet We women did not stop until we had explored every corner of that trunk and the two packing boxes Then I picked up a napkin What are these for I asked curiously My father slammed his book shut I had never seen such a look on his face How old are you Mary he demanded suddenly I told him that I was going on fifteen And you never saw a table napkin His tone was bitter and accusing I did n t understand how could I Father began to talk his words growing more and more bitter Mother defended herself hotly To day I know that justice was on her side But in that first adolescent self consciousness my sympathies were all with father Mother had neglected us she had not taught us to use table napkins Becky Sharp used them People in history used them I felt sure that Great Aunt Martha would have been horrified even in heaven to learn I had never even seen a table napkin Our parents quarrel dimmed the ecstasy of the personal belongings From that time we used napkins and a table cloth on Sundays that is when any one remembered it was Sunday Great Aunt Martha s napkins opened up a new world for me and they strengthened father s determination to give his children an education The September before I reached seventeen we persuaded mother to let me go to Madison and study for a half year So great was my eagerness to learn from books that I had given no thought to people Madison my first town showed me that my clothes were homemade and tacky Other girls wore store shoes and what seemed to me beautifully made dresses I was a backwoods gawk I hated myself and our home With many cautions father had intrusted eighty dollars to me for the half year s expenses I took the money and bought my first pair of buttoned shoes and a store dress with nine gores and stylish mutton leg sleeves It was poor stuff not warm enough for winter and together with a new coat and hat made a large hole in my funds I found work in a kindly family where in return for taking care of an old lady I received room and board and two dollars a week Four hours of my day were left for school The following February brought me an appointment as teacher in a district school at eighteen dollars a month and turnabout boarding in farmers families The next two years were spent teaching and attending school in Madison When I was twenty a gift from father added to my savings and made possible the realization of one of my dreams I went East for a special summer course No tubes shuttled under the Hudson in those days From the ferry boat I was suddenly dazzled with the vision of a towering gold dome rising above the four and five story structures The New York World building was then the tallest in the world To me it was also the most stupendous Impulsively I turned to a man leaning on the ferry boat railing beside me Is n t that the most wonderful thing in the world I gasped Not quite he answered and looked at me His look made me uncomfortable I could have spoken to any stranger in Madison without embarrassment It took me about twenty years to understand why a plain middle aged woman may chat with a strange man anywhere on earth while the same conversation cheapens a good looking young girl That summer I met my future husband He was doing research work at Columbia and we ran across each other constantly in the library I fairly lived there for I found myself for the first time among a wealth of books and I read everything autobiographies histories and novels good and bad Tom s family and most of his friends were out of town for July and August I had never met any one like him and he had never dreamed of any one like me We were friends in a week and sweethearts in a month Instead of joining his family Tom stayed in New York and showed me the town He took me to my first plays Even now I know that If I Were King and The Idol s Eye with Frank Daniels were good One day we went driving in an open carriage his It was upholstered in soft fawn color the coachman wore fawn colored livery and the horses were beautiful I was very happy When we reached my boarding house again I jumped out I was used to hopping from spring wagons Please don t do that again Mary reproved Tom very gently You might hurt yourself That amused me until a look from the coachman suddenly conveyed to me that I had made a faux pas Not long after I hurried off a street car ahead of Tom This time he said nothing but I have not forgotten the look on his face Over our marvelous meals in marvelous restaurants Tom delighted to get me started about home Great Aunt Martha s personal belongings amused him hugely He never tired of the visiting shoemaker nor of the carpenter who declared indignantly that if we wore decent clothes we wouldn t need our bench seats planed smooth But some things I never told about the table napkins for instance We were married in September Our honeymoon we spent fishing and roughing it in the Canadian wilds I felt at home and blissful I could cook and fish and make a bed in the open as well as any man It was heaven but it left me entirely unprepared for the world I was about to enter Not once did Tom say Mary we do this or that in our family He was too happy and I suppose he never thought of it As for me I wasted no worry on his family They would be kind and sympathetic and simple like Tom They would love me and I would love them The day after we returned from Canada to New York I spent looking over Tom s personal belongings as great a revelation as Aunt Martha s His richly bound books his beautiful furniture his pictures everything was perfect That night Tom made an announcement The family gets home to night and they will come to call to morrow Why don t we go to the station to meet them I suggested To day I appreciate better than I could then the gentle tact with which Tom told me his family was strong on good form and that the husband s family calls on the bride first My husband s family came and I realized that I was a mere baby in a new world a complicated and not very friendly world at that Though they never put it into words they made me understand in their cruel polite way that Tom was the hope of the family and his sudden marriage to a stranger had been a great shock if not more The beautiful ease of my husband s women folk filled me with admiration and despair I felt guilty of something I was queer Their voices the intonation even the tilt of their chins seemed to stamp these new in laws as aristocrats of another race Yet the same old New England stock that sired their ancestors produced my father s fathers Theirs had stayed in Boston and had had time to teach their children grace and refinement and subtleties Mine fought for their existence in a new country And when men and women fight for existence life becomes very simple I felt only my own misery that day Now I realize that the meeting between Tom s mother and his wife was a mutual misery I was crude No doubt to her I seemed even common With every one except Tom I seemed awkward and stupid Poor mother in law When she rose to go I saw her to her carriage She was extremely insistent that I should not But this was Tom s mother and I was determined to leave no friendly act undone At home it would have been an offense not to see the company to their wagon Even in Madison we would have escorted a caller to his carriage Again it was the coachman who with one chill look warned me that I had sinned Before Tom came home that afternoon he called on his mother so no explanations from me were necessary He knew it all and doubtless much more than had escaped me Like the princely gentleman he always was the poor boy tried to soften that after noon s blows by saying social customs were stupid and artificial and I knew all the important things in life The other few little things and habits of his world he could easily tell me Few and little There were thousands and they loomed bigger each day Moreover Tom did not tell me Either manlike he forgot or he was afraid of hurting my feelings One of the few things Tom did tell me I was forever forgetting Napkins belonged to Sundays at home and they were not washed often It was a long standing habit to save back breaking work for mother to fold my napkin neatly after meals Unlearning that and acquiring the custom of mussing up one s napkin and leaving it carelessly on the table was the meanest work of my life Interesting guests came to Tom s house and I would grow absorbed in their talk Not until we were leaving the table would I realize that my napkin lay neatly folded and squared in the midst of casually rumpled heaps One night years later I sat between Jim Hill and Senator Bailey of Texas at a dinner Both men folded their napkins I loved them for it During that first year Tom made up a little theater party for a classmate who had just married a Philadelphia girl With memories of Ben Franklin William Penn Liberty Bell and all the grand old characters of the City of brotherly Love I looked forward eagerly to making a new friend The Philadelphian was even more languid than Tom s mother She chopped her words and there were no r s in her English I tried to break the ice by talking of the traditions of her city She was bored She knew only Philadelphia s social register Just to play tit for tat twice during the evening I quoted from Julius Caesar and scored We had just settled down in old Martin s Restaurant for after theater supper when two tall gentlemen entered the room There s Tom Platt and Chauncey Depew remarked Tom s friend casually United States senators are important people in Wisconsin at least they were when I was young If a senator visited our community everybody turned out I knew much of both these men and Tom had often spoken warmly of Depew As they approached our table Tom and his friend both stood up Thrilled I rose hastily My eyes were too busy to see Tom s face and I did not realize until afterward that the only other woman had remained coolly seated On our way home Tom told me in his gentle way never to rise from a dining table to acknowledge an introduction even to a woman or a senator That night a tormenting devil with the face of the other woman kept me awake For the first time since my marriage I felt homesick for the prairies And then we were invited to visit Tom s Aunt Elizabeth in Boston and meet the whole family I was sick with dread I begged Tom to tell me some of the things I should and should not do Be your own sweet self and they ll love you he promised kissing me He meant it dear soul but I knew better From the very first minute Tom s Aunt Elizabeth made me conscious of her disapproval In after years I won the old lady s affection and real respect but I never spent a completely happy hour in her presence The night we arrived she gave me a formal dinner Some dozen additional guests dropped in later and I was bewildered by new faces and strange names Later in the evening I noticed a distinguished looking middle aged gentleman standing alone just outside the drawing room door Hurrying out I invited him to come in He inquired courteously if there was anything he could do for me Yes indeed I assured him Come in and talk to me He looked shy and surprised I insisted Then Tom s aunt called me and drawing me hastily into a corner demanded why I was inviting a servant into her drawing room Servant He looks like a senator I protested He s dressed exactly like every other man at the party and he looks twice as important as most of them Didn t you notice he addressed you as Madam pursued Aunt Elizabeth But it s perfectly proper to call a married woman Madam Foreigners always do I defended Can t you tell a servant when you see one inquired the old lady icily I begged to know how one could All Boston was summed up in her answer You are supposed to know the other people Tom s wife could have drowned in a thimble The third day of our visit we were at the dinner table when I saw Aunt Elizabeth s face change for the worse Her head went up higher and her upper lip drew longer Finally she turned to me Why do you cut your meat like a dog s dinner she snapped Tom s protesting exclamation did not stop her I laid my knife and fork on my plate and folded my hands in my lap to hide their trembling Time may dim many hurts but with the last flicker of intelligence I shall remember that scene Even then in a flash I saw the symbolism of it On one side rare mahogany shining silver deft servants napkins to rumple leisure for the niceties of life On the other hand a log cabin my tired mother with new babies always coming father slaving to homestead a claim and push civilization a little farther over our American continent A great tenderness for my parents filled my heart and overflowed in my eyes I have I confess had moments of bitterness toward them But that was not one of them I think I can tell you I answered as quietly as I could It s very simple I was the first baby and mother cut up my food for me After a while she cut up food for two babies By the time the third came I had to do my own cutting Naturally I did it just as mother had Then I began to help cut up food for the other babies It s a baby habit And I must now learn to cut one bite at a time like a civilized grown person Even Aunt Elizabeth was silenced But Tom rose from the table swearing My father would not have permitted a cowpuncher to use such language before my mother But I loved Tom for it However I did not sleep that night Next morning Tom s Aunt Elizabeth apologized and for Back Bay was really unbending Some days later we returned to New York and I thought my troubles were over for a time But the first night Tom came home full of excitement He had been appointed to the diplomatic corps and we were to sail for England within a month The news struck chill terror to my heart With so much still to learn in my native America what on earth should I do in English society II More than two months passed after the night my husband announced his foreign appointment before we sailed for England I planned to study and to have long talks with him about the customs of fashionable and diplomatic Europe but alas I reckoned without the friends and pretended friends who claim the time of a man of Tom s importance Besides he and I had so many other things to discuss So the sailing time approached and then he announced that we were to be presented at court I was thrilled half with fear and half with joy I remembered from my reading of history that some of England s kings had not spoken English and that French had been the court language I visited a bookstore and purchased what was recommended as an easy road to French and spent all morning learning to say l orange est un fruit I read the instructions for placing the tongue and puckering the lips and repeated les and las until I was dizzy Then I looked through our bookcases for a life of Benjamin Franklin I knew he had gone to court and played with queens But the great statesman author orator gave me no guide to correct form or English social customs Instead I grew so interested in the history of his work in England and France and in his inspiring achievement in obtaining recognition and credit for the United States that dinner time arrived before I realized I had not discovered what language was spoken at court nor what one talked about nor if one talked at all Tom roared when I made my confession With his boyish good humor he promised to answer all my questions on board ship So without a care in those delicious days that followed I wandered down Sixth Avenue to New York s then most correct shops buying clothes and clothes and clothes I bought practical and impractical gifts for the twins back in Wisconsin and for all the family and those good friends who had helped me through Madison The week before we sailed my husband said out of a clear sky Be sure you have the right clothes Mary The English are a conservative lot Suddenly I was conscious again that I did not know the essential things the wife of a diplomat ought to know what to wear and when a million and one tremendous social trifles The moment our magnificent liner left the dock I heaved a sigh of relief Tom would be mine for two whole weeks and all the questions I had saved up would be answered That evening he announced We don t dress for dinner the first night out Dress for dinner I asked What do you mean And then very gently he gave me my first lesson I had never seen anything bigger than a ferry boat How could I guess that even on an ocean liner we did not leave formality behind The party dresses so carefully selected the long rich velvet cape I had thought outrageously extravagant and the satin slippers and the suede I had packed them all carefully in the trunk and sent them to the hold of the ship But with the aid of a little cash the steward finally produced my treasure trunk and thereafter I dressed for dinner The two weeks I had expected my husband to give me held no quiet hours There is no such thing except when one is seasick as being alone aboard a ship Tom was popular good at cards and deck games always ready to play And the fourth day out I was too ill to worry about the customs at the Court of saint James It was not until just before we reached England that I began to feel myself again I stood on deck thrilled with the tall ships and the steamers the fishing smacks and the smaller craft in Southampton harbor What will be the first thing you do in London somebody asked me Go to Mayfair to find the home of Becky Sharp I answered Becky Sharp was as much a part of English history to me as Henry VIII or Anne Boleyn or William the Conqueror When my husband and I were alone he said I think they have picked out No twenty one Curzon Street as the house where Becky Sharp is supposed to have lived But what a funny thing for you to want to see first I remembered what old Lord Steyne had said to Becky You poor little earthen pipkin You want to swim down the stream with great copper kettles All women are alike Everybody is striving for what is not worth the having I was quite sure I did not want to drift down the stream with copper kettles I only wanted to be with Tom to see England with him to enjoy doctor Johnson s haunts to go to the Cheddar Cheese and the Strand to Waterloo Bridge and down the road the Romans built before England was England I wanted to see the world without the world seeing me In my heart was no desire to be a copper kettle But I had been cast into the stream and down it I must go like a little fungus holding to the biggest copper kettle I knew I told my husband this It was the first time he had been really irritated with me Why do you worry about these things he protested You have a good head and a good education You are the loveliest woman in England Be your own natural self and the English will love you But I remembered another occasion when he had told me to be my own natural sweet self How about what happened to Becky I asked Tom went into a rage Why do you insist on comparing yourself with that little The word he used was an ugly one I did not speak to him again until after we had passed the government inspectors I shall never forget my first day in London the old quiet city where everybody seemed so comfortable and easy going There was no show no pretense The people in the shops and on the street bore the earmarks of thrift I understood where New England got its spirit The first morning at the Alexandra Hotel Tom fell naturally into the European habit of having coffee and fruit and a roll brought to his bed I wanted to go down to the dining room My husband said it was not done and I would be lonesome The days of ranch life had taught me to get up with the chickens But it was not done in London The second morning the early sun was too much for me I dressed left the hotel and walked for several hours before a perfect servant brought shining plates and marmalade fruit and coffee to my big husky football player s bedside I have lived many years in Europe but I have never grown used to having breakfast brought to my room That second rainy morning Tom left me alone with the promise of being back for luncheon I picked up a London morning paper and glanced at the personal column I have read it every day since when I could get hold of the London Times All of human nature and the ups and downs of man are there from secondhand lace to the mortgaged jewels of broken down nobility from sporting games and tickets for sale to relatives wanted and those mysterious suggestive unsigned messages from home or to home I read the news of the war We in America did not know there was a war But Greece and Crete were at each other s throats and Turkey was standing waiting to crowd the little ancient nation into Armenia or off the map There was the Indian famine We did not talk about it at home but it had first place in the London paper And the Queen s birthday it was to be celebrated by feeding the poor of East London and paying the debts of the hospitals There was something so humane so kindly so civilized about it all I love England I said and that first impression balanced the scale many a time later when I did not love her The third or fourth day brought an invitation to dine at a famous house on Grosvenor Square with a duke I pestered my husband with questions What should I wear What should I talk about He just laughed The paper had reported a levee ordered by the queen describing the gowns and jewels worn by the ladies I had little jewelry a diamond ring which Tom gave me before we were married a bracelet two brooches and a string of gold beads which were fashionable in America I put them all on with my best bib and tucker When we were dressed Tom gave me one look and said Why do you wear all that junk I took off one of the brooches and the string of gold beads When our carriage drew up to the house on Grosvenor Square liveried servants stood at each side of the door liveried servants guided us inside There was a gold carpet paintings of ladies and gentlemen in gorgeous attire and murals and tapestries in the marble halls But I quickly forgot all of this grandeur listening to the names of guests being called off as they entered the drawing room mister Gladstone and missus Gladstone Lord Rosebery and the Marquis of Salisbury missus Humphry Ward looking fatter and older than I had expected officers colonels viscounts and ladies and then Tom and Mary but they were not called off that way I wanted to meet mister Gladstone and hoped I might even be near him at dinner but I sat between a colonel and a young captain of the Scots Greys mister Gladstone was on the other side of the table It was a huge table more than five feet wide and very long My husband was somewhere out of sight at the other end mister Gladstone mentioned the fund being raised for the victims of the Paris Opera Comique fire It is good form to be silent in the presence of death especially when death is colossal and the English never fail to follow good form There was a sudden lull at our end of the table It was I who broke that silence I was touched by the generosity of England and said so Since my arrival I had daily noted that England was giving to India sending relief to Greece and Armenia raising a fund for the fire sufferers and celebrating the Queen s Jubilee by feeding the poor I addressed my look and my admiring words to mister Gladstone Either my sincerity or the embarrassment he knew would follow my disregard of the thing that is done moved mister Gladstone s sympathy He smiled across the table at me and answered I am so glad you see these good points of England It was about the most gracious thing that was ever done to me in my life In England it is bad form to speak across the table One speaks to one s neighbor on the right or to one s neighbor on the left but the line across the table is foreign soil and must not be shouted across That night my husband said I forgot to tell you They never talk across the table in England I chided him and with some cause I had soon discovered that in England as in America it was not enough to be my own natural self But I came to love mister Gladstone Long after that I told him the story of missus Grant who when an awkward young man had broken one of her priceless Sevres after dinner coffee cups dropped hers on the floor to meet him on the same level Any woman who to put any one at ease will break a priceless Sevres cup is heroic I said His answer though flippant was pleasant Any man who would not smile across the table at a lovely woman is a fool mister Gladstone always wore a flower in his button hole a big loose collar that never fitted a floppy black necktie and trousers that needed a valet s attention He was the greatest combination of propriety and utter disregard of conventions I had ever seen The event next in importance to a presentation at court was a tea at which the tea planter Sir Thomas Lipton was one of the guests He was not Sir Thomas then but was very much in the limelight having contributed twenty five thousand pounds to the fund collected by the Princess of Wales to feed the poor of London in commemoration of Queen Victoria s Diamond Jubilee The Earl of Lathom then the Lord Chamberlain who looked like Santa Claus and smiled like Andrew Carnegie was among the guests so were mister and missus Gladstone Since the night he had talked to me across the table I always felt that mister Gladstone was my best friend in England He had a sense of humor so I said Is there anything pointed in asking the tea king to a tea That amused Gladstone He could not forgive Lipton parting his hair in the middle That night I repeated my joke to Tom Instead of smiling he said That s not the way to get on in England It s too Becky Sharpish And then came the day of the queen s salon Victoria did not often have audiences the Prince of Wales or some other member of the royal family usually holding levees and receiving presentations in her name Tom had warned me that there were certain clothes to be worn at a presentation I asked one of my American friends at the embassy who directed me to a hairdresser the most important thing it seemed being one s head She told me also to wear full evening dress with long white gloves and to remove the glove of the right hand The hairdresser asked about my jewels Remembering what Tom had said about junk I said I would wear no jewels She was horrified I would have to wear some she insisted if only a necklace of pearls She tactfully suggested that if my jewels had not arrived I could rent them from mister Somebody on the Strand It was frequently done she said by foreigners My friend at the embassy was politely surprised that Tom s wife would think of renting real or imitation jewels In the end I insisted upon going without jewels I had the required plumes in my hair and the veil that was correct form at court and my lovely evening gown and pearl embroidered slippers which were to me like Cinderella s at the ball Before I left the hotel I asked Tom to look at me critically I was still young very young very much in love and unacquainted with the ways of the world and so heaven came down into my heart when Tom took me into his arms and kissing me said There was never such a lovely queen It was about three o clock when we reached the Pimlico entrance Guards were on duty and men who looked like princes or very important personages in costume white stockings black pumps buckles breeches and gay coats stood at the door Inside the hall a gold carpet stretched to the marble stairs It was a wonderful place and I wanted to stop and look I was conscious of being a rubber neck I might never see another palace again We were guided up wonderful stairs and led into a sumptuous room where with the other guests we waited for the arrival of the queen and the royal family No one does anything or says anything at a salon A drawing room is a sacred rite in England It is recorded on the first page of the news taking precedence over wars decisions of supreme courts famines and international controversies Her Majesty receives To the Englishman to be presented at court is to be set up in England as class to be worshiped by those who have not been in the presence of the queen and to pay a little more to the butcher and milliner I should have loved that drawing room if I could have avoided the presentation It was an impressive picture the queen with a face like a royal coin a fine generous forehead and beautiful nose her intelligent and kindly eyes her ample figure her dignity come from long long years of rule Back of her the Prince of Wales and the Prime Minister who in later years I found myself always comparing to little mister Carnegie the Viscount Curzon with his royal look and in the foreground Sir S Ponsonby Fane in white silk stockings pumps and buckles with sword and gold lace and high collared swallow tailed coat I admired the queen s black moire dress her headdress of priceless lace her diamonds her high necked dress held together with more diamonds and her black gloves in striking contrast to our own I was enjoying the picture Then my name was called I had been thinking such kindly things of England mister Balfour fighting for general education mister Gladstone struggling to make England push Turkey back and save Greece all England raising money for the fire sufferers of Paris and the Indian famine What a humanitarian race they were I felt as pro England as any of the satellites in that room and almost as much awed But back of it all was a natural United States be natural as you were born impulse Neither Back Bay Boston nor Tom s Philadelphia friends had been able to repress it When my name was called and I stepped up I made the little bow I had practised for hours the day before and that morning and then as I looked into the eyes of the queen I held out my hand It was the instinctive action of a free born American I have realized in the years since what a real queen she was Smiling she extended her hand but not to be touched It was a little wave a little imitation of my own impulsive outstretching to a friend then her eyes went to the next person and I was on my way having been presented at court and done what is not done in England Tom s mission in England was important He had friends and there were distinguished people in England who regarded him and his family of sufficient value to take us aboard They were most gracious and kindly But Tom s eyes were not smiling That night my husband said some very frank things to me His position and even the credit of our country to some extent depended upon our conduct He did not say he was ashamed of me and in my heart I do not think he was but he regretted that I had not been trained in the little things upon which England put so much weight He suggested my employing a social secretary What I need Tom I said is a teacher You have told me these customs are not important They are important I need some one to teach them to me and I propose to get a teacher In the personal columns of the Times I had read this advertisement A lady of aristocratic birth and social training desires to be of service to a good paying guest I swallowed my pride and answered it I was not her paying guest but I employed this Scotch lady of aristocratic birth and social experience On the first day at luncheon which we ate privately in my apartment she said In England a knife is held as you hold a pen the handle coming up above the thumb and between the thumb and first finger My sense of humor permitted me to ask after trying it once What do you do when the meat is tough The Scotch aristocrat never smiled It is n t she answered I was humiliated and a little soul sick before that luncheon ended I had been told to break each bite of my bread a lady never bites a piece of bread I had been told to use a knife to separate my fish when I had learned oh so carefully in America to eat fish with a fork and a piece of bread I might have laughed about it all had not so much been at stake even Tom s respect III The Scotch lady of aristocratic birth and social experience lived with me one terrible week On the seventh day I came home from shopping with presents for the twins back in Wisconsin A day or so earlier while my mentor was out of the room I had asked the chef waiter of our floor about himself and his family and found that his family too included twins So with the present for my family I also brought some for his

6509_67147_000003_000001	train-clean-360	The chef waiter was taking the coats of the gentlemen callers I received the guests acknowledged the introductions and then as I removed my own coat I handed him the little package 
none	none	When we were alone the Scotch lady turned to me
6509_67147_000004_000001	train-clean-360	 In England she said ladies never converse with their servants particularly in the presence of guests 
none	none	Then she sealed her doom
6509_67147_000005_000001	train-clean-360	 Ladies never make gifts to their servants she added 
none	none	Their secretaries housekeepers or companions disburse their bounty I remembered the old U S A An American chef waiter might hope to be the father of a President On the ranch I had cooked for men of less education and much worse manners than this domestic who brought my athletic husband s breakfast to his bedside and who happened to be the proud father of twins I would learn table manners from an English lady of aristocratic birth and social experience but when it came to the human act of a little gift to a faithful servant I declared my American independence 
6509_67147_000008_000000	train-clean-360	I was homesick for Wisconsin homesick for real and simple people I wanted to go home 
6509_67147_000008_000001	train-clean-360	That night Tom and I had our first real quarrel and it was over my dismissal of the Scotch lady of aristocratic birth Life became intolerable for a while 
none	none	I dragged through days of bitter homesickness Nothing seemed real No one seemed sincere 
6509_67147_000008_000005	train-clean-360	Life was a stage 
none	none	Everybody seemed to be acting a part and speaking their pieces with guttural voices Even my husband s voice sounded different or else I realized for the first time that Boston apes London English Tom had learned his mother tongue in Boston and now suddenly he seemed like a foreigner to me simply because he spoke like these other foreigners The sun went out of my heaven 
6509_67147_000008_000009	train-clean-360	I was dumb with loneliness and sick with the fear of lost faith 
none	none	Could it be that my husband was affecting these English mannerisms Certainly he seemed at home in England while I seemed to be adrift alone in an arctic ocean I had no friend in England and more and more my husband s special work was engrossing him 
6509_67147_000009_000001	train-clean-360	When we were together I felt tongue tied 
6509_67147_000009_000002	train-clean-360	He had tried to be gentle with me but I was strange in this world of his and lonely and sensitive 
none	none	I had dreamed so much of this world and now that I was in it it was false and petty I longed for the United States for my Northwest for my hills and wide far plains I wanted to meet somebody from Madison who smiled like a friend One day Tom looked at me searchingly and said I must be ill 
6509_67147_000011_000000	train-clean-360	I confessed to a little homesickness 
6509_67147_000011_000001	train-clean-360	Tom became very attentive He took me sightseeing 
none	none	We lunched at the quaint inn where Dickens found his inspiration for Pickwick Papers and where the literary lights of London foregathered and still foregather for luncheon We sat in one of the cozy little stalls just Tom and I Suddenly it swept over me that life had gone all wrong Here was a dream come true and no joy in my heart Tom asked me for my thoughts I told him quite frankly I was thinking of home I was thinking of mother in her cotton house dress with her knitted shawl around her shoulders of father in his jeans and high boots tramping over the range with the men I saw the cow and the pigs and the chickens the smelly corral and the water hole the twins trying to rub each other s face in the mud 
6509_67147_000012_000004	train-clean-360	And I was thinking Tom would n t fit into my world and I could not belong to his 
none	none	That was the second time I heard Tom swear He wanted to know what kind of a snob I thought he was He d be as much at home with dad on the ranch as he was in London
6509_67147_000012_000007	train-clean-360	 The fault is with you he said 
none	none	You re not adaptable and you don t try to be Tom did n t understand 
6509_67147_000013_000001	train-clean-360	He never did 
6509_67147_000013_000002	train-clean-360	In all the years together which he made so rich and happy Tom never understood how hard and bitter a school was that first year of my married life 
6509_67147_000013_000003	train-clean-360	But Tom did try to give me a good time in London 
6509_67147_000013_000004	train-clean-360	He took me to interesting places and we were entertained by a number of people mostly ponderous and stupid 
6509_67147_000013_000005	train-clean-360	Tom did not suggest that we entertain in our turn 
6509_67147_000013_000006	train-clean-360	I think he felt I was not ready for it although even in after years when we talked frankly about many things he would never admit this 
none	none	I shall never forget my first week end party in England 
6509_67147_000014_000001	train-clean-360	I was not well and Tom manlike felt sure the change a trip down to Essex and new people would do me good 
6509_67147_000014_000002	train-clean-360	The thought of the country and a visit with some good simple country folk appealed to me too so I packed the bags and met Tom at Victoria Station at eleven o clock 
none	none	Alas It is a far cry from a Montana ranch to a gentleman s estate in England My vision of a quiet visit down on a farm vanished the minute we stepped off the train 
6509_67147_000014_000006	train-clean-360	Liveried coachmen collected our baggage 
none	none	They seemed to be discussing something then I heard Tom say I guess that s all I ll wire back for the rest of it 
6509_67147_000015_000000	train-clean-360	We were led to a handsome cart drawn by a fine tandem team and Tom and I were alone for a minute 
none	none	My God Mary he burst out didn t you bring any clothes for us I certainly have I retorted sure I was in the right this time Your nightshirt and my nightgown your toilet articles and mine a change of underclothes a clean shirt and two collars for you and my new striped silk waist I shall never forget Tom s expression Do you know where we are going he groaned To one of the grandest houses in England Oh Lord I ought to have told you You ll need all the clothes you have down here And and a valet and maid will unpack the bags oh hell 
6509_67147_000019_000006	train-clean-360	After more of the same kind of talk he began to cook up some yarn to tell the valet 
none	none	Suddenly all that is free born in me rose to the surface Is it the thing for gentlemen to be afraid of the valet I asked my husband Does a servant regulate your life and set your standards Tom was quiet for several moments then he took my hand and said very earnestly Mary don t you ever lose your respect for the real things It will save both of us After a while he added Just the same I ll have to lie out of this baggage hole He did in a very casual laughing way such a positive set of lies that I marveled and began to wonder how much of Tom was acting and how much was real 
6509_67147_000023_000000	train-clean-360	Tom went back to London on the next train and reached the farm with our baggage before it was time to dress for the eight o clock dinner 
none	none	The dinner was long and stupid After dinner the women went into the drawing room and gossiped about politics and personalities until the men joined them when they sat down to cards I did not know how to play cards and so was left with a garrulous old woman who had eaten and drunk over much It had been a long day for me I was ill and tired Suddenly sleep began to overpower me 
6509_67147_000025_000003	train-clean-360	I batted my eyes to keep them open 
none	none	I tried looking at the crystal lights but my leaden eyes could not face them The constant drone of that old woman was putting me to sleep 
6509_67147_000025_000005	train-clean-360	I tried to say a few words now and then to wake myself 
6509_67147_000025_000006	train-clean-360	I felt myself slipping Once my head dropped and came up with a jerk 
6509_67147_000025_000007	train-clean-360	I watched the great French clock 
none	none	Its hands did not seem to move 
6509_67147_000025_000009	train-clean-360	I looked at Tom 
none	none	He was absorbed in his game I could not endure it another minute I went over and said good night to my hostess who had spoken to me only once since my arrival Drowsy as I was I noticed she seemed surprised Oh no I told her I am not ill only very sleepy How good my pillow felt The next morning Tom was cross I had made a faux pas I had shown I was bored and peeved and had gone to bed before the hostess indicated it was bedtime 
6509_67147_000028_000003	train-clean-360	It was n t done in England 
6509_67147_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 What do you do if you can t keep awake I asked 
6509_67147_000029_000001	train-clean-360	 You slip out quietly go to your room ask a maid to call you after you have had forty winks then you go back and pretend you are having a good time said Tom 
none	none	There were some bitter hours after we got back to London But Tom won and I promised to get a companion Then there came into my life the most wonderful of friends She was the widow of a British Army officer who had been killed in India and her only child was dead She was a woman of education and heart she understood my needs all of them and I interested her She had seen great suffering she had a deep feeling for humanity and an honest desire to be of use in the world In the English register my companion was listed as the Honorable Evelyn but we quickly got down to Mary and Eve 
6509_67147_000030_000007	train-clean-360	We loved each other 
none	none	Eve went to France with us a few months later 
6509_67147_000030_000009	train-clean-360	She made me talk French with her My first formal dinner in France was a pleasant surprise 
6509_67147_000030_000010	train-clean-360	It was like a great family party not dull and quiet like the English dinner and ever so much more fun 
6509_67147_000030_000011	train-clean-360	Everybody participated 
none	none	If there was one lion at the table everybody shared him Illustration psixty jpg MY FIRST FORMAL DINNER IN FRANCE There is something in being born on a silken couch 
6509_67147_000032_000001	train-clean-360	Nothing surprises you 
6509_67147_000032_000002	train-clean-360	You are at ease anywhere in the world 
none	none	Eve fitted into Paris as naturally as in her native London I began to feel at home there myself It was a city of happy people care free natural sympathetic There was a lack of restraint which after the oppressive dignity of London was a rare treat 
6509_67147_000032_000005	train-clean-360	No one was critical 
none	none	Every one accepted my halting and faulty French without ridicule or condescension The amiability and the friendliness of the French people thawed my heart and began to lift me out of my slough of homesickness 
6509_67147_000032_000008	train-clean-360	Happiness came back to me 
6509_67147_000033_000000	train-clean-360	There had been hours in England when only the knowledge that a woman s rarest gift was coming to me and that Tom was proud and happy about it kept me from running away back to the simple life of my own United States 
none	none	I was homesick for mother Babies were a mystery to me although I had helped mother with all of hers We had buried three of them in homemade coffins pioneering is a ruthless scythe and only the fit survive 
6509_67147_000034_000003	train-clean-360	I began to understand my mother and the glory in the character which never faltered although she was alone and life had been hard 
none	none	How could I whine when I had Tom and a good friend and life was like a playground 
6509_67147_000035_000000	train-clean-360	I loved the French 
none	none	They regard life with a frankness which sometimes shocked my reserved Boston husband 
6509_67147_000035_000002	train-clean-360	He never accepted intimacy 
none	none	The restraint of old England was still in his blood 
6509_67147_000035_000004	train-clean-360	The free winds of the prairie had swept it from mine 
6509_67147_000036_000000	train-clean-360	My new friends in Paris discovered my happy secret 
none	none	It was my all absorbing thought and I was delighted to be able to discuss it frankly 
6509_67147_000036_000002	train-clean-360	Motherhood is the great and natural event in the life of a woman in France and no one makes a secret of it 
none	none	I was very happy in Paris And then Tom had to go to Vienna Not even Tom Eve and the promised baby could make me happy there In all the world I had seen no place where the line of class distinction was so closely drawn where social customs were so rigid and court forms so sacred as at the Austrian capital Learning the social customs of Vienna seemed as endless as counting the pebbles on the beach and about as useful The clock regulated our habits in Vienna 
6509_67147_000037_000004	train-clean-360	Up to eleven o clock certain attire was proper 
6509_67147_000037_000005	train-clean-360	If your watch stopped you were sure to break a social law 
none	none	I once saw a distinguished diplomat in distress because he found himself at an official function at eleven thirty with a black tie or without one I have forgotten which At first it offended me to receive an invitation or a command to appear at a formal function with an accompanying slip telling exactly what to wear 
6509_67147_000038_000001	train-clean-360	Then I laughed about it 
6509_67147_000039_000000	train-clean-360	Finally I rebelled 
none	none	On the plea of ill health I made Tom do the social honors for me while Eve and I did the museums and the galleries and the music fetes Years later I went back to Vienna and I did not discredit my country 
6509_67147_000039_000003	train-clean-360	But I never loved the city 
6509_67147_000039_000004	train-clean-360	I enjoyed its art its fascinating shops its picturesque streets and people and its beautiful women 
none	none	But for me Vienna has the faults of France and England the poverty and arrogance of London and the frivolity of Paris without their redeeming qualities 
6509_67147_000040_000000	train-clean-360	So I was glad to return to England 
none	none	The second day in London Tom took me to an exhibition important in the art world or at least in the official life of London Everybody who was somebody was there I saw the Princess of Wales and the Marquis of Salisbury who was then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs 
6509_67147_000040_000004	train-clean-360	I saw mister Balfour so handsome and gracious that I refused to believe there had ever been cause to call him Bloody Balfour There was something kingly about him yet he was simply mister Balfour 
none	none	Years afterward I realized that to know mister Balfour is either to worship him or hate him No one takes the middle course I had begun to have a beautiful time that afternoon I felt happy acutely conscious of my blessings and of one coming blessing in particular mister Gladstone joined us and Sir Henry Irving came over to speak to Eve She told him I had just said that England had a mold for handsome men 
6509_67147_000041_000003	train-clean-360	Irving was interesting and striking though certainly not handsome but he took the compliment to himself smiled bowed his thanks and said 
none	none	And America for beautiful women 
6509_67147_000043_000000	train-clean-360	mister Gladstone too could indulge in small talk 
none	none	You should have seen her rosy cheeks before she went to the Continent he said and added kindly that I looked very tired and should go down to Hawarden Castle and rest
6509_67147_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh I explained happily it is n t that I m not tired 
none	none	It is such a happy reason I felt Eve gasp mister Gladstone opened his kind eyes very wide and his heavy chin settled down in his collar 
6509_67147_000044_000003	train-clean-360	It was the last bad break I made 
none	none	But it was a blessing to me for it robbed all social form of terror For the first time I realized that custom is merely a matter of geography One takes off one s shoes to enter the presence of the ruler of Persia One wears a black tie until eleven o clock in Vienna or does n t One uses fish knives in England until he dines with royalty then one must manage with a fork and a piece of bread One dresses for dinner always and waits for the hostess to say it is time and speaks only to one s neighbor at table 
6509_67147_000044_000010	train-clean-360	In France one guest speaks to any or all of the others all one s friends extend congratulations if a baby is coming one shares all his joys with friends 
6509_67147_000044_000011	train-clean-360	But in England nobody must know and everybody must be surprised 
6509_67147_000044_000012	train-clean-360	No one ever speaks of himself in England 
none	none	They are sensitive about everything personal But there is an underground and very perfect system by which everything about everybody is known and noised about and discussed with everybody except the person in question It is a mysterious and elaborate hypocrisy With the aid of Eve I made a thorough study of the geography of social customs 
6509_67147_000045_000001	train-clean-360	I learned the ways of Europe of the Orient and of South America 
none	none	It is easier to understand races if one understands the psychology of their customs I realized that social amenities are too often neglected in America and our manners sometimes truthfully called crude But I told myself with pride that our truly cultivated people will not tolerate a social form that is not based on human kindly instincts It was not until the World War flooded Europe with American boys and girls that I realized the glory of our social standards and the great need to have our own people understand those standards IV Fear is the destroyer of peace I knew no peace until I learned not to be afraid of conventions The three most wretched years in my life might easily have been avoided by a little training at home or at school I realize now the unhappiness of those first years of my married life I was awkward and ill at ease in a world that valued social poise above knowledge From my childhood I had loved honest sincere people After my marriage I met distinguished men and women even a few who might be called great but they too had their affectations and petty vanities Being young I judged them harshly because they set what I considered too much store upon absurd conventions In the course of my travels since I have come to realize that social customs are a simple matter of geography What is proper in England is bad form in France and many customs that were correct in Vienna would be intolerable in Spain In the formal circles of Vienna no one spoke to anybody without an introduction In Spain there was a more subtle and truly aristocratic standard The assumption was that anybody one met in the home of one s host was desirable and it was courtesy therefore to begin a conversation with any guest This is the attitude also in parts of France But in those first months I had not acquired my philosophy I lived through homesick days and some that were hard and bitter I stayed with Tom that first year only because I was too bewildered to take any initiative and because I kept hoping that things would right themselves and I would wake out of my nightmare My baby came in the second year and then I could not go home The simple life of my own people slipped very very far away We made a hurried trip back to the United States that summer but Tom would not consent to my going West His own family wanted to see our baby and they decided that the little fellow had traveled enough and should not be subjected to the hardships of a cross country train trip So Tom sent for mother and the twins to come to us and they arrived at the Waldorf Hotel where we were staying Dear simple mother in her terrible clothes and the twins got up with more thought for economy than for beauty I shopped extravagantly with them The youngsters wanted to see everything in New York but mother despite all of those hard lonely years in our rough country and the many interesting things for her to do and see in New York mother wanted nothing better than to stay with the baby With all the children she had brought into this world one might think she had seen enough of babies But she adored my little son How near she seemed to me then How hungry I had been for her without realizing it I felt that she loved my baby boy as she had never loved me or any of her own children And I understood why mother never had had time to love her own babies In the struggle for existence of those hard years she had never had a minute to indulge in the pure joy of having her baby I sat watching her with her first grandchild so sweet in his exquisite hand sewn little clothes and suddenly I found myself crying hysterically Mother was very dear to me from that day Later in this chronicle I want to give a chapter to my mother and what we both suffered during this period of her visit to New York for it marked the climax of my own development When mother and the children started off on their return trip to the West Tom sent them flowers and candy and fruit He had already generously put financial worry away from my family for all time but I knew that he was a little ashamed of some of mother s crudities I wondered why I did not feel ashamed I was very very glad I did not It gave me something tangible to cling to a sure consciousness of power that comes of knowing one possesses the true pride to rise above the opinions of other people I would have given my life that day to be able to assure my family that material security which they owed to my husband who neither loved nor understood them I looked down the years and saw myself crushed by a burden of indebtedness to a man I felt I no longer loved Only mother s grateful simple happiness eased my hurt I had never approached my mother but I knew now that if her natural dignity and great kind heart had been given the advantages that the women in my husband s family took as a matter of course she would have been superior to them all Yet they barely tolerated mother no more I longed to go home to my own warm hearty open West I stood on the ferry after they had gone thinking that if my family were not so deeply indebted to my husband I would leave him I suppose I did not really mean that thought but it made me unhappy I felt disloyal and dishonest Finally I told Tom There was a scene but from that day he began to understand me and things were better A few days later we came home from a dinner party and after going to the baby s room for a minute Tom asked me to stay and talk But he did not talk For a long time he sat smoking and thinking I knew he had something on his mind and I waited Finally I realized that he was embarrassed Can I help Is it something I have done that has embarrassed you I asked That was many years ago but I can never forget the look Tom gave me It held all the love of our courtship and something besides that I had never seen in his face before For God s sake never say that to me again he cried Embarrassed me I am proud of you you never can know how proud I was sitting here trying to think how to tell you something my mother said about you and just what it means His mother My heart dropped His mother had never said anything about me excepting criticism I had been a bitter disappointment to her Whatever she said would be politely cruel at best a damning with faint praise She said my husband went on that she is very happy in our marriage completely satisfied and that she has come to be proud of you I don t know how to tell you just what that means I knew I knew his mother could have given me no higher praise I had learned what to her were the essentials I had cultivated the manner she placed above price But the realization brought self distrust Had I lost my honesty and sincerity Tom went on to tell me that his mother had particularly admired my attitude toward my own mother and the manner in which I met every little failing of hers She felt I had a sense of true values in people and that the simplicity and sureness with which I had met this situation was the essence of good breeding I had not thought it possible that Tom s mother could understand my feeling for my mother and my honest pride in her real worth Perhaps I reflected I had been unjust to my mother in law I knew what a shock I had been to her in the early days of our marriage and I knew only too well that even Tom had often regretted my ignorance of social usages They are simple customs and should be taught in every school in America but I had not learned them I was happy that night and for days afterward Then we went back to Europe Tom knew people on the steamer to whom I took a dislike They were bold and even vulgar and Tom admitted that he did not admire them I made up my mind we should avoid them The next afternoon I found Tom and that group walking the deck arm in arm chatting affably When we were alone I asked Tom how he could do it I know now that a man cannot hold an official position like Tom s and ignore politically important people But he only said rather carelessly and with a laugh that it was one of the prices a man pays for public office After that I noticed that my husband was known to nearly every one He had a glad hand and a smile for the public because it was the public I watched to see if he had a slightly different smile for the people of Back Bay and his own particular social class sometimes I thought he had and it made me a little soul sick I longed for a home for my baby and a few friends I could love and really enjoy I was not fitted to be the wife of a public man It was the poverty and crudeness of my youth that had made me intolerant One of the big lessons life has taught me is that people can be amiable tolerant and even friendly and still be sincere The pleasantry of social relations among the civilized peoples of the earth is a mere garment we wear for our own protection and to cover our feelings It is the oil of the machinery of life I have found that men and women who take part in the big work of the earth wear that garment of civility and graciousness and yet have their strong friendships and even their bitter enmities But I did not understand this when we went back to Europe I only knew that my husband was amiable to people he did not like and I questioned how deep his affection for me went How much of his kindness to me was just the easiest way and the manner of a gentleman A hard and bare youth had made me supersensitive and suspicious and narrow I wanted to measure other people by the standards of my own primitive years Out on the frontier we had judged life in the rough Courage and truth were the essentials A man fought his enemies out in the open and made no compromises There was nothing easy in life no smooth rhythm And I tried to drag forward with me as I went the bold ethics of the frontier I resented good manners because I believed they were a cloak of hypocrisy A few months after we returned to Europe the shadow of death crossed our path swiftly and terribly My little son died Other babies came to us later but that first little boy had brought more into my life than all the rest of the world could ever give He had restored my faith in life my hope and for a while was all my joy People were kind but I felt that many called merely because it was good form the thing to do Bitterness was creeping into my heart Yet why should it not be the thing to do to call on a bereaved mother It is a gesture of humanity Tom seemed very far away I felt that his pride was hurt perhaps his vanity for he had boasted of the little fellow and loved to show him off How little I understood I bring myself to tell these intimate things because there is a lesson in them for other women because I resent that any free born American citizen should be handicapped by lacking so small and easily acquired a possession as poise poise that comes with knowledge of the simple rules of the social game It is my hope that this honest confession of my own feelings due directly to lack of training may help other women and particularly other mothers whose children are now in the plastic years It was my utter lack of appreciation of manners and customs in my husband s class that estranged me from Tom I was resentful and antagonistic merely because I was different My husband was suffering even as I was suffering but no one realized it least of all myself Every one was especially kind to me because I was a woman People are rarely attentive and tender with men when loss comes Men are supposed to be strong and self controlled their hearts are rated as a little less deep and tender than the hearts of women yet when men are truly hurt they need love and care even as little children A month after the baby s death Tom and I were walking along the Embankment in London one Saturday afternoon when we met a small girl carrying a little child The baby was too tired to walk any farther it was dirty and was crying bitterly Tom stopped spoke to the girl and offered to carry the baby who soon quieted down on Tom s shoulder At the end of that walk Tom s light summer suit was ruined I expected him to turn with some trivial jesting remark but he said nothing I looked at him and saw that his face was set and hard and his eyes wet Without looking at me he said Don t speak to me now That moment of silence revealed to me my husband s character better than months of talking The next day my husband came to me and said Mary I have asked for a leave of absence We are going back to the United States We are going out West to have a visit with your family Two years before I had believed that Tom would not fit into my Northwest But in twenty four hours Tom and my father were old pals He was as much at home with mother and the children as I and all the neighbors liked him He was interested in everything on the ranch and even in the small town life of the village He interested father in putting modern equipment on the ranch He went hunting with the men played games with the children visited the little district schoolhouse and found joy in buying gifts for the youngsters When mother made a big platter full of taffy he pulled as enthusiastically as a boy As I stood at the corral one day and watched Tom with my youngest brother I remembered him at the court of saint James and I began to understand Tom was natural It was just a part of him to be kindly and gracious to everybody I had never seen him angry with men of his own type but I saw him furious enough to commit murder when a man on the ranch tied up a dog and beat her for running away In after years I saw Tom angry with men of his own class I saw him waging long bitter fights against public men who had betrayed public trust Something barbaric in me was satisfied that my kind gently bred man was one with the men of my own tribe who fought man and beast and the elements to take civilization farther west Almost a generation slipped by between that visit to the West and the next scene in my life of which I shall write Many things of personal and of national importance happened meantime but they have nothing to do with this message to women I was in France when the World War began I had been in Vienna again and in England at regular intervals I had learned to accept life as I found it and to get much joy out of living Sometimes I chafed a little under the demands of social life and needless formalities but I accepted them as inevitable Then the world was torn in two The earth dripped in blood and sorrow Life became more difficult than on the frontier and more elemental I was present in the first year of the war in a house where the King and Queen of the Belgians were guests where great generals and great statesmen had gathered on great and earnest and desperate business I was only an onlooker and I noticed what every one else was too absorbed to see As the evening progressed I realized that pomp and ceremony had died with the youth of France King generals statesmen met as human men pitting their wits against one another desperately struggling to find a way out of the hell into which they were falling Twice the king rose to his feet and no one else stood They were all too deep in the terrible question of war When the meeting was over and the guests of the house ready to retire the little queen said very quietly Madam may not my husband and I occupy this room together It is very kind of you to arrange two suites for us but I am sure there are many guests here to night and anyway I prefer to be near him The war had done that Who would expect a queen to think of the problems of housing guests even a great queen And the war had made the king not the king but her man very near and very dear Many other conventions I saw die by the way as the war progressed Then America came in There is a temptation to talk about America in the war but after all that has no bearing on my story Soon after the United States entered American men and women began to arrive in Europe in great numbers I met them everywhere sight seeing in offices at universities at embassies and consulates I met them and loved them and suffered for them I was proud of something they brought to France that France needed and I have no doubt that many of them took back to America something from France that we need For pure mental quality and courage no people on earth could match what the American girls took to France It was the finest stuff in the world They knew how to meet hardship without grumbling They knew how to run a kitchen and see that hungry men were fed They knew how to nurse to run telephones automobiles anything that needed to be done Some failed and fell by the wayside but they were the smallest possible percentage Those American girls knew how to do everything almost everything Two wonderful girls one who ran a telephone for the army and another in the Y both from the Middle West were at headquarters the day the King and Queen of the Belgians arrived With others they were sent to serve tea and they served it The Y girl taking a young captain whose presence made her eyes glisten to her Majesty said Captain Blank meet the queen And the queen holding out her hand and never batting an eye to show that all the conventions had been thrown to the winds said Captain I am very happy to meet you They served tea served it to the king the queen the general of the American army and other important people There was cake besides tea and it was not easy to drink tea and eat cake standing The telephone girl insisted that General Pershing must sit down The king was standing and of course General Pershing continued to do the same Will you sit down said another girl to the king There are plenty of chairs That girl had done her job in France a job of which many a man might have been proud and on her left breast she wore a military medal for valor The king touched the medal smiled at her and said he was glad there were plenty of chairs for he knew places where there were not But General Pershing and his cake still bothered the little Illinois girl who went back at him again and asked him to sit down and enjoy his cake The king indicated to the general to be seated No one but General Pershing would have known what to do between the rule to stand when a king stands and the rule to obey the order of the king He gracefully placed his plate on the side of a table half seated himself on it which was a compromise and went on enjoying himself The king sat down If any one had told that girl the sacredness of the convention she had ignored she would have suffered as keenly as I had suffered in my youth It was such a simple thing to learn yet who in the middle of a war would think of stopping to run a class in etiquette The point is that any girl capable of crossing half the world to do a big job and a hard one in a foreign land should have been given the opportunity to learn the rules of social intercourse I saw some American girls and men on official occasions at private houses and at official functions They were clever attractive fascinating but when they came to the end of their visit they rose to go and then stood talking talking talking They did not know exactly how to get away They did not want to be abrupt nor appear to be glad to leave It would have been so simple for some one to say to them One of the first rules in social life is to get up and go when you are at the end of your visit I was in Paris when Marshal Joffre gave the American Ambassador mister Sharp the gold oak leaves as a token of France s veneration for America There were young girls around us who did not hesitate to comment on everybody there One little New Jersey girl insisted rather audibly that Clemenceau looked like the old watchman on their block and a boy a young officer complained that General Foch had not won as many decorations as General Bliss and General Pershing Some youngsters asked high officers for souvenirs Many French people perhaps did worse but it hurt me to see even a few of our own splendid young people guilty of such crudities because our American youth is so fine at heart When the great artist Rodin died I went to the public ceremony held in his memory Suddenly I realized that America and France each had something left that war had not destroyed A young American art student who had given up his career for his uniform and was invalided back in Paris minus an arm stood very near me As he turned to Colonel House I heard him say Rodin s going is another battle lost It was typical of the American quality of which we have cause to boast the fineness of heart that is in our young people The day of the armistice in France those of us who are older stood looking on and realizing that all class distinctions all race age and pursuits had been wiped off the map People were just people There was a complete abandon I am not a young woman but I was caught up by the fury of the crowd and swept along singing laughing weeping Young soldiers passing would reach out to touch my hand sometimes to kiss me That night I believed that the war had broken down many of our barriers that all foolish customs had died that the terrific price paid in human blood and human suffering had at least left a world honest with itself simple and ready for good comradeship that men were measured by manliness and women by ideals It was a part of the armistice day fervor but I believed it And then I came home and went to Newport V Just before I came home to America in the Spring of nineteen nineteen I went to Essex for a week end in one of those splendid old estates which are the pride of England It was not my first visit but I was awed anew by the immensity of the place its culture and wealth which seemed to have existed always its aged power and pride Whole lives had been woven into its window curtains and priceless rugs centuries of art lived in the great tapestries successive generations of great artists had painted the ancestors of the present owner All three sons of that house went into the war One never returned from Egypt another is buried in Flanders Only the youngest returned At first glance the smooth life seemed unchanged in the proud old house But before sundown of my first day there I knew that life had put its acid test to the shield and proved it pure gold War taxes had fallen heavily on the estate and it was to be leased to an American Until then the castle was a home to less fortunate buddies of the owner s sons But these were not the tests I mean neither these nor the courage and the poise of that family in the face of their terrible loss nor their effort to make every one happy and comfortable It was an incident at tea time that opened my eyes The youngest son now the only son came in from a cross country tramp and brought with him a pleasant faced young woman whom he introduced as one of my pals in the war That was enough Lady R greeted her as one of the royal blood The girl was the daughter of a Manchester plumber She had done her bit and it had been a hard bit in the war and now she was stenographer in a near by village Later in the afternoon the story came out She had been clerk in the Q M corps and after her brother s death she asked for service near the front something hard She got it The mules in the supply and ammunition trains must be fed and it was her job to get hay to a certain division The girl had ten motor trucks to handle and twenty men three of them noncommissioned officers After four days during which trucks had disappeared and mules gone unfed she asked the colonel for the rank of first sergeant with only enlisted men under her Her first official orders were All trucks must stay together If one breaks down the others will stop and help The second day of her new command she met our young host who needed a truck to move supplies and tried to commandeer one of hers When she refused he ordered her He was a captain I am under orders to get those ten loads of hay to the mules was her reply What will you do if I just take one of them asked the captain You won t said the girl confidently I must get a truck he insisted What can you do about it if I take one of yours England needs men she answered But if you made it necessary I d have to shoot you If the mules are n t fed you and other men can t fight If you were fit to be a captain you d know that The young captain told the story himself and his family enjoyed it evidently admiring the Manchester lassie who sat there as red as a poppy They did not bend to the plumber s daughter nor seem to try to lift her to the altars of their ancient hall Every one met on new ground a ground where human beings had faced death together It was sign of a new fellowship too deep and fine for even a fish knife to sever There was no consciousness of ancient class There was only to day and to morrow It was the America I love that spirit The best America valuing a human being for personal worth Then I sailed for home I went to Newport to the Atlantic coast resorts They were all the same The world had changed but not my own country I saw more show of wealth more extravagance more carelessness more reckless morals than ever before and horrible to contemplate springing up in the new world the narrow social standards which war had torn from the old Social lines tightened Men who had been overwhelmingly welcome while they wore shoulder straps were now rated according to bank accounts or family The doughboy shavetail a hero before the armistice or the aviator who held the stage until November eleventh once he put on his serge suit and went back to selling insurance or keeping books became a nodding acquaintance sometimes not even that I was heartsick I thought often of those splendid men I had met in France and of the girls who poured tea for the King of the Belgians I wondered if any one back home was just nodding to them Everywhere was the blatant show of new wealth New money always glitters I saw it in cars with aluminum hoods and gold fittings diamonds big as birds eggs ermine coats in the daytime jeweled heels at night Bad breeding plus new money shouted from every street corner At private dinners I ate foods that I knew were served merely because they were expensive glutton feasts with twice as much as any one could eat with comfort One day I went to market the kind of a market to which my mother would have gone and I saw women whose husbands labored hard scorning to buy any but porterhouse steaks merely because porterhouse steak stood for prosperity In Washington I met a new kind of American a type that has sprung up suddenly like an evil toadstool It is a fungous disease that spreads Some hangs from old American stock some dangles from recent plantings all of it is snobbish and offensive It wears foreign clothes and affects foreign ways sometimes even foreign accents It chops and mumbles its words like English servants who speak their language badly Some of this is acquired at fashionable finishing schools or from foreign secretaries and servants These new Americans try to appear superior and distinctive by scorning all things American They want English chintzes in their homes French brocades and Italian silks and do not even know that some of these very textiles from America have won prizes in Europe since nineteen twelve An American manufacturer told me he has to stamp his cretonne English style print to sell it in this country This new species of American apes royalty It goes in for crests It may have made its money in gum shoes or chewing tobacco but it hires a genealogist to dig up a shield Fine if you are entitled to a crest But fake genealogists will cook up a coat for the price There are crests on the motor cars crests on the stationery on the silver the toilet articles there are sometimes even crests on the servants buttons and on linen and underclothes Fake crests are the first step down and like all lies they lead to other lies The next step is ancestors Selling and painting ancestors is another business which thrives around New York Philadelphia and Washington And the public swallows it They swallow each other s ancestors Even old families take these new descendants as a matter of course One of these new Americans recently gave a large feast in Washington with every out of season delicacy in profusion The only simple thing in the house was the mind of the hostess That night it was a tangled skein I saw she was worried Her house was full of potentates the wives of two cabinet officers and missus Coolidge She left the room twice after the dinner hour had arrived and it was late when dinner was finally announced Later in the evening one of the servants whispered to the hostess that she was wanted on the telephone the State Department She returned to the drawing room looking as if she had just heard of a death in the family The guests began considerately to leave Her expensive party was a dismal failure As I have known her husband for years I asked if I could be of any use Illustration pone hundred four jpg HER EXPENSIVE PARTY WAS A DISMAL FAILURE It s too late now he said She had the Princess Bibesco and the Princess Lubomirska here and the wife of the Vice President and she didn t know the precedence they took She held up dinner half an hour trying to get the State Department and now they tell her she guessed wrong It s a tragedy to her I confess I did not feel very sorry for that woman I remembered my little Indiana girl who introduced the captain to the Queen of Belgium I began to feel as if all America were like the De Morgan jingle Great fleas have little fleas On their backs to bite em And little fleas have lesser fleas And so ad infinitum Then I took a trip across the continent stopping off in Indiana to see my little Y friends It was like a bath for my soul Brains count out West Anybody who tries to show off is snubbed You must do something to be anything in the Middle West just to have something doesn t count You don t list your ancestors as you must in Virginia or the Carolinas but to feel self respecting you must do something I was happy to renew my wartime friendships Those who have not shared a great work or a greater tragedy will not understand these bonds The same young friend who served tea to the king took me to a musicale She wore her war medal One of the guests a lady from Virginia who claims four coats of arms was impressed by the girl s medal and the fact that she had entertained the king The girl had married since the war a fine young Irish lawyer with a family name which once belonged to a king but which since hard times hit the old sod has been a butt for song and jest The name did not impress the lady from Virginia You have such an interesting face she said What was your name before your marriage Oh it was much less interesting than my husband s answered my young Y friend and lifting the conversation out of the personal she asked Have you read mister Keynes The Economic Consequences of the Peace I had n t read it myself she confided to me later but it was the first new book I could think of That is good American manners and what the French call savoir faire The Far West still keeps the American inheritance of open hearted hospitality and its provincialism The West has inherited some of the finest virtues of our country and if it is not bitten by Back Bay Philadelphia Virginia or Charleston it will grow up into its mother s finest child No church west of Chicago no God west of Denver we used to hear when I was a child But to day the churches are part of the community and even men go People in the West do not seem to go to church merely out of respect for the devil and a conscience complex but because they like to Churches and schools are important places in the West President Harding has said that he hopes more and more people will learn to want to pray in a closet alone with God There are many people like that in our Middle West I say this because I hope it may help other American women who love their country to fight for honesty and purpose in our national life and for tolerance and respect for the simple things in our private lives

tm electronic works Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support Project Gutenberg tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U S unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition Most people start at our Web site which has the
