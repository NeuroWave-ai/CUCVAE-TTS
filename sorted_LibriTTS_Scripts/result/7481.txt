INTRODUCTION BY W TEIGNMOUTH SHORE ANTHONY TROLLOPE Born London April twenty four eighteen fifteen Died London December six eighteen eighty two INTRODUCTION There is the proper mood and the just environment for the reading as well as for the writing of works of fiction and there can be no better place for the enjoying of a novel by Anthony Trollope than under a tree in Kensington Gardens of a summer day Under a tree in the avenue that reaches down from the Round Pond to the Long Water There perhaps more than anywhere else lingers the early Victorian atmosphere As we sit beneath our tree we see in the distance the dun red brick walls of Kensington Palace where one night Princess Victoria was awakened to hear that she was Queen there in quaint hideously ugly Victorian rooms are to be seen Victorian dolls and other playthings the whole environment is early Victorian Here to the mind s eye how easy it is to conjure up ghosts of men in baggy trousers and long flowing whiskers of prim women in crinolines in hats with long trailing feathers and with ridiculous little parasols or with Grecian bends and chignons church parading to and fro beneath the trees or by the water s edge perchance even the fascinating Lady Crinoline and the elegant mister Macassar Jones whose history has been written by Clerk Charley in the pages we are introducing to the gentle reader As a poetaster of an earlier date has written Where Kensington high o er the neighbouring lands Midst green and sweets a royal fabric stands And sees each spring luxuriant in her bowers A snow of blossoms and a wild of flowers The dames of Britain oft in crowds repair To gravel walks and unpolluted air Here while the town in damps and darkness lies They breathe in sunshine and see azure skies Each walk with robes of various dyes bespread Seems from afar a moving tulip bed Where rich brocades and glossy damasks glow And chintz the rival of the showery bow Indeed the historian of social manners when dealing with the Victorian period will perforce have recourse to the early volumes of Punch and to the novels of Thackeray Dickens and Trollope There are certain authors of whom personally we know little but of whose works we cannot ever know enough such a one for example as Shakespeare others of whose lives we know much but for whose works we can have but scant affection such is Doctor Johnson others who are intimate friends in all their aspects as Goldsmith and Charles Lamb yet others who do not quite come home to our bosoms whose writings we cannot entirely approve but for whom and for whose works we find a soft place somewhere in our hearts and such a one is Anthony Trollope His novels are not for every day reading any more than are those of Marryat and Borrow to take two curious examples There are times and moods and places in which it would be quite impossible to read The Three Clerks others in which this story is almost wholly delightful With those who are fond of bed reading Trollope should ever be a favourite and it is no small compliment to say this for small is the noble army of authors who have given us books which can enchant in the witching hour between waking and slumber It is probable that all lovers of letters have their favourite bed books Thackeray has charmingly told us of his Of the few novels that can really be enjoyed when the reader is settling down for slumber almost all have been set forth by writers who consciously or unconsciously have placed character before plot Thackeray himself Miss Austen Borrow Marryat Sterne Dickens Goldsmith and Trollope Books are very human in their way as what else should they be children of men and women as they are Just as with human friends so with book friends first impressions are often misleading good literary coin sometimes seems to ring untrue but the untruth is in the ear of the reader not of the writer For instance Trollope has many odd and irritating tricks which are apt to scare off those who lack perseverance and who fail to understand that there must be something admirable in that which was once much admired by the judicious He shares with Thackeray the sinful habit of pulling up his readers with a wrench by reminding them that what is set before them is after all mere fiction and that the characters in whose fates they are becoming interested are only marionettes With Dickens and others he shares the custom so irritating to us of to day of ticketing his personages with clumsy descriptive labels such as in The Three Clerks mister Chaffanbrass Sir Gregory Hardlines Sir Warwick West End mister Neverbend mister Whip Vigil mister Nogo and mister Gitemthruet He must plead guilty also to some bad ways peculiarly his own or which he made so by the thoroughness with which he indulged in them He moralizes in his own person in deplorable manner is not this terrible Poor Katie dear darling bonnie Katie sweet sweetest dearest child why oh why has that mother of thine that tender hearted loving mother put thee unguarded in the way of such perils as this Has she not sworn to herself that over thee at least she would watch as a hen over her young so that no unfortunate love should quench thy young spirit or blanch thy cheek s bloom Is this not sufficient to make the gentlest reader swear to himself Fortunately this and some other appalling passages occur after the story is in full swing and after the three Clerks and those with whom they come into contact have proved themselves thoroughly interesting companions Despite all his old fashioned tricks Trollope does undoubtedly succeed in giving blood and life to most of his characters they are not as a rule people of any great eccentricity or of profound emotions but ordinary every day folk such as all of us have met and loved or endured Trollope fills very adequately a space between Thackeray and Dickens of whom the former deals for the most part with the upper ten the latter with the lower ten Trollope with the suburban and country town ten the three together giving us a very complete and detailed picture of the lives led by our grandmothers and grandfathers whose hearts were in the same place as our own but whose manners of speech of behaviour and of dress have now entered into the vague region known as the days of yore The Three Clerks is an excellent example of Trollope s handiwork The development of the plot is sufficiently skilful to maintain the reader s interest and the major part of the characters is lifelike always well observed and sometimes depicted with singular skill and insight Trollope himself liked the work well The plot is not so good as that of The Macdermots nor are any characters in the book equal to those of missus Proudie and the Warden but the work has a more continued interest and contains the first well described love scene that I ever wrote The passage in which Kate Woodward thinking she will die tries to take leave of the lad she loves still brings tears to my eyes when I read it I had not the heart to kill her I never could do that And I do not doubt that they are living happily together to this day The lawyer Chaffanbrass made his first appearance in this novel and I do not think that I have cause to be ashamed of him But this novel now is chiefly noticeable to me from the fact that in it I introduced a character under the name of Sir Gregory Hardlines by which I intended to lean very heavily on that much loathed scheme of competitive examination of which at that time Sir Charles Trevelyan was the great apostle Sir Gregory Hardlines was intended for Sir Charles Trevelyan as any one at the time would know who had taken an interest in the Civil Service We always call him Sir Gregory Lady Trevelyan said to me afterwards when I came to know her husband I never learned to love competitive examination but I became and am very fond of Sir Charles Trevelyan Sir Stafford Northcote who is now Chancellor of the Exchequer was then leagued with his friend Sir Charles and he too appears in The Three Clerks under the feebly facetious name of Sir Warwick West End But for all that The Three Clerks was a good novel Which excerpt from Trollope s Autobiography serves to throw light not only upon the novel in question but also upon the character of its author Trollope served honestly and efficiently for many a long year in the Post Office achieving his entrance through a farce of an examination The story of that examination he says is given accurately in the opening chapters of a novel written by me called The Three Clerks If any reader of this memoir would refer to that chapter and see how Charley Tudor was supposed to have been admitted into the Internal Navigation Office that reader will learn how Anthony Trollope was actually admitted into the Secretary s office of the General Post Office in eighteen thirty four Poe s description of the manner in which he wrote The Raven is incredible being probably one of his solemn and sombre jokes equally incredible is Trollope s confession of his humdrum mechanical methods of work Doubtless he believed he was telling the whole truth but only here and there in his Autobiography does he permit to peep out touches of light which complete the portrait of himself It is impossible that for the reader any character in fiction should live which has not been alive to its creator so is it with Trollope who speaking of his characters says I have wandered alone among the rooks and woods crying at their grief laughing at their absurdities and thoroughly enjoying their joy I have been impregnated with my own creations till it has been my only excitement to sit with the pen in my hand and drive my team before me at as quick a pace as I could make them travel There is a plain matter of factness about Trollope s narratives which is convincing making it difficult for the reader to call himself back to fact and to remember that he has been wandering in a world of fiction In The Three Clerks the young men who give the tale its title are all well drawn To accomplish this in the cases of Alaric and Charley Tudor was easy enough for a skilled writer but to breathe life into Harry Norman was difficult At first he appears to be a lay figure a priggish dummy of an immaculate hero a failure in portraiture but toward the end of the book it is borne in on us that our dislike had been aroused by the lifelike nature of the painting dislike toward a real man priggish indeed in many ways but with a very human strain of obstinacy and obdurateness which few writers would have permitted to have entered into the make up of any of their heroes Of the other men Undy Scott may be named as among the very best pieces of portraiture in Victorian fiction touch after touch of detail is added to the picture with really admirable skill and Undy lives in the reader s memory as vividly as he must have existed in the imagination of his creator There are some strong and curious passages in Chapter XLIV in which the novelist contrasts the lives and fates of Varney Bill Sykes and Undy Scott they stir the blood proving uncontestibly that Undy Scott was as real to Trollope as he is to us The figure of Undy swinging from a gibbet at the broad end of Lombard Street would have an effect Ah my fingers itch to be at the rope Trollope possessed the rare and beautiful gift of painting the hearts and souls of young girls and of this power he has given an admirable example in Katie Woodward It would be foolish and cruel to attempt to epitomize or rather to draw in miniature this portrait that Trollope has drawn at full length were it not for any other end those that are fond of all that is graceful and charming in young womanhood should read The Three Clerks so becoming the friend nay the lover of Katie Her sisters are not so attractive simply because nature did not make them so a very fine faithful woman Gertrude a dear thing Linda All three worthy of their mother she who as we are told in a delicious phrase though adverse to a fool could sympathize with folly These eight portraits are grouped in the foreground of this conversation piece the background being filled with slighter but always live figures Particularly striking as being somewhat unusual with Trollope is the depiction of the public house The Pig and Whistle in Norfolk Street the landlady missus Davis and the barmaid Norah Geraghty We can almost smell the gin the effluvia of stale beer the bad tobacco hear the simpers and see the sidlings of Norah feel sick with and at Charley he got up and took her hand and as he did so he saw that her nails were dirty He put his arms round her waist and kissed her and as he caressed her his olfactory nerves perceived that the pomatum in her hair was none of the best and then he felt very sick But oh why olfactory nerves Was it vulgar in early Victorian days to call a nose a nose How far different would have been Dickens s treatment of such characters and such a scene out of missus Davis and Norah he would have extracted fun and it would never have entered into his mind to have brought such a man as Charley into contact with them in a manner that must hurt that young hero s susceptibilities Thackeray would have followed a third way judging by his treatment of the Fotheringay and Captain Costigan partly humorous partly satirical partly serious Trollope was not endowed with any spark of wit his satire tends towards the obvious and his humour is mild almost unconscious as if he could depict for us what of the humorous came under his observation without himself seeing the fun in it Where he sets forth with intent to be humorous he sometimes attains almost to the tragic there are few things so sad as a joke that misses fire or a jester without sense of humour Of the genius of a writer of fiction there is scarce any other test so sure as this of the reality of his characters Few are the authors that have created for us figures of fiction that are more alive to us than the historic shadows of the past whose dead bones historians do not seem to be able to clothe with flesh and blood Trollope hovers on the border line between genius and great talent or rather it would be more fair to say that with regard to him opinions may justly differ For our own part we hold that his was not talent streaked with genius but rather a jog trot genius alloyed with mediocrity He lacked the supreme unconsciousness of supreme genius for of genius as of talent there are degrees There are characters in The Three Clerks that live those who have read the tale must now and again when passing Norfolk Street Strand regret that it would be waste of time to turn down that rebuilt thoroughfare in search of The Pig and Whistle which was one of these small tranquil shrines of Bacchus in which the god is worshipped with as constant a devotion though with less noisy demonstration of zeal than in his larger and more public temples Alas lovers of Victorian London must lament that such shrines grow fewer day by day the great thoroughfares know them no more they hide nervously in old world corners and in them you will meet old world characters who not seldom seem to have lost themselves on their way to the pages of Charles Dickens Despite the advent of electric tramways Hampton would still be recognized by the three clerks the little village of Hampton with its old fashioned country inn and its bright quiet grassy river Hampton is now as it then was the well loved resort of cockneydom So let us alight from the tramcar at Hampton and look about on the outskirts of the village for a small old fashioned brick house abutting on the road but looking from its front windows on to a lawn and garden which stretched down to the river Surbiton Cottage it is called Let us peep in at that merry happy family party and laugh at Captain Cuttwater waking from his placid sleep rubbing his eyes in wonderment and asking What the devil is all the row about But it is only with our mind s eye that we can see Surbiton Cottage a cottage in the air it is but more substantial to some of us than many a real jerry built villa of red brick and stucco Old fashioned seem to us the folk who once dwelt there old fashioned in all save that their hearts were true and their outlook on life sane and clean they live still though their clothes be of a quaint fashion and their talk be of yesterday Who knows but that they will live long after we who love them shall be dead and turned to dust W TEIGNMOUTH SHORE CONTENTS I THE WEIGHTS

popularly called the Weights and Measures Every inhabitant of London and every casual visitor there has admired the handsome edifice which generally goes by that name and which stands so conspicuously confronting the Treasury Chambers It must be owned that we have but a slip slop way of christening our public buildings When a man tells us that he called on a friend at the Horse Guards or looked in at the Navy Pay or dropped a ticket at the Woods and Forests we put up with the accustomed sounds though they are in themselves perhaps indefensible The Board of Commissioners for Regulating Weights and Measures and the Office of the Board of Commissioners for Regulating Weights and Measures are very long phrases and as in the course of this tale frequent mention will be made of the public establishment in question the reader s comfort will be best consulted by maintaining its popular though improper denomination It is generally admitted that the Weights and Measures is a well conducted public office indeed to such a degree of efficiency has it been brought by its present very excellent secretary the two very worthy assistant secretaries and especially by its late most respectable chief clerk that it may be said to stand quite alone as a high model for all other public offices whatever It is exactly antipodistic of the Circumlocution Office and as such is always referred to in the House of Commons by the gentleman representing the Government when any attack on the Civil Service generally is being made And when it is remembered how great are the interests entrusted to the care of this board and of these secretaries and of that chief clerk it must be admitted that nothing short of superlative excellence ought to suffice the nation All material intercourse between man and man must be regulated either justly or unjustly by weights and measures and as we of all people depend most on such material intercourse our weights and measures should to us be a source of never ending concern And then that question of the decimal coinage is it not in these days of paramount importance Are we not disgraced by the twelve pennies in our shilling by the four farthings in our penny One of the worthy assistant secretaries the worthier probably of the two has already grown pale beneath the weight of this question But he has sworn within himself with all the heroism of a Nelson that he will either do or die He will destroy the shilling or the shilling shall destroy him In his more ardent moods he thinks that he hears the noise of battle booming round him and talks to his wife of Westminster Abbey or a peerage Then what statistical work of the present age has shown half the erudition contained in that essay lately published by the secretary on The Market Price of Coined Metals What other living man could have compiled that chronological table which is appended to it showing the comparative value of the metallic currency for the last three hundred years Compile it indeed What other secretary or assistant secretary belonging to any public office of the present day could even read it and live It completely silenced mister Muntz for a session and even The Times was afraid to review it Such a state of official excellence has not however been obtained without its drawbacks at any rate in the eyes of the unambitious tyros and unfledged novitiates of the establishment It is a very fine thing to be pointed out by envying fathers as a promising clerk in the Weights and Measures and to receive civil speeches from mammas with marriageable daughters But a clerk in the Weights and Measures is soon made to understand that it is not for him to Sport with Amaryllis in the shade It behoves him that his life should be grave and his pursuits laborious if he intends to live up to the tone of those around him And as sitting there at his early desk his eyes already dim with figures he sees a jaunty dandy saunter round the opposite corner to the Council Office at eleven o clock he cannot but yearn after the pleasures of idleness Were it not better done as others use he says or sighs But then comes Phoebus in the guise of the chief clerk and touches his trembling ears As he pronounces lastly on each deed Of so much fame in Downing Street expect the meed And so the high tone of the office is maintained Such is the character of the Weights and Measures at this present period of which we are now treating The exoteric crowd of the Civil Service that is the great body of clerks attached to other offices regard their brethren of the Weights as prigs and pedants and look on them much as a master s favourite is apt to be regarded by other boys at school But this judgement is an unfair one Prigs and pedants and hypocrites too there are among them no doubt but there are also among them many stirred by an honourable ambition to do well for their country and themselves and to two such men the reader is now requested to permit himself to be introduced Henry Norman the senior of the two is the second son of a gentleman of small property in the north of England He was educated at a public school and thence sent to Oxford but before he had finished his first year at Brasenose his father was obliged to withdraw him from it finding himself unable to bear the expense of a university education for his two sons His elder son at Cambridge was extravagant and as at the critical moment when decision became necessary a nomination in the Weights and Measures was placed at his disposal old mister Norman committed the not uncommon injustice of preferring the interests of his elder but faulty son to those of the younger with whom no fault had been found and deprived his child of the chance of combining the glories and happiness of a double first a fellow a college tutor and a don Whether Harry Norman gained or lost most by the change we need not now consider but at the age of nineteen he left Oxford and entered on his new duties It must not however be supposed that this was a step which he took without difficulty and without pause It is true that the grand modern scheme for competitive examinations had not as yet been composed Had this been done and had it been carried out how awful must have been the cramming necessary to get a lad into the Weights and Measures But even as things were then it was no easy matter for a young man to convince the chief clerk that he had all the acquirements necessary for the high position to which he aspired Indeed that chief clerk was insatiable and generally succeeded in making every candidate conceive the very lowest opinion of himself and his own capacities before the examination was over Some of course were sent away at once with ignominy as evidently incapable Many retired in the middle of it with a conviction that they must seek their fortunes at the bar or in medical pursuits or some other comparatively easy walk of life Others were rejected on the fifth or sixth day as being deficient in conic sections or ignorant of the exact principles of hydraulic pressure And even those who were retained were so retained as it were by an act of grace The Weights and Measures was and indeed is like heaven no man can deserve it No candidate can claim as his right to be admitted to the fruition of the appointment which has been given to him Henry Norman however was found at the close of his examination to be the least undeserving of the young men then under notice and was duly installed in his clerkship It need hardly be explained that to secure so high a level of information as that required at the Weights and Measures a scale of salaries equally exalted has been found necessary Young men consequently enter at Lone hundred a year We are speaking of course of that more respectable branch of the establishment called the Secretary s Department At none other of our public offices do men commence with more than Lninety except of course at those in which political confidence is required Political confidence is indeed as expensive as hydraulic pressure though generally found to be less difficult of attainment Henry Norman therefore entered on his labours under good auspices having Lten per annum more for the business and pleasures of life in London than most of his young brethren of the Civil Service Whether this would have sufficed of itself to enable him to live up to that tone of society to which he had been accustomed cannot now be surmised as very shortly after his appointment an aunt died from whom he inherited some Lone hundred fifty or Ltwo hundred a year He was therefore placed above all want and soon became a shining light even in that bright gallery of spiritualized stars which formed the corps of clerks in the Secretary s Office at the Weights and Measures Young Norman was a good looking lad when he entered the public service and in a few years he grew up to be a handsome man He was tall and thin and dark muscular in his proportions and athletic in his habits From the date of his first enjoyment of his aunt s legacy he had a wherry on the Thames and was soon known as a man whom it was hard for an amateur to beat He had a racket in a racket court at saint John s Wood Road and as soon as fortune and merit increased his salary by another Lone hundred a year he usually had a nag for the season This however was not attained till he was able to count five years service in the Weights and Measures He was as a boy somewhat shy and reserved in his manners and as he became older he did not shake off the fault He showed it however rather among men than with women and indeed in spite of his love of exercise he preferred the society of ladies to any of the bachelor gaieties of his unmarried acquaintance He was nevertheless frank and confident in those he trusted and true in his friendships though considering his age too slow in making a friend Such was Henry Norman at the time at which our tale begins What were the faults in his character it must be the business of the tale to show The other young clerk in this office to whom we alluded is Alaric Tudor He is a year older than Henry Norman though he began his official career a year later and therefore at the age of twenty one How it happened that he contrived to pass the scrutinizing instinct and deep powers of examination possessed by the chief clerk was a great wonder to his friends though apparently none at all to himself He took the whole proceeding very easily while another youth alongside of him who for a year had been reading up for his promised nomination was so awe struck by the severity of the proceedings as to lose his powers of memory and forget the very essence of the differential calculus Of hydraulic pressure and the differential calculus young Tudor knew nothing and pretended to know nothing He told the chief clerk that he was utterly ignorant of all such matters that his only acquirements were a tolerably correct knowledge of English French and German with a smattering of Latin and Greek and such an intimacy with the ordinary rules of arithmetic and with the first books of Euclid as he had been able to pick up while acting as a tutor rather than a scholar in a small German university The chief clerk raised his eyebrows and said he feared it would not do A clerk however was wanting It was very clear that the young gentleman who had only showed that he had forgotten his conic sections could not be supposed to have passed The austerity of the last few years had deterred more young men from coming forward than the extra Lten had induced to do so One unfortunate on the failure of all his hopes had thrown himself into the Thames from the neighbouring boat stairs and though he had been hooked out uninjured by the man who always attends there with two wooden legs the effect on his parents minds had been distressing Shortly after this occurrence the chief clerk had been invited to attend the Board and the Chairman of the Commissioners who on the occasion was of course prompted by the Secretary recommended mister Hardlines to be a leetle more lenient In doing so the quantity of butter which he poured over mister Hardlines head and shoulders with the view of alleviating the misery which such a communication would be sure to inflict was very great But nevertheless mister Hardlines came out from the Board a crestfallen and unhappy man The service he said would go to the dogs and might do for anything he cared and he did not mind how soon If the Board chose to make the Weights and Measures a hospital for idiots it might do so He had done what little lay in his power to make the office respectable and now because mammas complained when their cubs of sons were not allowed to come in there and rob the public and destroy the office books he was to be thwarted and reprimanded He had been he said eight and twenty years in office and was still in his prime but he should he thought take advantage of the advice of his medical friends and retire He would never remain there to see the Weights and Measures become a hospital for incurables It was thus that mister Hardlines the chief clerk expressed himself He did not however send in a medical certificate nor apply for a pension and the first apparent effect of the little lecture which he had received from the Chairman was the admission into the service of Alaric Tudor mister Hardlines was soon forced to admit that the appointment was not a bad one as before his second year was over young Tudor had produced a very smart paper on the merits or demerits of the strike bushel Alaric Tudor when he entered the office was by no means so handsome a youth as Harry Norman but yet there was that in his face which was more expressive and perhaps more attractive He was a much slighter man though equally tall He could boast no adventitious capillary graces whereas young Norman had a pair of black curling whiskers which almost surrounded his face and had been the delight and wonder of the maidservants in his mother s house when he returned home for his first official holiday Tudor wore no whiskers and his light brown hair was usually cut so short as to give him something of the appearance of a clean Puritan But in manners he was no Puritan nor yet in his mode of life He was fond of society and at an early period of his age strove hard to shine in it He was ambitious and lived with the steady aim of making the most of such advantages as fate and fortune had put in his way Tudor was perhaps not superior to Norman in point of intellect but he was infinitely his superior in having early acquired a knowledge how best to use such intellect as he had His education had been very miscellaneous and disturbed by many causes but yet not ineffective or deficient His father had been an officer in a cavalry regiment with a fair fortune which he had nearly squandered in early life He had taken Alaric when little more than an infant and a daughter his only other child to reside in Brussels missus Tudor was then dead and the remainder of the household had consisted of a French governess a bonne and a man cook Here Alaric remained till he had perfectly acquired the French pronunciation and very nearly as perfectly forgotten the English He was then sent to a private school in England where he remained till he was sixteen returning home to Brussels but once during those years when he was invited to be present at his sister s marriage with a Belgian banker At the age of sixteen he lost his father who on dying did not leave behind him enough of the world s wealth to pay for his own burial His half pay of course died with him and young Tudor was literally destitute His brother in law the banker paid for his half year s schooling in England and then removed him to a German academy at which it was bargained that he should teach English without remuneration and learn German without expense Whether he taught much English may be doubtful but he did learn German thoroughly and in that as in most other transactions of his early life certainly got the best of the bargain which had been made for him At the age of twenty he was taken to the Brussels bank as a clerk but here he soon gave visible signs of disliking the drudgery which was exacted from him Not that he disliked banking He would gladly have been a partner with ever so small a share and would have trusted to himself to increase his stake But there is a limit to the good nature of brothers in law even in Belgium and Alaric was quite aware that no such good luck as this could befall him at any rate until he had gone through many years of servile labour His sister also though sisterly enough in her disposition to him did not quite like having a brother employed as a clerk in her husband s office They therefore put their heads together and as the Tudors had good family connexions in England a nomination in the Weights and Measures was procured The nomination was procured but when it was ascertained how very short a way this went towards the attainment of the desired object and how much more difficult it was to obtain mister Hardlines approval than the Board s favour young Tudor s friends despaired and recommended him to abandon the idea as should he throw himself into the Thames he might perhaps fall beyond the reach of the waterman s hook Alaric himself however had no such fears He could not bring himself to conceive that he could fail in being fit for a clerkship in a public office and the result of his examination proved at any rate that he had been right to try The close of his first year s life in London found him living in lodgings with Henry Norman At that time Norman s income was nearly three times as good as his own To say that Tudor selected his companion because of his income would be to ascribe unjustly to him vile motives and a mean instinct He had not done so The two young men had been thrown together by circumstances They worked at the same desk liked each other s society and each being alone in the world thereby not unnaturally came together But it may probably be said that had Norman been as poor as Tudor Tudor might probably have shrunk from rowing in the same boat with him As it was they lived together and were fast allies not the less so that they did not agree as to many of their avocations Tudor at his friend s solicitation had occasionally attempted to pull an oar from Searle s slip to Battersea bridge But his failure in this line was so complete and he had to encounter so much of Norman s raillery which was endurable and of his instruction which was unendurable that he very soon gave up the pursuit He was not more successful with a racket and keeping a horse was of course out of the question They had a bond of union in certain common friends whom they much loved and with whom they much associated At least these friends soon became common to them The acquaintance originally belonged to Norman and he had first cemented his friendship with Tudor by introducing him at the house of missus Woodward Since he had done so the one young man was there nearly as much as the other Who and what the Woodwards were shall be told in a subsequent chapter As they have to play as important a part in the tale about to be told as our two friends of the Weights and Measures it would not be becoming to introduce them at the end of this As regards Alaric Tudor it need only be further said by way of preface of him as of Harry Norman that the faults of his character must be made to declare themselves in the course of our narrative CHAPTER II THE INTERNAL NAVIGATION The London world visitors as well as residents are well acquainted also with Somerset House and it is moreover tolerably well known that Somerset House is a nest of public offices which are held to be of less fashionable repute than those situated in the neighbourhood of Downing Street but are not so decidedly plebeian as the Custom House Excise and Post Office But there is one branch of the Civil Service located in Somerset House which has little else to redeem it from the lowest depths of official vulgarity than the ambiguous respectability of its material position This is the office of the Commissioners of Internal Navigation The duties to be performed have reference to the preservation of canal banks the tolls to be levied at locks and disputes with the Admiralty as to points connected with tidal rivers The rooms are dull and dark and saturated with the fog which rises from the river and their only ornament is here and there some dusty model of an improved barge Bargees not unfrequently scuffle with hobnailed shoes through the passages and go in and out leaving behind them a smell of tobacco to which the denizens of the place are not unaccustomed Indeed the whole office is apparently infected with a leaven of bargedom Not a few of the men are employed from time to time in the somewhat lethargic work of inspecting the banks and towing paths of the canals which intersect the country This they generally do seated on a load of hay or perhaps of bricks in one of those long ugly shapeless boats which are to be seen congregating in the neighbourhood of Brentford So seated they are carried along at the rate of a mile and a half an hour and usually while away the time in gentle converse with the man at the rudder or in silent abstraction over a pipe But the dullness of such a life as this is fully atoned for by the excitement of that which follows it in London The men of the Internal Navigation are known to be fast nay almost furious in their pace of living not that they are extravagant in any great degree a fault which their scale of salaries very generally forbids but they are one and all addicted to Coal Holes and Cider Cellars they dive at midnight hours into Shades and know all the back parlours of all the public houses in the neighbourhood of the Strand Here they leave messages for one another and call the girl at the bar by her Christian name They are a set of men endowed with sallow complexions and they wear loud clothing and spend more money in gin and water than in gloves The establishment is not unusually denominated the Infernal Navigation and the gentlemen employed are not altogether displeased at having it so called The Infernal Navvies indeed rather glory in the name The navvies of Somerset House are known all over London and there are those who believe that their business has some connexion with the rivers or railroads of that bourne from whence no traveller returns Looking however from their office windows into the Thames one might be tempted to imagine that the infernal navigation with which they are connected is not situated so far distant from the place of their labours The spirit who guards the entrance into this elysium is by no means so difficult to deal with as mister Hardlines And it was well that it was so some few years since for young Charley Tudor a cousin of our friend Alaric for Charley Tudor could never have passed muster at the Weights and Measures Charles Tudor the third of the three clerks alluded to in our title page is the son of a clergyman who has a moderate living on the Welsh border in Shropshire Had he known to what sort of work he was sending his son he might probably have hesitated before he accepted for him a situation in the Internal Navigation Office He was however too happy in getting it to make many inquiries as to its nature We none of us like to look a gift horse in the mouth Old mister Tudor knew that a clerkship in the Civil Service meant or should mean a respectable maintenance for life and having many young Tudors to maintain himself he was only too glad to find one of them provided for Charley Tudor was some few years younger than his cousin Alaric when he came up to town and Alaric had at that time some three or four years experience of London life The examination at the Internal Navigation was certainly not to be so much dreaded as that at the Weights and Measures but still there was an examination and Charley who had not been the most diligent of schoolboys approached it with great dread after a preparatory evening passed with the assistance of his cousin and mister Norman Exactly at ten in the morning he walked into the lobby of his future workshop and found no one yet there but two aged seedy messengers He was shown into a waiting room and there he remained for a couple of hours during which every clerk in the establishment came to have a look at him At last he was ushered into the Secretary s room Ah said the Secretary your name is Tudor isn t it Charley confessed to the fact Yea said the Secretary I have heard about you from Sir Gilbert de Salop Now Sir Gilbert de Salop was the great family friend of this branch of the Tudors But Charley finding that no remark suggested itself to him at this moment concerning Sir Gilbert merely said Yes sir And you wish to serve the Queen said the Secretary Charley not quite knowing whether this was a joke or not said that he did Quite right it is a very fair ambition continued the great official functionary quite right but mind you mister Tudor if you come to us you must come to work I hope you like hard work you should do so if you intend to remain with us Charley said that he thought he did rather like hard work Hereupon a senior clerk standing by though a man not given to much laughter smiled slightly probably in pity at the unceasing labour to which the youth was about to devote himself The Internal Navigation requires great steadiness good natural abilities considerable education and and and no end of application Come mister Tudor let us see what you can do And so saying mister Oldeschole the Secretary motioned him to sit down at an office table opposite to himself Charley did as he was bid and took from the hands of his future master an old much worn quill pen with which the great man had been signing minutes Now said the great man just copy the few first sentences of that leading article either one will do and he pushed over to him a huge newspaper To tell the truth Charley did not know what a leading article was and so he sat abashed staring at the paper Why don t you write asked the Secretary Where shall I begin sir stammered poor Charley looking piteously into the examiner s face God bless my soul there either of those leading articles and leaning over the table the Secretary pointed to a particular spot Hereupon Charley began his task in a large ugly round hand neither that of a man nor of a boy and set himself to copy the contents of the paper The name of Pacifico stinks in the nostril of the British public It is well known to all the world how sincerely we admire the vers i tility of Lord Palmerston s genius how cordially we s i mpathize with his patriotic energies But the admiration which even a Palmerston inspires must have a bound and our s i mpathy may be called on too far When we find ourselves asked to pay By this time Charley had half covered the half sheet of foolscap which had been put before him and here at the word pay he unfortunately suffered a large blot of ink to fall on the paper That won t do mister Tudor that won t do come let us look and stretching over again the Secretary took up the copy Oh dear oh dear this is very bad versatility with an i sympathy with an i sympathize with an i Why mister Tudor you must be very fond of i s down in Shropshire Charley looked sheepish but of course said nothing And I never saw a viler hand in my life Oh dear oh dear I must send you back to Sir Gilbert Look here Snape this will never do never do for the Internal Navigation will it Snape the attendant senior clerk said as indeed he could not help saying that the writing was very bad I never saw worse in my life said the Secretary And now mister Tudor what do you know of arithmetic Charley said that he thought he knew arithmetic pretty well at least some of it he modestly added Some of it said the Secretary slightly laughing Well I ll tell you what this won t do at all and he took the unfortunate manuscript between his thumb and forefinger You had better go home and endeavour to write something a little better than this Mind if it is not very much better it won t do And look here take care that you do it yourself If you bring me the writing of any one else I shall be sure to detect you I have not any more time now as to arithmetic we ll examine you in some of it to morrow So Charley with a faint heart went back to his cousin s lodgings and waited till the two friends had arrived from the Weights and Measures The men there made a point of staying up to five o clock as is the case with all model officials and it was therefore late before he could get himself properly set to work But when they did arrive preparations for calligraphy were made on a great scale a volume of Gibbon was taken down new quill pens large and small and steel pens by various makers were procured cream laid paper was provided and ruled lines were put beneath it And when this was done Charley was especially cautioned to copy the spelling as well as the wording He worked thus for an hour before dinner and then for three hours in the evening and produced a very legible copy of half a chapter of the Decline and Fall I didn t think they examined at all at the Navigation said Norman Well I believe it s quite a new thing said Alaric Tudor The schoolmaster must be abroad with a vengeance if he has got as far as that And then they carefully examined Charley s work crossed his t s dotted his i s saw that his spelling was right and went to bed Again punctually at ten o clock Charley presented himself at the Internal Navigation and again saw the two seedy old messengers warming themselves at the lobby fire On this occasion he was kept three hours in the waiting room and some of the younger clerks ventured to come and speak to him At length mister Snape appeared and desired the acolyte to follow him Charley supposing that he was again going to the awful Secretary did so with a palpitating heart But he was led in another direction into a large room carrying his manuscript neatly rolled in his hand Here mister Snape introduced him to five other occupants of the chamber he mister Snape himself having a separate desk there being in official parlance the head of the room Charley was told to take a seat at a desk and did so still thinking that the dread hour of his examination was soon to come His examination however was begun and over No one ever asked for his calligraphic manuscript and as to his arithmetic it may be presumed that his assurance that he knew some of it was deemed to be adequate evidence of sufficient capacity And in this manner Charley Tudor became one of the Infernal Navvies He was a gay hearted thoughtless rollicking young lad when he came up to town and it may therefore be imagined that he easily fell into the peculiar ways and habits of the office A short bargee s pilot coat and a pipe of tobacco were soon familiar to him and he had not been six months in London before he had his house of call in a cross lane running between Essex Street and Norfolk Street Mary my dear a screw of bird s eye came quite habitually to his lips and before his fist year was out he had volunteered a song at the Buckingham Shades The assurance made to him on his first visit to the office by mister Secretary Oldeschole that the Internal Navigation was a place of herculean labours had long before this time become matter to him of delightful ridicule He had found himself to be one of six young men who habitually spent about five hours a day together in the same room and whose chief employment was to render the life of the wretched mister Snape as unendurable as possible There were copies to be written and entries to be made and books to be indexed But these things were generally done by some extra hand as to the necessity of whose attendance for such purpose mister Snape was forced to certify But poor Snape knew that he had no alternative He rule six unruly young navvies There was not one of them who did not well know how to make him tremble in his shoes Poor mister Snape had selected for his own peculiar walk in life a character for evangelical piety Whether he was a hypocrite as all the navvies averred or a man sincere as far as one so weak could accomplish sincerity it is hardly necessary for us to inquire He was not by nature an ill natured man but he had become by education harsh to those below him and timid and cringing with those above In the former category must by no means be included the six young men who were nominally under his guidance They were all but acknowledged by him as his superiors Ignorant as they were they could hardly be more so than he Useless as they were they did as much for the public service as he did He sometimes complained of them but it was only when their misconduct had been so loud as to make it no longer possible that he should not do so mister Snape being thus by character and predilection a religious man and having on various occasions in olden days professed much horror at having his ears wounded by conversation which was either immoral or profane it had of course become the habitual practice of the navvies to give continual utterance to every description of ribaldry and blasphemy for his especial edification Doubtless it may be concluded from the habits of the men that even without such provocation their talk would have exceeded the yea yea and nay nay to which young men should confine themselves But they especially concerted schemes of blasphemy and dialogues of iniquity for mister Snape s particular advantage and continued daily this disinterested amusement till at last an idea got abroad among them that mister Snape liked it Then they changed their tactics and canted through their noses in the manner which they imagined to be peculiar to methodist preachers So on the whole mister Snape had an uneasy life of it at the Internal Navigation Into all these malpractices Charley Tudor plunged headlong And how should it have been otherwise How can any youth of nineteen or twenty do other than consort himself with the daily companions of his usual avocations Once and again in one case among ten thousand a lad may be found formed of such stuff that he receives neither the good nor the bad impulses of those around him But such a one is a lapsus naturae He has been born without the proper attributes of youth or at any rate brought up so as to have got rid of them Such a one at any rate Charley Tudor was not He was a little shocked at first by the language he heard but that feeling soon wore off His kind heart also in the first month of his novitiate sympathized with the daily miseries of mister Snape but he also soon learnt to believe that mister Snape was a counterfeit and after the first half year could torture him with as much gusto as any of his brethren Alas no evil tendency communicates itself among young men more quickly than cruelty Those infernal navvies were very cruel to mister Snape And yet young Tudor was a lad of a kindly heart of a free honest open disposition deficient in no proportion of mind necessary to make an estimable man But he was easily malleable and he took at once the full impression of the stamp to which he was subjected Had he gone into the Weights and Measures a hypothesis which of course presumes a total prostration of the intellects and energy of mister Hardlines he would have worked without a groan from ten till five and have become as good a model as the best of them As it was he can be hardly said to have worked at all soon became facile princeps in the list of habitual idlers and was usually threatened once a quarter with dismissal even from that abode of idleness in which the very nature of true work was unknown Some tidings of Charley s doings in London and non doings at the Internal Navigation of course found their way to the Shropshire parsonage His dissipation was not of a very costly kind but Lninety per annum will hardly suffice to afford an ample allowance of gin and water and bird s eye tobacco over and above the other wants of a man s life Bills arrived there requiring payment and worse than this letters also came through Sir Gilbert de Salop from mister Oldeschole the Secretary saying that young Tudor was disgracing the office and lowering the high character of the Internal Navigation and that he must be removed unless he could be induced to alter his line of life c Urgent austere letters came from the father and fond heart rending appeals from the mother Charley s heart was rent It was at any rate a sign in him that he was not past hope of grace that he never laughed at these monitions that he never showed such letters to his companions never quizzed his governor s lectures or made merry over the grief of his mother But if it be hard for a young man to keep in the right path when he has not as yet strayed out of it how much harder is it to return to it when he has long since lost the track It was well for the father to write austere letters well for the mother to make tender appeals but Charley could not rid himself of his companions nor of his debts nor yet even of his habits He could not get up in the morning and say that he would at once be as his cousin Alaric or as his cousin s friend mister Norman It is not by our virtues or our vices that we are judged even by those who know us best but by such credit for virtues or for vices as we may have acquired Now young Tudor s credit for virtue was very slight and he did not know how to extend it At last papa and mamma Tudor came up to town to make one last effort to save their son and also to save on his behalf the valuable official appointment which he held He had now been three years in his office and his salary had risen to Lone hundred ten per annum Lone hundred ten per annum was worth saving if it could be saved The plan adopted by missus Tudor was that of beseeching their cousin Alaric to take Charley under his especial wing When Charley first arrived in town the fact of Alaric and Norman living together had given the former a good excuse for not offering to share his lodgings with his cousin Alaric with the advantage in age of three or four years at that period of life the advantage lies in that direction with his acquired experience of London life and also with all the wondrous eclat of the Weights and Measures shining round him had perhaps been a little too unwilling to take by the hand a rustic cousin who was about to enter life under the questionable auspices of the Internal Navigation He had helped Charley to transcribe the chapter of Gibbon and had it must be owned lent him from time to time a few odd pounds in his direst necessities But their course in life had hitherto been apart Of Norman Charley had seen less even than of his cousin And now it became a difficult question with Alaric how he was to answer the direct appeal made to him by missus Tudor Pray pray let him live with you if it be only for a year Alaric the mother had said with the tears running down her cheeks You are so good so discreet so clever you can save him Alaric promised or was ready to promise anything else but hesitated as to the joint lodgings How could he manage it said he living as he was with another man He feared that mister Norman would not accede to such an arrangement As for himself he would do anything but leave his friend Norman To tell the truth Alaric thought much perhaps too much of the respectability of those with whom he consorted He had already begun to indulge ambitious schemes already had ideas stretching even beyond the limits of the Weights and Measures and fully intended to make the very most of himself missus Tudor in her deep grief then betook herself to mister Norman though with that gentleman she had not even the slightest acquaintance With a sulking heart with a consciousness of her unreasonableness but with the eloquence of maternal sorrow she made her request mister Norman heard her out with all the calm propriety of the Weights and Measures begged to have a day to consider and then acceded to the request I think we ought to do it said he to Alaric The mother s tears had touched his heart and his sense of duty had prevailed Alaric of course could now make no further objection and thus Charley the Navvy became domesticated with his cousin Alaric and Harry Norman The first great question to be settled and it is a very great question with a young man was that of latch key or no latch key missus Richards the landlady when she made ready the third bedroom for the young gentleman would as was her wont in such matters have put a latchkey on the toilet table as a matter of course had she not had some little conversation with Mamma Tudor regarding her son Mamma Tudor had implored and coaxed and probably bribed missus Richards to do something more than take her son in and do for him and missus Richards as her first compliance with these requests had kept the latch key in her own pocket So matters went on for a week but when missus Richards found that her maidservant was never woken by mister Charley s raps after midnight and that she herself was obliged to descend in her dressing gown she changed her mind declared to herself that it was useless to attempt to keep a grown gentleman in leading strings and put the key on the table on the second Monday morning As none of the three men ever dined at home Alaric and Norman having clubs which they frequented and Charley eating his dinner at some neighbouring dining house it may be imagined that this change of residence did our poor navvy but little good It had however a salutary effect on him at any rate at first He became shamed into a quieter and perhaps cleaner mode of dressing himself he constrained himself to sit down to breakfast with his monitors at half past eight and was at any rate so far regardful of missus Richards as not to smoke in his bedroom and to come home sober enough to walk upstairs without assistance every night for the first month But perhaps the most salutary effect made by this change on young Tudor was this that he was taken by his cousin one Sunday to the Woodwards Poor Charley had had but small opportunity of learning what are the pleasures of decent society He had gone headlong among the infernal navvies too quickly to allow of that slow and gradual formation of decent alliances which is all in all to a young man entering life A boy is turned loose into London and desired to choose the good and eschew the bad Boy as he is he might probably do so if the opportunity came in his way But no such chance is afforded him To eschew the bad is certainly possible for him but as to the good he must wait till he be chosen This it is that is too much for him He cannot live without society and so he falls Society an ample allowance of society this is the first requisite which a mother should seek in sending her son to live alone in London balls routs picnics parties women pretty well dressed witty easy mannered good pictures elegant drawing rooms well got up books Majolica and Dresden china these are the truest guards to protect a youth from dissipation and immorality These are the books the arts the academes That show contain and nourish all the world if only a youth could have them at his disposal Some of these things though by no means all Charley Tudor encountered at the Woodwards CHAPTER III THE WOODWARDS It is very difficult nowadays to say where the suburbs of London come to an end and where the country begins The railways instead of enabling Londoners to live in the country have turned the country into a city London will soon assume the shape of a great starfish The old town extending from Poplar to Hammersmith will be the nucleus and the various railway lines will be the projecting rays There are still however some few nooks within reach of the metropolis which have not been be villaged and be terraced out of all look of rural charm and the little village of Hampton with its old fashioned country inn and its bright quiet grassy river is one of them in spite of the triple metropolitan waterworks on the one side and the close vicinity on the other of Hampton Court that well loved resort of cockneydom It was here that the Woodwards lived Just on the outskirts of the village on the side of it farthest from town they inhabited not a villa but a small old fashioned brick house abutting on to the road but looking from its front windows on to a lawn and garden which stretched down to the river The grounds were not extensive being included house and all in an area of an acre and a half but the most had been made of it it sloped prettily to the river and was absolutely secluded from the road Thus Surbiton Cottage as it was called though it had no pretension to the grandeur of a country house was a desirable residence for a moderate family with a limited income missus Woodward s family for there was no mister Woodward in the case consisted of herself and three daughters There was afterwards added to this an old gentleman an uncle of missus Woodward s but he had not arrived at the time at which we would wish first to introduce our readers to Hampton missus Woodward was the widow of a clergyman who had held a living in London and had resided there He had however died when two of his children were very young and while the third was still a baby From that time missus Woodward had lived at the cottage at Hampton and had there maintained a good repute paying her way from month to month as widows with limited incomes should do and devoting herself to the amusements and education of her daughters It was not probably from any want of opportunity to cast them aside that missus Woodward had remained true to her weeds for at the time of her husband s death she was a young and a very pretty woman and an income of Lfour hundred a year though moderate enough for all the wants of a gentleman s family would no doubt have added sufficiently to her charms to have procured her a second alliance had she been so minded Twelve years however had now elapsed since mister Woodward had been gathered to his fathers and the neighbouring world of Hampton who had all of them declared over and over again that the young widow would certainly marry again were now becoming as unanimous in their expressed opinion that the old widow knew the value of her money too well to risk it in the keeping of the best he that ever wore boots At the date at which our story commences she was a comely little woman past forty somewhat below the middle height rather embonpoint as widows of forty should be with pretty fat feet and pretty fat hands wearing just a soupcon of a widow s cap on her head with her hair now slightly grey parted in front and brushed very smoothly but not too carefully in bandeaux over her forehead She was a quick little body full of good humour slightly given to repartee and perhaps rather too impatient of a fool But though averse to a fool she could sympathize with folly A great poet has said that women are all rakes at heart and there was something of the rake at heart about missus Woodward She never could be got to express adequate horror at fast young men and was apt to have her own sly little joke at women who prided themselves on being punctilious She could perhaps the more safely indulge in this as scandal had never even whispered a word against herself With her daughters she lived on terms almost of equality The two elder were now grown up that is they were respectively eighteen and seventeen years old They were devotedly attached to their mother looked on her as the only perfect woman in existence and would willingly do nothing that could vex her but they perhaps were not quite so systematically obedient to her as children should be to their only surviving parent missus Woodward however found nothing amiss and no one else therefore could well have a right to complain They were both pretty but Gertrude the elder was by far the more strikingly so They were nevertheless much alike they both had rich brown hair which they like their mother wore simply parted over the forehead They were both somewhat taller than her and were nearly of a height But in appearance as in disposition Gertrude carried by far the greater air of command She was the handsomer of the two and the cleverer She could write French and nearly speak it while her sister could only read it She could play difficult pieces from sight which it took her sister a morning s pains to practise She could fill in and finish a drawing while her sister was still struggling and struggling in vain with the first principles of the art But there was a softness about Linda for such was the name of the second Miss Woodward which in the eyes of many men made up both for the superior beauty and superior talent of Gertrude Gertrude was perhaps hardly so soft as so young a girl should be In her had been magnified that spirit of gentle raillery which made so attractive a part of her mother s character She enjoyed and emulated her mother s quick sharp sayings but she hardly did so with her mother s grace and sometimes attempted it with much more than her mother s severity She also detested fools but in promulgating her opinion on this subject she was too apt to declare who the fools were whom she detested It may be thought that under such circumstances there could be but little confidence between the sisters but nevertheless in their early days they lived together as sisters should do Gertrude when she spoke of fools never intended to include Linda in the number and Linda appreciated too truly and admired too thoroughly her sister s beauty and talent to be jealous of either Of the youngest girl Katie it is not necessary at present to say much At this time she was but thirteen years of age and was a happy pretty romping child She gave fair promise to be at any rate equal to her sisters in beauty and in mind was quick and intelligent Her great taste was for boating and the romance of her life consisted in laying out ideal pleasure grounds and building ideal castles in a little reedy island or ait which lay out in the Thames a few perches from the drawing room windows Such was the family of the Woodwards Harry Norman s father and mister Woodward had been first cousins and hence it had been quite natural that when Norman came up to reside in London he should be made welcome to Surbiton Cottage He had so been made welcome and had thus got into a habit of spending his Saturday evenings and Sundays at the home of his relatives In summer he could row up in his own wherry and land himself and carpet bag direct on the Woodwards lawn and in the winter he came down by the Hampton Court five p m train and in each case he returned on the Monday morning Thus as regards that portion of his time which was most his own he may be said almost to have lived at Surbiton Cottage and if on any Sunday he omitted to make his appearance the omission was ascribed by the ladies of Hampton in some half serious sort of joke to metropolitan allurements and temptations which he ought to have withstood When Tudor and Norman came to live together it was natural enough that Tudor also should be taken down to Surbiton Cottage Norman could not leave him on every Saturday without telling him much of his friends whom he went to visit and he could hardly say much of them without offering to introduce his companion to them Tudor accordingly went there and it soon came to pass that he also very frequently spent his Sundays at Hampton It must be remembered that at this time the time that is of Norman and Tudor s first entrance on their London life the girls at Surbiton Cottage were mere girls that is little more than children they had not as it were got their wings so as to be able to fly away when the provocation to do so might come they were in short Gertrude and Linda Woodward and not the Miss Woodwards their drawers came down below their frocks instead of their frocks below their drawers and in lieu of studying the French language as is done by grown up ladies they did French lessons as is the case with ladies who are not grown up Under these circumstances there was no embarrassment as to what the young people should call each other and they soon became very intimate as Harry and Alaric Gertrude and Linda It is not however to be conceived that Alaric Tudor at once took the same footing in the house as Norman This was far from being the case In the first place he never slept there seeing that there was no bed for him and the most confidential intercourse in the household took place as they sat cosy over the last embers of the drawing room fire chatting about everything and nothing as girls always can do after Tudor had gone away to his bed at the inn on the opposite side of the way And then Tudor did not come on every Saturday and at first did not do so without express invitation and although the girls soon habituated themselves to the familiarity of their new friend s Christian name it was some time before missus Woodward did so Two three years soon flew by and Linda and Gertrude became the Miss Woodwards their frocks were prolonged their drawers curtailed and the lessons abandoned But still Alaric Tudor and Harry Norman came to Hampton not less frequently than of yore and the world resident on that portion of the left bank of the Thames found out that Harry Norman and Gertrude Woodward were to be man and wife and that Alaric Tudor and Linda Woodward were to go through the same ceremony They found this out or said that they had done so But as usual the world was wrong at least in part for at the time of which we are speaking no word of love making had passed at any rate between the last named couple And what was missus Woodward about all this time Was she match making or match marring or was she negligently omitting the duties of a mother on so important an occasion She was certainly neither match making nor match marring but it was from no negligence that she was thus quiescent She knew or thought she knew that the two young men were fit to be husbands to her daughters and she felt that if the wish for such an alliance should spring up between either pair there was no reason why she should interfere to prevent it But she felt also that she should not interfere to bring any such matter to pass These young people had by chance been thrown together Should there be love passages among them as it was natural to suppose there might be it would be well Should there be none such it would be well also She thoroughly trusted her own children and did not distrust her friends and so as regards missus Woodward the matter was allowed to rest We cannot say that on this matter we quite approve of her conduct though we cannot but admire the feeling which engendered it Her daughters were very young though they had made such positive advances as have been above described towards the discretion of womanhood they were of the age when they would have been regarded as mere boys had they belonged to the other sex The assertion made by Clara Van Artevelde that women grow upon the sunny side of the wall is doubtless true but young ladies gifted as they are with such advantages may perhaps be thought to require some counsel some advice in those first tender years in which they so often have to make or mar their fortunes Not that missus Woodward gave them no advice not but that she advised them well and often but she did so perhaps too much as an equal too little as a parent But be that as it may and I trust my readers will not be inclined so early in our story to lean heavily on missus Woodward whom I at once declare to be my own chief favourite in the tale but be that as it may it so occurred that Gertrude before she was nineteen had listened to vows of love from Harry Norman which she neither accepted nor repudiated and that Linda had before she was eighteen perhaps unfortunately taught herself to think it probable that she might have to listen to vows of love from Alaric Tudor There had been no concealment between the young men as to their feelings Norman had told his friend scores of times that it was the first wish of his heart to marry Gertrude Woodward and had told him moreover what were his grounds for hope and what his reasons for despair She is as proud as a queen he had once said as he was rowing from Hampton to Searle s Wharf and lay on his oars as the falling tide carried his boat softly past the green banks of Richmond she is as proud as a queen and yet as timid as a fawn She lets me tell her that I love her but she will not say a word to me in reply as for touching her in the way of a caress I should as soon think of putting my arm round a goddess And why not put your arms round a goddess said Alaric who was perhaps a little bolder than his friend and a little less romantic To this Harry answered nothing but laying his back to his work swept on past the gardens of Kew and shot among the wooden dangers of Putney Bridge I wish you could bring yourself to make up to Linda said he resting again from his labours that would make the matter so much easier Bring myself said Alaric what you mean is that you wish I could bring Linda to consent to be made up to I don t think you would have much difficulty said Harry finding it much easier to answer for Linda than for her sister but perhaps you don t admire her I think her by far the prettier of the two said Alaric That s nonsense said Harry getting rather red in the face and feeling rather angry Indeed I do and so I am convinced would most men You need not murder me man You want me to make up to Linda and surely it will be better that I should admire my own wife than yours Oh you may admire whom you like but to say that she is prettier than Gertrude why you know it is nonsense Very well my dear fellow then to oblige you I ll fall in love with Gertrude I know you won t do that said Harry for you are not so very fond of each other but joking apart I do wish so you would make up to Linda Well I will when my aunt leaves me Ltwo hundred a year There was no answering this so the two men changed the conversation as they walked up together from the boat wharf to the office of the Weights and Measures It was just at this time that fortune and old mister Tudor of the Shropshire parsonage brought Charley Tudor to reside with our two heroes For the first month or six weeks Charley was ruthlessly left by his companions to get through his Sundays as best he could It is to be hoped that he spent them in divine worship but it may we fear be surmised with more probability that he paid his devotions at the shrine of some very inferior public house deity in the neighbourhood of Somerset House As a matter of course both Norman and Tudor spoke much of their new companion to the ladies at Surbiton Cottage and as by degrees they reported somewhat favourably of his improved morals missus Woodward with a woman s true kindness begged that he might be brought down to Hampton I am afraid you will find him very rough said his cousin Alaric At any rate you will not find him a fool said Norman who was always the more charitable of the two Thank God for that said missus Woodward and if he will come next Saturday let him by all means do so Pray give my compliments to him and tell him how glad I shall be to see him And thus was this wild wolf to be led into the sheep cote this infernal navvy to be introduced among the angels of Surbiton Cottage missus Woodward thought that she had a taste for reclaiming reprobates and was determined to try her hand on Charley Tudor Charley went and his debut was perfectly successful We have hitherto only looked on the worst side of his character but bad as his character was it had a better side He was good natured in the extreme kind hearted and affectionate and though too apt to be noisy and even boisterous when much encouraged was not without a certain innate genuine modesty which the knowledge of his own iniquities had rather increased than blunted and as Norman had said of him he was no fool His education had not been good and he had done nothing by subsequent reading to make up for this deficiency but he was well endowed with mother wit and owed none of his deficiencies to nature s churlishness He came and was well received The girls thought he would surely get drunk before he left the table and missus Wood ward feared the austere precision of her parlourmaid might be offended by some unworthy familiarity but no accident of either kind seemed to occur He came to the tea table perfectly sober and as far as missus Woodward could tell was unaware of the presence of the parlour maiden On the Sunday morning Charley went to church just like a Christian Now missus Woodward certainly had expected that he would have spent those two hours in smoking and attacking the parlour maid He went to church however and seemed in no whit astray there stood up when others stood up and sat down when others sat down After all the infernal navvies bad as they doubtless were knew something of the recognized manners of civilized life Thus Charley Tudor ingratiated himself at Surbiton Cottage and when he left received a kind intimation from its mistress that she would be glad to see him again No day was fixed and so Charley could not accompany his cousin and Harry Norman on the next Saturday but it was not long before he got another direct invitation and so he also became intimate at Hampton There could be no danger of any one falling in love with him for Katie was still a child Things stood thus at Surbiton Cottage when missus Woodward received a proposition from a relative of her own which surprised them all not a little This was from a certain Captain Cuttwater who was a maternal uncle to missus Woodward and consisted of nothing less than an offer to come and live with them for the remaining term of his natural life Now missus Woodward s girls had seen very little of their grand uncle and what little they had seen had only taught them to laugh at him When his name was mentioned in the family conclave he was always made the subject of some little feminine joke and missus Woodward though she always took her uncle s part did so in a manner that made them feel that he was fair game for their quizzing When the proposal was first enunciated to the girls they one and all for Katie was one of the council suggested that it should be declined with many thanks He ll take us all for midshipmen said Linda and stop our rations and mast head us whenever we displease him I am sure he is a cross old hunks though mamma says he s not said Katie with all the impudence of spoilt fourteen He ll interfere with every one of our pursuits said Gertrude more thoughtfully and be sure to quarrel with the young men But missus Woodward though she had consulted her daughters had arguments of her own in favour of Captain Cuttwater s proposition which she had not yet made known to them Good humoured and happy as she always was she had her cares in the world Her income was only Lfour hundred a year and that now that the Income Tax had settled down on it was barely sufficient for her modest wants A moiety of this died with her and the remainder would be but a poor support for her three daughters if at the time of her death it should so chance that she should leave them in want of support She had always regarded Captain Cuttwater as a probable source of future aid He was childless and unmarried and had not as far as she was aware another relative in the world It would therefore under any circumstances be bad policy to offend him But the letter in which he had made his offer had been of a very peculiar kind He had begun by saying that he was to be turned out of his present berth by a d Whig Government on account of his age he being as young a man as ever he had been that it behoved him to look out for a place of residence in which he might live and if it should so please God die also He then said that he expected to pay Ltwo hundred a year for his board and lodging which he thought might as well go to his niece as to some shark who would probably starve him He also said that poor as he was and always had been he had contrived to scrape together a few hundred pounds that he was well aware that if he lived among strangers he should be done out of every shilling of it but that if his niece would receive him he hoped to be able to keep it together for the benefit of his grand nieces c Now missus Woodward knew her uncle to be an honest minded man she knew also that in spite of his protestation as to being a very poor man he had saved money enough to make him of some consequence wherever he went and she therefore conceived that she could not with prudence send him to seek a home among chance strangers She explained as much of this to the girls as she thought proper and ended the matter by making them understand that Captain Cuttwater was to be received On the Saturday after this the three scions of the Civil Service were all at Surbiton Cottage and it will show how far Charley had then made good his ground to state that the coming of the captain was debated in his presence And when is the great man to be here said Norman At once I believe said missus Woodward that is perhaps before the end of this week and certainly before the end of next And what is he like said Alaric Why he has a tail hanging down behind like a cat or a dog said Katie Hold your tongue miss said Gertrude As he is to come he must be treated with respect but it is a great bore To me it will destroy all the pleasures of life Nonsense Gertrude said missus Woodward it is almost wicked of you to say so Destroy all the pleasure of life to have an old gentleman live in the same house with you you ought to be more moderate my dear in what you say That s all very well mamma said Gertrude but you know you don t like him yourself But is it true that Captain Cuttwater wears a pigtail asked Norman I don t care what he wears said Gertrude he may wear three if he likes Oh I wish he would said Katie laughing that would be so delicious Oh Linda fancy Captain Cuttwater with three pigtails I am sorry to disappoint you Katie said missus Woodward but your uncle does not wear even one he once did but he cut it off long since I am so sorry said Katie I suppose he ll want to dine early and go to bed early said Linda His going to bed early would be a great blessing said Gertrude mindful of their midnight conclaves on Saturdays and Sundays But his getting up early won t be a blessing at all said Linda who had a weakness on that subject Talking of bed Harry you ll have the worst of it said Katie for the captain is to have your room Yes indeed said missus Woodward sighing gently we shall no longer have a bed for you Harry that is the worst of it Harry of course assured her that if that was the worst of it there was nothing very bad in it He could have a bed at the inn as well as Alaric and Charley The amount of that evil would only be half a crown a night And thus the advent of Captain Cuttwater was discussed CHAPTER IV CAPTAIN CUTTWATER Captain Cuttwater had not seen much service afloat that is he had not been personally concerned in many of those sea engagements which in and about the time of Nelson gave so great a halo of glory to the British Lion nor had it even been permitted to him to take a prominent part in such minor affairs as have since occurred he had not the opportunity of distinguishing himself either at the battle of Navarino or the bombarding of Acre and unfortunately for his ambition the period of his retirement came before that great Baltic campaign in which had he been there he would doubtless have distinguished himself as did so many others His earliest years were spent in cruising among the West Indies he then came home and spent some considerable portion of his life in idleness if that time can be said to have been idly spent which he devoted to torturing the Admiralty with applications remonstrances and appeals Then he was rated as third lieutenant on the books of some worm eaten old man of war at Portsmouth and gave up his time to looking after the stowage of anchors and counting fathoms of rope At last he was again sent afloat as senior lieutenant in a ten gun brig and cruised for some time off the coast of Africa hunting for slavers and returning after a while from this enterprising employment he received a sort of amphibious appointment at Devonport What his duties were here the author being in all points a landsman is unable to describe Those who were inclined to ridicule Captain Cuttwater declared that the most important of them consisted in seeing that the midshipmen in and about the dockyard washed their faces and put on clean linen not less often than three times a week According to his own account he had many things of a higher nature to attend to and indeed hardly a ship sank or swam in Hamoaze except by his special permission for a space of twenty years if his own view of his own career may be accepted as correct He had once declared to certain naval acquaintances over his third glass of grog that he regarded it as his birthright to be an Admiral but at the age of seventy two he had not yet acquired his birthright and the probability of his ever attaining it was becoming very small indeed He was still bothering Lords and Secretaries of the Admiralty for further promotion when he was astounded by being informed by the Port Admiral that he was to be made happy by half pay and a pension The Admiral in communicating the intelligence had pretended to think that he was giving the captain information which could not be otherwise than grateful to him but he was not the less aware that the old man would be furious at being so treated What pension him put him on half pay shelf him for life while he was still anxiously expecting that promotion that call to higher duties which had so long been his due and which now that his powers were matured could hardly be longer denied to him And after all that he had done for his country his ungrateful thankless ignorant country was he thus to be treated Was he to be turned adrift without any mark of honour any special guerdon any sign of his Sovereign s favour to testify as to his faithful servitude of sixty years devotion He who had regarded it as his merest right to be an Admiral and had long indulged the hope of being greeted in the streets of Devonport as Sir Bartholomew Cuttwater K C B was he to be thus thrown aside in his prime with no other acknowledgement than the bare income to which he was entitled It is hardly too much to say that no old officers who have lacked the means to distinguish themselves retire from either of our military services free from the bitter disappointment and sour feelings of neglected worth which Captain Cuttwater felt so keenly A clergyman or a doctor or a lawyer feels himself no whit disgraced if he reaches the end of his worldly labours without special note or honour But to a soldier or a sailor such indifference to his merit is wormwood It is the bane of the professions Nine men out of ten who go into it must live discontented and die disappointed Captain Cuttwater had no idea that he was an old man He had lived for so many years among men of his own stamp who had grown grey and bald and rickety and weak alongside of him that he had no opportunity of seeing that he was more grey or more rickety than his neighbours No children had become men and women at his feet no new race had gone out into the world and fought their battles under his notice One set of midshipmen had succeeded to another but his old comrades in the news rooms and lounging places at Devonport had remained the same and Captain Cuttwater had never learnt to think that he was not doing and was not able to do good service for his country The very name of Captain Cuttwater was odious to every clerk at the Admiralty He like all naval officers hated the Admiralty and thought that of all Englishmen those five who had been selected to sit there in high places as joint lords were the most incapable He pestered them with continued and almost continuous applications on subjects of all sorts He was always asking for increased allowances advanced rank more assistance less work higher privileges immunities which could not be granted and advantages to which he had no claim He never took answers but made every request the subject of a prolonged correspondence till at last some energetic Assistant Secretary declared that it should no longer be borne and Captain Cuttwater was dismissed with pension and half pay During his service he had contrived to save some four or five thousand pounds and now he was about to retire with an assured income adequate to all his wants The public who had the paying of Captain Cuttwater may perhaps think that he was amply remunerated for what he had done but the captain himself entertained a very different opinion Such is the view which we are obliged to take of the professional side of Captain Cuttwater s character But the professional side was by far the worst Counting fathoms of rope and looking after unruly midshipmen on shore are not duties capable of bringing out in high relief the better traits of a main s character Uncle Bat as during the few last years of his life he was always called at Surbiton Cottage was a gentleman and a man of honour in spite of anything that might be said to the contrary at the Admiralty He was a man with a soft heart though the end of his nose was so large so red and so pimply and rough as was his usage to little midshipmen when his duty caused him to encounter them in a body he had befriended many a one singly with kind words and an open hand The young rogues would unmercifully quiz Old Nosey for so Captain Cuttwater was generally called in Devonport whenever they could safely do so but nevertheless in their young distresses they knew him for their friend and were not slow to come to him In person Captain Cuttwater was a tall heavy man on whose iron constitution hogsheads of Hollands and water seemed to have had no very powerful effect He was much given to profane oaths but knowing that manners required that he should refrain before ladies and being unable to bring his tongue sufficiently under command to do so he was in the habit of craving the ladies pardon after every slip All that was really remarkable in Uncle Bat s appearance was included in his nose It had always been a generous weighty self confident nose inviting to itself more observation than any of its brother features demanded But in latter years it had spread itself out in soft porous red excrescences to such an extent as to make it really deserving of considerable attention No stranger ever passed Captain Cuttwater in the streets of Devonport without asking who he was or at any rate specially noticing him It must of course be admitted that a too strongly pronounced partiality for alcoholic drink had produced these defects in Captain Cuttwater s nasal organ and yet he was a most staunch friend of temperance No man alive or dead had ever seen Captain Cuttwater the worse for liquor at least so boasted the captain himself and there were none at any rate in Devonport to give him the lie Woe betide the midshipman whom he should see elated with too much wine and even to the common sailor who should be tipsy at the wrong time he would show no mercy Most eloquent were the discourses which he preached against drunkenness and they always ended with a reference to his own sobriety The truth was that drink would hardly make Captain Cuttwater drunk It left his brain untouched but punished his nose missus Woodward had seen her uncle but once since she had become a widow He had then come up to London to attack the Admiralty at close quarters and had sojourned for three or four days at Surbiton Cottage This was now some ten years since and the girls had forgotten even what he was like Great preparations were made for him Though the summer had nearly commenced a large fire was kept burning in his bedroom his bed was newly hung with new curtains two feather beds were piled on each other and everything was done which five women could think desirable to relieve the ailings of suffering age The fact however was that Captain Cuttwater was accustomed to a small tent bedstead in a room without a carpet that he usually slept on a single mattress and that he never had a fire in his bedroom even in the depth of winter Travelling from Devonport to London is now an easy matter and Captain Cuttwater old as he was found himself able to get through to Hampton in one day missus Woodward went to meet him at Hampton Court in a fly and conveyed him to his new home together with a carpet bag a cocked hat a sword and a very small portmanteau When she inquired after the remainder of his luggage he asked her what more lumber she supposed he wanted No more lumber at any rate made its appearance then or afterwards and the fly proceeded with an easy load to Surbiton Cottage There was great anxiety on the part of the girls when the wheels were heard to stop at the front door Gertrude kept her place steadily standing on the rug in the drawing room Linda ran to the door and then back again but Katie bolted out and ensconced herself behind the parlour maid who stood at the open door looking eagerly forth to get the first view of Uncle Bat So here you are Bessie as snug as ever said the captain as he let himself ponderously down from the fly Katie had never before heard her mother called Bessie and had never seen anything approaching in size or colour to such a nose consequently she ran away frightened That s Gertrude is it said the captain Gertrude uncle Why Gertrude is a grown up woman now That s Katie whom you remember an infant God bless my soul said the captain as though he thought that girls must grow twice quicker at Hampton than they did at Devonport or elsewhere God bless my soul He was then ushered into the drawing room and introduced in form to his grand nieces This is Gertrude uncle and this Linda there is just enough difference for you to know them apart And this Katie Come here Katie and kiss your uncle Katie came up hesitated looked horrified but did manage to get her face somewhat close to the old man s without touching the tremendous nose and then having gone through this peril she retreated again behind the sofa Well bless my stars Bessie you don t tell me those are your children Indeed uncle I believe they are It s a sad tale for me to tell is it not said the blooming mother with a laugh Why they ll be looking out for husbands next said Uncle Bat Oh they re doing that already every day said Katie Ha ha ha laughed Uncle Bat I suppose so I suppose so ha ha ha Gertrude turned away to the window disgusted and angry and made up her mind to hate Uncle Bat for ever afterwards Linda made a little attempt to smile and felt somewhat glad in her heart that her uncle was a man who could indulge in a joke He was then taken upstairs to his bedroom and here he greatly frightened Katie and much scandalized the parlour maid by declaring immediately on his entering the room that it was d hot d ation hot craving your pardon ladies We thought uncle you d like a fire began missus Woodward as A fire in June when I can hardly carry my coat on my back It s the last day of May now said Katie timidly from behind the bed curtains This however did not satisfy the captain and orders were forthwith given that the fire should be taken away the curtains stripped off the feather beds removed and everything reduced to pretty much the same state in which it had usually been left for Harry Norman s accommodation So much for all the feminine care which had been thrown away upon the consideration of Uncle Bat s infirmities God bless my soul said he wiping his brow with a huge coloured handkerchief as big as a mainsail one night in such a furnace as that would have brought on the gout He had dined in town and by the time that his chamber had been stripped of its appendages he was nearly ready for bed Before he did so he was asked to take a glass of sherry Ah sherry said he taking up the bottle and putting it down again Sherry ah yes very good wine I am sure You haven t a drop of rum in the house have you missus Woodward declared with sorrow that she had not Or Hollands said Uncle Bat But the ladies of Surbiton Cottage were unsupplied also with Hollands Gin suggested the captain almost in despair missus Woodward had no gin but she could send out and get it and the first evening of Captain Cuttwater s visit saw missus Woodward s own parlour maid standing at the bar of the Green Dragon while two gills of spirits were being measured out for her Only for the respect she owed to Missus as she afterwards declared she never would have so demeaned herself for all the captains in the Queen s battalions The captain however got his grog and having enlarged somewhat vehemently while he drank it on the iniquities of those scoundrels at the Admiralty took himself off to bed and left his character and peculiarities to the tender mercies of his nieces The following day was Friday and on the Saturday Norman and Tudor were to come down as a matter of course During the long days they usually made their appearance after dinner but they had now been specially requested to appear in good orderly time in honour of the captain Their advent had been of course spoken of and missus Woodward had explained to Uncle Bat that her cousin Harry usually spent his Sundays at Hampton and that he usually also brought with him a friend of his a mister Tudor To all this as a matter of course Uncle Bat had as yet no objection to make The young men came and were introduced with due ceremony Surbiton Cottage however during dinnertime was very unlike what it had been before in the opinion of all the party there assembled The girls felt themselves called upon they hardly knew why to be somewhat less intimate in their manner with the young men than they customarily were and Harry and Alaric with quick instinct reciprocated the feeling missus Woodward even assumed involuntarily somewhat of a company air and Uncle Bat who sat at the bottom of the table in the place usually assigned to Norman was awkward in doing the honours of the house to guests who were in fact much more at home there than himself After dinner the young people strolled out into the garden and Katie as was her wont insisted on Harry Norman rowing her over to her damp paradise in the middle of the river He attempted vainly to induce Gertrude to accompany them Gertrude was either coy with her lover or indifferent for very few were the occasions on which she could be induced to gratify him with the rapture of a tete a tete encounter So that in fact Harry Norman s Sunday visits were generally moments of expected bliss of which the full fruition was but seldom attained So while Katie went off to the island Alaric and the two girls sat under a spreading elm tree and watched the little boat as it shot across the water And what do you think of Uncle Bat said Gertrude Well I am sure he s a good sort of fellow and a very gallant officer but But what said Linda It s a thousand pities he should have ever been removed from Devonport where I am sure he was both useful and ornamental Both the girls laughed cheerily and as the sound came across the water to Norman s ears he repented himself of his good nature to Katie and determined that her sojourn in the favourite island should on this occasion be very short But he is to pay mamma a great deal of money said Linda and his coming will be a great benefit to her in that way There ought to be something to compensate for the bore said Gertrude We must only make the best of him said Alaric For my part I am rather fond of old gentlemen with long noses but it seemed to me that he was not quite so fond of us I thought he looked rather shy at Harry and me Both the girls protested against this and declared that there could be nothing in it Well now I ll tell you what Gertrude said Alaric I am quite sure that he looks on me especially as an interloper and yet I ll bet you a pair of gloves I am his favourite before a month is over Oh no Linda is to be his favourite said Gertrude Indeed I am not said Linda I liked him very well till he drank three huge glasses of gin and water last night but I never can fancy him after that You can t conceive Alaric what the drawing room smelt like I suppose he ll do the same every evening Well what can you expect said Gertrude if mamma will have an old sailor to live with her of course he ll drink grog While this was going on in the garden missus Woodward sat dutifully with her uncle while he sipped his obnoxious toddy and answered his questions about their two friends They were both in the Weights and Measures by far the most respectable public office in London as she told him and both doing extremely well there They were indeed young men sure to distinguish themselves and get on in the world Had this not been so she might perhaps have hesitated to receive them so frequently and on such intimate terms at Surbiton Cottage This she said in a half apologetic manner and yet with a feeling of anger at herself that she should condescend to apologize to any one as to her own conduct in her own house They are very nice young men I am sure said Uncle Bat Indeed they are said missus Woodward And very civil to the young ladies said Uncle Bat They have known them since they were children uncle and of course that makes them more intimate than young men generally are with young ladies and again missus Woodward was angry with herself for making any excuses on the subject Are they well off asked the prudent captain Harry Norman is very well off he has a private fortune Both of them have excellent situations To my way of thinking that other chap is the better fellow At any rate he seems to have more gumption about him Why uncle you don t mean to tell me that you think Harry Norman a fool said missus Woodward Harry Norman was missus Woodward s special friend and she fondly indulged the hope of seeing him in time become the husband of her elder and favourite daughter if indeed she can be fairly said to have had a favourite child Captain Cuttwater poured out another glass of rum and dropped the subject Soon afterwards the whole party came in from the lawn Katie was all draggled and wet for she had persisted in making her way right across the island to look out for a site for another palace Norman was a little inclined to be sulky for Katie had got the better of him when she had got out of the boat he could not get her into it again and as he could not very well leave her in the island he had been obliged to remain paddling about while he heard the happy voices of Alaric and the two girls from the lawn Alaric was in high good humour and entered the room intent on his threatened purpose of seducing Captain Cuttwater s affections The two girls were both blooming with happy glee and Gertrude was especially bright in spite of the somewhat sombre demeanour of her lover Tea was brought in whereupon Captain Cuttwater having taken a bit of toast and crammed it into his saucer fell fast asleep in an arm chair You ll have very little opportunity to night said Linda almost in a whisper Opportunity for what asked missus Woodward Hush said Gertrude we ll tell you by and by mamma You ll wake Uncle Bat if you talk now I am so thirsty said Katie bouncing into the room with dry shoes and stockings on I am so thirsty Oh Linda do give me some tea Hush said Alaric pointing to the captain who was thoroughly enjoying himself and uttering sonorous snores at regular fixed intervals Sit down Katie and don t make a noise said missus Woodward gently Katie slunk into a chair opened wide her large bright eyes applied herself diligently to her teacup and then after taking breath said in a very audible whisper to her sister Are not we to talk at all Linda That will be very dull I think Yes my dear you are to talk as much as you please and as often as you please and as loud as you please that is to say if your mamma will let you said Captain Cuttwater without any apparent waking effort and in a moment the snoring was going on again as regularly as before Katie looked round and again opened her eyes and laughed missus Woodward said You are very good natured uncle The girls exchanged looks with Alaric and Norman who had not yet recovered his good humour went on sipping his tea As soon as the tea things were gone Uncle Bat yawned and shook himself and asked if it was not nearly time to go to bed Whenever you like Uncle Bat said missus Woodward who began to find that she agreed with Gertrude that early habits on the part of her uncle would be a family blessing But perhaps you ll take something before you go Well I don t mind if I do take a thimbleful of rum and water So the odious spirit bottle was again brought into the drawing room Did you call at the Admiralty sir as you came through town said Alaric Call at the Admiralty sir said the captain turning sharply round at the questioner what the deuce should I call at the Admiralty for craving the ladies pardon Well indeed I don t know said Alaric not a bit abashed But sailors always do call there for the pleasure I suppose of kicking their heels in the lords waiting room I have done with that game said Captain Cuttwater now wide awake and in his energy he poured half a glass more rum into his beaker I ve done with that game and I ll tell you what mister Tudor if I had a dozen sons to provide for to morrow Oh I do so wish you had said Katie it would be such fun Fancy Uncle Bat having twelve sons Gertrude What would you call them all uncle Why I tell you what Miss Katie I wouldn t call one of them a sailor I d sooner make tailors of them Tinker tailor soldier sailor gentleman apothecary ploughboy thief said Katie That would only be eight what should the other four be uncle You re quite right Captain Cuttwater said Alaric at least as far as the present moment goes but the time is coming when things at the Admiralty will be managed very differently Then I m d if that time can come too soon craving the ladies pardon said Uncle Bat I don t know what you mean Alaric said Harry Norman who was just at present somewhat disposed to contradict his friend and not ill inclined to contradict the captain also as far as I can judge the Admiralty is the very last office the Government will think of touching The Government shouted Captain Cuttwater oh if we are to wait for the Government the navy may go to the deuce sir It s the pressure from without that must do the work said Alaric Pressure from without said Norman scornfully I hate to hear such trash We ll see young gentleman we ll see said the captain it may be trash and it may be right that five fellows who never did the Queen a day s service in their life should get fifteen hundred or two thousand a year and have the power of robbing an old sailor like me of the reward due to me for sixty years hard work Reward no but the very wages that I have actually earned Look at me now d me look at me Here I am Captain Cuttwater with sixty years service and I ve done more perhaps for the Queen s navy than than It s too true Captain Cuttwater said Alaric speaking with a sort of mock earnestness which completely took in the captain but stealing a glance at the same time at the two girls who sat over their work at the drawing room table it s too true and there s no doubt the whole thing must be altered and that soon In the first place we must have a sailor at the head of the navy Yes said the captain and one that knows something about it too You ll never have a sailor sitting as first lord said Norman authoritatively unless it be when some party man high in rank may happen to have been in the navy as a boy And why not said Captain Cuttwater quite angrily Because the first lord must sit in the Cabinet and to do that he must be a thorough politician D politicians craving the ladies pardon said Uncle Bat Amen said Alaric Uncle Bat thinking that he had thoroughly carried his point finished his grog took up his candlestick and toddled off to bed Well I think I have done something towards carrying my point said Alaric I didn t think you were half so cunning said Linda laughing I cannot think how you can condescend to advocate opinions diametrically opposed to your own convictions said Norman somewhat haughtily Fee fo fum said Alaric What is it all about said missus Woodward Alaric wants to do all he can to ingratiate himself with Uncle Bat said Gertrude and I am sure he s going the right way to work It s very good natured on his part said missus Woodward I don t know what you are talking about said Katie yawning and I think you are all very stupid so I ll go to bed The rest soon followed her They did not sit up so late chatting over the fire this evening as was their wont on Saturdays though none of them knew what cause prevented it CHAPTER V BUSHEY PARK The next day being Sunday the whole party very properly went to church but during the sermon Captain Cuttwater very improperly went to sleep and snored ponderously the whole time Katie was so thoroughly shocked that she did not know which way to look Norman who had recovered his good humour and Alaric could not refrain from smiling as they caught the eyes of the two girls and missus Woodward made sundry little abortive efforts to wake her uncle with her foot Altogether abortive they were not for the captain would open his eyes and gaze at her for a moment in the most good natured lack lustre manner conceivable but then in a moment he would be again asleep and snoring with all the regularity of a kitchen clock This was at first very dreadful to the Woodwards but after a month or two they got used to it and so apparently did the pastor and the people of Hampton After church there was a lunch of course and then according to their wont they went out to walk These Sunday walks in general were matters of some difficulty The beautiful neighbourhood of Hampton Court with its palace gardens and lovely park is so popular with Londoners that it is generally alive on that day with a thronged multitude of men women and children and thus becomes not an eligible resort for lovers of privacy Captain Cuttwater however on this occasion insisted on seeing the chestnuts and the crowd and consequently they all went into Bushey Park Uncle Bat who professed himself to be a philanthropist and who was also a bit of a democrat declared himself delighted with what he saw It was a great thing for the London citizens to come down there with their wives and children and eat their dinners in the open air under the spreading trees and both Harry and Alaric agreed with him missus Woodward however averred that it would be much better if they would go to church first and Gertrude and Linda were of opinion that the Park was spoilt by the dirty bits of greasy paper which were left about on all sides Katie thought it very hard that as all the Londoners were allowed to eat their dinners in the Park she might not have hers there also To which Captain Cuttwater rejoined that he should give them a picnic at Richmond before the summer was over All the world knows how such a party as that of our friends by degrees separates itself into twos and threes when sauntering about in shady walks It was seldom indeed that Norman could induce his Dulcinea to be so complaisant in his favour but either accident or kindness on her part favoured him on this occasion and as Katie went on eliciting from Uncle Bat fresh promises as to the picnic Harry and Gertrude found themselves together under one avenue of trees while Alaric and Linda were equally fortunate or unfortunate under another I did so wish to speak a few words to you Gertrude said Norman but it seems as though now that this captain has come among us all our old habits and ways are to be upset I don t see that you need say that said she We may perhaps be put out a little that is mamma and Linda and I but I do not see that you need suffer Suffer no not suffer and yet it is suffering What is suffering said she Why to be as we were last night not able to speak to each other Come Harry you should be a little reasonable said she laughing If you did not talk last night whose fault was it I suppose you will say it was my own Perhaps it was But I could not feel comfortable while he was drinking gin and water It was rum said Gertrude rather gravely Well rum and water in your mother s drawing room and cursing and swearing before you and Linda as though he were in the cockpit of a man of war Alaric you saw was able to make himself happy and I am sure he is not more indifferent to us than you are Alaric seemed to me to be bent on making a fool of the old man and to tell the truth I cannot approve of his doing so It seems to me Harry that you do not approve of what any of us are doing said she I fear we are all in your black books Captain Cuttwater and mamma and Alaric and I and all of us Well now Gertrude do you mean to say you think it right that Katie should sit by and hear a man talk as Captain Cuttwater talked last night Do you mean to say that the scene which passed with the rum and the curses and the absurd ridicule which was thrown on your mother s uncle was such as should take place in your mother s drawing room I mean to say Harry that my mother is the best and only judge of what should and what should not take place there Norman felt himself somewhat silenced by this and walked on for a time without speaking He was a little too apt to take upon himself the character of Mentor and strange to say he was aware of his own fault in this particular Thus though the temptation to preach was very powerful he refrained himself for a while His present desire was to say soft things rather than sharp words and though lecturing was at this moment much easier to him than love making he bethought himself of his object and controlled the spirit of morality which was strong within him But we were so happy before your uncle came he said speaking with his sweetest voice and looking at the beautiful girl beside him with all the love he was able to throw into his handsome face And we are happy now that he has come or at any rate ought to be said Gertrude doing a little in the Mentor line herself now that the occasion came in her way Ah Gertrude you know very well there is only one thing can make me happy said Harry Why you unreasonable man just now you said you were perfectly happy before Captain Cuttwater came I suppose the one thing now necessary is to send him away again No Gertrude the thing necessary is to take you away What out of the contamination of poor old Uncle Bat s bottle of rum But Harry you see it would be cowardly in me to leave mamma and Linda to suffer the calamity alone I wonder Gertrude whether in your heart of hearts you really care a straw about me said Harry who was now very sentimental and somewhat lachrymose You know we all care very much about you and it is very wrong in you to express such a doubt said Gertrude with a duplicity that was almost wicked as if she did not fully understand that the kind of caring of which Norman spoke was of a very different nature from the general caring which she on his behalf shared with the rest of her family All of you yes but I am not speaking of all of you I am speaking of you Gertrude you in particular Can you ever love me well enough to be my wife Well there is no knowing what I may be able to do in three or four years time but even that must depend very much on how you behave yourself in the mean time If you get cross because Captain Cuttwater has come here and snub Alaric and Linda as you did last night and scold at mamma because she chooses to let her own uncle live in her own house why to tell you the truth I don t think I ever shall All persons who have a propensity to lecture others have a strong constitutional dislike to being lectured themselves Such was decidedly the case with Harry Norman In spite of his strong love and his anxious desire to make himself agreeable his brow became somewhat darkened and his lips somewhat compressed He would not probably have been annoyed had he not been found fault with for snubbing his friend Tudor Why should Gertrude his Gertrude put herself forward to defend his friend Let her say what she chose for her mother or even for her profane dram drinking vulgar old uncle but it was too much that she should take up the cudgels for Alaric Tudor Well said he I was annoyed last night and I must own it It grieved me to hear Alaric turning your uncle into ridicule and that before your mother s face and it grieved me to see you and Linda encourage him In what Alaric said about the Admiralty he did not speak truthfully Do you mean to say that Alaric said what was false Inasmuch as he was pretending to express his own opinion he did say what was false Then I must and will say that I never yet knew Alaric say a word that was not true and which is more I am quite sure that he would not accuse you of falsehood behind your back in a fit of jealousy Jealousy said Norman looking now as black as grim death itself Yes it is jealousy It so turned out that Alaric got on better last night with Captain Cuttwater than you did and that makes you jealous Pish said Norman somewhat relieved but still sufficiently disgusted that his lady love should suppose that he could be otherwise than supremely indifferent to the opinion of Captain Cuttwater The love scene however was fatally interrupted and the pair were not long before they joined the captain missus Woodward and Katie And how fared it with the other pair under the other avenue of chestnuts Alaric Tudor had certainly come out with no defined intention of making love as Harry Norman had done but with such a companion it was very difficult for him to avoid it Linda was much more open to attacks of this nature than her sister Not that she was as a general rule willingly and wilfully inclined to give more encouragement to lovers than Gertrude but she had less power of fence less skill in protecting herself and much less of that naughty self esteem which makes some women fancy that all love making to them is a liberty and the want of which makes others feel that all love making is to them a compliment Alaric Tudor had no defined intention of making love but he had a sort of suspicion that he might if he pleased do so successfully and he had no defined intention of letting it alone He was a far seeing prudent man for his age perhaps too prudent but he was nevertheless fully susceptible of the pleasure of holding an affectionate close intercourse with so sweet a girl as Linda Woodward and though he knew that marriage with a girl without a dowry would for him be a death blow to all his high hopes he could hardly resist the temptation of conjugating the verb to love Had he been able to choose from the two sisters he would probably have selected Gertrude in spite of what he had said to Norman in the boat but Gertrude was bespoken and it therefore seemed all but unnatural that there should not be some love passages between him and Linda Ah missus Woodward my friend my friend was it well that thou shouldst leave that sweet unguarded rosebud of thine to such perils as these They also commenced their wooing by talking over Captain Cuttwater but they did not quarrel over him Linda was quite content to be told by her friend what she ought to do and how she ought to think about her uncle and Alaric had a better way of laying down the law than Norman He could do so without offending his hearer s pride and consequently was generally better listened to than his friend though his law was probably not in effect so sound But they had soon done with Captain Cuttwater and Alaric had to choose another subject Gertrude and Norman were at some distance from them but were in sight and somewhat in advance Look at Harry said Alaric I know from the motion of his shoulder that he is at this moment saying something very tender It is ten times more likely that they are quarrelling said Linda Oh the quarrels of lovers we know all about that don t we You must not call them lovers Alaric mamma would not like it nor indeed would Gertrude I am sure I would not for the world do anything that missus Woodward would not like but between ourselves Linda are they not lovers No that is not that I know of I don t believe that they are a bit said Linda blushing at her own fib And why should they not be How indeed is it possible that they should not be that is for I heartily beg Gertrude s pardon how is it possible that Harry should not be in love with her Indeed Gertrude is very very beautiful said Linda with the faintest possible sigh occasioned by the remembrance of her own inferior charms Indeed she is very very beautiful repeated Alaric speaking with an absent air as though his mind were fully engaged in thinking of the beauty of which he spoke It was not in Linda s nature to be angry because her sister was admired and because she was not But yet there was something in Alaric s warm tone of admiration which gave her a feeling of unhappiness which she would have been quite unable to define even had she attempted it She saw her sister and Harry Norman before her and she knew in her heart that they were lovers in spite of her little weak declaration to the contrary She saw how earnestly her sister was loved and she in her kindly loving nature could not but envy her fancied happiness Envy no it certainly was not envy She would not for worlds have robbed her sister of her admirer but it was so natural for her to feel that it must be delicious to be admired She did not begrudge Gertrude Norman s superior beauty nor his greater wealth she knew that Gertrude was entitled to more much more than herself But seeing that Norman was Gertrude s lover was it not natural that Alaric should be hers And then though Harry was the handsomer and the richer she liked Alaric so much the better of the two But now that Alaric was alone with her the only subject he could think to talk of was Gertrude s beauty It must not be supposed that these thoughts in their plainly developed form passed through Linda s mind It was not that she thought all this but that she felt it Such feelings are quite involuntary whereas one s thoughts are more or less under command Linda would not have allowed herself to think in this way for worlds but she could not control her feelings They walked on side by side perfectly silent for a minute or two and an ill natured tear was gathering itself in the corner of Linda s eye she was afraid even to raise her hand to brush it away for fear Alaric should see her and thus it went on gathering till it was like to fall How singular it is said Alaric how very singular the way in which I find myself living with you all such a perfect stranger as I am A perfect stranger said Linda who having remembered Alaric since the days of her short frocks and lessons looked on him as a very old friend indeed Yes a perfect stranger if you think of it What do any of you know about me Your mother never saw my mother your father knew nothing of my father there is no kindred blood common to us Harry Norman there is your near cousin but what am I that I should be thus allowed to live with you and walk with you and have a common interest in all your doings Why you are a dear friend of mamma s are you not A dear friend of mamma s said he well indeed I hope I am for your mother is at any rate a dear friend to me But Linda one cannot be so much without longing to be more Look at Harry how happy he is But Alaric surely you would not interfere with Harry said Linda whose humble innocent heart thought still of nothing but the merits of her sister and then remembering that it was necessary that she should admit nothing on Gertrude s behalf she entered her little protest against the assumption that her sister acknowledged Norman for her lover That is you would not do so if there were anything in it I interfere with Harry said Alaric switching the heads off the bits of fern with the cane he carried No indeed I have no wish at all to do that It is not that of which I was thinking Harry is welcome to all his happiness that is if Gertrude can be brought to make him happy Linda made no answer now but the tear came running down her face and her eyes became dim and her heart beat very quick and she didn t quite remember where she was Up to this moment no man had spoken a word of love to Linda Woodward and to some girls the first word is very trying Interfere with Harry Alaric repeated again and renewed his attack on the ferns Well Linda what an opinion you must have of me Linda was past answering she could not protest nor would it have been expedient to do so that her opinion of her companion was not unfavourable Gertrude is beautiful very beautiful he continued still beating about the bush as modest lovers do and should do but she is not the only beautiful girl in Surbiton Cottage nor to my eyes is she the most so Linda was now quite beside herself She knew that decorum required that she should say something stiff and stately to repress such language but if all her future character for propriety had depended on it she could not bring herself to say a word She knew that Gertrude when so addressed would have maintained her dignity and have concealed her secret even if she allowed herself to have a secret to conceal She knew that it behoved her to be repellent and antagonistic to the first vows of a first lover But alas she had no power of antagonism no energy for repulse left in her Her knees seemed to be weak beneath her and all she could do was to pluck to pieces the few flowers that she carried at her waist Alaric saw his advantage but was too generous to push it closely nor indeed did he choose to commit himself to all the assured intentions of a positive declaration He wished to raise an interest in Linda s heart and having done so to leave the matter to chance Something however it was necessary that he should say He walked a while by her in silence decapitating the ferns and then coming close to her he said Linda dear Linda you are not angry with me Linda however answered nothing Linda dearest Linda speak one word to me Don t said Linda through her tears Pray don t Alaric pray don t Well Linda I will not say another word to you now Let us walk gently we shall catch them up quite in time before they leave the park And so they sauntered on exchanging no further words Linda by degrees recovered her calmness and as she did so she found herself to be oh so happy She had never never envied Gertrude her lover but it was so sweet so very sweet to be able to share her sister s happiness And Alaric was he also happy At the moment he doubtless enjoyed the triumph of his success But still he had a feeling of sad care at his heart How was he to marry a girl without a shilling Were all his high hopes was all his soaring ambition to be thrown over for a dream of love Ah missus Woodward my friend my friend thou who wouldst have fed thy young ones like the pelican with blood from thine own breast had such feeding been of avail thou who art the kindest of mothers has it been well for thee to subject to such perils this poor weak young dove of thine Uncle Bat had become tired with his walk and crawled home so slowly that Alaric and Linda caught the party just as they reached the small wicket which leads out of the park on the side nearest to Hampton Nothing was said or thought of their absence and they all entered the house together Four of them however were conscious that that Sunday s walk beneath the chestnuts of Bushey Park would long be remembered Nothing else occurred to make the day memorable In the evening after dinner missus Woodward and her daughters went to church leaving her younger guests to entertain the elder one The elder one soon took the matter in his own hand by going to sleep and Harry and Alaric being thus at liberty sauntered out down the river side They both made a forced attempt at good humour each speaking cheerily to the other but there was no confidence between them as there had been on that morning when Harry rowed his friend up to London Ah me what had occurred between them to break the bonds of their mutual trust to quench the ardour of their firm friendship But so it was between them now It was fated that they never again should place full confidence in each other There was no such breach between the sisters at least not as yet but even between them there was no free and full interchange of their hopes and fears Gertrude and Linda shared the same room and were accustomed as what girls are not to talk half through the night of all their wishes thoughts and feelings And Gertrude was generally prone enough to talk of Harry Norman Sometimes she would say she loved him a little just a little at others she would declare that she loved him not at all that is not as heroines love in novels not as she thought she could love and would do should it ever be her lot to be wooed by such a lover as her young fancy pictured to her Then she would describe her beau ideal and the description certainly gave no counterpart of Harry Norman To tell the truth however Gertrude was as yet heart whole and when she talked of love and Harry Norman she did not know what love was On this special Sunday evening she was disinclined to speak of him at all Not that she loved him more than usual but that she was beginning to think that she could not ever really love him at all She had taught herself to think that he might probably be her husband and had hitherto felt no such repugnance to her destiny as caused her to shun the subject But now she was beginning to think of the matter seriously and as she did so she felt that life might have for her a lot more blessed than that of sharing the world with her cousin Harry When therefore Linda began to question her about her lover and to make little hints of her desire to tell what Alaric had said of her and Norman Gertrude gave her no encouragement She would speak of Captain Cuttwater of Katie s lessons of the new dress they were to make for their mother of mister Everscreech s long sermon of anything in fact but of Harry Norman Now this was very hard on poor Linda Her heart was bursting within her to tell her sister that she also was beloved but she could not do so without some little encouragement In all their conferences she took the cue of the conversation from her sister and though she could have talked about Alaric by the hour if Gertrude would have consented to talk about Harry she did not know how to start the subject of her own lover while Gertrude was so cold and uncommunicative as to hers She struggled very hard to obtain the privilege for which she so anxiously longed but in doing so she only met with a sad and sore rebuff Gertrude at last said Linda when Gertrude thought that the subject had been put to rest at any rate for that night don t you think mamma would be pleased if she knew that you had engaged yourself to Harry Norman No said Gertrude evincing her strong mind by the tone in which she spoke I do not If mamma wished it she would have told me for she never has any secrets I should be as wrong to engage myself with Harry as you would be with Alaric For though Harry has property of his own while poor Alaric has none he has a very insufficient income for a married man and I have no fortune with which to help him If nothing else prevented it I should consider it wicked in me to make myself a burden to a man while he is yet so young and comparatively so poor Prudent sensible high minded well disciplined Gertrude But had her heart really felt a spark of love for the man of whom she spoke how much would prudent sensible high minded considerations have weighed with her Alas not a feather Having made her prudent high minded speech she turned round and slept and poor Linda also turned round and bedewed her pillow She no longer panted to tell her sister of Alaric s love On the next morning the two young men returned to town and the customary dullness of the week began CHAPTER VI SIR GREGORY HARDLINES Great changes had been going on at the Weights and Measures or rather it might be more proper to say that great changes were now in progress From that moment in which it had been hinted to mister Hardlines that he must relax the rigour of his examinations he had pondered deeply over the matter Hitherto he had confined his efforts to his own office and so far from feeling personally anxious for the amelioration of the Civil Service generally had derived no inconsiderable share of his happiness from the knowledge that there were such sinks of iniquity as the Internal Navigation To be widely different from others was mister Hardlines glory He was perhaps something of a Civil Service Pharisee and wore on his forehead a broad phylactery stamped with the mark of Crown property He thanked God that he was not as those publicans at Somerset House and took glory to himself in paying tithes of official cumin But now he was driven to a wider range Those higher Pharisees who were above him in his own pharisaical establishment had interfered with the austerity of his worship He could not turn against them there on their own ground He of all men could not be disobedient to official orders But if he could promote a movement beyond the walls of the Weights and Measures if he could make Pharisees of those benighted publicans in the Strand if he could introduce conic sections into the Custom House and political economy into the Post Office if by any effort of his the Foreign Office clerks could be forced to attend punctually at ten and that wretched saunterer whom five days a week he saw lounging into the Council Office if he could be made to mend his pace what a wide field for his ambition would mister Hardlines then have found Great ideas opened themselves to his mind as he walked to and from his office daily What if he could become the parent of a totally different order of things What if the Civil Service through his instrumentality should become the nucleus of the best intellectual diligence in the country instead of being a byword for sloth and ignorance mister Hardlines meditated deeply on this and as he did so it became observed on all sides that he was an altered man as regarded his solicitude for the Weights and Measures One or two lads crept in by no means conspicuous for their attainments in abstract science young men too were observed to leave not much after four o clock without calling down on themselves mister Hardlines usual sarcasm Some said he was growing old others that he was broken hearted But mister Hardlines was not old nor broken in heart or body He was thinking of higher things than the Weights and Measures and at last he published a pamphlet mister Hardlines had many enemies all in the Civil Service one of the warmest of whom was mister Oldeschole of the Navigation and at first they rejoiced greatly that Job s wish had been accomplished on their behalf and that their enemy had written a book They were down on mister Hardlines with reviews counter pamphlets official statements and indignant contradiction but mister Hardlines lived through this storm of missiles and got his book to be feted and made much of by some Government pundits who were very bigwigs indeed And at last he was invited over to the building on the other side to discuss the matter with a President a Secretary of State a Lord Commissioner two joint Secretaries and three Chairmen And then for a period of six months the light of mister Hardlines face ceased to shine on the children of the Weights and Measures and they felt one and all that the glory had in a certain measure departed from their house Now and again mister Hardlines would look in but he did so rather as an enemy than as a friend There was always a gleam of antagonistic triumph in his eye which showed that he had not forgotten the day when he was called in question for his zeal He was felt to be in opposition to his own Board rather than in company operation with it The Secretary and the Assistant Secretaries would say little caustic things about him to the senior clerks and seemed somewhat to begrudge him his new honours But for all this mister Hardlines cared little The President and the Secretary of State the joint Secretaries and the Chairmen all allowed themselves to be led by him in this matter His ambition was about to be gratified It was his destiny that he should remodel the Civil Service What was it to him whether or no one insignificant office would listen to his charming Let the Secretary at the Weights and Measures sneer as he would he would make that hero of the metallic currency know that he mister Hardlines was his master At the end of six months his budding glory broke out into splendid full blown many coloured flowers He resigned his situation at the Weights and Measures and was appointed Chief Commissioner of the Board of Civil Service Examination with a salary of Ltwo thousand a year he was made a K C B and shone forth to the world as Sir Gregory Hardlines and he received a present of Lone thousand that happy ne plus ultra of Governmental liberality Sir Gregory Hardlines was forced to acknowledge to himself that he was born to a great destiny When Sir Gregory as we must now call him was first invited to give his attendance at another office he found it expedient to take with him one of the young men from the Weights and Measures and he selected Alaric Tudor Now this was surprising to many for Tudor had been brought into the office not quite in accordance with Sir Gregory s views But during his four years of service Alaric had contrived to smooth down any acerbity which had existed on this score either the paper on the strike bushel or his own general intelligence or perhaps a certain amount of flattery which he threw into his daily intercourse with the chief clerk had been efficacious and when Sir Gregory was called upon to select a man to take with him to his new temporary office he selected Alaric Tudor The main effect which such selection had upon our story rises from the circumstance that it led to an introduction between Tudor and the Honourable Undecimus Scott and that this introduction brought about a close alliance We will postpone for a short while such description of the character and position of this gentleman as it may be indispensable to give and will in this place merely say that the Honourable Undecimus Scott had been chosen to act as secretary to the temporary commission that was now making inquiry as to the proposed Civil Service examinations and that in this capacity he was necessarily thrown into communication with Tudor He was a man who had known much of officialities had filled many situations was acquainted with nearly all the secretaries assistant secretaries and private secretaries in London had been in Parliament and was still hand and glove with all young members who supported Government Tudor therefore thought it a privilege to know him and allowed himself to become in a certain degree subject to his influence When it was declared to the world of Downing Street that Sir Gregory Hardlines was to be a great man to have an office of his own and to reign over assistant commissioners and subject secretaries there was great commotion at the Weights and Measures and when his letter of resignation was absolutely there visible to the eyes of clerks properly docketed and duly minuted routine business was for a day nearly suspended Gentlemen walked in and out from each other s rooms asking this momentous question Who was to fill the chair which had so long been honoured by the great Hardlines Who was to be thought worthy to wear that divine mantle But even this was not the question of the greatest moment which at that period disturbed the peace of the office It was well known that the chief clerk must be chosen from one of the three senior clerks and that he would be so chosen by the voice of the Commissioners There were only three men who were deeply interested in this question But who would then be the new senior clerk and how would he be chosen A strange rumour began to be afloat that the new scheme of competitive examination was about to be tried in filling up this vacancy occasioned by the withdrawal of Sir Gregory Hardlines From hour to hour the rumour gained ground and men s minds began to be much disturbed It was no wonder that men s minds should be disturbed Competitive examinations at eighteen twenty and twenty two may be very well and give an interesting stimulus to young men at college But it is a fearful thing for a married man with a family who has long looked forward to rise to a certain income by the worth of his general conduct and by the value of his seniority it is a fearful thing for such a one to learn that he has again to go through his school tricks and fill up examination papers with all his juniors round him using their stoutest efforts to take his promised bread from out of his mouth Detur digno is a maxim which will make men do their best to merit rewards every man can find courage within his heart to be worthy but detur digniori is a fearful law for such a profession as the Civil Service What worth can make a man safe against the possible greater worth which will come treading on his heels The spirit of the age raises from year to year to a higher level the standard of education The prodigy of eighteen fifty seven who is now destroying all the hopes of the man who was well enough in eighteen fifty five will be a dunce to the tyro of eighteen sixty There were three or four in the Weights and Measures who felt all this with the keenest anxiety The fact of their being there and of their having passed the scrutiny of mister Hardlines was proof enough that they were men of high attainments but then the question arose to them and others whether they were men exactly of those attainments which were now most required Who is to say what shall constitute the merits of the dignior It may one day be conic sections another Greek iambics and a third German philosophy Rumour began to say that foreign languages were now very desirable The three excellent married gentlemen who stood first in succession for the coveted promotion were great only in their vernacular Within a week from the secession of Sir Gregory his immediate successor had been chosen and it had been officially declared that the vacant situation in the senior class was to be thrown open as a prize for the best man in the office Here was a brilliant chance for young merit The place was worth Lsix hundred a year and might be gained by any one who now received no more than Lone hundred Each person desirous of competing was to send in his name to the Secretary on or before that day fortnight and on that day month the candidates were to present themselves before Sir Gregory Hardlines and his board of Commissioners And yet the joy of the office was by no means great The senior of those who might become competitors was of course a miserable disgusted man He went about fruitlessly endeavouring to instigate rebellion against Sir Gregory that very Sir Gregory whom he had for many years all but worshipped Poor Jones was to tell the truth in a piteous case He told the Secretary flatly that he would not compete with a lot of boys fresh from school and his friends began to think of removing his razors Nor were Brown and Robinson in much better plight They both it is true hated Jones ruthlessly and desired nothing better than an opportunity of supplanting him They were moreover fast friends themselves but not the less on that account had Brown a mortal fear of Robinson as also had Robinson a mortal fear of Brown Then came the bachelors First there was Uppinall who when he entered the office was supposed to know everything which a young man had ever known Those who looked most to dead knowledge were inclined to back him as first favourite It had however been remarked that his utility as a clerk had not been equal to the profundity of his acquirements Of all the candidates he was the most self confident The next to him was mister A Minusex a wondrous arithmetician He was one who could do as many sums without pen and paper as a learned pig who was so given to figures that he knew the number of stairs in every flight he had gone up and down in the metropolis one who whatever the subject before him might be never thought but always counted Many who knew the peculiar propensities of Sir Gregory s earlier days thought that mister Minusex was not an unlikely candidate The sixth in order was our friend Norman The Secretary and the two Assistant Secretaries when they first put their heads together on the matter declared that he was the most useful man in the office There was a seventh named Alphabet Precis mister Precis peculiar forte was a singular happiness in official phraseology Much that he wrote would doubtless have been considered in the purlieus of Paternoster Row as ungrammatical if not unintelligible but according to the syntax of Downing Street it was equal to Macaulay and superior to Gibbon He had frequently said to his intimate friends that in official writing style was everything and of his writing it certainly did form a very prominent part He knew well none perhaps so well when to beg leave to lay before the Board and when simply to submit to the Commissioners He understood exactly to whom it behoved the secretary to have the honour of being a very humble servant and to whom the more simple I am sir was a sufficiently civil declaration These are qualifications great in official life but were not quite so much esteemed at the time of which we are speaking as they had been some few years previously There was but one other named as likely to stand with any probability of success and he was Alaric Tudor Among the very juniors of the office he was regarded as the great star of the office There was a dash about him and a quick readiness for any work that came to hand in which perhaps he was not equalled by any of his compeers Then too he was the special friend of Sir Gregory But no one had yet heard Tudor say that he intended to compete with his seven seniors none yet knew whether he would put himself forward as an adversary to his own especial friend Norman That Norman would be a candidate had been prominently stated For some few days not a word was spoken even between the friends themselves as to Tudor s intention On the Sunday they were as usual at Hampton and then the subject was mooted by no less a person than Captain Cuttwater So you young gentlemen up in London are all going to be examined are you said he what is it to be about Who s to be first lieutenant of the ship is that it Oh no said Alaric nothing half so high as that Boatswain s mate would be nearer the mark And who is to be the successful man Oh Harry Norman here He was far the first favourite in yesterday s betting And how do you stand yourself said Uncle Bat Oh I m only an outsider said Alaric They put my name down just to swell the number but I shall be scratched before the running begins Indeed he won t said Harry He ll run and distance us all There is no one who has a chance with him Why he is Sir Gregory s own pet There was nothing more said on the subject at Surbiton Cottage The ladies seemed instinctively to perceive that it was a matter which they had better leave alone Not only were the two young men to be pitted against each other but Gertrude and Linda were as divided in their wishes on the subject as the two candidates could be themselves On the following morning however Norman introduced the subject I suppose you were only jesting yesterday said he when you told the captain that you were not going to be a candidate Indeed I can hardly say that I was in jest or in earnest said Alaric I simply meant to decline to discuss the subject with Uncle Bat But of course you do mean to stand said Harry Alaric made no answer Perhaps you would rather decline to discuss the matter with me also said Harry Not at all I would much prefer discussing it openly and honestly My own impression is that I had better leave it alone And why so said Harry Why so repeated Alaric Well there are so many reasons In the first place there would be seven to one against me and I must confess that if I did stand I should not like to be beaten The same argument might keep us all back said Norman That s true but one man will be more sensitive more cowardly if you will than another and then I think no one should stand who does not believe himself to have a fair chance His doing so might probably mar his future prospects How can I put myself in competition with such men as Uppinall and Minuses Harry laughed slightly for he knew it had been asked by many how such men as Uppinall and Minusex could think of putting themselves in competition with Alaric Tudor That is something like mock modesty is it not Alaric No by heaven it is not I know well what those men are made of and I know or think I know my own abilities I will own that I rank myself as a human creature much higher than I rank them But they have that which I have not and that which they have is that which these examiners will chiefly require If you have no other reason said Norman I would strongly advise you to send in your name Well Harry I have another reason and though last it is by no means the least You will be a candidate and probably the successful one To tell you the truth I have no inclination to stand against you Norman turned very red and then answered somewhat gravely I would advise you to lay aside that objection I fairly tell you that I consider your chance better than my own And suppose it be so which I am sure it is not but suppose it be so what then Why you will do right to take advantage of it Yes and so gain a step and lose a friend said Alaric No there can be no heartburn to me in your being selected for though I am older than you you are my senior in the office But were I to be put over your head it would in the course of nature make a division between us and if it were possible that you should forgive it it would be quite impossible that Gertrude should do so I value your friendship and that of the Woodwards too highly to risk it Norman instantly fired up with true generous energy I should be wretched said he if I thought that such a consideration weighed with you I would rather withdraw myself than allow such a feeling to interfere with your prospects Indeed after what you have said I shall not send in my own name unless you also send in yours I shall only be creating fuel for a feud said Alaric To put you out of the question no promotion could compensate to me for what I should lose at Hampton Nonsense man you would lose nothing Faith I don t know whether it is not I that should lose if I were successful at your expense How would Gertrude receive me said Alaric pushing the matter further than he perhaps should have done We won t mind Gertrude said Norman with a little shade of black upon his brow You are an older man than I and therefore promotion is to you of more importance than to me You are also a poorer man I have some means besides that drawn from my office which if I marry I can settle on my wife you have none such I should consider myself to be worse than wicked if I allowed any consideration of such a nature to stand in the way of your best interests Believe me Alaric that though I shall as others be anxious for success myself I should in failing be much consoled by knowing that you had succeeded And as he finished speaking he grasped his friend s hand warmly in token of the truth of his assertion Alaric brushed a tear from his eye and ended by promising to be guided by his friend s advice Harry Norman as he walked into the office felt a glow of triumph as he reflected that he had done his duty by his friend with true disinterested honesty And Alaric he also felt a glow of triumph as he reflected that come what might there would be now no necessity for him to break with Norman or with the Woodwards Norman must now always remember that it was at his own instigation that he Alaric had consented to be a candidate As regarded the real fact of the candidature the prize was too great to allow of his throwing away such a chance Alaric s present income was Ltwo hundred that which he hoped to gain was Lsix hundred CHAPTER VII mister FIDUS NEVERBEND Immediately on entering the office Tudor gave it to be understood that he intended to give in his name as a candidate but he had hardly done so when his attention was called off from the coming examinations by another circumstance which was ultimately of great importance to him One of the Assistant Secretaries sent for him and told him that his services having been required by Sir Gregory Hardlines for a week or so he was at once to go over to that gentleman s office and Alaric could perceive that as Sir Gregory s name was mentioned the Assistant Secretary smiled on him with no aspect of benign solicitude He went over accordingly and found that Sir Gregory having been desired to select a man for a special service in the country had named him He was to go down to Tavistock with another gentleman from the Woods and Forests for the purpose of settling some disputed point as to the boundaries and privileges of certain mines situated there on Crown property You know nothing about mining I presume said Sir Gregory Nothing whatever said Alaric I thought not that was one reason why I selected you What is wanted is a man of sharp intelligence and plain common sense and one also who can write English for it will fall to your lot to draw up the report on the matter mister Neverbend who is to be your colleague cannot put two words together mister Neverbend said Alaric Yes Fidus Neverbend of the Woods and Forests a very excellent public servant and one in whom the fullest confidence can be placed But between you and me he will never set the Thames on fire Does he understand mining asked Alaric He understands Government properties and will take care that the Crown be not wronged but Tudor the Government will look to you to get the true common sense view of the case I trust I mean that I really do trust that you will not disgrace my choice Alaric of course promised that he would do his best expressed the deepest gratitude to his patron and went off to put himself into communication with mister Neverbend at the Woods and Forests having received an assurance that the examination in his own office should not take place till after his return from Tavistock He was not slow to perceive that if he could manage to come back with all the eclat of a successful mission the prestige of such a journey would go far to assist him on his coming trial mister Fidus Neverbend was an absolute dragon of honesty His integrity was of such an all pervading nature that he bristled with it as a porcupine does with its quills He had theories and axioms as to a man s conduct and the conduct especially of a man in the Queen s Civil Service up to which no man but himself could live Consequently no one but himself appeared to himself to be true and just in all his dealings A quarter of an hour spent over a newspaper was in his eyes a downright robbery If he saw a man so employed he would divide out the total of salary into hourly portions and tell him to a fraction of how much he was defrauding the public If he ate a biscuit in the middle of the day he did so with his eyes firmly fixed on some document and he had never been known to be absent from his office after ten or before four When Sir Gregory Hardlines declared that mister Fidus Neverbend would never set the Thames on fire he meant to express his opinion that that gentleman was a fool and that those persons who were responsible for sending mister Neverbend on the mission now about to be undertaken were little better than fools themselves for so sending him But mister Neverbend was no fool He was not a disciple of Sir Gregory s school He had never sat in that philosopher s porch or listened to the high doctrines prevalent at the Weights and Measures He could not write with all mister Precis conventional correctness or dispose of any subject at a moment s notice as would mister Uppinall but nevertheless he was no fool Sir Gregory like many other wise men thought that there were no swans but of his own hatching and would ask with all the pompous conceit of Pharisees in another age whether good could come out of the Woods and Forests Sir Gregory however perfectly succeeded in his object of imbuing Tudor with a very indifferent opinion of his new colleague s abilities It was his object that Tudor should altogether take the upper hand in the piece of work which was to be done between them and that it should be clearly proved how very incapable the Woods and Forests were of doing their own business mister Fidus Neverbend however whatever others in the outer world might think of him had a high character in his own office and did not under estimate himself He when he was told that a young clerk named Tudor was to accompany him conceived that he might look on his companion rather in the light of a temporary private secretary than an equal partner and imagined that new glory was added to him by his being so treated The two men therefore met each other with very different views But though mister Neverbend was no fool he was not an equal either in tact or ability to Alaric Tudor Alaric had his interview with him and was not slow to perceive the sort of man with whom he had to act Of course on this occasion little more than grimaces and civility passed between them but mister Neverbend even in his grimaces and civility managed to show that he regarded himself as decidedly No one upon the occasion Well mister Tudor said he I think of starting on Tuesday Tuesday will not I suppose be inconvenient to you Sir Gregory has already told me that we are expected to be at Tavistock on Tuesday evening Ah I don t know about that said Neverbend that may be all very well for Sir Gregory but I rather think I shall stay the night at Plymouth It will be the same to me said Tudor I haven t looked at the papers yet so I can hardly say what may be necessary No no of course not As to the papers I don t know that there is much with which you need trouble yourself I believe I am pretty well up in the case But mister Tudor there will be a good deal of writing to do when we are there We are both used to that I fancy said Tudor so it won t kill us No of course not I understand that there will be a good many people for me to see a great many conflicting interests for me to reconcile and probably I may find myself obliged to go down two or three of these mines Well that will be good fun said Alaric Neverbend drew himself up The idea of having fun at the cost of Government was painful to him however he spared the stranger his reproaches and merely remarked that the work he surmised would be heavy enough both for the man who went below ground and for the one who remained above The only point settled between them was that of their starting by an early train on the Tuesday named and then Alaric returned to Sir Gregory s office there to read through and digest an immense bulk of papers all bearing on the question at issue There had it appeared been lately opened between the Tamar and the Tavy a new mine which had become exceedingly prosperous outrageously prosperous as shareholders and directors of neighbouring mines taught themselves to believe Some question had arisen as to the limits to which the happy possessors of this new tin El Dorado were entitled to go squabbles of course had been the result and miners and masters had fought and bled each side in defence of its own rights As a portion of these mines were on Crown property it became necessary that the matter should be looked to and as the local inspector was accused of having been bribed and bought and of being in fact an absolute official Judas it became necessary to send some one to inspect the inspector Hence had come Alaric s mission The name of the mine in question was Wheal Mary Jane and Alaric had read the denomination half a score of times before he learnt that there was no real female in the case The Sunday before he went was of course passed at Hampton and there he received the full glory of his special appointment He received glory and Norman in an equal degree fell into the background missus Woodward stuck kindly to Harry and endeavoured in her gentle way to quiz the projected trip to Devonshire But the other party was too strong and her raillery failed to have the intended effect Gertrude especially expressed her opinion that it was a great thing for so young a man to have been selected for such employment by such a person and Linda though she said less could not prevent her tell tale face from saying more Katie predicted that Alaric would certainly marry Mary Jane Wheal and bring her to Surbiton Cottage and Captain Cuttwater offered to the hero introductions to all the old naval officers at Devonport By jingo I should like to go with you said the captain I fear the pleasure would not repay the trouble said Alaric laughing Upon my word I think I ll do it said the captain It would be of the greatest possible service to you as an officer of the Crown It would give you so much weight there I could make you known you know I could not hear of such a thing said Alaric trembling at the idea which Uncle Bat had conjured up There is Admiral Starbod and Captain Focassel and old Hardaport and Sir Jib Boom why d n me they would all do anything for me craving the ladies pardon Alaric in his own defence was obliged to declare that the rules of the service especially required that he should hold no friendly communication with any one during the time that he was employed on this special service Poor Captain Cuttwater grieved to have his good nature checked was obliged to put up with this excuse and consoled himself with abusing the Government which could condescend to give so absurd an order This was on the Saturday On the Sunday going to church the captain suggested that Alaric might at any rate just call upon Sir Jib on the sly It would be a great thing for you said Uncle Bat I ll write a note to night and you can take it with you Sir Jib is a rising man and you ll regret it for ever if you miss the opportunity Now Sir Jib Boom was between seventy and eighty and he and Captain Cuttwater had met each other nearly every day for the last twenty years and had never met without a squabble After church they had their usual walk and Linda s heart palpitated as she thought that she might have to undergo another tete a tete with her lover But it palpitated in vain It so turned out that Alaric either avoided or at any rate did not use the privilege and Linda returned home with an undefined feeling of gentle disappointment She had fully made up her mind to be very staid very discreet and very collected to take a leaf out of her sister s book and give him no encouragement whatever she would not absolutely swear to him that she did not now and never could return his passion but she would point out how very imprudent any engagement between two young persons situated as they were must be how foolish it would be for them to bind themselves for any number of years to a marriage which must be postponed she would tell Alaric all this and make him understand that he was not to regard himself as affianced to her but she with a woman s faith would nevertheless remain true to him This was Linda s great resolve and the strong hope that in a very few weeks Alaric would be promoted to a marrying income of Lsix hundred per annum made the prospect of the task not so painful as it might otherwise have been Fate however robbed her of the pleasure if it would have been a pleasure of sacrificing her love to her duty and dear Linda dearest Linda was not again whispered into her ear And what on earth is it that you are to do down in the mines asked missus Woodward as they sat together in the evening Nothing on the earth missus Woodward it is to be all below the surface forty fathom deep said Alaric Take care that you ever come up again said she They say the mine is exceedingly rich perhaps I may be tempted to stay down there Then you ll be like the gloomy gnome that lives in dark cold mines said Katie Isn t it very dangerous going down into those places asked Linda Men go down and come up again every day of their lives and what other men can do I can I suppose That doesn t follow at all said Captain Cuttwater What sort of a figure would you make on a yard arm reefing a sail in a gale of wind Pray do take care of yourself said Gertrude Norman s brow grew black I thought that it was settled that mister Neverbend was to go down and that you were to stay above ground said he So mister Neverbend settled it but that arrangement may perhaps be unsettled again said Alaric with a certain feeling of confidence in his own strong will I don t at all doubt said missus Woodward that if we were to get a sly peep at you we should find you both sitting comfortably at your inn all the time and that neither of you will go a foot below the ground Very likely All I mean to say is that if Neverbend goes down I ll go too But mind you gloomy gnome mind you bring up a bit of gold for me said Katie On the Monday morning he started with the often expressed good wishes of all the party and with a note for Sir Jib Boom which the captain made him promise that he would deliver and which Alaric fully determined to lose long before he got to Plymouth That evening he and Norman passed together As soon as their office hours were over they went into the London Exhibition which was then open and there walking up and down the long centre aisle they talked with something like mutual confidence of their future prospects This was a favourite resort with Norman who had schooled himself to feel an interest in works of art Alaric s mind was of a different cast he panted rather for the great than the beautiful and was inclined to ridicule the growing taste of the day for torsos Palissy ware and Assyrian monsters There was then some mutual confidence between the two young men Norman who was apt to examine himself and his own motives more strictly than Alaric ever did had felt that something like suspicion as to his friend had crept over him and he had felt also that there was no ground for such suspicion He had determined to throw it off and to be again cordial with his companion He had resolved so to do before his last visit at Hampton but it was at Hampton that the suspicion had been engendered and there he found himself unable to be genial kindly and contented Surbiton Cottage was becoming to him anything but the abode of happiness that it had once been A year ago he had been the hero of the Hampton Sundays he could not but now feel that Alaric had as it were supplanted him with his own friends The arrival even of so insignificant a person as Captain Cuttwater and Captain Cuttwater was very insignificant in Norman s mind had done much to produce this state of things He had been turned out of his bedroom at the cottage and had therefore lost those last loving lingering words sometimes protracted to so late an hour which had been customary after Alaric s departure to his inn those last lingering words which had been so sweet because their sweetness had not been shared with his friend He could not be genial and happy at Surbiton Cottage but he was by no means satisfied with himself that he should not have been so When he found that he had been surly with Alaric he was much more angry with himself than Alaric was with him Alaric indeed was indifferent about it He had no wish to triumph over Harry but he had an object to pursue and he was not the man to allow himself to be diverted from it by any one s caprice This trip is a great thing for you said Harry Well I really don t know Of course I could not decline it but on the whole I should be just as well pleased to have been spared If I get through it well why it will be well But even that cannot help me at this examination I don t know that Why a week passed in the slush of a Cornish mine won t teach a man algebra It will give you prestige Then you mean to say the examiners won t examine fairly well perhaps so But what will be the effect on me if I fail I know nothing of mines I have a colleague with me of whom I can only learn that he is not weak enough to be led or wise enough to lead who is so self opinionated that he thinks he is to do the whole work himself and yet so jealous that he fears I shall take the very bread out of his mouth What am I to do with such a man You must manage him said Harry That is much easier said than done replied Alaric I wish you had the task instead of me So do not I Sir Gregory when he chose you knew what he was about Upon my word Harry you are full of compliments to day I really ought to take my hat off No I am not I am in no mood for compliments I know very well what stuff you are made of I know your superiority to myself I know you will be selected to go up over all our heads I feel all this and Alaric you must not be surprised that to a certain degree it is painful to me to feel it But by God s help I will get over it and if you succeed it shall go hard with me but I will teach myself to rejoice at it Look at that fawn there said he turning away his face to hide the tear in his eye did you ever see more perfect motion Alaric was touched but there was more triumph than sympathy in his heart It was sweet much too sweet to him to hear his superiority thus acknowledged He was superior to the men who worked round him in his office He was made of a more plastic clay than they and despite the inferiority of his education he knew himself to be fit for higher work than they could do As the acknowledgement was made to him by the man whom of those around him he certainly ranked second to himself he could not but feel that his heart s blood ran warm within him he could not but tread with an elastic step But it behoved him to answer Harry and to answer him in other spirit than this Oh Harry said he you have some plot to ruin me by my own conceit to make me blow myself out and destroy myself poor frog that I am in trying to loom as largely as that great cow Fidus Neverbend You know I am fully conscious how much inferior my education has been to yours Education is nothing said Harry Education is nothing Alaric triumphantly re echoed the words in his heart Education is nothing mind mind is everything mind and the will So he expressed himself to his own inner self but out loud he spoke much more courteously It is the innate modesty of your own heart Harry that makes you think so highly of me and so meanly of yourself But the proof of what we each can do is yet to be seen Years alone can decide that That your career will be honourable and happy of that I feel fully sure I wish I were as confident of mine But Alaric said Norman going on rather with the thread of his own thoughts than answering or intending to answer what the other said in following up your high ambition and I know you have a high ambition do not allow yourself to believe that the end justifies the means because you see that men around you act as though they believed so Do I do so do I seem to do so said Alaric turning sharply round Don t be angry with me Alaric don t think that I want to preach but sometimes I fancy not that you do so but that your mind is turning that way that in your eager desire for honourable success you won t scrutinize the steps you will have to take That I would get to the top of the hill in short even though the hillside be miry Well I own I wish to get to the top of the hill But not to defile yourself in doing so When a man comes home from a successful chase with his bag well stuffed with game the women do not quarrel with him because there is mud on his gaiters Alaric that which is evil is evil Lies are evil And am I a liar Heaven forbid that I should say so heaven forbid that I should have to think so but it is by such doctrines as that that men become liars What by having muddy gaiters By disregarding the means in looking to the end And I will tell you how men become mere vegetables by filling their minds with useless needless scruples by straining at gnats Well finish your quotation said Harry I have finished it in speaking to you I would not for the world go on and seem to insinuate that you would swallow a camel No insinuation could be more base or unjust But nevertheless I think you may be too over scrupulous What great man ever rose to greatness continued Alaric after they had walked nearly the length of the building in silence who thought it necessary to pick his steps in the manner you have described Then I would not be great said Harry But surely God intends that there shall be great men on the earth He certainly wishes that there should be good men said Harry And cannot a man be good and great That is the problem for a man to solve Do you try that Good you certainly can be if you look to Him for assistance Let that come first and then the greatness if that be possible It is all a quibble about a word said Alaric What is good David was a man after God s own heart and a great man too and yet he did things which were I to do I should be too base to live Look at Jacob how did he achieve the tremendous rights of patriarchal primogeniture But come the policemen are trying to get rid of us it is time for us to go and so they left the building and passed the remainder of the evening in concord together in concord so soon to be dissolved and ah perhaps never to be renewed On the next morning Alaric and his new companion met each other at an early hour at the Paddington station Neverbend was rather fussy with his dispatch box and a large official packet which an office messenger dashing up in a cab brought to him at the moment of his departure Neverbend s enemies were wont to declare that a messenger a cab and a big packet always rushed up at the moment of his starting on any of his official trips Then he had his ticket to get and his Times to buy and he really had not leisure to do more than nod at Alaric till he had folded his rug around him tried that the cushion was soft enough and completed his arrangements for the journey Well mister Tudor at last he said as soon as the train was in motion and how are you this morning ready for work I hope Well not exactly at this moment said Alaric One has to get up so early for these morning trains Early mister Tudor my idea is that no hour should be considered either early or late when the Crown requires our services Just at present the Crown requires nothing else of us I suppose but that we should go along at the rate of forty miles an hour There is nothing like saving time said Neverbend I know you have as yet had no experience in these sort of cases so I have brought you the papers which refer to a somewhat similar matter that occurred in the Forest of Dean I was sent down there and that is the report which I then wrote I propose to take it for the model of that which we shall have to draw up when we return from Tavistock and as he spoke he produced a voluminous document or treatise in which he had contrived to render more obscure some matter that he had been sent to clear up on the Crown property in the Forest of Dean Now Alaric had been told of this very report and was aware that he was going to Tavistock in order that the joint result of his and mister Neverbend s labours might be communicated to the Crown officers in intelligible language The monster report before him contained twenty six pages of close folio writing and he felt that he really could not oblige mister Neverbend by reading it Forest of Dean ah that s coal is it not said Alaric Mary Jane seems to be exclusively in the tin line I fear there will be no analogy The cases are in many respects similar said Neverbend and the method of treating them Then I really cannot concur with you as to the propriety of my reading it I should feel myself absolutely wrong to read a word of such a report for fear I might be prejudiced by your view of the case It would in my mind be positively dishonest in me to encourage any bias in my own feelings either on one side or the other But really mister Tudor I need not say how much personal advantage it would be to me to have the benefit of your experience but my conscience tells me that I should not do it so I think I ll go to sleep mister Neverbend did not know what to make of his companion whether to admire the high tone of his official honesty or to reprobate his idleness in refusing to make himself master of the report While he was settling the question in his own mind Tudor went to sleep and did not wake till he was invited to partake of ten minutes refreshment at Swindon I rather think said mister Neverbend that I shall go on to Tavistock to night Oh of course said Alaric I never for a moment thought of stopping short of it and taking out a book he showed himself disinclined for further conversation Of course it s open to me to do as I please in such a matter said Neverbend continuing his subject as soon as they reached the Bristol station but on the whole I rather think we had better go on to Tavistock to night No I will not stop at Plymouth he said as he passed by Taunton and on reaching Exeter he declared that he had fully made up his mind on the subject We ll get a chaise at Plymouth said Alaric I think there will be a public conveyance said Neverbend But a chaise will be the quickest said the one And much the dearest said the other That won t signify much to us said Alaric we shan t pay the bill It will signify a great deal to me said Neverbend with a look of ferocious honesty and so they reached Plymouth On getting out of the railway carriage Alaric at once hired a carriage with a pair of horses the luggage was strapped on and mister Neverbend before his time for expostulation had fairly come found himself posting down the road to Tavistock followed at a respectful distance by two coaches and an omnibus They were soon drinking tea together at the Bedford Hotel and I beg to assure any travelling readers that they might have drunk tea in a much worse place mister Neverbend though he made a great struggle to protect his dignity and maintain the superiority of his higher rank felt the ground sinking from beneath his feet from hour to hour He could not at all understand how it was but even the servants at the hotel seemed to pay more deference to Tudor than to him and before the evening was over he absolutely found himself drinking port wine negus because his colleague had ordered it for him And now said Neverbend who was tired with his long journey I think I ll go to bed Do said Alaric who was not at all tired and I ll go through this infernal mass of papers I have hardly looked at them yet Now that I am in the neighbourhood I shall better understand the strange names So Alaric went to work and studied the dry subject that was before him It will luckily not be necessary for us to do so also It will be sufficient for us to know that Wheal Mary Jane was at that moment the richest of all the rich mines that had then been opened in that district that the or its or her shares which is the proper way of speaking of them I am shamefully ignorant were at an enormous premium that these two Commissioners would have to see and talk to some scores of loud and angry men deeply interested in their success or failure and that that success or failure might probably in part depend on the view which these two Commissioners might take CHAPTER VIII THE honorable UNDECIMUS SCOTT The honorable Undecimus Scott was the eleventh son of the Lord Gaberlunzie Lord Gaberlunzie was the representative of a very old and very noble race more conspicuous however at the present time for its age and nobility than for its wealth The honorable Undecimus therefore learnt on arriving at manhood that he was heir only to the common lot of mortality and that he had to earn his own bread This however could not have surprised him much as nine of his brethren had previously found themselves in the same condition Lord Gaberlunzie certainly was not one of those wealthy peers who are able to make two or three elder sons and after that to establish any others that may come with comfortable younger children s portions The family was somewhat accustomed to the res angusta domi but they were fully alive to the fact that a noble brood such as their own ought always to be able to achieve comfort and splendour in the world s broad field by due use of those privileges which spring from a noble name Cauldkail Castle in Aberdeenshire was the family residence but few of the eleven young Scotts were ever to be found there after arriving at that age at which they had been able to fly from the paternal hall It is a terrible task that of having to provide for eleven sons With two or three a man may hope with some reasonable chance of seeing his hope fulfilled that things will go well with him and that he may descend to his grave without that worst of wretchedness that gnawing grief which comes from bad children But who can hope that eleven sons will all walk in the narrow path Had Lord Gaberlunzie however been himself a patriarch and ruled the pastoral plains of Palestine instead of the bleak mountains which surround Cauldkail Castle he could not have been more indifferent as to the number of his sons They flew away each as his time came with the early confidence of young birds and as seldom returned to disturb the family nest They were a cannie comely sensible brood Their father and mother if they gave them nothing else gave them strong bodies and sharp brains They were very like each other though always with a difference Red hair bright as burnished gold high but not very high cheek bones and small sharp twinkling eyes were the Gaberlunzie personal characteristics There were three in the army two in the navy and one at a foreign embassy one was at the diggings another was chairman of a railway company and our own more particular friend Undecimus was picking up crumbs about the world in a manner that satisfied the paternal mind that he was quite able to fly alone There is a privilege common to the sons of all noble lords the full value of which the young Scotts learnt very early in life that of making any woman with a tocher an honourable lady Ye maun be a puir chiel gin ye ll be worth less than ten thoosand pound in the market o marriage and ten thoosand pound is a gawcey grand heritage Such had been the fatherly precept which Lord Gaberlunzie had striven to instil into each of his noble sons and it had not been thrown away upon them One after the other they had gone forth into the market place alluded to and had sold themselves with great ease and admirable discretion There had been but one Moses in the lot the honorable Gordon Hamilton Scott had certainly brought home a bundle of shagreen spectacle cases in the guise of a widow with an exceedingly doubtful jointure doubtful indeed at first but very soon found to admit of no doubt whatever He was the one who with true Scotch enterprise was prosecuting his fortunes at the Bendigo diggings while his wife consoled herself at home with her title Undecimus with filial piety had taken his father exactly at his word and swapped himself for Lten thousand He had however found himself imbued with much too high an ambition to rest content with the income arising from his matrimonial speculation He had first contrived to turn his real Lten thousand into a fabulous Lfifty thousand and had got himself returned to Parliament for the Tillietudlem district burghs on the credit of his great wealth he then set himself studiously to work to make a second market by placing his vote at the disposal of the Government Nor had he failed of success in his attempt though he had hitherto been able to acquire no high or permanent post He had soon been appointed private secretary to the First Lord of the Stannaries and he found that his duty in this capacity required him to assist the Government whip in making and keeping houses This occupation was congenial to his spirit and he worked hard and well at it but the greatest of men are open to the tainting breath of suspicion and the Honourable Undecimus Scott or Undy Scott as he was generally now called did not escape Ill natured persons whispered that he was not on all occasions true to his party and once when his master the whip in chief overborne with too much work had been tempted to put himself to bed comfortably in his own house instead of on his usual uneasy couch behind the Speaker s chair Undy had greatly failed The leader of a party whose struggles for the religion of his country had hitherto met but small success saw at a glance the opportunity which fortune had placed in his way he spied with eagle eye the nakedness of that land of promise which is compressed in the district round the Treasury benches the barren field before him was all his own and he put and carried his motion for closing the parks on Sundays He became a hero but Undy was all but undone The highest hope of the Sabbatarian had been to address an almost empty house for an hour and a half on this his favourite subject But the chance was too good to be lost he sacrificed his oratorical longings on the altar of party purpose and limited his speech to a mere statement of his motion Off flew on the wings of Hansom a youthful member more trusty than the trusted Undy to the abode of the now couchant Treasury Argus Morpheus had claimed him all for his own He was lying in true enjoyment with his tired limbs stretched between the unaccustomed sheets and snoring with free and sonorous nose restrained by the contiguity of no Speaker s elbow But even in his deepest slumber the quick wheels of the bounding cab struck upon the tympanum of his anxious ear He roused himself as does a noble watch dog when the suspicious tread of theft approaches The hurry of the jaded horse the sudden stop the maddened furious knock all told a tale which his well trained ear only knew too well He sat up for a moment listening in his bed stretched himself with one involuntary yawn and then stood upright on the floor It should not at any rate be boasted by any one that he had been found in bed With elastic step three stairs at a time up rushed that young and eager member It was well for the nerves of missus Whip Vigil that the calls of society still held her bound in some distant brilliant throng for no consideration would have stopped the patriotic energy of that sucking statesman mister Vigil had already performed the most important act of a speedy toilet when his door was opened and as his young friend appeared was already buttoning his first brace Pumpkin is up said the eager juvenile and we have only five men in the house And where the devil is Undy Scott said the Right honorable mister Vigil The devil only knows said the other I deserve it for trusting him said the conscience stricken but worthy public servant By this time he had on his neckcloth and boots in his eager haste to serve his country he had forgotten his stockings I deserve it for trusting him and how many men have they Forty one when I left Then they ll divide of course Of course they will said the promising young dove of the Treasury And now mister Whip Vigil had buttoned on that well made frock with which the Parliamentary world is so conversant and as he descended the stairs arranged with pocket comb his now grizzling locks His well brushed hat stood ready to his touch below and when he entered the cab he was apparently as well dressed a gentleman as when about three hours after noon he may be seen with slow and easy step entering the halls of the Treasury chambers But ah alas he was all too late He came but to see the ruin which Undy s defection had brought about He might have taken his rest and had a quiet mind till the next morning s Times revealed to him the fact of mister Pumpkin s grand success When he arrived the numbers were being taken and he even he mister Whip Vigil he the great arch numberer was excluded from the number of the counted When the doors were again open the Commons of England had decided by a majority of forty one to seven that the parks of London should one and all be closed on Sundays and mister Pumpkin had achieved among his own set a week s immortality We mustn t have this again Vigil said a very great man the next morning with a good humoured smile on his face however as he uttered the reprimand It will take us a whole night and God knows how much talking to undo what those fools did yesterday mister Vigil resolved to leave nothing again to the unassisted industry or honesty of Undy Scott and consequently that gentleman s claims on his party did not stand so highly as they might have done but for this accident Parliament was soon afterwards dissolved and either through the lukewarm support of his Government friends or else in consequence of his great fortune having been found to be ambiguous the independent electors of the Tillietudlem burghs took it into their heads to unseat mister Scott Unseated for Tillietudlem he had no means of putting himself forward elsewhere and he had to repent in the sackcloth and ashes of private life the fault which had cost him the friendship of mister Vigil His life however was not strictly private He had used the Honourable before his name and the M P which for a time had followed after it to acquire for himself a seat as director at a bank board He was a Vice President of the Caledonian English Irish and General European and American Fire and Life Assurance Society such at least had been the name of the joint stock company in question when he joined it but he had obtained much credit by adding the word Oriental and inserting it after the allusion to Europe he had tried hard to include the fourth quarter of the globe but as he explained to some of his friends it would have made the name too cumbrous for the advertisements He was a director also of one or two minor railways dabbled in mining shares and altogether did a good deal of business in the private stock jobbing line In spite of his former delinquencies his political friends did not altogether throw him over In the first place the time might come when he would be again useful and then he had managed to acquire that air and tact which make one official man agreeable to another He was always good humoured when in earnest there was a dash of drollery about him in his most comic moods he ever had some serious purpose in view he thoroughly understood the esoteric and exoteric bearings of modern politics and knew well that though he should be a model of purity before the public it did not behove him to be very strait laced with his own party He took everything in good part was not over talkative over pushing or presumptuous he felt no strong bias of his own had at his fingers ends the cant phraseology of ministerial subordinates and knew how to make himself useful He knew also a knowledge much more difficult to acquire how to live among men so as never to make himself disagreeable But then he could not be trusted True But how many men in his walk of life can be trusted And those who can at how terribly high a price do they rate their own fidelity How often must a minister be forced to confess to himself that he cannot afford to employ good faith Undy Scott therefore from time to time received some ministerial bone some Civil Service scrap of victuals thrown to him from the Government table which if it did not suffice to maintain him in all the comforts of a Treasury career still preserved for him a connexion with the Elysium of public life gave him as it were a link by which he could hang on round the outer corners of the State s temple and there watch with advantage till the doors of Paradise should be re opened to him He was no Lucifer who having wilfully rebelled against the high majesty of Heaven was doomed to suffer for ever in unavailing but still proud misery the penalties of his asserted independence but a poor Peri who had made a lapse and thus forfeited for a while celestial joys and was now seeking for some welcome offering striving to perform some useful service by which he might regain his lost glory The last of the good things thus tendered to him was not yet all consumed When mister Hardlines now Sir Gregory was summoned to assist at or rather preside over the deliberations of the committee which was to organize a system of examination for the Civil Service the honorable U Scott had been appointed secretary to that committee This to be sure afforded but a fleeting moment of halcyon bliss but a man like mister Scott knew how to prolong such a moment to its uttermost stretch The committee had ceased to sit and the fruits of their labour were already apparent in the establishment of a new public office presided over by Sir Gregory but still the clever Undy continued to draw his salary Undy was one of those men who though married and the fathers of families are always seen and known en garcon No one had a larger circle of acquaintance than Undy Scott no one apparently a smaller circle than missus Undy Scott So small indeed was it that its locale was utterly unknown in the fashionable world At the time of which we are now speaking Undy was the happy possessor of a bedroom in Waterloo Place and rejoiced in all the comforts of a first rate club But the sacred spot in which at few and happy intervals he received the caresses of the wife of his bosom and the children of his loins is unknown to the author In age mister Scott at the time of the Tavistock mining inquiry was about thirty five Having sat in Parliament for five years he had now been out for four and was anxiously looking for the day when the universal scramble of a general election might give him another chance In person he was as we have said stalwart and comely hirsute with copious red locks not only over his head but under his chin and round his mouth He was well made six feet high neither fat nor thin and he looked like a gentleman He was careful in his dress but not so as to betray the care that he took he was imperturbable in temper though restless in spirit and the one strong passion of his life was the desire of a good income at the cost of the public He had an easy way of getting intimate with young men when it suited him and as easy a way of dropping them afterwards when that suited him He had no idea of wasting his time or opportunities in friendships Not that he was indifferent as to his companions or did not appreciate the pleasure of living with pleasant men but that life was too short and with him the race too much up hill to allow of his indulging in such luxuries He looked on friendship as one of those costly delights with which none but the rich should presume to gratify themselves He could not afford to associate with his fellow men on any other terms than those of making capital of them It was not for him to walk and talk and eat and drink with a man because he liked him How could the eleventh son of a needy Scotch peer who had to maintain his rank and position by the force of his own wit how could such a one live if he did not turn to some profit even the convivialities of existence Acting in accordance with his fixed and conscientious rule in this respect Undy Scott had struck up an acquaintance with Alaric Tudor He saw that Alaric was no ordinary clerk that Sir Gregory was likely to have the Civil Service under his thumb and that Alaric was a great favourite with the great man It would but little have availed Undy to have striven to be intimate with Sir Gregory himself The Knight Commander of the Bath would have been deaf to his blandishments but it seemed probable that the ears of Alaric might be tickled And thus Alaric and Undy Scott had become fast friends that is as fast as such friends generally are Alaric was no more blind to his own interest than was his new ally But there was this difference between them Undy lived altogether in the utilitarian world which he had formed around himself whereas Alaric lived in two worlds When with Undy his pursuits and motives were much such as those of Undy himself but at Surbiton Cottage and with Harry Norman he was still susceptible of a higher feeling He had been very cool to poor Linda on his last visit to Hampton but it was not that his heart was too hard for love He had begun to discern that Gertrude would never attach herself to Norman and if Gertrude were free why should she not be his Poor Linda Scott had early heard and of what official event did he not obtain early intelligence that Neverbend was to go down to Tavistock about the Mary Jane tin mine and that a smart colleague was required for him He would fain for reasons of his own have been that smart colleague himself but that he knew was impossible He and Neverbend were the Alpha and Omega of official virtues and vices But he took an opportunity of mentioning before Sir Gregory in a passing unpremeditated way how excellently adapted Tudor was for the work It so turned out that his effort was successful and that Tudor was sent The whole of their first day at Tavistock was passed by Neverbend and Alaric in hearing interminable statements from the various mining combatants and when at seven o clock Alaric shut up for the evening he was heartily sick of the job The next morning before breakfast he sauntered out to air himself in front of the hotel and who should come whistling up the street with a cigar in his mouth but his new friend Undy Scott CHAPTER IX mister MANYLODES Alaric Tudor was very much surprised Had he seen Sir Gregory himself or Captain Cuttwater walking up the street of Tavistock he could not have been more startled It first occurred to him that Scott must have been sent down as a third Commissioner to assist at the investigation and he would have been right glad to have known that this was the case for he found that the management of mister Neverbend was no pastime But he soon learnt that such relief was not at hand for him Well Tudor my boy said he and how do you like the clotted cream and the thick ankles of the stout Devonshire lasses I have neither tasted the one nor seen the other said Alaric As yet I have encountered nothing but the not very civil tongues and not very clear brains of Cornish roughs A Boeotian crew but nevertheless they know on which side their bread is buttered and in general it goes hard with them but they butter it on both sides And how does the faithful Neverbend conduct himself Talk of Boeotians if any man ever was born in a foggy air it must have been my friend Fidus Alaric merely shrugged his shoulders and laughed slightly But what on earth brings you down to Tavistock said he Oh I am a denizen of the place naturalized and all but settled have vast interests here and a future constituency Let the Russells look well to themselves The time is quickly coming when you will address me in the House with bitter sarcasm as the honourable but inconsistent member for Tavistock egad who knows but you may have to say Right Honourable Oh I did not know the wind blew in that quarter said Alaric not ill pleased at the suggestion that he also on some future day might have a seat among the faithful Commons The wind blows from all quarters with me said Undy but in the meantime I am looking out for shares Will you come in and breakfast asked the other What with friend Fidus no thank ee I am not by many degrees honest enough to suit his book He would be down on some little public peccadillo of mine before I had swallowed my first egg Besides I would not for worlds break the pleasure of your tete a tete Will you come down after dinner No neither after dinner nor before breakfast not all the coffee nor all the claret of the Bedford shall tempt me Remember my friend you are paid for it I am not Well then good morning said Alaric I must go in and face my fate like a Briton Undy went on for a few steps and then returned as though a sudden thought had struck him But Tudor I have bowels of compassion within me though no pluck I am willing to rescue you from your misery though I will not partake it Come up to me this evening and I will give you a glass of brandy punch Your true miners never drink less generous tipple How on earth am I to shake off this incubus of the Woods and Works Shake him off Why make him drunk and put him to bed or tell him at once that the natural iniquity of your disposition makes it necessary that you should spend a few hours of the day in the company of a sinner like myself Tell him that his virtue is too heavy for the digestive organs of your unpractised stomach Tell him what you will but come I myself am getting sick of those mining Vandals though I am so used to dealing with them Alaric promised that he would come and then went in to breakfast Undy also returned to his breakfast well pleased with this first success in the little scheme which at present occupied his mind The innocent young Commissioner little dreamt that the Honourable mister Scott had come all the way to Tavistock on purpose to ask him to drink brandy punch at the Blue Dragon Another day went wearily and slowly on with Alaric and mister Neverbend Tedious never ending statements had to be taken down in writing the same things were repeated over and over again and were as often contradicted men who might have said in five words all that they had to say would not be constrained to say it in less than five thousand and each one seemed to think or pretended to seem to think that all the outer world and the Government were leagued together to defraud the interest to which he himself was specially attached But this was not the worst of it There were points which were as clear as daylight but Tudor could not declare them to be so as by doing so he was sure to elicit a different opinion from mister Neverbend I am not quite so clear on that point mister Tudor he would say Alaric till experience made him wise would attempt to argue it That is all very well but I am not quite so sure of it We will reserve the point if you please and so affairs went on darkly no ray of light being permitted to shine in on the matter in dispute It was settled however before dinner that they should both go down the Wheal Mary Jane on the following day Neverbend had done what he could to keep this crowning honour of the inquiry altogether in his own hands but he had found that in this respect Tudor was much too much for him Immediately after dinner Alaric announced that he was going to spend the evening with a friend A friend said Neverbend somewhat startled I did not know that you had any friends in Tavistock Not a great many but it so happened that I did meet a man I know this morning and promised to go to him in the evening I hope you ll excuse my leaving you Oh I don t mind for myself said Neverbend though when men are together it s as well for them to keep together But mister Tudor Well said Alaric who felt growing within him a determination to put down at once anything like interference with his private hours Perhaps I ought not to mention it said Neverbend but I do hope you ll not get among mining people Only think what our position here is What on earth do you mean said Alaric Do you think I shall be bribed over by either side because I choose to drink a glass of wine with a friend at another hotel Bribed No I don t think you ll be bribed but I think we should both keep ourselves absolutely free from all chance of being talked to on the subject except before each other and before witnesses I would not drink brandy and water at the Blue Dragon before this report be written even if my brother were there Well mister Neverbend I am not so much afraid of myself But wherever there are two men there will be two opinions So good night if it so chance that you are in bed before my return So Tudor went out and Neverbend prepared himself to sit up for him He would sooner have remained up all night than have gone to bed before his colleague came back Three days Alaric Tudor had now passed with mister Neverbend and not only three days but three evenings also A man may endure to be bored in the course of business through the day but it becomes dreadful when the infliction is extended to post prandial hours It does not often occur that one is doomed to bear the same bore both by day and night any change gives some ease but poor Alaric for three days had had no change He felt like a liberated convict as he stepped freely forth into the sweet evening air and made his way through the town to the opposition inn Here he found Undy on the door steps with a cigar in his mouth Here I am waiting for you said he You are fagged to death I know and we ll get a mouthful of fresh air before we go upstairs and so saying he put his arm through Alaric s and they strolled off through the suburbs of the town You don t smoke said Undy with his cigar case in his hand Well I believe you are right cigars cost a great deal of money and can t well do a man any real good God Almighty could never have intended us to make chimneys of our mouths and noses Does Fidus ever indulge in a weed He never indulges in anything said Alaric Except honesty said the other and in that he is a beastly glutton He gorges himself with it till all his faculties are overpowered and his mind becomes torpid It s twice worse than drinking I wonder whether he ll do a bit of speculation before he goes back to town Who Neverbend he never speculates Why not Ah my fine fellow you don t know the world yet Those sort of men dull drones like Neverbend are just the fellows who go the deepest I ll be bound he will not return without a few Mary Janes in his pocket book He ll be a fool if he does I know Why that s the very mine we are down here about And that s the very reason why he ll purchase Mary Janes He has an opportunity of knowing their value Oh let Neverbend alone He is not so young as you are my dear fellow Young or old I think you mistake his character Why Tudor what would you think now if he not only bought for himself but was commissioned to buy by the very men who sent him down here It would be hard to make me believe it Ah faith is a beautiful thing what a pity that it never survives the thirtieth year except with women and fools And have you no faith Scott Yes much in myself some little in Lord Palmerston that is in his luck and a good deal in a bank note But I have none at all in Fidus Neverbend What have faith in a man merely because he tells me to have it His method of obtaining it is far too easy I trust neither his wit nor his judgement but I don t believe him to be a thief Thief I said nothing of thieves He may for aught I know be just as good as the rest of the world all I say is that I believe him to be no better But come we must go back to the inn there is an ally of mine coming to me a perfect specimen of a sharp Cornish mining stockjobber as vulgar a fellow as you ever met and as shrewd He won t stay very long so you need not be afraid of him Alaric began to feel uneasy and to think that there might by possibility be something in what Neverbend had said to him He did not like the idea of meeting a Cornish stock jobber in a familiar way over his brandy punch while engaged as he now was on the part of Government he felt that there might be impropriety in it and he would have been glad to get off if he could But he felt ashamed to break his engagement and thus followed Undy into the hotel Has mister Manylodes been here said Scott as he walked upstairs He s in the bar now sir said the waiter Beg him to come up then In the bar why that man must have a bar within himself the alcohol he consumes every day would be a tidy sale for a small public house Up they went and mister Manylodes was not long in following them He was a small man more like an American in appearance than an Englishman He had on a common black hat a black coat black waistcoat and black trousers thick boots a coloured shirt and very dirty hands Though every article he wore was good and most of them such as gentlemen wear no man alive could have mistaken him for a gentleman No man conversant with the species to which he belonged could have taken him for anything but what he was As he entered the room a faint sickly second hand smell of alcohol pervaded the atmosphere Well Manylodes said Scott I m glad to see you again This is my friend mister Tudor Your servant sir said Manylodes just touching his hat without moving it from his head And how are you mister Scott I am glad to see you again in these parts sir And how s trade Come Tudor what will you drink Manylodes I know takes brandy their sherry is vile and their claret worse maybe they may have a fairish glass of port And how is trade Manylodes We re all as brisk as bees at present I never knew things sharper If you ve brought a little money with you now s your time But I tell you this you ll find it sharp work for the eyesight Quick s the word I suppose Lord love you Quick Why a fellow must shave himself before he goes to bed if he wants to be up in time these days I suppose so Lord love you why there was old Sam Weazle never caught napping yet why at Truro last Monday he bought up to four hundred fifty New Friendships and before he was a bed they weren t worth not this bottle of brandy Well old Sam was just bit by those Cambourne lads And how did that happen Why the New Friendships certainly was very good while they lasted just for three months they was the thing certainly Why it came up sir as if there weren t no end of it and just as clean as that half crown but I know d there was an end coming Water I suppose said Undy sipping his toddy Them clean takes mister Scott they never lasts There was water but that weren t the worst Old Weazle knew of that he calculated he d back the metal agin the water and so he bought all up he could lay his finger on But the stuff was run out Them Cambourne boys what did they do Why they let the water in on purpose By Monday night old Weazle knew it all and then you may say it was as good as a play And how did you do in the matter Oh I sold I did very well bought at Lseven twos threed and sold at Lsix nineteens ten one twod and got my seven per cent for the four months But Lord love you them clean takes never lasts I worn t going to hang on Here s your health mister Scott Yours mister I didn t just catch the general leman s name and without waiting for further information on the point he finished his brandy and water So it s all up with the New Friendships is it said Undy Up and down mister Scott every dog has his day these Mary Janes will be going the same way some of them days We re all mortal and with this moral comparison between the uncertainty of human life and the vicissitudes of the shares in which he trafficked mister Manylodes proceeded to put some more sugar and brandy into his tumbler True true we are all mortal Manylodes and Mary Janes old friendships and New Friendships while they last we must make the most we can of them buy them cheap and sell them dear and above all things get a good percentage That s the game mister Scott and I will say no man understands it better than yourself keep the ball a running that s your maxim Are you going it deep in Mary Jane mister Scott Who I O no she s a cut above me now I fear The shares are worth any money now I suppose Worth any money I think they are mister Scott but I believe and then bringing his chair close up to that of his aristocratic friend resting his hands one on mister Scott s knee and the other on his elbow and breathing brandy into his ear he whispered to him words of great significance I ll leave you Scott said Alaric who did not enjoy the society of mister Manylodes and to whom the nature of the conversation was in his present position extremely irksome I must be back at the Bedford early Early why early surely our honest friend can get himself to bed without your interference Come you don t like the brandy toddy nor I either We ll see what sort of a hand they are at making a bowl of bishop Not for me Scott Yes for you man surely you are not tied to that fellow s apron strings he said removing himself from the close contiguity of mister Manylodes and speaking under his voice take my advice if you once let that man think you fear him you ll never get the better of him Alaric allowed himself to be persuaded and stayed I have just ten words of business to say to this fellow continued Scott and then we will be alone It was a lovely autumn evening early in September and Alaric sat himself at an open window looking out from the back of the hotel on to the Brentor with its singular parish church built on its highest apex while Undy held deep council with his friend of the mines But from time to time some word of moment found its way to Alaric s ears and made him also unconsciously fix his mind on the irritamenta malorum which are dug from the bowels of the earth in those western regions Minting money sir it s just minting money There s been no chance like it in my days Lfour twelves sixd paid up and they ll be at Ltwenty five in Truro before sun sets on Saturday Lord love you mister Scott now s your time If as I hear they and then there was a very low whisper and Alaric who could not keep his eye altogether from mister Manylodes countenance saw plainly that that worthy gentleman was talking of himself and in spite of his better instincts a desire came over him to know more of what they were discussing and he could not keep from thinking that shares bought at Lfour twelves sixd and realizing Ltwenty five must be very nice property Well I ll manage it said Scott still in a sort of whisper but audibly enough for Alaric to hear Forty you say I ll take them at Lfive ones oned very well and he took out his pocket book and made a memorandum Come Tudor here s the bishop We have done our business so now we ll enjoy ourselves What Manylodes are you off Lord love you mister Scott I ve a deal to do before I get to my downy and I don t like those doctored tipples Good night mister Scott I wishes you good night sir and making another slight reference to his hat which had not been removed from his head during the whole interview mister Manylodes took himself off There now is a specimen of a species of the genus homo class Englishman which is I believe known nowhere but in Cornwall Cornwall and Devonshire I suppose said Alaric No he is out of his true element here If you want to see him in all the glory of his native county you should go west of Truro From Truro to Hayle is the land of the Manylodes And a singular species it is But Tudor you ll be surprised I suppose if I tell you that I have made a purchase for you A purchase for me Yes I could not very well consult you before that fellow and yet as the chance came in my way I did not like to lose it Come the bishop ain t so bad is it though it is doctored tipple and he refilled Alaric s glass But what have you purchased for me Scott Forty shares in the Mary Jane Then you may undo the bargain again for I don t want them and shall not take them You need not be a bit uneasy my dear fellow I ve bought them at a little over Lfive and they ll be saleable to morrow at double the money or at any rate to morrow week But what s your objection to them In the first place I ve got no money to buy shares That s just the reason why you should buy them having no money you can t but want some and here s your way to make it You can have no difficulty in raising Ltwo hundred And in the next place I should not think of buying mining shares and more especially these while I am engaged as I now am Fal de ral de ral de ral That s all very fine mister Commissioner only you mistake your man you think you are talking to mister Neverbend Well Scott I shan t have them Just as you please my dear fellow there s no compulsion Only mark this the ball is at your foot now but it won t remain there There is a tide in the affairs of men you know the rest and you know also that tide and time wait for no man If you are contented with your two or three hundred a year in the Weights and Measures God forbid that I should tempt you to higher thoughts only in that case I have mistaken my man I must be contented with it if I can get nothing better said Tudor weakly Exactly you must be contented or rather you must put up with it if you can get nothing better That s the meaning of contentment all the world over You argue in a circle You must be a mere clerk if you cannot do better than other mere clerks But the fact of your having such an offer as that I now make you is proof that you can do better than others proves in fact that you need not be a mere clerk unless you choose to remain so Buying these shares might lose me all that I have got and could not do more than put a hundred pounds or so in my pocket Gammon Could I go back and tell Sir Gregory openly that I had bought them Why Tudor you are the youngest fish I ever met sent out to swim alone in this wicked world of ours Who the deuce talks openly of his speculations Will Sir Gregory tell you what shares he buys Is not every member of the House every man in the Government every barrister parson and doctor that can collect a hundred pounds are not all of them at the work And do they talk openly of the matter Does the bishop put it into his charge or the parson into his sermon But they would not be ashamed to tell their friends Would not they Oh the reverend mister Pickabit of saint Judas Without would not be ashamed to tell his bishop But the long and the short of the thing is this most men circumstanced as you are have no chance of doing anything good till they are forty or fifty and then their energies are worn out You have had tact enough to push yourself up early and yet it seems you have not pluck enough to take the goods the gods provide you The gods you mean the devils rather said Alaric who sat listening and drinking almost unconsciously his doctored tipple Call them what you will for me Fortune has generally been esteemed a goddess but misfortune a very devil But Tudor you don t know the world Here is a chance in your way Of course that keg of brandy who went out just now understands very well who you are He wants to be civil to me and he thinks it wise to be civil to you also He has a hat full of these shares and he tells me that knowing my weakness and presuming that you have the same he bought a few extra this morning thinking we might like them Now I have no hesitation in saying there is not a single man whom the Government could send down here from Sir Gregory downwards who could refuse the chance I am quite sure that Neverbend Oh for Heaven s sake don t choke me with Neverbend the fools are fools and will be so they are used for their folly I speak of men with brains How do you think that such men as Hardlines Vigil and mister Estimate have got up in the world Would they be where they are now had they been contented with their salaries They had private fortunes Very private they must have been I never heard of them No what fortunes they have they made Two of them are in Parliament and the other has a Government situation of Ltwo thousand a year with little or nothing to do But they began life early and never lost a chance It is quite clear that that blackguard who was here just now thinks that he can influence my opinion by inducing me to have an interest in the matter He had no such idea nor have I Do you think I would persuade you to such villany Do you think I do not know you too well Of course the possession of these shares can have no possible effect on your report and is not expected to have any But when men like you and me become of any note in the world others such as Manylodes like to know that we are embarked in the same speculation with themselves Why are members of Parliament asked to be directors and vice governors and presidents and guardians of all the joint stock societies that are now set agoing Not because of their capital for they generally have none not for their votes because one vote can be but of little use in any emergency It is because the names of men of note are worth money Men of note understand this and enjoy the fat of the land accordingly I want to see you among the number Twas thus the devil pleaded for the soul of Alaric Tudor and alas he did not plead in vain Let him but have a fair hearing and he seldom does Tis in this way that the truth of that awful mystery the fall of man comes home to us that we cannot hear the devil plead and resist the charm of his eloquence To listen is to be lost Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil Let that petition come forth from a man s heart a true and earnest prayer and he will be so led that he shall not hear the charmer let him charm ever so wisely Twas but a thin veil that the honorable Undecimus Scott threw over the bait with which he fished for the honesty of Alaric Tudor and yet it sufficed One would say that a young man fortified with such aspirations as those which glowed in Alaric s breast should have stood a longer siege should have been able to look with clearer eyesight on the landmarks which divide honour from dishonour integrity from fraud and truth from falsehood But he had never prayed to be delivered from evil His desire had rather been that he might be led into temptation He had never so prayed yet had he daily said his prayers at fitting intervals On every returning Sunday had he gone through with all the fitting forms the ordinary worship of a Christian Nor had he done this as a hypocrite With due attention and a full belief he had weekly knelt at God s temple and given if not his mind at least his heart to the service of his church But the inner truth of the prayer which he repeated so often had not come home to him Alas how many of us from week to week call ourselves worms and dust and miserable sinners describe ourselves as chaff for the winds grass for the burning stubble for the plough as dirt and filth fit only to be trodden under foot and yet in all our doings before the world cannot bring home to ourselves the conviction that we require other guidance than our own Alaric Tudor had sighed for permission to go forth among worldlings and there fight the world s battle Power station rank wealth all the good things which men earn by tact diligence and fortune combined and which were so far from him at his outset in life became daily more dear to his heart And now his honourable friend twitted him with being a mere clerk No he was not never had been never would be such Had he not already in five or six short years distanced his competitors and made himself the favourite and friend of men infinitely above him in station Was he not now here in Tavistock on a mission which proved that he was no mere clerk Was not the fact of his drinking bishop in the familiar society of a lord s son and an ex M P a proof of it It would be calumny on him to say that he had allowed Scott to make him tipsy on this occasion He was far from being tipsy but yet the mixture which he had been drinking had told upon his brain But Undy said he he had never before called his honourable friend by his Christian name but Undy if I take these shares where am I to get the money to pay for them The chances are you may part with them before you leave Tavistock If so you will not have to pay for them You will only have to pocket the difference Or pay the loss Or pay the loss But there s no chance of that I ll guarantee you against that But I shan t like to sell them I shan t choose to be trafficking in shares Buying a few as an investment may perhaps be a different thing Oh Alaric Alaric to what a pass had your conscience come when it could be so silenced Well I suppose you can raise a couple of hundred Ltwo hundred five will cover the whole thing commission and all but mind I don t advise you to keep them long I shall take two months dividends and then sell Two hundred and five pounds said Tudor to whom the sum seemed anything but trifling and when must it be paid Well I can give Manylodes a cheque for the whole dated this day week You ll be back in town before that We must allow him Lfive for the accommodation I suppose you can pay the money in at my banker s by that day Alaric had some portion of the amount himself and he knew that Norman had money by him he felt also a half drunken conviction that if Norman failed him Captain Cuttwater would not let him want such a sum and so he said that he could and the bargain was completed As he went downstairs whistling with an affected ease and a gaiety which he by no means felt Undy Scott leant back in his chair and began to speculate whether his new purchase was worth the purchase money He s a sharp fellow certainly in some things and may do well yet but he s uncommonly green That however will wear off I should not be surprised if he told Neverbend the whole transaction before this time to morrow And then mister Scott finished his cigar and went to bed When Alaric entered the sitting room at the Bedford he found Neverbend still seated at a table covered with official books and huge bundles of official papers An enormous report was open before him from which he was culling the latent sweets and extracting them with a pencil He glowered at Alaric with a severe suspicious eye which seemed to accuse him at once of the deed which he had done You are very late said Neverbend but I have not been sorry to be alone I believe I have been able to embody in a rough draft the various points which we have hitherto discussed I have just been five hours and a half at it and Fidus looked at his watch five hours and forty minutes To morrow perhaps that is if you are not going to your friend again you ll not object to make a fair copy Copy shouted Alaric in whose brain the open air had not diminished the effect of the bishop and who remembered with all the energy of pot valour that he was not a mere clerk copy bother I m going to bed old fellow and I advise you to do the same And then taking up a candlestick and stumbling somewhat awkwardly against a chair Tudor went off to his room waiting no further reply from his colleague mister Neverbend slowly put up his papers and followed him He is decidedly the worse for drink decidedly so said he to himself as he pulled off his clothes What a disgrace to the Woods and Works what a disgrace And he resolved in his mind that he would be very early at the pit s mouth He would not be kept from his duty while a dissipated colleague collected his senses by the aid of soda water CHAPTER X WHEAL MARY JANE mister Manylodes was at any rate right in this that that beverage which men call bishop is a doctored tipple and Alaric Tudor when he woke in the morning owned the truth It had been arranged that certain denizens of the mine should meet the two Commissioners at the pit mouth at eight o clock and it had been settled at dinner time that breakfast should be on the table at seven sharp Half an hour s quick driving would take them to the spot At seven mister Fidus Neverbend who had never yet been known to be untrue to an appointment by the fraction of a second was standing over the breakfast table alone He was alone but not on that account unhappy He could hardly disguise the pleasure with which he asked the waiter whether mister Tudor was yet dressed or the triumph which he felt when he heard that his colleague was not quite ready Bring the tea and the eggs at once said Neverbend very briskly Won t you wait for mister Tudor asked the waiter with an air of surprise Now the landlord waiter boots and chambermaid the chambermaid especially had all in mister Neverbend s estimation paid Tudor by far too much consideration and he was determined to show that he himself was first fiddle Wait no quite out of the question bring the hot water immediately and tell the ostler to have the fly at the door at half past seven exact Yes sir said the man and disappeared Neverbend waited five minutes and then rang the bell impetuously If you don t bring me my tea immediately I shall send for mister Boteldale Now mister Boteldale was the landlord mister Tudor will be down in ten minutes was the waiter s false reply for up to that moment poor Alaric had not yet succeeded in lifting his throbbing head from his pillow The boots was now with him administering soda water and brandy and he was pondering in his sickened mind whether by a manful effort he could rise and dress himself or whether he would not throw himself backwards on his coveted bed and allow Neverbend the triumph of descending alone to the nether world Neverbend nearly threw the loaf at the waiter s head Wait ten minutes longer what right had that vile Devonshire napkin twirler to make to him so base a proposition Bring me my breakfast sir shouted Neverbend in a voice that made the unfortunate sinner jump out of the room as though he had been moved by a galvanic battery In five minutes tea made with lukewarm water and eggs that were not half boiled were brought to the impatient Commissioner As a rule mister Neverbend when travelling on the public service made a practice of enjoying his meals It was the only solace which he allowed himself the only distraction from the cares of office which he permitted either to his body or his mind But on this great occasion his country required that he should forget his comforts and he drank his tasteless tea and ate his uncooked eggs threatening the waiter as he did so with sundry pains and penalties in the form of sixpences withheld Is the fly there said he as he bolted a last morsel of cold roast beef Coming sir said the waiter as he disappeared round a corner In the meantime Alaric sat lackadaisical on his bedside all undressed leaning his head upon his hand and feeling that his struggle to dress himself was all but useless The sympathetic boots stood by with a cup of tea well drawn comfortable tea in his hand and a small bit of dry toast lay near on an adjacent plate Try a bit o toast sir said boots Ugh ejaculated poor Alaric Have a leetle drop o rum in the tea sir and it ll set you all to rights in two minutes The proposal made Alaric very sick and nearly completed the catastrophe Ugh he said There s the trap sir for mister Neverbend said the boots whose ears caught the well known sound The devil it is said Alaric who was now stirred up to instant action Take my compliments to mister Neverbend and tell him I ll thank him to wait ten minutes Boots descending with the message found mister Neverbend ready coated and gloved standing at the hotel door The fly was there and the lame ostler holding the horse but the provoking driver had gone back for his coat Please sir mister Tudor says as how you re not to go just at present but to wait ten minutes till he be ready Neverbend looked at the man but he would not trust himself to speak Wait ten minutes and it now wanted five and twenty minutes to eight no not for all the Tudors that ever sat upon the throne of England There he stood with his watch in his hand as the returning Jehu hurried round from the stable yard You are now seven minutes late said he and if you are not at the place by eight o clock I shall not give you one farthing All right said Jehu We ll be at Mary Jane in less than no time and off they went not at the quickest pace But Neverbend s heart beat high with triumph as he reflected that he had carried the point on which he had been so intent Alaric when he heard the wheels roll off shook from him his lethargy It was not only that Neverbend would boast that he alone had gone through the perils of their subterranean duty but that doubtless he would explain in London how his colleague had been deterred from following him It was a grievous task that of dressing himself as youthful sinners know but too well Every now and then a qualm would come over him and make the work seem all but impossible Boots however stuck to him like a man poured cold water over his head renewed his tea cup comforted him with assurances of the bracing air and put a paper full of sandwiches in his pocket For heaven s sake put them away said Alaric to whom the very idea of food was repulsive You ll want em sir afore you are half way to Mary Jane and it a n t no joke going down and up again I know what s what sir The boots stuck to him like a man He did not only get him sandwiches but he procured for him also mister Boteldale s own fast trotting pony and just as Neverbend was rolling up to the pit s mouth fifteen minutes after his time greatly resolving in his own mind to button his breeches pocket firmly against the recreant driver Alaric started on the chase after him mister Neverbend had a presentiment that sick as his friend might be nauseous as doubtless were the qualms arising from yesterday s intemperance he would make an attempt to recover his lost ground He of the Woods and Works had begun to recognize the energy of him of the Weights and Measures and felt that there was in it a force that would not easily be overcome even by the fumes of bishop But yet it would be a great thing for the Woods and Works if he Neverbend could descend in this perilous journey to the deep bowels of the earth leaving the Weights and Measures stranded in the upper air This descent among the hidden riches of a lower world this visit to the provocations of evils not yet dug out from their durable confinement was the keystone as it were of the whole mission Let Neverbend descend alone alone inspect the wonders of that dirty deep and Tudor might then talk and write as he pleased In such case all the world of the two public offices in Question and of some others cognate to them would adjudge that he Neverbend had made himself master of the situation Actuated by these correct calculations mister Neverbend was rather fussy to begin an immediate descent when he found himself on the spot Two native gentlemen who were to accompany the Commissioners or the Commissioner as appeared likely to be the case were already there as were also the men who were to attend upon them It was an ugly uninviting place to look at with but few visible signs of wealth The earth which had been burrowed out by these human rabbits in their search after tin lay around in huge ungainly heaps the overground buildings of the establishment consisted of a few ill arranged sheds already apparently in a state of decadence dirt and slush and pods of water confined by muddy dams abounded on every side muddy men with muddy carts and muddy horses slowly crawled hither and thither apparently with no object and evidently indifferent as to whom they might overset in their course The inferior men seemed to show no respect to those above them and the superiors to exercise no authority over those below them There was a sullen equality among them all On the ground around was no vegetation nothing green met the eye some few stunted bushes appeared here and there nearly smothered by heaped up mud but they had about them none of the attractiveness of foliage The whole scene though consisting of earth alone was unearthly and looked as though the devil had walked over the place with hot hoofs and then raked it with a huge rake I am afraid I am very late said Neverbend getting out of his fly in all the haste he could muster and looking at his watch the moment his foot touched the ground very late indeed gentlemen I really must apologize but it was the driver I was punctual to the minute I was indeed But come gentlemen we won t lose another moment and mister Neverbend stepped out as though he were ready at an instant s notice to plunge head foremost down the deepest shaft in all that region of mines Oh sir there a n t no cause of hurry whatsomever said one of the mining authorities the day is long enough Oh but there is cause of hurry mister Undershot said Neverbend angrily great cause of hurry we must do this work very thoroughly and I positively have not time to get through all that I have before me But a n t the other general leman a coming asked mister Undershot Surely mister Tooder isn t a going to cry off said the other Why he was so hot about it yesterday mister Tudor is not very well this morning said mister Neverbend As his going down is not necessary for the inquiry and is merely a matter of taste on his part he has not joined me this morning Come gentlemen are we ready It was then for the first time explained to mister Neverbend that he had to go through a rather complicated adjustment of his toilet before he would be considered fit to meet the infernal gods He must he was informed envelop himself from head to foot in miner s habiliments if he wished to save every stitch he had on him from dirt and destruction He must also cover up his head with a linen cap so constituted as to carry a lump of mud with a candle stuck in it if he wished to save either his head from filth or his feet from falling Now mister Neverbend like most clerks in public offices was somewhat particular about his wardrobe it behoved him as a gentleman frequenting the West End to dress well and it also behoved him to dress cheaply he was moreover careful both as to his head and feet he could not therefore reject the recommended precautions but yet the time the time thus lost might destroy all He hurried into the shed where his toilet was to be made and suffered himself to be prepared in the usual way He took off his own great coat and put on a muddy course linen jacket that covered the upper portion of his body completely he then dragged on a pair of equally muddy overalls and lastly submitted to a most uninviting cap which came down over his ears and nearly over his eyes and on the brow of which a lump of mud was then affixed bearing a short tallow candle But though dressed thus in miner s garb mister Neverbend could not be said to look the part he filled He was a stout reddish faced gentleman with round shoulders and huge whiskers he was nearly bald and wore spectacles and in the costume in which he now appeared he did not seem to be at his ease Indeed all his air of command all his personal dignity and dictatorial tone left him as soon as he found himself metamorphosed into a fat pseudo miner He was like a cock whose feathers had been trailed through the mud and who could no longer crow aloud or claim the dunghill as his own His appearance was somewhat that of a dirty dissipated cook who having been turned out of one of the clubs for drunkenness had been wandering about the streets all night He began to wish that he was once more in the well known neighbourhood of Charing Cross The adventure however must now be carried through There was still enough of manhood in his heart to make him feel that he could not return to his colleague at Tavistock without visiting the wonders which he had come so far to see When he reached the head of the shaft however the affair did appear to him to be more terrible than he had before conceived He was invited to get into a rough square bucket in which there was just room for himself and another to stand he was specially cautioned to keep his head straight and his hands and elbows from protruding and then the windlass began to turn and the upper world the sunlight and all humanity receded from his view The world receded from his view but hardly soon enough for as the windlass turned and the bucket descended his last terrestrial glance looking out among the heaps of mud descried Alaric Tudor galloping on mister Boteldale s pony up to the very mouth of the mine Facilis descensus Averni The bucket went down easy enough and all too quick The manner in which it grounded itself on the first landing grated discordantly on mister Neverbend s finer perceptibilities But when he learnt after the interchange of various hoarse and to him unintelligible bellowings that he was to wait in that narrow damp lobby for the coming of his fellow Commissioner the grating on his feelings was even more discordant He had not pluck enough left to grumble but he grunted his displeasure He grunted however in vain for in about a quarter of an hour Alaric was close to him shoulder to shoulder He also wore a white jacket c with a nightcap of mud and candle on his head but somehow he looked as though he had worn them all his life The fast gallop and the excitement of the masquerade which for him had charms the sterner Neverbend could not feel had dissipated his sickness and he was once more all himself So I ve caught you at the first stage said he good humouredly for though he knew how badly he had been treated he was much too wise to show his knowledge It shall go hard but I ll distance you before we have done he said to himself Poor Neverbend only grunted And then they all went down a second stage in another bucket and then a third in a third bucket and then the business commenced As far as this point passive courage alone had been required to stand upright in a wooden tub and go down and down and down was in itself easy enough so long as the heart did not utterly faint mister Neverbend s heart had grown faintish but still he had persevered and now stood on a third lobby listening with dull unintelligent ears to eager questions asked by his colleague and to the rapid answers of their mining guides Tudor was absolutely at work with paper and pencil taking down notes in that wretched Pandemonium There now sir said the guide no more of them ugly buckets mister Neverbend we can trust to our own arms and legs for the rest of it and so saying he pointed out to mister Neverbend s horror stricken eyes a perpendicular iron ladder fixed firmly against the upright side of a shaft and leading for aught mister Neverbend could see direct to hell itself Down here is it said Alaric peeping over I ll go first said the guide and down he went down down down till Neverbend looking over could barely see the glimmer of his disappearing head light Was it absolutely intended that he should disappear in the same way Had he bound himself to go down that fiendish upright ladder And were he to go down it what then Would it be possible that a man of his weight should ever come up again Shall it be you or I next said Alaric very civilly Neverbend could only pant and grunt and Alaric with a courteous nod placed himself on the ladder and went down down down till of him also nothing was left but the faintest glimmer mister Neverbend remained above with one of the mining authorities one attendant miner also remained with them Now Sir said the authority if you are ready the ladder is quite free Free What would not Neverbend have given to be free also himself He looked down the free ladder and the very look made him sink It seemed to him as though nothing but a spider could creep down that perpendicular abyss And then a sound slow sharp and continuous as of drops falling through infinite space on to deep water came upon his ear and he saw that the sides of the abyss were covered with slime and the damp air made him cough and the cap had got over his spectacles and nearly blinded him and he was perspiring with a cold clammy sweat Well sir shall we be going on said the authority mister Tooder ll be at the foot of the next set before this mister Neverbend wished that mister Tudor s journey might still be down and down and down till he reached the globe s centre in which conflicting attractions might keep him for ever fixed In his despair he essayed to put one foot upon the ladder and then looked piteously up to the guide s face Even in that dark dingy atmosphere the light of the farthing candle on his head revealed the agony of his heart His companions though they were miners were still men They saw his misery and relented Maybe thee be afeared said the working miner and if so be thee bee saint thee d better bide I am sure I should never come up again said Neverbend with a voice pleading for mercy but with all the submission of one prepared to suffer without resistance if mercy should not be forthcoming Thee bee saint for sartan too thick and weazy like for them stairs said the miner I am I am said Neverbend turning on the man a look of the warmest affection and shoving the horrid heavy encumbered cap from off his spectacles yes I am too fat How would he have answered with what aspect would he have annihilated the sinner had such a man dared to call him weazy up above on terra firma under the canopy of heaven His troubles however or at any rate his dangers were brought to an end As soon as it became plainly manifest that his zeal in the public service would carry him no lower and would hardly suffice to keep life throbbing in his bosom much longer even in his present level preparations were made for his ascent A bell was rung hoarse voices were again heard speaking and answering in sounds quite unintelligible to a Cockney s ears chains rattled the windlass whirled and the huge bucket came tumbling down nearly on their heads Poor Neverbend was all but lifted into it Where now was all the pride of the morn that had seen him go forth the great dictator of the mines Where was that towering spirit with which he had ordered his tea and toast and rebuked the slowness of his charioteer Where the ambition that had soared so high over the pet of the Weights and Measures Alas alas how few of us there are who have within us the courage to be great in adversity Aequam memento c c if thou couldst but have thought of it O Neverbend who need saint must some day die But Neverbend did not think of it How few of us do remember such lessons at those moments in which they ought to be of use to us He was all but lifted into the tub and then out of it and then again into another till he reached the upper world a sight piteous to behold His spectacles had gone from him his cap covered his eyes his lamp had reversed itself and soft globules of grease had fallen on his nose he was bathed in perspiration and was nevertheless chilled through to his very bones his whiskers were fringed with mud and his black cravat had been pulled from his neck and lost in some infernal struggle Nevertheless the moment in which he seated himself on a hard stool in that rough shed was perhaps the happiest in his life some Christian brought him beer had it been nectar from the brewery of the gods he could not have drunk it with greater avidity By slow degrees he made such toilet as circumstances allowed and then had himself driven back to Tavistock being no more willing to wait for Tudor now than he had been in the early morning But Jehu found him much more reasonable on his return and as that respectable functionary pocketed his half crown he fully understood the spirit in which it was given Poor Neverbend had not now enough pluck left in him to combat the hostility of a postboy Alaric who of course contrived to see all that was to be seen and learn all that was to be learnt in the dark passages of the tin mine was careful on his return to use his triumph with the greatest moderation His conscience was alas burdened with the guilty knowledge of Undy s shares When he came to think of the transaction as he rode leisurely back to Tavistock he knew how wrong he had been and yet he felt a kind of triumph at the spoil which he held for he had heard among the miners that the shares of Mary Jane were already going up to some incredible standard of value In this manner so said he to himself had all the great minds of the present day made their money and kept themselves afloat Twas thus he tried to comfort himself but not as yet successfully There were no more squabbles between mister Neverbend and mister Tudor each knew that of himself which made him bear and forbear and so the two Commissioners returned to town on good terms with each other and Alaric wrote a report which delighted the heart of Sir Gregory Hardlines ruined the opponents of the great tin mine and sent the Mary Jane shares up and up and up till speculating men thought that they could not give too high a price to secure them Alaric returned to town on Friday It had been arranged that he and Charley and Norman should all go down to Hampton on the Saturday and then on the following week the competitive examination was to take place But Alaric s first anxiety after his return was to procure the Ltwo hundred six which he had to pay for the shares which he held in his pocket book He all but regretted as he journeyed up to town with the now tame Fidus seated opposite to him that he had not disposed of them at Tavistock even at half their present value so that he might have saved himself the necessity of being a borrower and have wiped his hands of the whole affair He and Norman dined together at their club in Waterloo Place the Pythagorean a much humbler establishment than that patronized by Scott and one that was dignified by no politics After dinner as they sat over their pint of sherry Alaric made his request Harry said he suddenly you are always full of money I want you to lend me Lone hundred fifty Norman was much less quick in his mode of speaking than his friend and at the present moment was inclined to be somewhat slower than usual This affair of the examination pressed upon his spirits and made him dull and unhappy During the whole of dinner he had said little or nothing and had since been sitting listlessly gazing at vacancy and balancing himself on the hind legs of his chair O yes certainly said he but he said it without the eagerness with which Alaric thought that he should have answered his request If it s inconvenient or if you don t like it said Alaric the blood mounting to his forehead it does not signify I can do without it I can lend it you without any inconvenience said Harry When do you want it not to night I suppose No not to night I should like to have it early to morrow morning but I see you don t like it so I ll manage it some other way I don t know what you mean by not liking it I have not the slightest objection to lending you any money I can spare I don t think you ll find any other of your friends who will like it better You can have it by eleven o clock to morrow Intimate as the two men were there had hitherto been very little borrowing or lending between them and now Alaric felt as though he owed it to his intimacy with his friend to explain to him why he wanted so large a sum in so short a time He felt moreover that he would not himself be so much ashamed of what he had done if he could confess it to some one else He could then solace himself with the reflection that he had done nothing secret Norman he supposed would be displeased but then Norman s displeasure could not injure him and with Norman there would be no danger that the affair would go any further You must think it very strange said he that I should want such a sum but the truth is I have bought some shares Railway shares said Norman in a tone that certainly did not signify approval He disliked speculation altogether and had an old fashioned idea that men who do speculate should have money wherewith to do it No not railway shares exactly Canal suggested Norman No not canal Gas Mines said Alaric bringing out the dread truth at last Harry Norman s brow grew very black Not that mine that you ve been down about I hope said he Yes that very identical Mary Jane that I went down and down about said Alaric trying to joke on the subject Don t look so very black my dear fellow I know all that you have to say upon the matter I did what was very foolish I dare say but the idea never occurred to me till it was too late that I might be suspected of making a false report on the subject because I had embarked a hundred pounds in it Alaric if it were known Then it mustn t be known said Tudor I am sorry for it but as I told you the idea didn t occur to me till it was too late The shares are bought now and must be paid for to morrow I shall sell them the moment I can and you shall have the money in three or four days I don t care one straw about the money said Norman now quick enough but still in great displeasure I would give double the amount that you had not done this Don t be so suspicious Harry said the other don t try to think the worst of your friend By others by Sir Gregory Hardlines Neverbend and such men I might expect to be judged harshly in such a matter But I have a right to expect that you will believe me I tell you that I did this inadvertently and am sorry for it surely that ought to be sufficient Norman said nothing more but he felt that Tudor had done that which if known would disgrace him for ever It might however very probably never be known and it might also be that Tudor would never act so dishonestly again On the following morning the money was paid and in the course of the next week the shares were resold and the money repaid and Alaric Tudor for the first time in his life found himself to be the possessor of over three hundred pounds Such was the price which Scott Manylodes company had found it worth their while to pay him for his good report on Mary Jane CHAPTER XI THE THREE KINGS And now came the all important week On the Saturday the three young men went down to Hampton Charley had lately been leading a very mixed sort of life One week he would consort mainly with the houri of the Norfolk Street beer shop and the next he would be on his good behaviour and live as respectably as circumstances permitted him to do His scope in this respect was not large The greatest respectability which his unassisted efforts could possibly achieve was to dine at a cheap eating house and spend his evenings at a cigar divan He belonged to no club and his circle of friends except in the houri and navvy line was very limited Who could expect that a young man from the Internal Navigation would sit for hours and hours alone in a dull London lodging over his book and tea cup Who should expect that any young man will do so And yet mothers and aunts and anxious friends do expect it very much in vain During Alaric s absence at Tavistock Norman had taken Charley by the hand and been with him a good deal He had therefore spent an uncommonly respectable week and the Norfolk Street houri would have been au desespoir but that she had other Charleys to her bow When he found himself getting into a first class carriage at the Waterloo bridge station with his two comrades he began to appreciate the comfort of decency and almost wished that he also had been brought up among the stern morals and hard work of the Weights and Measures Nothing special occurred at Surbiton Cottage It might have been evident to a watchful bystander that Alaric was growing in favour with all the party excepting missus Woodward and that as he did so Harry was more and more cherished by her This was specially shown in one little scene Alaric had brought down with him to Hampton the documents necessary to enable him to draw out his report on Mary Jane Indeed it was all but necessary that he should do so as his coming examination would leave him but little time for other business during the week On Saturday night he sat up at his inn over the papers and on Sunday morning when missus Woodward and the girls came down ready bonneted for church he signified his intention of remaining at his work I certainly think he might have gone to church said missus Woodward when the hall door closed behind the party as they started to their place of worship Oh mamma think how much he has to do said Gertrude Nonsense said missus Woodward it s all affectation and he ought to go to church Government clerks are not worked so hard as all that are they Harry Alaric is certainly very busy but I think he should go to church all the same said Harry who himself never omitted divine worship But surely this is a work of necessity said Linda Fiddle de de said missus Woodward I hate affectation my dear It s very grand I dare say for a young man s services to be in such request that he cannot find time to say his prayers He ll find plenty of time for gossiping by and by I don t doubt Linda could say nothing further for an unbidden tear moistened her eyelid as she heard her mother speak so harshly of her lover Gertrude however took up the cudgels for him and so did Captain Cuttwater I think you are a little hard upon him mamma said Gertrude particularly when you know that as a rule he always goes to church I have heard you say yourself what an excellent churchman he is Young men change sometimes said missus Woodward Upon my word Bessie I think you are very uncharitable this fine Sunday morning said the captain I wonder how you ll feel if we have that chapter about the beam and the mote missus Woodward did not quite like being scolded by her uncle before her daughters but she said nothing further Katie however looked daggers at the old man from out her big bright eyes What right had any man were he ever so old ever so much an uncle to scold her mamma Katie was inclined to join her mother and take Harry Norman s side for it was Harry Norman who owned the boat They were now at the church door and they entered without saying anything further Let us hope that charity which surpasseth all other virtues guided their prayers while they were there and filled their hearts In the meantime Alaric unconscious how he had been attacked and how defended worked hard at his Tavistock notes missus Woodward was quite right in this that the Commissioner of the Mines though he was unable to find time to go to church did find time to saunter about with the girls before dinner Was it to be expected that he should not do so for what other purpose was he there at Hampton They were all very serious this Sunday afternoon and Katie could make nothing of them She and Charley indeed went off by themselves to a desert island or a place that would have been a desert island had the water run round it and there built stupendous palaces and laid out glorious gardens Charley was the most good natured of men and could he have only brought a boat with him as Harry so often did he would soon have been first favourite with Katie It shan t be at all like Hampton Court said Katie speaking of the new abode which Charley was to build for her Not at all said Charley Nor yet Buckingham Palace No said Charley I think we ll have it Gothic Gothic said Katie looking up at him with all her eyes Will Gothic be most grand What s Gothic Charley began to consider Westminster Abbey said he at last Oh but Charley I don t want a church Is the Alhambra Gothic Charley was not quite sure but thought it probably was They decided therefore that the new palace should be built after the model of the Alhambra The afternoon was but dull and lugubrious to the remainder of the party The girls seemed to feel that there was something solemn about the coming competition between two such dear friends which prevented and should prevent them all from being merry Harry perfectly sympathized in the feeling and even Alaric though depressed himself by no melancholy forebodings was at any rate conscious that he should refrain from any apparent anticipation of a triumph They all went to church in the evening but even this amendment in Alaric s conduct hardly reconciled him to missus Woodward I suppose we shall all be very clever before long said she after tea but really I don t know that we shall be any the better for it Now in this office of yours by the end of next week there will be three or four men with broken hearts and there will be one triumphant jackanapes so conceited and proud that he ll never bring himself to do another good ordinary day s work as long as he lives Nothing will persuade me but that it is not only very bad but very unjust also The jackanapes must learn to put up with ordinary work said Alaric or he ll soon find himself reduced to his former insignificance And the men with the broken hearts they I suppose must put up with their wretchedness too said missus Woodward and their wives also and children who have been looking forward for years to this vacancy as the period of their lives at which they are to begin to be comfortable I hate such heartlessness I hate the very name of Sir Gregory Hardlines But mamma won t the general effect be to produce a much higher class of education among the men said Gertrude In the army and navy the best men get on the best said Linda Do they by jingo said Uncle Bat It s very little you know about the navy Miss Linda Well then at any rate they ought said Linda I would have a competitive examination in every service said Gertrude It would make young men ambitious They would not be so idle and empty as they now are if they had to contend in this way for every step upwards in the world The world said missus Woodward will soon be like a fishpond very full of fish but with very little food for them Every one is scrambling for the others prey and they will end at last by eating one another If Harry gets this situation will not that unfortunate Jones who for years has been waiting for it always regard him as a robber My maxim is this said Uncle Bat if a youngster goes into any service say the navy and does his duty by his country like a man why he shouldn t be passed over Now look at me I was on the books of the Catamaran one of the old seventy fours in ninety six I did my duty then and always was never in the black book or laid up sick was always rough and ready for any work that came to hand and when I went into the Mudlark as lieutenant in year nine little Bobby Howard had just joined the old Cat as a young middy And where am I now and where is Bobby Howard Why d e I m on the shelf craving the ladies pardon and he s a Lord of the Admiralty if you please and a Member of Parliament Now I say Cuttwater s as good a name as Howard for going to sea with any day and if there d been a competitive examination for Admiralty Lords five years ago Bobby Howard would never have been where he is now and somebody else who knows more about his profession than all the Howards put together might perhaps have been in his place And so my lads here s to you and I hope the best man will win Whether Uncle Bat agreed with his niece or with his grandnieces was not very apparent from the line of his argument but they all laughed at his eagerness and nothing more was said that evening about the matter Alaric Harry and Charley of course returned to town on the following day Breakfast on Monday morning at Surbiton Cottage was an early affair when the young men were there so early that Captain Cuttwater did not make his appearance Since his arrival at the cottage missus Woodward had found an excuse for a later breakfast in the necessity of taking it with her uncle so that the young people were generally left alone Linda was the family tea maker and was therefore earliest down and Alaric being the first on this morning to leave the hotel found her alone in the dining room He had never renewed the disclosure of his passion but Linda had thought that whenever he shook hands with her since that memorable walk she had always felt a more than ordinary pressure This she had been careful not to return but she had not the heart to rebuke it Now when he bade her good morning he certainly held her hand in his longer than he need have done He looked at her too as though his looks meant something more than ordinary looking at least so Linda thought but yet he said nothing and so Linda slightly trembling went on with the adjustment of her tea tray It will be all over Linda when we meet again said Alaric His mind she found was intent on his examination not on his love But this was natural was as it should be If and she was certain in her heart that it would be so if he should be successful then he might speak of love without having to speak in the same breath of poverty as well It will be all over when we meet again he said I suppose it will said Linda I don t at all like it it seems so unnatural having to contend against one s friend And yet one cannot help it one cannot allow one s self to go to the wall I m sure Harry doesn t mind it said Linda I m sure I do said he If I fail I shall be unhappy and if I succeed I shall be equally so I shall set all the world against me I know what your mother meant when she talked of a jackanapes yesterday If I get the promotion I may wish good bye to Surbiton Cottage Oh Alaric Harry would forgive me but Harry s friends would never do so How can you say so I am sure mamma has no such feeling nor yet even Gertrude I mean that none of us have It is very natural all of you should for he is your cousin You are just the same as our cousin I am sure we think quite as much of you as of Harry Even Gertrude said she hoped that you would get it Dear Gertrude Because you know Harry does not want it so much as you do I am sure I wish you success with all my heart Perhaps it s wicked to wish for either of you over the other but you can t both get it at once you know At this moment Katie came in and soon afterwards Gertrude and the two other young men and so nothing further was said on the subject Charley parted with the competitors at the corner of Waterloo Bridge He turned into Somerset House being there regarded on these Monday mornings as a prodigy of punctuality and Alaric and Harry walked back along the Strand arm in arm toward their own office Well lads I hope you ll both win said Charley And whichever wins most why of course he ll stand an uncommon good dinner Oh that s of course said Alaric We ll have it at the Trafalgar And so the two walked on together arm in arm to the Weights and Measures The ceremony which was now about to take place at the Weights and Measures was ordained to be the first of those examinations which under the auspices of Sir Gregory Hardlines were destined to revivify clarify and render perfect the Civil Service of the country It was a great triumph to Sir Gregory to see the darling object of his heart thus commencing its existence in the very cradle in which he as an infant Hercules had made his first exertions in the cause It was to be his future fortune to superintend these intellectual contests in a stately office of his own duly set apart and appointed for the purpose But the throne on which he was to sit had not yet been prepared for him and he was at present constrained to content himself with exercising his power now here and now there according as his services might be required carrying the appurtenances of his royalty about with him But Sir Gregory was not a solitary monarch In days long gone by there were as we all know three kings at Cologne and again three kings at Brentford So also were there three kings at the Civil Service Examination Board But of these three Sir Gregory was by far the greatest king He sat in the middle had two thousand jewels to his crown whereas the others had only twelve hundred each and his name ran first in all the royal warrants Nevertheless Sir Gregory could he have had it so would like most other kings have preferred an undivided sceptre Of his company mates on the throne the elder in rank was a west country baronet who not content with fatting beeves and brewing beer like his sires aspired to do something for his country Sir Warwick Westend was an excellent man full of the best intentions and not more than decently anxious to get the good things of Government into his hand He was perhaps rather too much inclined to think that he could see further through a millstone than another and had a way of looking as though he were always making the attempt He was a man born to grace if not his country at any rate his county and his conduct was uniformly such as to afford the liveliest satisfaction to his uncles aunts and relations in general If as a king he had a fault it was this that he allowed that other king Sir Gregory to carry him in his pocket But Sir Gregory could not at all get the third king into his pocket This gentleman was a worthy clergyman from Cambridge one mister Jobbles by name mister Jobbles had for many years been examining undergraduates for little goes and great goes and had passed his life in putting posing questions in detecting ignorance by viva voce scrutiny and eliciting learning by printed papers He by a stupendous effort of his mathematical mind had divided the adult British male world into classes and sub classes and could tell at a moment s notice how long it would take him to examine them all His soul panted for the work Every man should he thought be made to pass through some go The greengrocer s boy should not carry out cabbages unless his fitness for cabbage carrying had been ascertained and till it had also been ascertained that no other boy ambitious of the preferment would carry them better Difficulty There was no difficulty Could not he Jobbles get through five thousand viva voces in every five hours that is with due assistance and would not fifty five thousand printed papers containing five hundred fifty five thousand questions be getting themselves answered at the same time with more or less precision So now mister Jobbles was about to try his huge plan by a small commencement On the present occasion the examination was actually to be carried on by two of the kings in person Sir Gregory had declared that as so large a portion of his heart and affections was bound up with the gentlemen of the Weights and Measures he could not bring himself actually to ask questions of them and then to listen to or read their answers Should any of his loved ones make some fatal faux pas his tears like those of the recording angel would blot out the error His eyes would refuse to see faults if there should be faults in those whom he himself had nurtured Therefore though he came with his colleagues to the Weights and Measures he did not himself take part in the examination At eleven o clock the Board room was opened and the candidates walked in and seated themselves Fear of Sir Gregory and other causes had thinned the number Poor Jones who by right of seniority should have had the prize declined to put himself in competition with his juniors and in lieu thereof sent up to the Lords of the Treasury an awful memorial spread over fifteen folio pages very uselessly The Lords of the Treasury referred it to the three kings whose secretary put a minute upon it Sir Gregory signed the minute and some gentleman at the Treasury wrote a short letter to mister Jones apprising that unhappy gentleman that my Lords had taken the matter into their fullest consideration and that nothing could be done to help him Had Jones been consulted by any other disappointed Civil Service Werter as to the expediency of complaining to the Treasury Lords Jones would have told him exactly what would be the result The disappointed one however always thinks that all the Treasury Lords will give all their ears to him though they are deafer than Icarus to the world beside Robinson stood his ground like a man but Brown found out a day or two before the struggle came that he could not bring himself to stand against his friend Jones he said he knew was incompetent but Robinson ought to get it so he for one would not stand in Robinson s way Uppinall was there as confident as a bantam cock and so was Alphabet Precis who had declared to all his friends that if the pure well of official English undefiled was to count for anything he ought to be pretty safe But poor Minusex was ill and sent a certificate He had so crammed himself with unknown quantities that his mind like a gourmand s stomach had broken down under the effort and he was now sobbing out algebraic positions under his counterpane Norman and Alaric made up the five who still had health strength and pluck to face the stern justice of the new kings and they accordingly took their seats on five chairs equally distant placing themselves in due order of seniority And then first of all Sir Gregory made a little speech standing up at the head of the Board room table with an attendant king on either hand and the Secretary and two Assistant Secretaries standing near him Was not this a proud moment for Sir Gregory It had now become his duty he said to take his position in that room that well known well loved room under circumstances of which he had little dreamt when he first entered it with awe struck steps in the days of his early youth But nevertheless even then ambition had warmed him That ambition had been to devote every energy of his mind every muscle of his body every hour of his life to the Civil Service of his country It was not much perhaps that he had been able to do he could not boast of those acute powers of mind of that gigantic grasp of intellect of which they saw in those days so wonderful an example in a high place Sir Gregory here gratefully alluded to that statesman who had given him his present appointment But still he had devoted all his mind such as it was and every hour of his life to the service and now he had his reward If he might be allowed to give advice to the gentlemen before him gentlemen of whose admirable qualifications for the Civil Service of the country he himself was so well aware his advice should be this That they should look on none of their energies as applicable to private purposes regard none of their hours as their own They were devoted in a peculiar way to the Civil Service and they should feel that such was their lot in life They should know that their intellects were a sacred pledge intrusted to them for the good of that service and should use them accordingly This should be their highest ambition And what higher ambition asked Sir Gregory could they have They all alas knew that the service had been disgraced in other quarters by idleness incompetency and he feared he must say dishonesty till incompetency and dishonesty had become not the exception but the rule It was too notorious that the Civil Service was filled by the family fools of the aristocracy and middle classes and that any family who had no fool to send sent in lieu thereof some invalid past hope Thus the service had become a hospital for incurables and idiots It was said Sir Gregory for him and them to cure all that He would not he said at that moment say anything with reference to salaries It was as they were all aware a very difficult subject and did not seem to be necessarily connected with the few remarks which the present opportunity had seemed to him to call for He then told them they were all his beloved children that they were a credit to the establishment that he handed them over without a blush to his excellent colleagues Sir Warwick Westend and mister Jobbles and that he wished in his heart that each of them could be successful And having so spoken Sir Gregory went his way It was beautiful then to see how mister Jobbles swam down the long room and handed out his examination papers to the different candidates as he passed them Twas a pity there should have been but five the man did it so well so quickly with such a gusto He should have been allowed to try his hand upon five hundred instead of five His step was so rapid and his hand and arm moved so dexterously that no conceivable number would have been too many for him But even with five he showed at once that the right man was in the right place mister Jobbles was created for the conducting of examinations And then the five candidates who had hitherto been all ears of a sudden became all eyes and devoted themselves in a manner which would have been delightful to Sir Gregory to the papers before them Sir Warwick in the meantime was seated in his chair hard at work looking through his millstone It is a dreadful task that of answering examination papers only to be exceeded in dreadfulness by the horrors of mister Jobbles viva voce torments A man has before him a string of questions and he looks painfully down them from question to question searching for some allusion to that special knowledge which he has within him He too often finds that no such allusion is made It appears that the Jobbles of the occasion has exactly known the blank spots of his mind and fitted them all He has perhaps crammed himself with the winds and tides and there is no more reference to those stormy subjects than if Luna were extinct but he has unfortunately been loose about his botany and question after question would appear to him to have been dictated by Sir Joseph Paxton or the head gardener at Kew And then to his own blank face and puzzled look is opposed the fast scribbling of some botanic candidate fast as though reams of folio could hardly contain all the knowledge which he is able to pour forth And so with a mixture of fast scribbling pens and blank faces our five friends went to work The examination lasted for four days and it was arranged that on each of the four days each of the five candidates should be called up to undergo a certain quantum of mister Jobbles viva voce This part of his duty mister Jobbles performed with a mildness of manner that was beyond all praise A mother training her first born to say papa could not do so with a softer voice or more affectionate demeanour The planet Jupiter said he to mister Precis I have no doubt you know accurately the computed distance of that planet from the sun and also that of our own planet Could you tell me now how would you calculate the distance in inches say from London Bridge to the nearest portion of Jupiter s disc at twelve o clock on the first of April mister Jobbles as he put his little question smiled the sweetest of smiles and spoke in a tone conciliating and gentle as though he were asking mister Precis to dine with him and take part of a bottle of claret at half past six But nevertheless mister Precis looked very blank I am not asking the distance you know said mister Jobbles smiling sweeter than ever I am only asking how you would compute it But still mister Precis looked exceedingly blank Never mind said mister Jobbles with all the encouragement which his voice could give never mind Now suppose that a be a milestone b a turnpike gate and so on But mister Jobbles in spite of his smiles so awed the hearts of some of his candidates that two of them retired at the end of the second day Poor Robinson thinking and not without sufficient ground that he had not a ghost of a chance determined to save himself from further annoyance and then Norman put utterly out of conceit with himself by what he deemed the insufficiency of his answers did the same He had become low in spirits unhappy in temperament and self diffident to a painful degree Alaric to give him his due did everything in his power to persuade him to see the task out to the last But the assurance and composure of Alaric s manner did more than anything else to provoke and increase Norman s discomfiture He had been schooling himself to bear a beating with a good grace and he began to find that he could only bear it as a disgrace On the morning of the third day instead of taking his place in the Board room he sent in a note to mister Jobbles declaring that he withdrew from the trial mister Jobbles read the note and smiled with satisfaction as he put it into his pocket It was an acknowledgement of his own unrivalled powers as an Examiner mister Precis still trusting to his pure well went on to the end and at the end declared that so ignorant was mister Jobbles of his duty that he had given them no opportunity of showing what they could do in English composition Why had he not put before them the papers in some memorable official case and desired them to make an abstract those for instance on the much vexed question of penny versus pound as touching the new standard for the decimal coinage mister Jobbles an Examiner indeed And so mister Precis bethought himself that he also if unsuccessful would go to the Lords of the Treasury And mister Uppinall and Alaric Tudor also went on Those who knew anything of the matter when they saw how the running horses were reduced in number and what horses were left on the course when they observed also how each steed came to the post on each succeeding morning had no doubt whatever of the result So that when Alaric was declared on the Saturday morning to have gained the prize there was very little astonishment either felt or expressed at the Weights and Measures Alaric s juniors wished him joy with some show of reality in their manner but the congratulations of his seniors including the Secretary and Assistant Secretaries the new Chief Clerk and the men in the class to which he was now promoted were very cold indeed But to this he was indifferent It was the nature of Tudor s disposition that he never for a moment rested satisfied with the round of the ladder on which he had contrived to place himself He had no sooner gained a step than he looked upwards to see how the next step was to be achieved His motto might well have been Excelsior if only he could have taught himself to look to heights that were really high When he found that the august Secretary received him on his promotion without much empressement he comforted himself by calculating how long it would be before he should fill that Secretary s chair if indeed it should ever be worth his while to fill it The Secretary at the Weights and Measures had after all but a dull time of it and was precluded by the routine of his office from parliamentary ambition and the joys of government Alaric was already beginning to think that this Weights and Measures should only be a stepping stone to him and that when Sir Gregory with his stern dogma of devotion to the service had been of sufficient use to him he also might with advantage be thrown over In the meantime an income of Lsix hundred a year brought with it to the young bachelor some very comfortable influence But the warmest and the pleasantest of all the congratulations which he received was from his dear friend Undy Scott Ah my boy said Undy pressing his hand you ll soon be one of us By the by I want to put you up for the Downing you should leave that Pythagorean there s nothing to be got by it Now the Downing was a political club in which however politics had latterly become a good deal mixed But the Government of the day generally found there a liberal support and recognized and acknowledged its claim to consideration CHAPTER XII CONSOLATION On the following Sunday neither Tudor nor Norman was at Hampton They had both felt that they could not comfortably meet each other there and each had declined to go They had promised to write and now that the matter was decided how were they or either of them to keep the promise It may be thought that the bitterness of the moment was over with Norman as soon as he gave up but such was not the case Let him struggle as he would with himself he could not rally nor bring himself to feel happy on what had occurred He would have been better satisfied if Alaric would have triumphed but Alaric seemed to take it all as a matter of course and never spoke of his own promotion unless he did so in answer to some remark of his companion then he could speak easily enough otherwise he was willing to let the matter go by as one settled and at rest He had consulted Norman about the purchase of a horse but he hitherto had shown no other sign that he was a richer man than formerly It was a very bitter time for Norman He could not divest his mind of the subject What was he to do Where was he to go How was he to get away even for a time from Alaric Tudor And then was he right in wishing to get away from him Had he not told himself over and over again that it behoved him as a man and a friend and a Christian to conquer the bitter feeling of envy which preyed on his spirits Had he not himself counselled Alaric to stand this examination and had he not promised that his doing so should make no difference in their friendship Had he not pledged himself to rejoice in the success of his friend and now was he to break his word both to that friend and to himself Schooling himself or trying to school himself in this way he made no attempt at escaping from his unhappiness They passed the Wednesday Thursday and Friday evenings together It was now nearly the end of September and London was empty that is empty as regards those friends and acquaintances with whom Norman might have found some resource On the Saturday they left their office early for all office routine had during this week been broken through by the immense importance of the ceremony which was going on and then it became necessary to write to missus Woodward Will you write to Hampton or shall I said Alaric as they walked arm in arm under the windows of Whitehall Oh you of course said Norman you have much to tell them I have nothing Just as you please said the other That is of course I will if you like it But I think it would come better from you You are nearer to them than I am and it will have less a look of triumph on my part and less also of disappointment on yours if you write If you tell them that you literally threw away your chance you will only tell them the truth Norman assented but he said nothing further What business had Alaric to utter such words as triumph and disappointment He could not keep his arm on which Alaric was leaning from spasmodically shrinking from the touch He had been beaten by a man nay worse had yielded to a man who had not the common honesty to refuse a bribe and yet he was bound to love this man He could not help asking himself the question which he would do Would he love him or hate him But while he was so questioning himself he got home and had to sit down and write his letter this he did at once but not without difficulty It ran as follows My dear missus Woodward I write a line to tell you of my discomfiture and Alaric s success I gave up at the end of the second day Of course I will tell you all about it when we meet No one seemed to doubt that Alaric would get it as a matter of course I shall be with you on next Saturday Alaric says he will not go down till the Saturday after when I shall be at Normansgrove My best love to the girls Tell Katie I shan t drown either myself or the boat Yours ever affectionately H N Saturday September one hundred eighty five Pray write me a kind letter to comfort me missus Woodward did write him a very kind letter and it did comfort him And she wrote also as she was bound to do a letter of congratulation to Alaric This letter though it expressed in the usual terms the satisfaction which one friend has in another s welfare was not written in the same warm affectionate tone as that to Norman Alaric perceived instantly that it was not cordial He loved missus Woodward dearly and greatly desired her love and sympathy But what then He could not have everything He determined therefore not to trouble his mind If missus Woodward did not sympathize with him others of the family would do so and success would ultimately bring her round What woman ever yet refused to sympathize with successful ambition Alaric also received a letter from Captain Cuttwater in which that gallant veteran expressed his great joy at the result of the examination Let the best man win all the world over said he whatever his name is And they ll have to make the same rule at the Admiralty too The days of the Howards are gone by that is unless they can prove themselves able seamen which very few of them ever did yet Let the best man win that s what I say and let every man get his fair share of promotion Alaric did not despise the sympathy of Captain Cuttwater It might turn out that even Captain Cuttwater could be made of use missus Woodward s letter to Harry was full of the tenderest affection It was a flattering soothing loving letter such as no man ever could have written It was like oil poured into his wounds and made him feel that the world was not all harsh to him He had determined not to go to Hampton that Saturday but missus Woodward s letter almost made him rush there at once that he might throw himself into her arms into her arms and at her daughter s feet The time had now come to him when he wanted to be comforted by the knowledge that his love was returned He resolved that during his next visit he would formally propose to Gertrude The determination to do this and a strong hope that he might do it successfully kept him up during the interval On the following week he was to go to his father s place to shoot having obtained leave of absence for a month and he felt that he could still enjoy himself if he could take with him the conviction that all was right at Surbiton Cottage missus Woodward in her letter though she had spoken much of the girls had said nothing special about Gertrude Nevertheless Norman gathered from it that she intended that he should go thither to look for comfort and that he would find there the comfort that he required And missus Woodward had intended that such should be the effect of her letter It was at present the dearest wish of her heart to see Norman and Gertrude married That Norman had often declared his love to her eldest daughter she knew very well and she knew also that Gertrude had never rejected him Having perfect confidence in her child she had purposely abstained from saying anything that could bias her opinion She had determined to leave the matter in the hands of the young people themselves judging that it might be best arranged as a true love match between them without interference from her she had therefore said nothing to Gertrude on the subject missus Woodward however discovered that she was in error when it was too late for her to retrieve her mistake and indeed had she discovered it before that letter was written what could she have done She could not have forbidden Harry to come to her house she could not have warned him not to throw himself at her daughter s feet The cup was prepared for his lips and it was necessary that he should drink of it There was nothing for which she could blame him nothing for which she could blame herself nothing for which she did blame her daughter It was sorrowful pitiful to be lamented wept for aye and groaned for many inward groans it cost her but it was at any rate well that she could attribute her sorrow to the spite of circumstances rather than to the ill conduct of those she loved Nor would it have been fair to blame Gertrude in the matter While she was yet a child this friend of her mother s had been thrown with her and when she was little more than a child she found that this friend had become a lover She liked him in one sense loved him and was accustomed to regard him as one whom it would be almost wrong in her not to like and love What wonder then that when he first spoke to her warm words of adoration she had not been able at once to know her own heart and tell him that his hopes would be in vain She perceived by instinct rather than by spoken words that her mother was favourable to this young lover that if she accepted him she would please her mother that the course of true love might in their case run smooth What wonder then that she should have hesitated before she found it necessary to say that she could not would not be Harry Norman s wife On the Saturday morning the morning of that night which was as he hoped to see him go to bed a happy lover so happy in his love as to be able to forget his other sorrows she was sitting alone with her mother It was natural that their conversation should turn to Alaric and Harry Alaric with his happy prospects was soon dismissed but missus Woodward continued to sing the praises of him who had she been potent with the magi of the Civil Service would now be the lion of the Weights and Measures I must say I think it was weak of him to retire said Gertrude Alaric says in his letter to Uncle Bat that had he persevered he would in all probability have been successful I should rather say that it was generous said her mother Well I don t know mamma that of course depends on his motives but wouldn t generosity of that sort between two young men in such a position be absurd You mean that such regard for his friend would be Quixotic Yes mamma Perhaps it would All true generosity all noble feeling is now called Quixotic But surely Gertrude you and I should not quarrel with Harry on that account I think he got frightened mamma and had not nerve to go through with it missus Woodward looked vexed but she made no immediate reply and for some time the mother and daughter went on working without further conversation At last Gertrude said I think every man is bound to do the best he can for himself that is honestly there is something spoony in one man allowing another to get before him as long as he can manage to be first himself missus Woodward did not like the tone in which her daughter spoke She felt that it boded ill for Harry s welfare and she tried but tried in vain to elicit from her daughter the expression of a kinder feeling Well my dear I must say I think you are hard on him But probably just at present you have the spirit of contradiction in you If I were to begin to abuse him perhaps I should get you to praise him Oh mamma I did not abuse him Something like it my dear when you said he was spoony Oh mamma I would not abuse him for worlds I know how good he is I know how you love him but but and Gertrude though very little given to sobbing moods burst into tears Come here Gertrude come here my child said missus Woodward now moved more for her daughter than for her favourite what is it what makes you cry I did not really mean that you abused poor Harry Gertrude got up from her chair knelt at her mother s feet and hid her face in her mother s lap Oh mamma she said with a half smothered voice I know what you mean I know what you wish but but but oh mamma you must not must not must not think of it any more Then may God help him said missus Woodward gently caressing her daughter who was still sobbing with her face buried in her mother s lap May God Almighty lighten the blow to him But oh Gertrude I had hoped I had so hoped Oh mamma don t pray don t and Gertrude sobbed as though she were going into hysterics No my child I will not say another word Dear as he is to me you are and must be ten times dearer There Gertrude it is over now over at least between us We know each other s hearts now It is my fault that we did not do so sooner They did understand each other at last and the mother made no further attempt to engage her daughter s love for the man she would have chosen as her daughter s husband But still the worst was to come as missus Woodward well knew and as Gertrude knew also to come too on this very day missus Woodward with a woman s keen perception felt assured that Harry Norman when he found himself at the Cottage freed from the presence of the successful candidate surrounded by the affectionate faces of all her circle would melt at once and look to his love for consolation She understood the feelings of his heart as well as though she had read them in a book and yet she could do nothing to save him from his fresh sorrows The cup was prepared for him and it was necessary that he should drink it She could not tell him could not tell even him that her daughter had rejected him when as yet he had made no offer And so Harry Norman hurried down to his fate When he reached the Cottage missus Woodward and Linda and Katie were in the drawing room Harry my dear Harry said missus Woodward rushing to him throwing her arms round him and kissing him we know it all we understand it all my fine dear good Harry Harry was melted in a moment and in the softness of his mood kissed Katie too and Linda also Katie he had often kissed but never Linda cousins though they were Linda merely laughed but Norman blushed for he remembered that had it so chanced that Gertrude had been there he would not have dared to kiss her Oh Harry said Katie we are so sorry that is not sorry about Alaric but sorry about you Why were there not two prizes It s all right as it is Katie said he we need none of us be sorry at all Alaric is a clever fellow everybody gave him credit for it before and now he has proved that everybody is right He is older than you you know and therefore he ought to be cleverer said Katie trying to make things pleasant And then they went out into the garden But where was Gertrude all this time She had been in the drawing room a moment before his arrival They walked out into the lawn but nothing was said about her absence Norman could not bring himself to ask for her and missus Woodward could not trust herself to talk of her Where is the captain said Harry He s at Hampton Court said Linda he has found another navy captain there and he goes over every day to play backgammon As they were speaking however the captain walked through the house on to the lawn Well Norman how are you how are you sorry you couldn t all win But you re a man of fortune you know so it doesn t signify Not a great deal of fortune said Harry looking sheepish Well I only hope the best man got it Now at the Admiralty the worst man gets it always The worst man didn t get it here said Harry No no said Uncle Bat I m sure he did not nor he won t long at the Admiralty either I can tell them that But where s Gertrude She s in her bedroom dressing for dinner said Katie Hoity toity said Uncle Bat she s going to make herself very grand to day That s all for you Master Norman Well I suppose we may all go in and get ready but mind I have got no sweetheart and so I shan t make myself grand at all and so they all went in to dress for dinner When Norman came down Gertrude was in the drawing room alone But he knew that they would be alone but for a minute and that a minute would not serve for his purpose She said one soft gentle word of condolence to him some little sentence that she had been studying to pronounce All her study was thrown away for Norman in his confusion did not understand a word that she spoke Her tone however was kind and affectionate and she shook hands with him apparently with cordiality He however ventured no kiss with her He did not even press her hand when for a moment he held it within his own Dinner was soon over and the autumn evening still admitted of their going out Norman was not sorry to urge the fact that the ladies had done so as an excuse to Captain Cuttwater for not sitting with him over his wine He heard their voices in the garden and went out to join them prepared to ascertain his fate if fortune would give him an opportunity of doing so He found the party to consist of missus Woodward Linda and Katie Gertrude was not there I think the evenings get warmer as the winter gets nearer said Harry Yes said missus Woodward but they are so dangerous The night comes on all at once and then the air is so damp and cold And so they went on talking about the weather Your boat is up in London I know Harry said Katie with a voice of reproach but at the same time with a look of entreaty Yes it s at Searle s said Norman But the punt is here said Katie Not this evening Katie said he Katie how can you be such a tease said missus Woodward you ll make Harry hate the island and you too I wonder you can be so selfish Poor Katie s eyes became suffused with tears My dear Katie it s very bad of me isn t it said Norman and the fine weather so nearly over too I ought to take you oughtn t I come we will go No we won t said Katie taking his big hand in both her little ones indeed we won t It was very wrong of me to bother you and you with with with so much to think of Dear Harry I don t want to go at all indeed I don t and she turned away from the little path which led to the place where the punt was moored They sauntered on for a while together and then Norman left them He said nothing but merely stole away from the lawn towards the drawing room window missus Woodward well knew with what object he went and would have spared him from his immediate sorrow by following him but she judged that it would be better both for him and for her daughter that he should learn the truth He went in through the open drawing room window and found Gertrude alone She was on the sofa with a book in her hand and had he been able to watch her closely he would have seen that the book trembled as he entered the room But he was unable to watch anything closely His own heart beat so fast his own confusion was so great that he could hardly see the girl whom he now hoped to gain as his wife Had Alaric been coming to his wooing he would have had every faculty at his call But then Alaric could not have loved as Norman loved And so we will leave them In about half an hour when the short twilight was becoming dusk missus Woodward returned and found Norman standing alone on the hearthrug before the fireplace Gertrude was away and he was leaning against the mantelpiece with his hands behind his back staring at vacancy but oh with such an aspect of dull speechless agony in his face missus Woodward looked up at him and would have burst into tears had she not remembered that they would not be long alone she therefore restrained herself but gave one involuntary sigh and then taking off her bonnet placed herself where she might sit without staring at him in his sorrow Katie came in next Oh Harry it s so lucky we didn t start in the punt said she for it s going to pour and we never should have been back from the island in that slow thing Norman looked at her and tried to smile but the attempt was a ghastly failure Katie gazing up into his face saw that he was unhappy and slunk away without further speech to her distant chair There from time to time she would look up at him and her little heart melted with ruth to see the depth of his misery Why oh why thought she should that greedy Alaric have taken away the only prize And then Linda came running in with her bonnet ribbons all moist with the big raindrops You are a nice squire of dames said she to leave us all out to get wet through by ourselves and then she also looking up saw that jesting was at present ill timed and so sat herself down quietly at the tea table But Norman never moved He saw them come in one after another He saw the pity expressed in missus Woodward s face he heard the light hearted voices of the two girls and observed how when they saw him their light heartedness was abashed but still he neither spoke nor moved He had been stricken with a fearful stroke and for a while was powerless Captain Cuttwater having shaken off his dining room nap came for his tea and then at last Gertrude also descending from her own chamber glided quietly into the room When she did so Norman with a struggle roused himself and took a chair next to missus Woodward and opposite to her eldest daughter Who could describe the intense discomfiture of that tea party or paint in fitting colours the different misery of each one there assembled Even Captain Cuttwater at once knew that something was wrong and munched his bread and butter and drank his tea in silence Linda surmised what had taken place though she was surprised she was left without any doubt Poor Katie was still in the dark but she also knew that there was cause for sorrow and crept more and more into her little self missus Woodward sat with averted face and ever and anon she put her handkerchief to her eyes Gertrude was very pale and all but motionless but she had schooled herself and managed to drink her tea with more apparent indifference than any of the others Norman sat as he had before been standing with that dreadful look of agony upon his brow Immediately after tea missus Woodward got up and went to her dressing room Her dressing room though perhaps not improperly so called was not an exclusive closet devoted to combs petticoats and soap and water It was a comfortable snug room nicely furnished with sofa and easy chairs and often open to others besides her handmaidens Thither she betook herself that she might weep unseen but in about twenty minutes her tears were disturbed by a gentle knock at the door Very soon after she went Gertrude also left the room and then Katie crept off I have got a headache to night said Norman after the remaining three had sat silent for a minute or two I think I ll go across and go to bed A headache said Linda Oh I am so sorry that you have got to go to that horrid inn Oh I shall do very well there said Norman trying to smile Will you have my room said the captain good naturedly any sofa does for me Norman assured them as well as he could that his present headache was of such a nature that a bed at the inn would be the best thing for him and then shaking hands with them he moved to the door Stop a moment Harry said Linda and let me tell mamma She ll give you something for your head He made a sign to her however to let him pass and then creeping gently upstairs he knocked at missus Woodward s door Come in said missus Woodward and Harry Norman with all his sorrows still written on his face stood before her Oh Harry said she come in I am so glad that you have come to me Oh Harry dear Harry what shall I say to comfort you What can I say what can I do Norman forgetting his manhood burst into tears and throwing himself on a sofa buried his face on the arm and sobbed like a young girl But the tears of a man bring with them no comfort as do those of the softer sex He was a strong tall man and it was dreadful to see him thus convulsed missus Woodward stood by him and put her hand caressingly on his shoulder She saw he had striven to speak and had found himself unable to do so I know how it is said she you need not tell me I know it all Would that she could have seen you with my eyes would that she could have judged you with my mind Oh missus Woodward To me Harry you should have been the dearest the most welcome son But you are so still No son could be dearer Oh that she could have seen you as I see you There is no hope said he He did not put it as a question but missus Woodward saw that it was intended that she should take it as such if she pleased What could she say to him She knew that there was no hope Had it been Linda Linda might have been moulded to her will But with Gertrude there could now be no hope What could she say She knelt down and kissed his brow and mingled her tears with his Oh Harry oh Harry my dearest dearest son Oh missus Woodward I have loved her so truly What could missus Woodward do but cry also what but that and throw such blame as she could upon her own shoulders She was bound to defend her daughter It has been my fault Harry she said it is I whom you must blame not poor Gertrude I blame no one said he I know you do not but it is I whom you should blame I should have learnt how her heart stood and have prevented this but I thought I thought it would have been otherwise Norman looked up at her and took her hand and pressed it I will go now he said and don t expect me here to morrow I could not come in Say that I thought it best to go to town because I am unwell Good bye missus Woodward pray write to me I can t come to the Cottage now for a while but pray write to me do not you forget me missus Woodward missus Woodward fell upon his breast and wept and bade God bless him and called him her son and her dearest friend and sobbed till her heart was nigh to break What she thought what could her daughter wish for when she repulsed from her feet such a suitor as Harry Norman He then went quietly down the stairs quietly out of the house and having packed up his bag at the inn started off through the pouring rain and walked away through the dark stormy night through the dirt and mud and wet to his London lodgings nor was he again seen at Surbiton Cottage for some months after this adventure CHAPTER XIII A COMMUNICATION OF IMPORTANCE Norman s dark wet walk did him physically no harm and morally some good He started on it in that frame of mind which induces a man to look with indifference on all coming evils under the impression that the evils already come are too heavy to admit of any increase But by the time that he was thoroughly wet through well splashed with mud and considerably fatigued by his first five or six miles walk he began to reflect that life was not over with him and that he must think of future things as well as those that were past He got home about two o clock and having knocked up his landlady missus Richards betook himself to bed Alaric had been in his room for the last two hours but of Charley and his latch key missus Richards knew nothing She stated her belief however that two a m seldom saw that erratic gentleman in his bed On the following morning Alaric when he got his hot water heard that Norman returned during the night from Hampton and he immediately guessed what had brought him back He knew that nothing short of some great trouble would have induced Harry to leave the Cottage so abruptly and that that trouble must have been of such a nature as to make his remaining with the Woodwards an aggravation of it No such trouble could have come on him but the one As Charley seldom made his appearance at the breakfast table on Sunday mornings Alaric foresaw that he must undergo a tete a tete which would not be agreeable to himself and which must be much more disagreeable to his companion but for this there was no help Harry had however prepared himself for what he had to go through and immediately that the two were alone he told his tale in a very few words Alaric said he I proposed to Gertrude last night and she refused me Alaric Tudor was deeply grieved for his friend There was something in the rejected suitor s countenance something in the tone of voice which would have touched any heart softer than stone and Alaric s heart had not as yet been so hardened by the world as to render him callous to the sight of such grief as this Take my word for it Harry she ll think better of it in a month or two he said Never never I am sure of it Not only from her own manner but from her mother s said Harry And yet during half his walk home he had been trying to console himself with the reflection that most young ladies reject their husbands once or twice before they accept them There is no offering a man comfort in such a sorrow as this unless indeed he be one to whom the worship of Bacchus may be made a fitting substitute for that of the Paphian goddess There is a sort of disgrace often felt if never acknowledged which attaches itself to a man for having put himself into Norman s present position and this generally prevents him from confessing his defeat in such matters The misfortune in question is one which doubtless occurs not unfrequently to mankind but as mankind generally bear their special disappointments in silence and as the vanity of women is generally exceeded by their good nature the secret we believe in most cases remains a secret Shall I wasting in despair Die because a woman s fair If she be not fair for me What care I how fair she be This was the upshot of the consideration which Withers the poet gave to the matter and Withers was doubtless right Tis thus that rejected lovers should think thus that they should demean themselves but they seldom come to this philosophy till a few days have passed by and talking of their grievance does not assist them in doing so When therefore Harry had declared what had happened to him and had declared also that he had no further hope he did not at first find himself much the better for what he had confessed He was lackadaisical and piteous and Alaric though he had endeavoured to be friendly soon found that he had no power of imparting any comfort Early in the day they parted and did not see each other again till the following morning I was going down to Normansgrove on Thursday said Harry Yes I know said Alaric I think I shall ask leave to go to day It can t make much difference and the sooner I get away the better And so it was settled Norman left town the same afternoon and Alaric with his blushing honours thick upon him was left alone London was now very empty and he was constrained to enjoy his glory very much by himself He had never associated much with the Minusexes and Uppinalls nor yet with the Joneses and Robinsons of his own office and it could not be expected that there should be any specially confidential intercourse between them just at the present moment Undy was of course out of town with the rest of the fashionable world and Alaric during the next week was left very much on his own hands And so said he to himself as he walked solitary along the lone paths of Rotten Row and across the huge desert to the Marble Arch and so poor Harry s hopes have been all in vain he has lost his promotion and now he has lost his bride poor Harry and then it occurred to him that as he had acquired the promotion it might be his destiny to win the bride also He had never told himself that he loved Gertrude he had looked on her as Norman s own and he at any rate was not the man to sigh in despair after anything that was out of his reach But now now that Harry s chance was over and that no bond of friendship could interfere with such a passion why should he not tell himself that he loved Gertrude If as Harry had himself said there was no longer any hope for him why said Alaric to himself why should not I try my chance Of Linda of dear dearest Linda at this moment he thought very little or perhaps not at all Of what missus Woodward might say of that he did think a good deal The week was melancholy and dull and it passed very slowly at Hampton On the Sunday morning it became known to them all that Norman was gone but the subject by tacit consent was allowed to pass all but unnoticed Even Katie even Uncle Bat were aware that something had occurred which ought to prevent them from inquiring too particularly why Harry had started back to town in so sudden a manner and so they said nothing To Linda Gertrude had told what had happened and Linda as she heard it asked herself whether she was prepared to be equally obdurate with her lover He had now the means of supporting a wife and why should she be obdurate Nothing was said on the subject between Gertrude and her mother What more could missus Woodward say It would have been totally opposed to the whole principle of her life to endeavour by any means to persuade her daughter to the match or to have used her maternal influence in Norman s favour And she was well aware that it would have been impossible to do so successfully Gertrude was not a girl to be talked into a marriage by any parent and certainly not by such a parent as her mother There was therefore nothing further to be said about it On Saturday Alaric went down but his arrival hardly made things more pleasant missus Woodward could not bring herself to be cordial with him and the girls were restrained by a certain feeling that it would not be right to show too much outward joy at Alaric s success Linda said one little word of affectionate encouragement but it produced no apparent return from Alaric His immediate object was to recover missus Woodward s good graces and he thought before he went that he had reason to hope that he might do so Of all the household Captain Cuttwater was the most emphatic in his congratulations He had no doubt he said that the best man had won He had always hoped that the best man might win He had not had the same luck when he was young but he was very glad to see such an excellent rule brought into the service It would soon work great changes he was quite sure at the Board of Admiralty On the Sunday afternoon Captain Cuttwater asked him into his own bedroom and told him with a solemn serious manner that he had a communication of importance to make to him Alaric followed the captain into the well known room in which Norman used to sleep wondering what could be the nature of Uncle Bat s important communication It might probably be some tidings of Sir Jib Boom mister Alaric said the old man as soon as they were both seated on opposite sides of a little Pembroke table that stood in the middle of the room I was heartily glad to hear of your success at the Weights and Measures not that I ever doubted it if they made a fair sailing match of it I am sure I am much obliged to you Captain Cuttwater That is as may be by and by But the fact is I have taken a fancy to you I like fellows that know how to push themselves Alaric had nothing for it but to repeat again that he felt himself grateful for Captain Cuttwater s good opinion Not that I have anything to say against mister Norman a very nice young man indeed he is very nice though perhaps not quite so cheerful in his manners as he might be Alaric began to take his friend s part and declared what a very worthy fellow Harry was I am sure of it I am sure of it said Uncle Bat but everybody can t be Aone and a man can t make everybody his heir Alaric pricked up his ears So after all Captain Cuttwater was right in calling his communication important But what business had Captain Cuttwater to talk of making new heirs had he not declared that the Woodwards were his heirs I have got a little money mister Alaric he went on saying in a low modest tone very different from that he ordinarily used I have got a little money not much and it will of course go to my niece here Of course said Alaric That is to say it will go to her children which is all the same thing Quite the same thing said Alaric But my idea is this if a man has saved a few pounds himself I think he has a right to give it to those he loves best Now I have no children of my own Alaric declared himself aware of the fact And I suppose I shan t have any now Not if you don t marry said Alaric who felt rather at a loss for a proper answer He could not however have made a better one No that s what I mean but I don t think I shall marry I am very well contented here and I like Surbiton Cottage amazingly It s a charming place said Alaric No I don t suppose I shall ever have any children of my own and then Uncle Bat sighed gently and so I have been considering whom I should like to adopt Quite right Captain Cuttwater Whom I should like to adopt I should like to have one whom I could call in a special manner my own Now mister Alaric I have made up my mind and who do you think it is Oh Captain Cuttwater I couldn t guess on such a matter I shouldn t like to guess wrong Perhaps not no that s right well then I ll tell you it s Gertrude Alaric was well aware that it was Gertrude before her name had been pronounced Yes it s Gertrude of course I couldn t go out of Bessie s family of course it must be either Gertrude or Linda or Katie Now Linda and Katie are very well but they haven t half the gumption that Gertrude has No they have not said Alaric I like gumption said Captain Cuttwater You ve a great deal of gumption that s why I like you Alaric laughed and muttered something Now I have been thinking of something and Uncle Bat looked strangely mysterious I wonder what you think of Gertrude Who I said Alaric I can see through a millstone as well as another said the captain and I used to think that Norman and Gertrude meant to hit it off together Alaric said nothing He did not feel inclined to tell Norman s secret and yet he could not belie Gertrude by contradicting the justice of Captain Cuttwater s opinion I used to think so but now I find there s nothing in it I am sure Gertrude wouldn t have him and I think she s right He hasn t gumption enough Harry Norman is no fool I dare say not said the captain but take my word she ll never have him Lord bless you Norman knows that as well as I do Alaric knew it very well himself also but he did not say so Now the long and the short of it is this why don t you make up to her If you ll make up to her and carry the day all I can say is I will do all I can to keep the pot a boiling and if you think it will help you you may tell Gertrude that I say so This was certainly an important communication and one to which Alaric found it very difficult to give any immediate answer He said a great deal about his affection for missus Woodward of his admiration for Miss Woodward of his strong sense of Captain Cuttwater s kindness and of his own unworthiness but he left the captain with an impression that he was not prepared at the present moment to put himself forward as a candidate for Gertrude s hand I don t know what the deuce he would have said the captain to himself She s as fine a girl as he s likely to find and two or three thousand pounds isn t so easily got every day by a fellow that hasn t a shilling of his own When Alaric took his departure the next morning he thought he perceived from missus Woodward s manner that there was less than her usual cordiality in the tone in which she said that of course he would return at the end of the week I will if possible he said and I need not say that I hope to do so but I fear I may be kept in town at any rate I ll write When the end of the week came he wrote to say that unfortunately he was kept in town He thoroughly understood that people are most valued when they make themselves scarce He got in reply a note from Gertrude saying that her mother begged that on the following Saturday he would come and bring Charley with him On his return to town Alaric by appointment called on Sir Gregory He had not seen his patron yet since his great report on Wheal Mary Jane had been sent in That report had been written exclusively by himself and poor Neverbend had been obliged to content himself with putting all his voluminous notes into Tudor s hands He afterwards obediently signed the report and received his reward for doing so Alaric never divulged to official ears how Neverbend had halted in the course of his descent to the infernal gods I thoroughly congratulate you said Sir Gregory You have justified my choice and done your duty with credit to yourself and benefit to the public I hope you may go on and prosper As long as you remember that your own interests should always be kept in subservience to those of the public service you will not fail to receive the praise which such conduct deserves Alaric thanked Sir Gregory for his good opinion and as he did so he thought of his new banker s account and of the Lthree hundred which was lying there After all which of them was right Sir Gregory Hardlines or Undy Scott Or was it that Sir Gregory s opinions were such as should control the outward conduct and Undy s those which should rule the inner man CHAPTER XIV VERY SAD Norman prolonged his visit to his father considerably beyond the month At first he applied for and received permission to stay away another fortnight and at the end of that fortnight he sent up a medical certificate in which the doctor alleged that he would be unable to attend to business for some considerable additional period It was not till after Christmas Day that he reappeared at the Weights and Measures Alaric kept his appointment at Hampton and took Charley with him And on the two following Saturdays he also went there and on both occasions Charley accompanied him During these visits he devoted himself as closely as he could to missus Woodward He talked to her of Norman and of Norman s prospects in the office he told her how he had intended to abstain from offering himself as a competitor till he had as it were been forced by Norman to do so he declared over and over again that Norman would have been victorious had he stood his ground to the end and assured her that such was the general opinion through the whole establishment And this he did without talking much about himself or praising himself in any way when he did so His speech was wholly of his friend and of the sorrow that he felt that his friend should have been disappointed in his hopes All this had its effects Of Norman s rejected love they neither of them spoke Each knew that the other must be aware of it but the subject was far too tender to be touched at any rate as yet And so matters went on and Alaric regained the footing of favour which he had for a while lost with the mistress of the house But there was one inmate of Surbiton Cottage who saw that though Alaric spent so much of his time with missus Woodward he found opportunity also for other private conversation and this was Linda Why was it that in the moments before they dressed for dinner Alaric was whispering with Gertrude and not with her Why was it that Alaric had felt it necessary to stay from church that Sunday evening when Gertrude also had been prevented from going by a headache He had remained he said in order that Captain Cuttwater might have company but Linda was not slow to learn that Uncle Bat had been left to doze away the time by himself Why on the following Monday had Gertrude been down so early and why had Alaric been over from the inn full half an hour before his usual time Linda saw and knew all this and was disgusted But even then she did not could not think that Alaric could be untrue to her that her own sister would rob her of her lover It could not be that there should be such baseness in human nature Poor Linda And yet though she did not believe that such falseness could exist in this world of hers at Surbiton Cottage she could not restrain herself from complaining rather petulantly to her sister as they were going to bed on that Sunday evening I hope your headache is better she said in a tone of voice as near to irony as her soft nature could produce Yes it is quite well now said Gertrude disdaining to notice the irony I dare say Alaric had a headache too I suppose one was about as bad as the other Linda said Gertrude answering rather with dignity than with anger you ought to know by this time that it is not likely that I should plead false excuses Alaric never said he had a headache He said he stayed from church to be with Uncle Bat but when we came back we found him with you Uncle Bat went to sleep and then he came into the drawing room The two girls said nothing more about it Linda should have remembered that she had never breathed a word to her sister of Alaric s passion for herself Gertrude s solemn propriety had deterred her just as she was about to do so How very little of that passion had Alaric breathed himself and yet alas enough to fill the fond girl s heart with dreams of love which occupied all her waking all her sleeping thoughts Oh ye ruthless swains from whose unhallowed lips fall words full of poisoned honey do ye never think of the bitter agony of many months of the dull misery of many years of the cold monotony of an uncheered life which follow so often as the consequence of your short hour of pastime On the Monday morning as soon as Alaric and Charley had started for town it was the morning on which Linda had been provoked to find that both Gertrude and Alaric had been up half an hour before they should have been Gertrude followed her mother to her dressing room and with palpitating heart closed the door behind her Linda remained downstairs putting away her tea and sugar not in the best of humours but Katie according to her wont ran up after her mother Katie said Gertrude as Katie bounced into the room dearest Katie I want to speak a word to mamma alone Will you mind going down just for a few minutes and she put her arm round her sister and kissed her with almost unwonted tenderness Go Katie dear said missus Woodward and Katie speechless retired Gertrude has got something particular to tell mamma something that I may not hear I wonder what it is about said Katie to her second sister Linda s heart sank within her Could it be No it could not could not be that the sweet voice which had whispered in her ears those well remembered words could have again whispered the same into other ears that the very Gertrude who had warned her not to listen to such words from such lips should have listened to them herself and have adopted them and made them her own It could not could not be and yet Linda s heart sank low within her If you really love him said the mother again caressing her eldest daughter as she acknowledged her love but hardly with such tenderness as when that daughter had repudiated that other love if you really love him dearest of course I do not of course I cannot object I do mamma I do Well then Gertrude so be it I have not a word to say against your choice Had I not believed him to be an excellent young man I should not have allowed him to be here with you so much as he has been We cannot all see with the same eyes dearest can we No mamma but pray don t think I dislike poor Harry and oh mamma pray don t set him against Alaric because of this Set him against Alaric No Gertrude I certainly shall not do that But whether I can reconcile Harry to it that is another thing At any rate he has no right to be angry at it said Gertrude assuming her air of dignity Certainly not with you Gertrude No nor with Alaric said she almost with indignation That depends on what has passed between them It is very hard to say how men so situated regard each other I know everything that has passed between them said Gertrude I never gave Harry any encouragement As soon as I understood my own feelings I endeavoured to make him understand them also But my dearest no one is blaming you But you are blaming Alaric Indeed I am not Gertrude No man could have behaved more honourably to his friend said Gertrude no man more nobly and if Harry does not feel it so he has not the good heart for which I always gave him credit Poor fellow his friendship for Alaric will be greatly tried And mamma has not Alaric s friendship been tried and has it not borne the trial nobly Harry told him of of of his intentions Harry told him long long long ago Ah me poor Harry sighed missus Woodward But you think nothing of Alaric Alaric is successful my dear and can Think sufficiently of himself missus Woodward was going to say but she stopped herself Harry told him all continued Gertrude and Alaric Alaric said nothing of his own feelings Alaric never said a word to me that he might not have said before his friend till till You must own mamma that no one can have behaved more nobly than Alaric has done missus Woodward nevertheless had her own sentiments on the matter which were not quite in unison with those of her daughter But then she was not in love with Alaric and her daughter was She thought that Alaric s love was a passion that had but lately come to the birth and that had he been true to his friend nobly true as Gertrude had described him it would never have been born at all or at any rate not till Harry had had a more prolonged chance of being successful with his suit missus Woodward understood human nature better than her daughter or at least flattered herself that she did so and she felt well assured that Alaric had not been dying for love during the period of Harry s unsuccessful courtship He might she thought have waited a little longer before he chose for his wife the girl whom his friend had loved seeing that he had been made the confidant of that love Such were the feelings which missus Woodward felt herself unable to repress but she could not refuse her consent to the marriage After all she had some slight twinge of conscience some inward conviction that she was prejudiced in Harry s favour as her daughter was in Alaric s Then she had lost all right to object to Alaric by allowing him to be so constantly at the Cottage and then again there was nothing to which in reason she could object In point of immediate income Alaric was now the better match of the two She kissed her daughter therefore and promised that she would do her best to take Alaric to her heart as her son in law You will tell Uncle Bat mamma said Gertrude O yes certainly my dear of course he ll be told But I suppose it does not make much matter immediately I think he should be told mamma I should not like him to think that he was treated with anything like disrespect Very well my dear I ll tell him said missus Woodward who was somewhat surprised at her daughter s punctilious feelings about Uncle Bat However it was all very proper and she was glad to think that her children were inclined to treat their grand uncle with respect in spite of his long nose And then Gertrude was preparing to leave the room but her mother stopped her Gertrude dear said she Yes mamma Come here dearest shut the door Gertrude have you told Linda yet No mamma not yet As missus Woodward asked the question there was an indescribable look of painful emotion on her brow It did not escape Gertrude s eye and was not to her perfectly unintelligible She had conceived an idea why she did not know that these recent tidings of hers would not be altogether agreeable to her sister No mamma I have not told her of course I told you first But now I shall do so immediately Let me tell her said missus Woodward will you Gertrude Oh certainly mamma if you wish it Things were going wrong with missus Woodward She had perceived with a mother s anxious eye that her second daughter was not indifferent to Alaric Tudor While she yet thought that Norman and Gertrude would have suited each other this had caused her no disquietude She herself had entertained none of those grand ideas to which Gertrude had given utterance with so much sententiousness when she silenced Linda s tale of love before the telling of it had been commenced missus Woodward had always felt sufficiently confident that Alaric would push himself in the world and she would have made no objection to him as a son in law had he been contented to take the second instead of the first of her flock She had never spoken to Linda on the matter and Linda had offered to her no confidence but she felt all but sure that her second child would not have entertained the affection which she had been unable altogether to conceal had no lover s plea been poured into her ears missus Woodward questioned her daughters but little but she understood well the nature of each and could nearly read their thoughts Linda s thoughts it was not difficult to read Linda pet she said as soon as she could get Linda into her room without absolutely sending for her you have not yet heard Gertrude s news No said Linda turning very pale and feeling that her heart was like to burst I would let no one tell you but myself Linda Come here dearest don t stand there away from me Can you guess what it is Linda for a moment could not speak No mamma she said at last I don t know what it is missus Woodward twined her arm round her daughter s waist as they sat on the sofa close to each other Linda tried to compose herself but she felt that she was trembling in her mother s arms She would have given anything to be calm anything to hide her secret She little guessed then how well her mother knew it Her eyes were turned down and she found that she could not raise them to her mother s face No mamma she said I don t know what is it Gertrude is to be married Linda She is engaged I thought she refused Harry said Linda through whose mind a faint idea was passing of the cruelty of nature s arrangements which gave all the lovers to her sister Yes dearest she did and now another has made an offer she has accepted him missus Woodward could hardly bring herself to speak out that which she had to say and yet she felt that she was only prolonging the torture for which she was so anxious to find a remedy Has she said Linda on whom the full certainty of her misery had now all but come She has accepted our dear Alaric Our dear Alaric what words for Linda s ears They did reach her ears but they did not dwell there her soft gentle nature sank beneath the sound Her mother when she looked to her for a reply found that she was sinking through her arms Linda had fainted missus Woodward neither screamed nor rang for assistance nor emptied the water jug over her daughter nor did anything else which would have the effect of revealing to the whole household the fact that Linda had fainted She had seen girls faint before and was not frightened But how when Linda recovered was she to be comforted missus Woodward laid her gently on the sofa undid her dress loosened her stays and then sat by her chafing her hands and moistening her lips and temples till gradually the poor girl s eyes reopened The recovery from a fainting fit a real fainting fit I beg young ladies to understand brings with it a most unpleasant sensation and for some minutes Linda s sorrow was quelled by her sufferings but as she recovered her strength she remembered where she was and what had happened and sobbing violently she burst into an hysterical storm of tears Her most poignant feeling now was one of fear lest her mother should have guessed her secret and this missus Woodward well understood She could do nothing towards comforting her child till there was perfect confidence between them It was easy to arrive at this with Linda nor would it afterwards be difficult to persuade her as to the course she ought to take The two girls were so essentially different the one so eager to stand alone and guide herself the other so prone to lean on the nearest support that came to her hand It was not long before Linda had told her mother everything Either by words or tears or little signs of mute confession she made her mother understand with all but exactness what had passed between Alaric and herself and quite exactly what had been the state of her own heart She sobbed and wept and looked up to her mother for forgiveness as though she had been guilty of a great sin and when her mother caressed her with all a mother s tenderness and told her that she was absolved from all fault free of all blame she was to a certain degree comforted Whatever might now happen her mother would be on her side But missus Woodward when she looked into the matter found that it was she that should have demanded pardon of her daughter not her daughter of her Why had this tender lamb been allowed to wander out of the fold while a wolf in sheep s clothing was invited into the pasture ground Gertrude with her talent her beauty and dignity of demeanour had hitherto been perhaps the closest to the mother s heart had been if not the most cherished yet the most valued Gertrude had been the apple of her eye This should be altered now If a mother s love could atone for a mother s negligence missus Woodward would atone to her child for this hour of misery And Katie her sweet bonny Katie she at least should be protected from the wolves Those were the thoughts that passed through missus Woodward s heart as she sat there caressing Linda But how were things to be managed now at the present moment It was quite clear that the wolf in sheep s clothing must be admitted into the pastoral family either that or the fairest lamb of the flock must be turned out altogether to take upon herself lupine nature and roam the woods a beast of prey As matters stood it behoved them to make such a sheep of Alaric as might be found practicable And so missus Woodward set to work to teach her daughter how best she might conduct herself in her present state of wretchedness She had to bear with her sister s success to listen to her sister s joy to enter into all her future plans to assist at her toilet to prepare her wedding garments to hear the congratulations of friends and take a sister s share in a sister s triumph and to do this without once giving vent to a reproach And she had worse than this to do she had to encounter Alaric and to wish him joy of his bride she had to protect her female pride from the disgrace which a hopeless but acknowledged love would throw on it she had to live in the house with Alaric as though he were her brother and as though she had never thought to live with him in any nearer tie She would have to stand at the altar as her sister s bridesmaid and see them married and she would have to smile and be cheerful as she did so This was the lesson which missus Woodward had now to teach her daughter and she so taught it that Linda did all that circumstances and her mother required of her Late on that afternoon she went to Gertrude and kissing her wished her joy At that moment Gertrude was the more embarrassed of the two Linda dear Linda she said embracing her sister convulsively I hope you will be happy Gertrude with all my heart said Linda and so she relinquished her lover We talk about the weakness of women and Linda Woodward was in many a way weak enough but what man what giant has strength equal to this It was not that her love was feeble Her heart was capable of truest love and she had loved Alaric truly But she had that within her which enabled her to overcome herself and put her own heart and hopes and happiness all but her maiden pride into the background when the hopes and happiness of another required it She still shared the same room with her sister and those who know how completely absorbed a girl is by her first acknowledged love may imagine how many questions she had to answer to how many propositions she was called to assent for how many schemes she had to vouchsafe a sister s interest while her heart was telling her that she should have been the questioner she should have been the proposer that the schemes should all have been her own But she bore it bravely When Alaric first came down which he did in the middle of the week she was as she told her mother too weak to stand in his presence Her mother strongly advised her not to absent herself so she sat gently by while he kissed missus Woodward and Katie She sat and trembled for her turn she knew must come It did come Alaric with an assurance which told more for his courage than for his heart came up to her and with a smiling face offered her his hand She rose up and muttered some words which she had prepared for the occasion and he still holding her by the hand stooped down and kissed her cheek missus Woodward looked on with an angry flush on her brow and hated him for his cold hearted propriety of demeanour Linda went up to her mother s room and sitting on her mother s bed sobbed herself into tranquillity It was very grievous to missus Woodward to have to welcome Alaric to her house For Alaric s own sake she would no longer have troubled herself to do so but Gertrude was still her daughter her dear child Gertrude had done nothing to disentitle her to a child s part and a child s protection and even had she done so missus Woodward was not a woman to be unforgiving to her child For Gertrude s sake she had to make Alaric welcome she forced herself to smile on him and call him her son to make him more at home in her house even than Harry had ever been to give him privileges which he wolf as he was had so little deserved But Captain Cuttwater made up by the warmth of his congratulations for any involuntary coolness which Alaric might have detected in those of missus Woodward It had become a strong wish of the old man s heart that he might make Alaric at any rate in part his heir without doing an injustice to his niece or her family He had soon seen and appreciated what he had called the gumption both of Gertrude and Alaric Had Harry married Gertrude and Alaric Linda he would have regarded either of those matches with disfavour But now he was quite satisfied now he could look on Alaric as his son and Gertrude as his daughter and use his money according to his fancy without incurring the reproaches of his conscience Quite right my boy he said to Alaric slapping him on the back at the same time with pretty nearly all his power quite right Didn t I know you were the winning horse didn t I tell you how it would be Do you think I don t know what gumption means If I had not had my own weather eye open aye and d wide open the most of my time I shouldn t have two or three thousand pounds to give away now to any young fellow that I take a fancy to Alaric was of course all smiles and good humour and Gertrude not less so The day after he heard of the engagement Uncle Bat went to town and on his return he gave Gertrude Lone hundred to buy her wedding clothes and half that sum to her mother in order that the thing might go off as he expressed himself slip slap and no mistake To Linda he gave nothing but promised her that he would not forget her when her time came All this time Norman was at Normansgrove but there were three of the party who felt that it behoved them to let him know what was going on missus Woodward wrote first and on the following day both Gertrude and Alaric wrote to him the former from Hampton and the latter from his office in London All these letters were much laboured but with all this labour not one of them contained within it a grain of comfort That from missus Woodward came first and told the tale Strange to say though Harry had studiously rejected from his mind all idea of hope as regarded Gertrude nevertheless the first tidings of her betrothal with Alaric struck him as though he had still fancied himself a favoured lover He felt as though in his absence he had been robbed of a prize which was all his own as though a chattel had been taken from him to which he had a full right as though all the Hampton party missus Woodward included were in a conspiracy to defraud him the moment his back was turned The blow was so severe that it laid him prostrate at once He could not sob away his sorrow on his mother s bosom no one could teach him how to bear his grief with meek resignation He had never spoken of his love to his friends at Normansgrove They had all been witnesses to his deep disappointment but that had been attributed to his failure at his office He was not a man to seek for sympathy in the sorrows of his heart He had told Alaric of his rejection because he had already told him of his love but he had whispered no word of it to anyone besides On the day on which he received missus Woodward s letter he appeared at dinner ghastly pale and evidently so ill as to be all but unable to sit at table but he would say nothing to anybody he sat brooding over his grief till he was unable to sit any longer And yet missus Woodward had written with all her skill with all her heart striving to pluck the sting away from the tidings which she had to communicate She had felt however that she owed as much at least to her daughter as she did to him and she failed to call Alaric perjured false dishonoured unjust disgraced and treacherous Nothing short of her doing so would have been deemed by Norman fitting mention of Tudor s sin nothing else would have satisfied the fury of his wrath On the next morning he received Gertrude s letter and Alaric s The latter he never read he opened it saw that it began as usual My dear Harry and then crammed it into his pocket By return of post it went back under a blank cover addressed to Alaric at the Weights and Measures The days of duelling were gone by unfortunately as Norman now thought but nothing he determined should ever induce him again to hold friendly intercourse with the traitor He abstained from making any such oath as to the Woodwards but determined that his conduct in that respect should be governed by the manner in which Alaric was received by them But Gertrude s letter he read over and over again and each time he did so he indulged in a fresh burst of hatred against the man who had deceived him A dishonest villain he said to himself over and over again what right had I to suppose he would be true to me when I found that he had been so false to others Dearest Harry the letter began Dearest Harry Why should she begin with a lie He was not dearest You must not must not must not be angry with Alaric she went on to say as soon as she had told her tale Oh must he not Not be angry with Alaric Not angry with the man who had forgotten every law of honour every principle of honesty every tie of friendship Not angry with the man whom he had trusted with the key of his treasure and who had then robbed him who had stolen from him all his contentment all his joy his very heart s blood not angry with him Our happiness will never be perfect unless you will consent to share it Thus simply in the affection of her heart had Gertrude concluded the letter by which she intended to pour balm into the wounds of her rejected lover and pave the way for the smoothing of such difficulties as might still lie in the way of her love Their happiness would not be perfect unless he would consent to share it Every word in the sentence was gall to him It must have been written with the object of lacerating his wounds and torturing his spirit so at least said Norman to himself He read the letter over and over again At one time he resolved to keep it till he could thrust it back into her hand and prove to her of what cruelty she had been guilty Then he thought of sending it to missus Woodward and asking her how after that could she think that he should ever again enter her doors at Hampton Finally he tore it into a thousand bits and threw them behind the fire Share their happiness and as he repeated the words he gave the last tear to the fragments of paper which he still held in his hand Could he at that moment as easily have torn to shreds all hope of earthly joys for those two lovers he would then have done it and cast the ruins to the flames Oh what a lesson he might have learnt from Linda And yet what were his injuries to hers He in fact had not been injured at least not by him against whom the strength of his wrath most fiercely raged The two men had both admired Gertrude but Norman had started on the race first Before Alaric had had time to know his own mind he had learnt that Norman claimed the beauty as his own He had acknowledged to himself that Norman had a right to do so and had scrupulously abstained from interfering with him Why should Norman like a dog in the manger begrudge to his friend the fodder which he himself could not enjoy To him at any rate Alaric had in this been no traitor Twas thus at least that Gertrude argued in her heart and twas thus that missus Woodward tried to argue also But who could excuse Alaric s falseness to Linda And yet Linda had forgiven him CHAPTER XV NORMAN RETURNS TO TOWN Harry Norman made no answer to either of his three letters beyond that of sending Alaric s back unread but this without other reply was sufficient to let them all guess nearly with accuracy what was the state of his mind Alaric told Gertrude how his missive had been treated and Gertrude of course told her mother There was very little of that joy at Surbiton Cottage which should have been the forerunner of a wedding None of the Woodward circle were content thus to lose their friend And then their unhappiness on this score was augmented by hearing that Harry had sent up a medical certificate instead of returning to his duties when his prolonged leave of absence was expired To Alaric this at the moment was a relief He had dreaded the return of Norman to London There were so many things to cause infinite pain to them both All Norman s things his books and clothes his desks and papers and pictures his whips and sticks and all those sundry belongings which even a bachelor collects around him were strewing the rooms in which Alaric still lived He had of course felt that it was impossible that they should ever again reside together Not only must they quarrel but all the men at their office must know that they had quarrelled And yet some intercourse must be maintained between them they must daily meet in the rooms at the Weights and Measures and it would now in their altered position become necessary that in some things Norman should receive instructions from Alaric as his superior officer But if Alaric thought of this often so did Norman and before the last fortnight had expired the thinking of it had made him so ill that his immediate return to London was out of the question missus Woodward s heart melted within her when she heard that Harry was really ill She had gone on waiting day after day for an answer to her letter but no answer came No answer came but in lieu thereof she heard that Harry was laid up at Normansgrove She heard it and Gertrude heard it and in spite of the coming wedding there was very little joy at Surbiton Cottage And then missus Woodward wrote again and a man must have had a heart of stone not to be moved by such a letter She had heard she said that he was ill and the tidings had made her wretched the more so inasmuch as he had sent no answer to her last letter Was he very ill was he dangerously ill She hoped she would fain hope that his illness had not arisen from any mental grief If he did not reply to this or get some of his family to do so there would be nothing for her but to go herself to Normansgrove She could not remain quiet while she was left in such painful doubt about her dearest well loved Harry Norman How to speak of Gertrude or how not to speak of her missus Woodward knew not at last she added The three girls send their kindest love they are all as wretchedly anxious as I am I know you are too good to wish that poor Gertrude should suffer but if you did you might have your wish The tidings of your illness together with your silence have robbed her of all her happiness and it ended thus Dearest Harry do not be cruel to us our hearts are all with you This was too much for Norman s sternness and he relented at least as far as missus Woodward was concerned He wrote to say that though he was still weak he was not dangerously ill and that he intended if nothing occurred amiss to be in town about the end of the year He hoped he might then see her to thank her for all her kindness She would understand that he could not go down to Surbiton Cottage but as she would doubtless have some occasion for coming up to town they might thus contrive to meet He then sent his love to Linda and Katie and ended by saying that he had written to Charley Tudor to take lodgings for him Not the slightest allusion was made either to Gertrude or Alaric except that which might seem to be conveyed in the intimation that he could make no more visits to Hampton This letter was very cold It just permitted missus Woodward to know that Norman did not regard them all as strangers and that was all Linda said it was very sad and Gertrude said not to her mother but to Alaric that it was heartless Captain Cuttwater predicted that he would soon come round and be as sound as a roach again in six months time Alaric said nothing but he went on with his wooing and this he did so successfully as to make Gertrude painfully alive to what would have been in her eyes the inferiority of her lot had she unfortunately allowed herself to become the victim of Norman s love Alaric went on with his wooing and he also went on with his share buying Undy Scott had returned to town for a week or two to wind up the affairs of his expiring secretaryship and he made Alaric understand that a nice thing might yet be done in Mary Janes Alaric had been very foolish to sell so quickly so at least said Undy To this Alaric replied that he had bought the shares thoughtlessly and had felt a desire to get rid of them as quickly as he could Those were scruples at which Undy laughed pleasantly and Alaric soon laughed with him At any rate said Undy your report is written and off your hands now so you may do what you please in the matter like a free man with a safe conscience Alaric supposed that he might I am as fond of the Civil Service as any man said Undy just as fond of it as Sir Gregory himself I have been in it and may be in it again If I do I shall do my duty But I have no idea of having my hands tied My purse is my own to do what I like with it Whether I buy beef or mutton or shares in Cornwall is nothing to anyone I give the Crown what it pays for my five or six hours a day and nothing more When I was appointed private secretary to the First Lord of the Stannaries I told my friend Whip Vigil that those were the terms on which I accepted office and Vigil agreed with me Alaric pupil as he was to the great Sir Gregory declared that he also agreed with him That is not Sir Gregory s doctrine but it s mine said Undy and though it s my own I think it by far the honester doctrine of the two Alaric did not sift the matter very deeply nor did he ask Undy or himself either whether in using the contents of his purse in the purchase of shares he would be justified in turning to his own purpose any information which he might obtain in his official career Nor did he again offer to put that broad test to himself which he had before proposed and ask himself whether he would dare to talk of what he was doing in the face of day in his own office before Sir Gregory or before the Neverbends of the Service He had already learnt the absurdity of such tests Did other men talk of such doings Was it not notorious that the world speculated and that the world was generally silent in the matter Why should he attempt to be wiser than those around him Was it not sufficient for him to be wise in his generation What man had ever become great who allowed himself to be impeded by small scruples If the sportsman returned from the field laden with game who would scrutinize the mud on his gaiters Excelsior said Alaric to himself with a proud ambition and so he attempted to rise by the purchase and sale of mining shares When he was fairly engaged in the sport his style of play so fascinated Undy that they embarked in a sort of partnership pro hoc vice good to the last during the ups and downs of Wheal Mary Jane Mary Jane no doubt would soon run dry or else be drowned as had happened to New Friendship But in the meantime something might be done Of course you ll be consulted about those other papers said Undy It might be as well they should be kept back for a week or two Well I ll see said Alaric and as he said it he felt that his face was tinged with a blush of shame But what then Who would look at the dirt on his gaiters if he filled his bag with game missus Woodward was no whit angered by the coldness of Norman s letter She wished that he could have brought himself to write in a different style but she remembered his grief and knew that as time should work its cure upon it he would come round and again be gentle and affectionate at any rate with her She misdoubted Charley s judgement in the choice of lodgings and therefore she talked over the matter with Alaric It was at last decided that he Alaric should move instead of driving Norman away His final movement would soon take place that movement which would rob him of the freedom of lodginghood and invest him with all the ponderous responsibility and close restraint of a householder He and Gertrude were to be married in February and after spending a cold honeymoon in Paris and Brussels were to begin their married life amidst the sharp winds of a London March But love gratified love will we believe keep out even an English east wind If so it is certainly the only thing that will Charley therefore wrote to Norman telling him that he could remain in his old home and humbly asking permission to remain there with him To this request he received a kind rejoinder in the affirmative Though Charley was related to Alaric there had always apparently been a closer friendship between him and Norman than between the two cousins and now in his fierce unbridled quarrel with Alaric and in his present coolness with the Woodwards he seemed to turn to Charley with more than ordinary affection Norman made his appearance at the office on the first Monday of the new year He had hitherto sat at the same desk with Alaric each of them occupying one side of it on his return he found himself opposite to a stranger Alaric had of course been promoted to a room of his own The Weights and Measures had never been a noisy office but now it became more silent than ever Men there talked but little at any time and now they seemed to cease from talking altogether It was known to all that the Damon and Pythias of the establishment were Damon and Pythias no longer that war waged between them and that if all accounts were true they were ready to fly each at the other s throat Some attributed this to the competitive examination others said it was love others declared that it was money the root of evil and one rash young gentleman stated his positive knowledge that it was all three At any rate something dreadful was expected and men sat anxious at their desks fearing the coming evil On the Monday the two men did not meet nor on the Tuesday On the next morning Alaric having acknowledged to himself the necessity of breaking the ice walked into the room where Norman sat with three or four others It was absolutely necessary that he should make some arrangement with him as to a certain branch of office work and though it was competent for him as the superior to have sent for Norman as the inferior he thought it best to abstain from doing so even though he were thereby obliged to face his enemy for the first time in the presence of others Well mister Embryo said he speaking to the new junior and standing with his back to the fire in an easy way as though there was nothing wrong under the sun or at least nothing at the Weights and Measures well mister Embryo how do you get on with those calculations Pretty well I believe sir I think I begin to understand them now said the tyro producing for Alaric s gratification five or six folio sheets covered with intricate masses of figures Ah yes that will do very well said Alaric taking up one of the sheets and looking at it with an assumed air of great interest Though he acted his part pretty well his mind was very far removed from mister Embryo s efforts Norman sat at his desk as black as a thunder cloud with his eyes turned intently at the paper before him but so agitated that he could not even pretend to write By the by Norman said Alaric when will it suit you to look through those Scotch papers with me My name sir is mister Norman said Harry getting up and standing by his chair with all the firmness of a Paladin of old With all my heart said Alaric In speaking to you I can have but one wish and that is to do so in any way that may best please you Any instructions you may have to give I will attend to as far as my duty goes said Norman And then Alaric pushing mister Embryo from his chair without much ceremony sat down opposite to his former friend and said and did what he had to say and do with an easy unaffected air in which there was at any rate none of the usual superciliousness of a neophyte s authority Norman was too agitated to speak reasonably or to listen calmly but Alaric knew that though he might not do so to day he would to morrow or if not to morrow then the next day and so from day to day he came into Norman s room and transacted his business mister Embryo got accustomed to looking through the window at the Council Office for the ten minutes that he remained there and Norman also became reconciled to the custom And thus though they never met in any other way they daily had a kind of intercourse with each other which at last contrived to get itself arranged into a certain amount of civility on both sides Immediately that Norman s arrival was heard of at Surbiton Cottage missus Woodward hastened up to town to see him She wrote to him to say that she would be at his lodgings at a certain hour and begged him to come thither to her Of course he did not refuse and so they met missus Woodward had much doubted whether or no she would take Linda or Katie with her but at last she resolved to go alone Harry she thought would be more willing to speak freely to her to open his heart to her if there were nobody by but herself Their meeting was very touching and characteristic of the two persons missus Woodward was sad enough but her sadness was accompanied by a strength of affection that carried before it every obstacle Norman was also sad but he was at first stern and cold and would have remained so to the last had not his manly anger been overpowered by her feminine tenderness It was singular but not the less true that at this period Norman appeared to have forgotten altogether that he had ever proposed to Gertrude and been rejected by her All that he said and all that he thought was exactly what he might have said and thought had Alaric taken from him his affianced bride No suitor had ever felt his suit to be more hopeless than he had done and yet he now regarded himself as one whose high hopes of happy love had all been destroyed by the treachery of a friend and the fickleness of a woman This made the task of appeasing him very difficult to missus Woodward She could not in plain language remind him that he had been plainly rejected nor could she on the other hand permit her daughter to be branded with a fault of which she had never been guilty missus Woodward had wished though she had hardly hoped so to mollify Norman as to induce him to promise to be at the wedding but she soon found that this was out of the question There was no mitigating his anger against Alaric missus Woodward said he standing very upright and looking very stiff I will never again willingly put myself in any position where I must meet him Oh Harry don t say so think of your close friendship think of your long friendship Why did he not think of it But Harry if not for his sake if not for your own at any rate do so for ours for my sake for Katie s and Linda s for Gertrude s sake I had rather not speak of Gertrude missus Woodward Ah Harry Gertrude has done you no injury why should you thus turn your heart against her You should not blame her if you have anyone to blame it is me No you have been true to me And has she been false Oh Harry think how we have loved you You should be more just to us Tush he said I do not believe in justice there is no justice left I would have given everything I had for him I would have made any sacrifice His happiness was as much my thought as my own And now and yet you talk to me of justice And if he had injured you Harry would you not forgive him Do you repeat your prayers without thinking of them Do you not wish to forgive them that trespass against you Norman groaned inwardly in the spirit Do you not think of this when you kneel every night before your God There are injuries which a man cannot forgive is not expected to forgive Are there Harry Oh that is a dangerous doctrine In that way every man might nurse his own wrath till anger would make devils of us all Our Saviour has made no exceptions In one sense I do forgive him missus Woodward I wish him no evil But it is impossible that I should call a man who has so injured me my friend I look upon him as disgraced for ever She then endeavoured to persuade him to see Gertrude or at any rate to send his love to her But in this also he was obdurate It could he said do no good He could not answer for himself that his feelings would not betray him A message would be of no use if true it would not be gracious if false it had better be avoided He was quite sure Gertrude would be indifferent as to any message from him The best thing for them both would be that they should forget each other He promised however that he would go down to Hampton immediately after the marriage and he sent his kindest love to Linda and Katie And dear missus Woodward said he I know you think me very harsh I know you think me vindictive but pray pray believe that I understand all your love and acknowledge all your goodness The time will perhaps come when we shall be as happy together as we once were missus Woodward trying to smile through her tears could only say that she would pray that that time might soon come and so bidding God bless him as a mother might bless her child she left him and returned to Hampton not with a light heart CHAPTER XVI THE FIRST WEDDING In spite however of Norman and his anger on a cold snowy morning in the month of February Gertrude stood at the altar in Hampton Church a happy trusting bride 
6199-48196-0001	train-other-500	and Linda stood smiling behind her the lovely leader of the nuptial train Nor were Linda s smiles false or forced much less treacherous She had taught herself to look on Alaric as her sister s husband
6199-48196-0002	train-other-500	and though in doing so she had suffered and did still suffer she now thought of her own lost lover in no other guise
none	none	 A housemaid not long since who was known in the family in which she lived to be affianced to a neighbouring gardener came weeping 
6199-48196-0003	train-other-500	to her mistress Oh ma am Why Susan what ails you Oh ma am Well Susan what is it why are you crying Oh ma am John
none	none	 Well what of John I hope he is not misbehaving 
6199-48196-0004	train-other-500	Indeed ma am he is then the worst of misbehaviour for he s gone and got hisself married And poor Susan gave vent to a flood of tears Her mistress tried to comfort her and not in vain
6199-48196-0005	train-other-500	She told her that probably she might be better as she was that John seeing what he had done must be a false creature who would undoubtedly have used her ill and she ended her good counsel by trying to make Susan understand that there were still as good fish in the sea
none	none	 as had ever yet been caught out of it And that s true too ma am said Susan with her apron to her eyes Then you should not be downhearted you know Nor I han t down arted ma am for thank God I could love any man but 
6199-48196-0006	train-other-500	it s the looks on it ma am it s that I mind How many of us are there women and men too who think most of the looks of it under such circumstances and who were we as honest as poor Susan
6199-48196-0007	train-other-500	ought to thank God as she did that we can love anyone anyone that is of the other sex We are not all of us susceptible of being torn to tatters by an unhappy passion not even all those of us who may be susceptible
6199-48196-0008	train-other-500	of a true and honest love And it is well that it is so It is one of God s mercies and if we were as wise as Susan we should thank God for it Linda was perhaps one of those
6199-48196-0009	train-other-500	She was good affectionate tender and true But she was made of that stuff which can bend to the north wind The world was not all over with her because a man had been untrue to her She had had her grief
none	none	 and had been told to meet it like a Christian she had been obedient to the telling and now felt the good result So when Gertrude was married she stood smiling behind her and when her new brother in law kissed her in the vestry room she smiled again 
6199-48196-0010	train-other-500	and honestly wished them happiness And Katie was there very pretty and bonny still childish with her short dress and long trousers but looking as though she too would soon feel the strength of her own wings and be able to fly away
6199-48196-0011	train-other-500	from her mother s nest Dear Katie Her story has yet to be told To her belongs neither the soft easiness of her sister Linda nor the sterner dignity of Gertrude But she has a character of her own which contains perhaps
6199-48196-0012	train-other-500	higher qualities than those given to either of her sisters And there were other bridesmaids there how many it boots not now to say We must have the spaces round our altars greatly widened if this passion for bevies
6199-48196-0013	train-other-500	of attendant nymphs be allowed to go on increasing and if crinolines increase also If every bride is to have twelve maidens and each maiden to stand on no less than a twelve yard circle what modest temple will ever suffice
6199-48196-0014	train-other-500	for a sacrifice to Hymen And missus Woodward was there of course as pretty to my thinking as either of her daughters or any of the bridesmaids She was very pretty and smiling and quiet But when Gertrude said
6199-48196-0015	train-other-500	I will she was thinking of Harry Norman and grieving that he was not there And Captain Cuttwater was there radiant in a new blue coat made specially for the occasion and elastic with true joy He had been very generous
none	none	 He had given Lone thousand to Alaric and settled Lone hundred fifty a year 
6199-48196-0016	train-other-500	on Gertrude payable of course after his death This indeed was the bulk of what he had to give and missus Woodward had seen with regret his exuberant munificence to one of her children But Gertrude was her child and of course
6199-48196-0017	train-other-500	she could not complain And Charley was there acting as best man It was just the place and just the work for Charley He forgot all his difficulties all his duns and also all his town delights
6199-48196-0018	train-other-500	Without a sigh he left his lady in Norfolk Street to mix gin sling for other admirers and felt no regret though four brother navvies were going to make a stunning night of it at the Salon de Seville
none	none	 dansant 
6199-48196-0019	train-other-500	at the bottom of Holborn Hill However he had his hopes that he might be back in time for some of that fun And Undy Scott was there
none	none	 He and Alaric had fraternized so greatly of late that the latter had 
6199-48196-0020	train-other-500	as a matter of course asked him to his wedding and missus Woodward had of course expressed her delight at receiving Alaric s friend
none	none	 Undy also was a pleasant fellow for a wedding party he was full of talk fond of ladies 
6199-48196-0021	train-other-500	being no whit abashed in his attendance on them by the remembrance of his bosom s mistress whom he had left let us hope happy in her far domestic retirement Undy Scott was a good man at a wedding and made himself specially agreeable on this occasion
6199-48196-0022	train-other-500	But the great glory of the day was the presence of Sir Gregory Hardlines It was a high honour considering all that rested on Sir Gregory s shoulders for so great a man to come all the way down to Hampton to see a clerk
6199-48196-0023	train-other-500	in the Weights and Measures married Cum tot sustineas et tanta negotia solus for we may call it solus Sir Warwick and mister Jobbles being sources of more plague than profit
6199-48196-0024	train-other-500	in carrying out your noble schemes while so many things are on your shoulders Sir Gregory while you are defending the Civil Service by your pen adorning it by your conduct perfecting it by new rules how could any man
6199-48196-0025	train-other-500	have had the face to ask you to a wedding Nevertheless Sir Gregory was there and did not lose the excellent opportunity which a speech at the breakfast table afforded him for expressing his opinion on the Civil Service of his country
6199-48196-0026	train-other-500	And so Gertrude Woodward became Gertrude Tudor and she and Alaric were whirled away by a post chaise and post boy done out with white bows to the Hampton Court station from thence they whisked up to London
6199-48196-0027	train-other-500	and then down to Dover and there we will leave them They were whisked away having first duly gone through the amount of badgering which the bride and bridegroom have to suffer at the wedding breakfast table
6199-48196-0028	train-other-500	They drank their own health in champagne Alaric made a speech in which he said he was quite unworthy of his present happiness and Gertrude picked up all the bijoux gold pencil cases and silver cream jugs
6199-48196-0029	train-other-500	which were thrown at her from all sides All the men made speeches and all the women laughed but the speech of the day was that celebrated one made by Sir Gregory in which he gave a sketch of Alaric Tudor
none	none	 as the beau ideal 
6199-48196-0030	train-other-500	of a clerk in the Civil Service His heart said he energetically is at the Weights and Measures but Gertrude looked at him as though she did not believe a word of it
6199-48196-0031	train-other-500	And so Alaric and Gertrude were whisked away and the wedding guests were left to look sheepish at each other and take themselves off as best they might Sir Gregory of course had important public business which precluded him from having the gratification
6199-48196-0032	train-other-500	of prolonging his stay at Hampton Charley got away in perfect time to enjoy whatever there might be to be enjoyed at the dancing saloon of Seville and Undy Scott returned to his club Then all was again quiet at Surbiton Cottage
6199-48196-0033	train-other-500	Captain Cuttwater who had perhaps drunk the bride s health once too often went to sleep Katie having taken off her fine clothes roamed about the house disconsolate and missus Woodward and Linda betook themselves to their needles
none	none	 The Tudors went to Brussels and were made welcome by the Belgian banker whose counters he had deserted so much to his own benefit and from thence to Paris and having been there long enough to buy a French bonnet and wonder at the enormity of French prices they returned to a small but comfortable house they had prepared for themselves in the neighbourhood of Westbourne Terrace 
6199-48196-0034	train-other-500	Previous to this Norman had been once and but once at Hampton and when there he had failed in being comfortable himself or in making the Woodwards so he could not revert to his old habits or sit or move or walk
6199-48196-0035	train-other-500	as though nothing special had happened since he had been last there He could not talk about Gertrude and he could not help talking of her By some closer packing among the ladies a room had now been prepared for him in the house
6199-48196-0036	train-other-500	even this upset him and brought to his mind all those unpleasant thoughts which he should have endeavoured to avoid
none	none	 He did not repeat his visit before the Tudors returned 
6199-48196-0037	train-other-500	and then for some time he was prevented from doing so by the movements of the Woodwards themselves missus Woodward paid a visit to her married daughter and when she returned Linda did the same And so for a while Norman was as it were
6199-48196-0038	train-other-500	divided from his old friends whereas Tudor as a matter of course was one of themselves It was only natural that missus Woodward should forgive Alaric and receive him to her bosom now that he was her son in law
6199-48196-0039	train-other-500	After all such ties as these avail more than any predilections more than any effort of judgement in the choice of the objects of our affections
none	none	 We associate with those with whom the tenor of life has thrown us and from habit we learn to love those with whom we are brought to associate CHAPTER XVII THE HONOURABLE missus VAL AND MISS GOLIGHTLY The first eighteen months of Gertrude s married life were not unhappy though like all persons entering on the realities of the world she found much to disappoint her At first her husband s society was sufficient for her and to give him his due he was not at first an inattentive husband Then came the baby bringing with him as first babies always should do a sort of second honeymoon of love and a renewal of those services which women so delight to receive from their bosoms lord She had of course made acquaintances since she had settled herself in London and had in her modest way done her little part in adding to the gaiety of the great metropolis In this respect indeed Alaric s commencement of life had somewhat frightened missus Woodward and the more prudent of his friends Grand as his official promotion had been his official income at the time of his marriage did not exceed Lsix hundred a year and though this was to be augmented occasionally till it reached Leight hundred yet even with this advantage it could hardly suffice for a man and his wife and a coming family to live in an expensive part of London and enable him to see his friends occasionally as the act of feeding one s acquaintance is now generally called Gertrude like most English girls of her age was at first so ignorant about money that she hardly knew whether Lsix hundred was or was not a sufficient income to justify their present mode of living but she soon found reason to suspect that her husband at any rate endeavoured to increase it by other means We say to suspect because he never spoke to her on the subject he never told her of Mary Janes and New Friendships or hinted that he had extensive money dealings in connexion with Undy Scott But it can be taken for granted that no husband can carry on such dealings long without some sort of cognizance on his wife s part as to what he is doing a woman who is not trusted by her lord may choose to remain in apparent darkness may abstain from questions and may consider it either her duty or her interest to assume an ignorance as to her husband s affairs but the partner of one s bed and board the minister who soothes one s headaches and makes one s tea and looks after one s linen can t but have the means of guessing the thoughts which occupy her companion s mind and occasionally darken his brow Much of Gertrude s society had consisted of that into which Alaric was thrown by his friendship with Undy Scott There was a brother of Undy s living in town one Valentine Scott a captain in a cavalry regiment and whose wife was by no means of that delightfully retiring disposition evinced by Undy s better half The honorable missus Valentine or missus Val Scott as she was commonly called was a very pushing woman and pushed herself into a prominent place among Gertrude s friends She had been the widow of Jonathan Golightly esquire umquhile sheriff of the city of London and stockbroker and when she gave herself and her jointure up to Captain Val she also brought with her to enliven the house a daughter Clementina the only remaining pledge of her love for the stockbroker When Val Scott entered the world his father s precepts as to the purposes of matrimony were deeply graven on his heart He was the best looking of the family and except Undy the youngest He had not Undy s sharpness his talent for public matters or his aptitude for the higher branches of the Civil Service but he had wit to wear his sash and epaulets with an easy grace and to captivate the heart person and some portion of the purse of the Widow Golightly The lady was ten years older than the gentleman but then she had a thousand a year and to make matters more pleasant the beauteous Clementina had a fortune of her own Under these circumstances the marriage had been contracted without any deceit or attempt at deceit by either party Val wanted an income and the sheriff s widow wanted the utmost amount of social consideration which her not very extensive means would purchase for her On the whole the two parties to the transaction were contented with their bargain missus Val it is true kept her income very much in her own hands but still she consented to pay Val s tailors bills and it is something for a man to have bed and board found him for nothing It is true again the lady did not find that the noble blood of her husband gave her an immediate right of entry into the best houses in London but it did bring her into some sort of contact with some few people of rank and fame and being a sensible woman she had not been unreasonable in her expectations When she had got what she could from her husband in this particular she did not trouble him much further He delighted in the Rag and there spent the most of his time happily she delighted in what she called the charms of society and as society expanded itself before her she was also we must suppose happy She soon perceived that more in her immediate line was to be obtained from Undy than from her own member of the Gaberlunzie family and hence had sprung up her intimacy with missus Tudor It cannot be said that Gertrude was very fond of the Honourable missus Val nor even of her daughter Clementina Golightly who was more of her own age These people had become her friends from the force of circumstances and not from predilection To tell the truth missus Val who had in her day encountered with much patience a good deal of snubbing and who had had to be thankful when she was patronized now felt that her day for being a great lady had come and that it behoved her to patronize others She tried her hand upon Gertrude and found the practice so congenial to her spirits so pleasantly stimulating so well adapted to afford a gratifying compensation for her former humility that she continued to give up a good deal of her time to No five Albany Row Westbourne Terrace at which house the Tudors resided The young bride was not exactly the woman to submit quietly to patronage from any missus Val however honourable she might be but for a while Gertrude hardly knew what it meant and at her first outset the natural modesty of youth and her inexperience in her new position made her unwilling to take offence and unequal to rebellion By degrees however this feeling of humility wore off she began to be aware of the assumed superiority of missus Val s friendship and by the time that their mutual affection was of a year s standing Gertrude had determined in a quiet way without saying anything to anybody to put herself on a footing of more perfect equality with the Honourable missus Val Clementina Golightly was in the common parlance of a large portion of mankind a doosed fine gal She stood five feet six and stood very well on very good legs but with rather large feet She was as straight as a grenadier and had it been her fate to carry a milk pail she would have carried it to perfection Instead of this however she was permitted to expend an equal amount of energy in every variation of waltz and polka that the ingenuity of the dancing professors of the age has been able to produce Waltzes and polkas suited her admirably for she was gifted with excellent lungs and perfect powers of breathing and she had not much delight in prolonged conversation Her fault if she had one was a predilection for flirting but she did her flirtations in a silent sort of way much as we may suppose the fishes do theirs whose amours we may presume to consist in swimming through their cool element in close contiguity with each other A feast of reason and a flow of soul were not the charms by which Clementina Golightly essayed to keep her admirers spell bound at her feet To whirl rapidly round a room at the rate of ten miles an hour with her right hand outstretched in the grasp of her partner s and to know that she was tightly buoyed up like a horse by a bearing rein by his other hand behind her back was for her sufficient To do this as she did do it without ever crying for mercy with no slackness of breath and apparently without distress must have taken as much training as a horse gets for a race But the training had in nowise injured her and now having gone through her gallops and run all her heats for three successive seasons she was still sound of wind and limb and fit to run at any moment when called upon We have said nothing about the face of the beauteous Clementina and indeed nothing can be said about it There was no feature in it with which a man could have any right to find fault that she was a doosed fine girl was a fact generally admitted but nevertheless you might look at her for four hours consecutively on a Monday evening and yet on Tuesday you would not know her She had hair which was brownish and sufficiently silky and which she wore as all other such girls do propped out on each side of her face by thick round velvet pads which when the waltzing pace became exhilarating occasionally showed themselves looking greasy She had a pair of eyes set straight in her head faultless in form and perfectly inexpressive She had a nose equally straight but perhaps a little too coarse in dimensions She had a mouth not over large with two thin lips and small whitish teeth and she had a chin equal in contour to the rest of her face but on which Venus had not deigned to set a dimple Nature might have defied a French passport officer to give a description of her by which even her own mother or a detective policeman might have recognized her When to the above list of attractions it is added that Clementina Golightly had Ltwenty thousand of her own and a reversionary interest in her mother s jointure it may be imagined that she did not want for good winded cavaliers to bear her up behind and whirl around with her with outstretched hands I am not going to stay a moment my dear said missus Val seating herself on Gertrude s sofa having rushed up almost unannounced into the drawing room followed by Clementina indeed Lady Howlaway is waiting for me this moment but I must settle with you about the June flower show Oh thank you missus Scott don t trouble yourself about me said Gertrude I don t think I shall go Oh nonsense my dear of course you ll go it s the show of the year and the Grand duke is to be there baby is all right now you know I must not hear of your not going All the same I fear I must decline said Gertrude I think I shall be at Hampton Oh nonsense my dear of course you must show yourself People will say all manner of things else Clementina has promised to meet Victoire Jaquetanapes there and a party of French people people of the very highest ton You ll be delighted my dear M Jaquetanapes is the most delicious polkist you ever met said Clementina He has got a new back step that will quite amaze you As Gertrude in her present condition was not much given to polkas this temptation did not have great effect Oh you must come of course my dear and pray let me recommend you to go to Madame Bosconi for your bonnet she has such darling little ducks and as cheap as dirt But I want you to arrange about the carriage you can do that with mister Tudor and I can settle with you afterwards Captain Scott won t go of course but I have no doubt Undecimus and mister Tudor will come later and bring us home we can manage very well with the one carriage In spite of her thousand a year the Honourable missus Val was not ashamed to look after the pounds shillings and pence And so having made her arrangements missus Val took herself off hurrying to appease the anger of Lady Howlaway and followed by Clementina who since her little outburst as to the new back step of M Jaquetanapes had not taken much part in the conversation Flower shows are a great resource for the missus Scotts of London life They are open to ladies who cannot quite penetrate the inner sancta of fashionable life and yet they are frequented by those to whom those sancta are everyday household walks There at least the missus Scotts of the outer world can show themselves in close contiguity and on equal terms with the missus Scotts of the inner world And then who is to know the difference If also one is an Honourable missus Scott and can contrive to appear as such in the next day s Morning Post may not one fairly boast that the ends of society have been attained Where is the citadel How is one to know when one has taken it Gertrude could not be quite so defiant with her friends as she would have wished to have been as they were borne with and encouraged by her husband Of Undy s wife Alaric saw nothing and heard little but it suited Undy to make use of his sister in law s house and it suited Alaric to be intimate with Undy s sister in law Moreover had not Clementina Golightly Ltwenty thousand and was she not a doosed fine girl This was nothing to Alaric now and might not be considered to be much to Undy But that far seeing acute financier knew that there were other means of handling a lady s money than that of marrying her He could not at present acquire a second fortune in that way but he might perhaps acquire the management of this Ltwenty thousand if he could provide the lady with a husband of the proper temperament Undy Scott did not want to appropriate Miss Golightly s fortune he only wanted to have the management of it Looking round among his acquaintance for a fitting parti for the sweet Clementina his mind after much consideration settled upon Charley Tudor There were many young men much nearer and dearer to Undy than Charley who might be equally desirous of so great a prize but he could think of none over whom he might probably exercise so direct a control Charley was a handsome gay fellow and waltzed au ravir he might therefore without difficulty make his way with the fair Clementina He was distressingly poor and would therefore certainly jump at an heiress he was delightfully thoughtless and easy of leading and therefore the money when in his hands might probably be manageable He was also Alaric s cousin and therefore acceptable Undy did not exactly open his mind to Alaric Tudor in this matter Alaric s education was going on rapidly but his mind had not yet received with sufficient tenacity those principles of philosophy which would enable him to look at this scheme in its proper light He had already learnt the great utility one may almost say the necessity of having a command of money he was beginning also to perceive that money was a thing not to be judged of by the ordinary rules which govern a man s conduct In other matters it behoves a gentleman to be open above board liberal and true good natured generous confiding self denying doing unto others as he would wish that others should do unto him but in the acquirement and use of money that is its use with the object of acquiring more its use in the usurer s sense his practice should be exactly the reverse he should be close secret exacting given to concealment not over troubled by scruples suspicious without sympathies self devoted and always doing unto others exactly that which he is on his guard to prevent others from doing unto him viz making money by them So much Alaric had learnt and had been no inapt scholar But he had not yet appreciated the full value of the latitude allowed by the genius of the present age to men who deal successfully in money He had as we have seen acknowledged to himself that a sportsman may return from the field with his legs and feet a little muddy but he did not yet know how deep a man may wallow in the mire how thoroughly he may besmear himself from head to foot in the blackest foulest mud and yet be received an honoured guest by ladies gay and noble lords if only his bag be sufficiently full Rem quocunque modo rem The remainder of the passage was doubtless applicable to former times but now is hardly worth repeating As Alaric s stomach was not yet quite suited for strong food Undy fitted this matter to his friend s still juvenile capacities There was an heiress a doosed fine girl as Undy insisted laying peculiar strength on the word of emphasis with Ltwenty thousand and there was Charley Tudor a devilish decent fellow without a rap Why not bring them together This would only be a mark of true friendship on the part of Undy and on Alaric s part it would be no more than one cousin would be bound to do for another Looking at it in this light Alaric saw nothing in the matter which could interfere with his quiet conscience I ll do what I can said Undy missus Val is inclined to have a way of her own in most things but if anybody can lead her I can Charley must take care that Val himself doesn t take his part that s all If he interferes it would be all up with us And thus Alaric intent mainly on the interest of his cousin and actuated perhaps a little by the feeling that a rich cousin would be more serviceable than a poor one set himself to work in connexion with Undy Scott to make prey of Clementina Golightly s Ltwenty thousand But if Undy had no difficulty in securing the company operation of Alaric in this matter Alaric by no means found it equally easy to secure the company operation of Charley Charley Tudor had not yet learnt to look upon himself as a marketable animal worth a certain sum of money in consequence of such property in good appearance address c as God had been good enough to endow him withal He daily felt the depth and disagreeable results of his own poverty and not unfrequently when specially short of the Queen s medium sighed for some of those thousands and tens of thousands with which men s mouths are so glibly full He had often tried to calculate what would be his feelings if some eccentric good natured old stranger should leave him say five thousand a year he had often walked about the street with his hands in his empty pockets building delicious castles in the air and doing the most munificent actions imaginable with his newly acquired wealth as all men in such circumstances do relieving distress rewarding virtue and making handsome presents to all his friends and especially to missus Woodward So far Charley was not guiltless of coveting wealth but he had never for a moment thought of realizing his dreams by means of his personal attractions It had never occurred to him that any girl having money could think it worth her while to marry him He navvy as he was with his infernal friends and pot house love with his debts and idleness and low associations with his saloons of Seville his Elysium in Fleet Street and his Paradise near the Surrey Gardens had hitherto thought little enough of his own attractions No kind father had taught him that he was worth Lten thousand in any market in the world When he had dreamt of money he had never dreamt of it as accruing to him in return for any value or worth which he had inherent in himself Even in his lighter moments he had no such conceit and at those periods few and far between in which he did think seriously Of the world at large this special method of escaping from his difficulties never once presented itself to his mind When therefore Alaric first spoke to him of marrying Ltwenty thousand and Clementina Golightly his surprise was unbounded Ltwenty thousand said Alaric and a doosed fine girl you know and he also laid great stress on the latter part of the offer knowing how inflammable was Charley s heart and at the same time how little mercenary was his mind But Charley was not only surprised at the proposed arrangement but apparently also unwilling to enter into it He argued that in the first place no girl in her senses would accept him To this Alaric replied that as Clementina had not much sense to speak of that objection might fall to the ground Then Charley expressed an idea that Miss Golightly s friends might probably object when they learnt what were the exact pecuniary resources of the expectant husband to which Alaric argued that the circumstances of the case were very lucky inasmuch as some of Clementina s natural friends were already prepossessed in favour of such an arrangement Driven thus from two of his strongholds Charley in the most modest of voices in a voice one may say quite shamefaced and conscious of its master s weakness suggested that he was not quite sure that at the present moment he was very much in love with the lady in question Alaric had married for love and was not two years married yet had his education so far progressed in that short period as to enable him to laugh at such an objection Then my dear fellow what the deuce do you mean to do with yourself You ll certainly go to the dogs Charley had an idea that he certainly should and also had an idea that Miss Clementina and her Ltwenty thousand might not improbably go in the same direction if he had anything to do with them And as for loving her continued Alaric that s all my eye Love is a luxury which none but the rich or the poor can afford We middle class paupers who are born with good coats on our backs but empty purses can have nothing to do with it But you married for love Alaric My marriage was not a very prudent one and should not be taken as an example And then I did get some fortune with my wife and what is more I was not so fearfully in want of it as you are Charley acknowledged the truth of this said that he would think of the matrimonial project and promised at any rate to call on Clementina on an early occasion He had already made her acquaintance had already danced with her and certainly could not take upon himself to deny that she was a doosed fine girl But Charley had reasons of his own reasons which he could not make known to Alaric for not thinking much of or trusting much to Miss Golightly s fortune In the first place he regarded marriage on such a grand scale as that now suggested as a ceremony which must take a long time to adjust the wooing of a lady with so many charms could not be carried on as might be the wooing of a chambermaid or a farmer s daughter It must take months at least to conciliate the friends of so rich an heiress and months at the end of them to prepare the wedding gala But Charley could not wait for months before one month was over he would probably be laid up in some vile limbo an unfortunate poor prisoner at the suit of an iron hearted tailor At this very moment of Alaric s proposition at this instant when he found himself talking with so much coolness of the expedience or inexpedience of appropriating to his own purpose a slight trifle of Ltwenty thousand he was in dire strait as to money difficulties He had lately that is within the last twelve months made acquaintance with an interesting gentleman named Jabesh M Ruen mister Jabesh M Ruen was in the habit of relieving the distresses of such impoverished young gentlemen as Charley Tudor and though he did this with every assurance of philanthropic regard though in doing so he only made one stipulation Pray be punctual mister Tudor now pray do be punctual sir and you may always count on me nevertheless in spite of all his goodness mister M Ruen s young friends seldom continued to hold their heads well up over the world s waters On the morning after this conversation with Alaric Charley intended to call on his esteemed old friend Many were the morning calls he did make many were the weary useless aimless walks which he took to that little street at the back of Mecklenburg Square with the fond hope of getting some relief from mister M Ruen and many also were the calls the return visits as it were which mister M Ruen made at the Internal Navigation and numerous were the whispers which he would there whisper into the ears of the young clerk mister Snape the while sitting by with a sweet unconscious look as though he firmly believed mister M Ruen to be Charley s maternal uncle And then too Charley had other difficulties which in his mind presented great obstacles to the Golightly scheme though Alaric would have thought little of them and Undy nothing What was he to do with his Norfolk Street lady his barmaid houri his Norah Geraghty to whom he had sworn all manner of undying love and for whom in some sort of fashion he really had an affection And Norah was not a light of love whom it was as easy to lay down as to pick up Charley had sworn to love her and she had sworn to love Charley and to give her her due she had kept her word to him Though her life rendered necessary a sort of daily or rather nightly flirtation with various male comers as indeed for the matter of that did also the life of Miss Clementina Golightly yet she had in her way been true to her lover She had been true to him and Charley did not doubt her and in a sort of low way respected her though it was but a dissipated and debauched respect There had even been talk between them of marriage and who can say what in his softer moments when his brain had been too weak or the toddy too strong Charley may not have promised And there was yet another objection to Miss Golightly one even more difficult of mention one on which Charley felt himself more absolutely constrained to silence than even either of the other two He was sufficiently disinclined to speak to his cousin Alaric as to the merits either of mister Jabesh M Ruen or of Miss Geraghty but he could have been eloquent on either rather than whisper a word as to the third person who stood between him and the Ltwenty thousand The school in which Charley now lived that of the infernal navvies had taught him to laugh at romance but it had not been so successful in quelling the early feelings of his youth in drying up the fountains of poetry within him as had been the case with his cousin in that other school in which he had been a scholar Charley was a dissipated dissolute rake and in some sense had degraded himself but he had still this chance of safety on his side that he himself reprobated his own sins He dreamt of other things and a better life He made visions to himself of a sweet home and a sweeter sweetest lovely wife a love whose hair should not be redolent of smoke nor her hands reeking with gin nor her services at the demand of every libertine who wanted a screw of tobacco or a glass of cold without He had made such a vision to himself and the angel with which he had filled it was not a creature of his imagination She who was to reign in this ethereal paradise this happy home far as the poles away from Norfolk Street was a living being in the sublunar globe present sometimes to Charley s eyes and now so often present to his thoughts and yet she was but a child and as ignorant that she had ever touched a lover s heart by her childish charms as though she had been a baby After all even on Charley s part it was but a vision He never really thought that his young inamorata would or could be to him a real true heart s companion returning his love with the double love of a woman watching his health curing his vices and making the sweet things of the world a living reality around him This love of his was but a vision but not the less on that account did it interfere with his cousin Alaric s proposition in reference to Miss Clementina Golightly That other love also that squalid love of his was in truth no vision was a stern palpable reality very difficult to get rid of and one which he often thought to himself would very probably swallow up that other love and drive his sweet dream far away into utter darkness and dim chaotic space But at any rate it was clear that there was no room in his heart for the beauteous Clementina doosed fine girl as she undoubtedly was and serviceable as the Ltwenty thousand most certainly would have been CHAPTER XVIII A DAY WITH ONE OF THE NAVVIES MORNING On the morning after this conversation with Alaric Charley left his lodgings with a heavy heart and wended his way towards Mecklenburg Square At the corner of Davies Street he got an omnibus which for fourpence took him to one of the little alleys near Gray s Inn and there he got down and threading the well known locality through Bedford Place and across Theobald s Road soon found himself at the door of his generous patron Oh how he hated the house how he hated the blear eyed cross grained dirty impudent fish fag of an old woman who opened the door for him how he hated mister Jabesh M Ruen to whom he now came a supplicant for assistance and how above all he hated himself for being there He was shown into mister M Ruen s little front parlour where he had to wait for fifteen minutes while his patron made such a breakfast as generally falls to the lot of such men We can imagine the rancid butter the stale befingered bread the ha porth of sky blue milk the tea innocent of China s wrongs and the soiled cloth mister M Ruen always did keep Charley waiting fifteen minutes and so he was no whit surprised the doing so was a part of the tremendous interest which the wretched old usurer received for his driblets of money There was not a bit of furniture in the room on which Charley had not speculated till speculation could go no further the old escritoire or secretaire which mister M Ruen always opened the moment he came into the room the rickety Pembroke table covered with dirty papers which stood in the middle of it the horsehair bottomed chairs on which Charley declined to sit down unless he had on his thickest winter trousers so perpendicular had become some atoms on the surface which when new had no doubt been horizontal the ornaments on the chimney broken bits of filthy crockery full of wisps of paper with a china duck without a tail and a dog to correspond without a head the pictures against the wall with their tarnished dingy frames and cracked glasses representing three of the Seasons how the fourth had gone before its time to its final bourne by an unhappy chance mister M Ruen had once explained to Charley while endeavouring to make his young customer take the other three as a good value for Lseven tens in arranging a little transaction the total amount of which did not exceed Lfifteen In that instance however Charley who had already dabbled somewhat deeply in dressing cases utterly refused to trade in the articles produced Charley stood with his back to the dog and duck facing Winter with Spring on his right and Autumn on his left it was well that Summer was gone no summer could have shed light on that miserable chamber He knew that he would have to wait and was not therefore impatient and at the end of fifteen minutes mister M Ruen shuffled into the room in his slippers He was a little man with thin grey hair which stood upright from his narrow head what his age might have been it was impossible to guess he was wizened and dry and grey but still active enough on his legs when he had exchanged his slippers for his shoes and as keen in all his senses as though years could never tell upon him He always wore round his neck a stiff starched deep white handkerchief not fastened with a bow in front the ends being tucked in so as to be invisible This cravat not only covered his throat but his chin also so that his head seemed to grow forth from it without the aid of any neck and he had a trick of turning his face round within it an inch or two to the right or to the left in a manner which seemed to indicate that his cranium was loose and might be removed at pleasure He shuffled into the room where Charley was standing with little short quick steps and putting out his hand just touched that of his customer by way of going through the usual process of greeting Some short statement must be made of Charley s money dealings with mister M Ruen up to this period About two years back a tailor had an over due bill of his for Ltwenty of which he was unable to obtain payment and being unwilling to go to law or perhaps being himself in mister M Ruen s power he passed this bill to that worthy gentleman what amount of consideration he got for it it matters not now to inquire mister M Ruen very shortly afterwards presented himself at the Internal Navigation and introduced himself to our hero He did this with none of the overbearing harshness of the ordinary dun or the short caustic decision of a creditor determined to resort to the utmost severity of the law He turned his head about and smiled and just showed the end of the bill peeping out from among a parcel of others begged mister Tudor to be punctual he would only ask him to be punctual and would in such case do anything for him and ended his visit by making an appointment to meet Charley in the little street behind Mecklenburg Square Charley kept his appointment and came away from mister M Ruen s with a well contented mind He had it is true left Lfive behind him and had also left the bill still entire but he had obtained a promise of unlimited assistance from the good natured gentleman and had also received instructions how he was to get a brother clerk to draw a bill how he was to accept it himself and how his patron was to discount it for him paying him real gold out of the Bank of England in exchange for his worthless signature Charley stepped lighter on the ground as he left mister M Ruen s house on that eventful morning than he had done for many a day There was something delightful in the feeling that he could make money of his name in this way as great bankers do of theirs by putting it at the bottom of a scrap of paper He experienced a sort of pride too in having achieved so respectable a position in the race of ruin which he was running as to have dealings with a bill discounter He felt that he was putting himself on a par with great men and rising above the low level of the infernal navvies mister M Ruen had pulled the bill out of a heap of bills which he always carried in his huge pocket book and showed to Charley the name of an impoverished Irish peer on the back of it and the sight of that name had made Charley quite in love with rum He already felt that he was almost hand and glove with Lord Mount Coffeehouse for it was a descendant of the nobleman so celebrated in song Only be punctual mister Tudor only be punctual and I will do anything for you mister M Ruen had said as Charley left the house Charley however never had been punctual and yet his dealings with mister M Ruen had gone on from that day to this What absolute money he had ever received into his hand he could not now have said but it was very little probably not amounting in all to Lfifty Yet he had already paid during the two years more than double that sum to this sharp clawed vulture and still owed him the amounts of more bills than he could number Indeed he had kept no account of these double fanged little documents he had signed them whenever told to do so and had even been so preposterously foolish as to sign them in blank All he knew was that at the beginning of every quarter mister M Ruen got nearly the half of his little modicum of salary and that towards the middle of it he usually contrived to obtain an advance of some small some very small sum and that when doing so he always put his hand to a fresh bit of paper He was beginning to be heartily sick of the bill discounter His intimacy with the lord had not yet commenced nor had he experienced any of the delights which he had expected to accrue to him from the higher tone of extravagance in which he entered when he made mister M Ruen s acquaintance And then the horrid fatal waste of time which he incurred in pursuit of the few pounds which he occasionally obtained filled even his heart with a sort of despair Morning after morning he would wait in that hated room and then day after day at two o clock he would attend the usurer s city haunt and generally all in vain The patience of mister Snape was giving way and the discipline even of the Internal Navigation felt itself outraged And now Charley stood once more in that dingy little front parlour in which he had never yet seen a fire and once more mister Jabesh M Ruen shuffled into the room in his big cravat and dirty loose slippers How d ye do mister Tudor how d ye do I hope you have brought a little of this with you and Jabesh opened out his left hand and tapped the palm of it with the middle finger of his right by way of showing that he expected some money not that he did expect any cormorant that he was this was not the period of the quarter in which he ever got money from his customer Indeed I have not mister M Ruen but I positively must get some Oh oh oh oh mister Tudor mister Tudor How can we go on if you are so unpunctual Now I would do anything for you if you would only be punctual Oh bother about that you know your own game well enough Be punctual mister Tudor only be punctual and we shall be all right and so you have not got any of this and Jabesh went through the tapping again Not a doit said Charley but I shall be up the spout altogether if you don t do something to help me But you are so unpunctual mister Tudor Oh d it you ll make me sick if you say that again What else do you live by but that But I positively must have some money from you to day If not I am done for I don t think I can mister Tudor not to day mister Tudor some other day say this day month that is if you ll be punctual This day month no but this very day mister M Ruen why you got Leighteen from me when I received my last salary and I have not had a shilling back since But you are so unpunctual mister Tudor and Jabesh twisted his head backwards and forwards within his cravat rubbing his chin with the interior starch Well then I ll tell you what it is said Charley I ll be shot if you get a shilling from me on the first of October and you may sell me up as quick as you please If I don t give a history of your business that will surprise some people my name isn t Tudor Ha ha ha laughed mister M Ruen with a soft quiet laugh Well really mister Tudor I would do more for you than any other young man that I know if you were only a little more punctual How much is it you want now Lfifteen or Lten Lten will do Ten pounds said Jabesh as though Charley had asked for ten thousand ten pounds if two or three would do But two or three won t do And whose name will you bring Whose name why Scatterall s to be sure Now Scatterall was one of the navvies and from him mister M Ruen had not yet succeeded in extracting one farthing though he had his name on a volume of Charley s bills Scatterall I don t like mister Scatterall said Jabesh he is very dissipated and the most unpunctual young man I ever met you really must get some one else mister Tudor you really must Oh that s nonsense Scatterall is as good as anybody I couldn t ask any of the other fellows they are such a low set But mister Scatterall is so unpunctual There s your cousin mister Alaric Tudor My cousin Alaric Oh nonsense you don t suppose I d ask him to do such a thing You might as well tell me to go to my father Or that other gentleman you live with mister Norman He is a most punctual gentleman Bring me his name and I ll let you have Lten or Leight I ll let you have Leight at once I dare say you will mister M Ruen or Leighty and be only too happy to give it me But you know that is out of the question Now I won t wait any longer just give me an answer to this if I come to you in the city will you let me have some money to day If you won t why I must go elsewhere that s all The interview ended by an appointment being made for another meeting to come off at two p m that day at the Banks of Jordan a public house in Sweeting s Alley as well known to Charley as the little front parlour of mister M Ruen s house Bring the bill stamp with you mister Tudor said Jabesh by way of a last parting word of counsel and let mister Scatterall sign it that is if it must be mister Scatterall but I wish you would bring your cousin s name Nonsense Well then bring it signed but I ll fill it you young fellows understand nothing of filling in a bill properly And then taking his leave the infernal navvy hurried off and reached his office in Somerset House at a quarter past eleven o clock As he walked along he bought the bit of stamped paper on which his friend Scatterall was to write his name When he reached the office he found that a great commotion was going on mister Snape was standing up at his desk and the first word which greeted Charley s ears was an intimation from that gentleman that mister Oldeschole had desired that mister Tudor when he arrived should be instructed to attend in the board room Very well said Charley in a tone of great indifference with all my heart I rather like seeing Oldeschole now and then But he mustn t keep me long for I have to meet my grandmother at Islington at two o clock and Charley having hung up his hat prepared to walk off to the Secretary s room You ll be good enough to wait a few minutes mister Tudor said Snape Another gentleman is with mister Oldeschole at present You will be good enough to sit down and go on with the Kennett and Avon lock entries till mister Oldeschole is ready to see you Charley sat down at his desk opposite to his friend Scatterall I hope mister Snape you had a pleasant meeting at evening prayers yesterday said he with a tone of extreme interest You had better mind the lock entries at present mister Tudor they are greatly in arrear And the evening meetings are docketed up as close as wax I suppose What the deuce is in the wind Dick mister Scatterall s Christian name was Richard Where s Corkscrew mister Corkscrew was also a navvy and was one of those to whom Charley had specially alluded when he spoke of the low set Oh here s a regular go said Scatterall It s all up with Corkscrew I believe Why what s the cheese now Oh it s all about some pork chops which Screwy had for supper last night Screwy was a name of love which among his brother navvies was given to mister Corkscrew mister Snape seems to think they did not agree with him Pork chops in July exclaimed Charley Poor Screwy forgot the time of year said another navvy he ought to have called it lamb and grass And then the story was told On the preceding afternoon mister Corkscrew had been subjected to the dire temptation of a boating party to the Eel pie Island for the following day and a dinner thereon There were to be at the feast no less than four and twenty jolly souls and it was intimated to mister Corkscrew that as no soul was esteemed to be more jolly than his own the party would be considered as very imperfect unless he could join it Asking for a day s leave mister Corkscrew knew to be out of the question he had already taken too many without asking He was therefore driven to take another in the same way and had to look about for some excuse which might support him in his difficulty An excuse it must be not only new but very valid one so strong that it could not be overset one so well avouched that it could not be doubted Accordingly after mature consideration he sat down after leaving his office and wrote the following letter before he started on an evening cruising expedition with some others of the party to prepare for the next day s festivities Thursday morning July one hundred eighty five MY DEAR SIR I write from my bed where I am suffering a most tremendous indiggestion last night I eat a stunning supper off pork chopps and never remembered that pork chopps always does disagree with me but I was very indiscrete and am now teetotally unable to rise my throbing head from off my pillar I have took four blu pills and some salts and sena plenty of that and shall be the thing to morrow morning no doubt just at present I feel just as if I had a mill stone inside my stomac Pray be so kind as to make it all right with mister Oldeschole and believe me to remain Your faithful and obedient servant VERAX CORKSCREW Thomas Snape esquire c Internal Navigation Office Somerset House Having composed this letter of excuse and not intending to return to his lodgings that evening he had to make provision for its safely reaching the hands of mister Snape in due time on the following morning This he did by giving it to the boy who came to clean the lodging house boots with sundry injunctions that if he did not deliver it at the office by ten o clock on the following morning the sixpence accruing to him would never be paid mister Corkscrew however said nothing as to the letter not being delivered before ten the next morning and as other business took the boy along the Strand the same evening he saw no reason why he should not then execute his commission He accordingly did so and duly delivered the letter into the hands of a servant girl who was cleaning the passages of the office Fortune on this occasion was blind to the merits of mister Corkscrew and threw him over most unmercifully It so happened that mister Snape had been summoned to an evening conference with mister Oldeschole and the other pundits of the office to discuss with them or rather to hear discussed some measure which they began to think it necessary to introduce for amending the discipline of the department We are getting a bad name whether we deserve it or not said mister Oldeschole That fellow Hardlines has put us into his blue book and now there s an article in the Times Just at this moment a messenger brought in to mister Snape the unfortunate letter of which we have given a copy What s that said mister Oldeschole A note from mister Corkscrew sir said Snape He s the worst of the whole lot said mister Oldeschole He is very bad said Snape but I rather think that perhaps sir mister Tudor is the worst of all Well I don t know said the Secretary muttering sotto voce to the Under Secretary while mister Snape read the letter Tudor at any rate is a gentleman mister Snape read the letter and his face grew very long There was a sort of sneaking civility about Corkscrew not prevalent indeed at all times but which chiefly showed itself when he and mister Snape were alone together which somewhat endeared him to the elder clerk He would have screened the sinner had he had either the necessary presence of mind or the necessary pluck But he had neither He did not know how to account for the letter but by the truth and he feared to conceal so flagrant a breach of discipline at the moment of the present discussion Things at any rate so turned out that mister Corkscrew s letter was read in full conclave in the board room of the office just as he was describing the excellence of his manoeuvre with great glee to four or five other jolly souls at the Magpie and Stump At first it was impossible to prevent a fit of laughter in which even mister Snape joined but very shortly the laughter gave way to the serious considerations to which such an epistle was sure to give rise at such a moment What if Sir Gregory Hardlines should get hold of it and put it into his blue book What if the Times should print it and send it over the whole world accompanied by a few of its most venomous touches to the eternal disgrace of the Internal Navigation and probably utter annihilation of mister Oldeschole s official career An example must be made Yes an example must be made Messengers were sent off scouring the town for mister Corkscrew and about midnight he was found still true to the Magpie and Stump but hardly in condition to understand the misfortune which had befallen him So much as this however did make itself manifest to him that he must by no means join his jolly souled brethren at the Eel pie Island and that he must be at his office punctually at ten o clock the next morning if he had any intention of saving himself from dismissal When Charley arrived at his office mister Corkscrew was still with the authorities and Charley s turn was to come next Charley was rather a favourite with mister Oldeschole having been appointed by himself at the instance of mister Oldeschole s great friend Sir Gilbert de Salop and he was moreover the best looking of the whole lot of navvies but he was no favourite with mister Snape Poor Screwy it will be all up with him said Charley He might just as well have gone on with his party and had his fun out It will I imagine be necessary to make more than one example mister Tudor said mister Snape with a voice of utmost severity A a a men said Charley If everything else fails I think I ll go into the green line You couldn t give me a helping hand could you mister Snape There was a rumour afloat in the office that mister Snape s wife held some little interest in a small greengrocer s establishment mister Tudor to attend in the board room immediately said a fat messenger who opened the door wide with a start and then stood with it in his hand while he delivered the message All right said Charley I ll tumble up and be with them in ten seconds and then collecting together a large bundle of the arrears of the Kennett and Avon lock entries being just as much as he could carry he took the disordered papers and placed them on mister Snape s desk exactly over the paper on which he was writing and immediately under his nose mister Tudor mister Tudor said Snape As I am to tear myself away from you mister Snape it is better that I should hand over these valuable documents to your safe keeping There they are mister Snape pray see that you have got them all and so saying he left the room to attend to the high behests of mister Oldeschole As he went along the passages he met Verax Corkscrew returning from his interview Well Screwy said he and how fares it with you Pork chops are bad things in summer ain t they It s all U P said Corkscrew almost crying I m to go down to the bottom and I m to stay at the office till seven o clock every day for a month and old Foolscap says he ll ship me the next time I m absent half an hour without leave Oh is that all said Charley If that s all you get for pork chops and senna I m all right I shouldn t wonder if I did not get promoted and so he went in to his interview What was the nature of the advice given him what amount of caution he was called on to endure need not here be exactly specified We all know with how light a rod a father chastises the son he loves let Solomon have given what counsel he may to the contrary Charley in spite of his manifold sins was a favourite and he came forth from the board room an unscathed man In fact he had been promoted as he had surmised seeing that Corkscrew who had been his senior was now his junior He came forth unscathed and walking with an easy air into his room put his hat on his head and told his brother clerks that he should be there to morrow morning at ten or at any rate soon after And where are you going now mister Tudor said Snape To meet my grandmother at Islington if you please sir said Charley I have permission from mister Oldeschole to attend upon her for the rest of the day perhaps you would like to ask him And so saying he went off to his appointment with mister M Ruen at the Banks of Jordan CHAPTER XIX A DAY WITH ONE OF THE NAVVIES AFTERNOON The Banks of Jordan was a public house in the city which from its appearance did not seem to do a very thriving trade but as it was carried on from year to year in the same dull monotonous dead alive sort of fashion it must be surmised that some one found an interest in keeping it open Charley when he entered the door punctually at two o clock saw that it was as usual nearly deserted One long lanky middle aged man seedy as to his outward vestments and melancholy in countenance sat at one of the tables But he was doing very little good for the establishment he had no refreshment of any kind before him and was intent only on a dingy pocket book in which he was making entries with a pencil You enter the Banks of Jordan by two folding doors in a corner of a very narrow alley behind the Exchange As you go in you observe on your left a little glass partition something like a large cage inside which in a bar are four or five untempting looking bottles and also inside the cage on a chair is to be seen a quiet looking female who is invariably engaged in the manufacture of some white article of inward clothing Anything less like the flashy dressed bar maidens of the western gin palaces it would be difficult to imagine To this encaged sempstress no one ever speaks unless it be to give a rare order for a mutton chop or pint of stout And even for this she hardly stays her sewing for a moment but touches a small bell and the ancient waiter who never shows himself but when called for and who is the only other inhabitant of the place ever visible receives the order from her through an open pane in the cage as quietly as she received it from her customer The floor of the single square room of the establishment is sanded and the tables are ranged round the walls each table being fixed to the floor and placed within wooden partitions by which the occupier is screened from any inquiring eyes on either side Such was mister Jabesh M Ruen s house of call in the city and of many a mutton chop and many a pint of stout had Charley partaken there while waiting for the man of money To him it seemed to be inexcusable to sit down in a public inn and call for nothing he perceived however that the large majority of the frequenters of the Banks of Jordan so conducted themselves He was sufficiently accustomed to the place to know how to give his orders without troubling that diligent barmaid and had done so about ten minutes when Jabesh more punctual than usual entered the place This Charley regarded as a promising sign of forthcoming cash It very frequently happened that he waited there an hour and that after all Jabesh would not come and then the morning visit to Mecklenburg Square had to be made again and so poor Charley s time or rather the time of his poor office was cut up wasted and destroyed A mutton chop said mister M Ruen looking at Charley s banquet A very nice thing indeed in the middle of the day I don t mind if I have one myself and so Charley had to order another chop and more stout They have very nice sherry here excellent sherry said M Ruen The best I think in the city that s why I come here Upon my honour mister M Ruen I shan t have money to pay for it until I get some from you said Charley as he called for a pint of sherry Never mind John never mind the sherry to day said M Ruen mister Tudor is very kind but I ll take beer and the little man gave a laugh and twisted his head and ate his chop and drank his stout as though he found that both were very good indeed When he had finished Charley paid the bill and discovered that he was left with ninepence in his pocket And then he produced the bill stamp Waiter said he pen and ink and the waiter brought pen and ink Not to day said Jabesh wiping his mouth with the table cloth Not to day mister Tudor I really haven t time to go into it to day and I haven t brought the other bills with me I quite forgot to bring the other bills with me and I can do nothing without them and mister M Ruen got up to go But this was too much for Charley He had often before bought bill stamps in vain and in vain had paid for mutton chops and beer for mister M Ruen s dinner but he had never before when doing so been so hard pushed for money as he was now He was determined to make a great attempt to gain his object Nonsense said he getting up and standing so as to prevent M Ruen from leaving the box that s d nonsense Oh don t swear said M Ruen pray don t take God s name in vain I don t like it I shall swear and to some purpose too if that s your game Now look here Let me get up and we ll talk of it as we go to the bank you are so unpunctual you know D your punctuality Oh don t swear mister Tudor Look here if you don t let me have this money to day by all that is holy I will never pay you a farthing again not one farthing I ll go into the court and you may get your money as you can But mister Tudor let me get up and we ll talk about it in the street as we go along There s the stamp said Charley Fill it up and then I ll go with you to the bank M Ruen took the bit of paper and twisted it over and over again in his hand considering the while whether he had yet squeezed out of the young man all that could be squeezed with safety or whether by an additional turn by giving him another small advancement he might yet get something more He knew that Tudor was in a very bad state that he was tottering on the outside edge of the precipice but he also knew that he had friends Would his friends when they came forward to assist their young Pickle out of the mire would they pay such bills as these or would they leave poor Jabesh to get his remedy at law That was the question which mister M Ruen had to ask and to answer He was not one of those noble vultures who fly at large game and who are willing to run considerable risk in pursuit of their prey mister M Ruen avoided courts of law as much as he could and preferred a small safe trade one in which the fall of a single customer could never be ruinous to him in which he need run no risk of being transported for forgery incarcerated for perjury or even if possibly it might be avoided gibbeted by some lawyer or judge for his malpractices But you are so unpunctual he said having at last made up his mind that he had made a very good thing of Charley and that probably he might go a little further without much danger I wish to oblige you mister Tudor but pray do be punctual and so saying he slowly spread the little document before him across which Scatterall had already scrawled his name and slowly began to write in the date Slowly with his head low down over the table and continually twisting it inside his cravat he filled up the paper and then looking at it with the air of a connoisseur in such matters he gave it to Charley to sign But you haven t put in the amount said Charley mister M Ruen twisted his head and laughed He delighted in playing with his game as a fisherman does with a salmon Well no I haven t put in the amount yet Do you sign it and I ll do that at once I ll do it said Charley I ll say Lfifteen and you ll give me Lten on that No no no said Jabesh covering the paper over with his hands you young men know nothing of filling bills just sign it mister Tudor and I ll do the rest And so Charley signed it and then M Ruen again taking the pen wrote in fifteen pounds as the recognized amount of the value of the document He also took out his pocket book and filled a cheque but he was very careful that Charley should not see the amount there written And now said he we will go to the bank As they made their way to the house in Lombard Street which mister M Ruen honoured by his account Charley insisted on knowing how much he was to have for the bill Jabesh suggested Lthree tens Charley swore he would take nothing less than Leight but by the time they had arrived at the bank it had been settled that Lfive was to be paid in cash and that Charley was to have the three Seasons for the balance whenever he chose to send for them When Charley as he did at first positively refused to accede to these terms mister M Ruen tendered him back the bill and reminded him with a plaintive voice that he was so unpunctual so extremely unpunctual Having reached the bank which the money lender insisted on Charley entering with him mister M Ruen gave the cheque across the counter and wrote on the back of it the form in which he would take the money whereupon a note and five sovereigns were handed to him The cheque was for Lfifteen and was payable to C Tudor esquire so that proof might be forthcoming at a future time if necessary that he had given to his customer full value for the bill Then in the outer hall of the bank unseen by the clerks he put one after another slowly and unwillingly four sovereigns into Charley s hand The other where s the other said Charley Jabesh smiled sweetly and twisted his head Come give me the other said Charley roughly Four is quite enough quite enough for what you want and remember my time mister Tudor you should remember my time Give me the other sovereign said Charley taking hold of the front of his coat Well well you shall have ten shillings but I want the rest for a purpose Give me the sovereign said Charley or I ll drag you in before them all in the bank and expose you give me the other sovereign I say Ha ha ha laughed mister M Ruen I thought you liked a joke mister Tudor Well here it is And now do be punctual pray do be punctual and I ll do anything I can for you And then they parted Charley going westward towards his own haunts and M Ruen following his daily pursuits in the city Charley had engaged to pull up to Avis s at Putney with Harry Norman to dine there take a country walk and row back in the cool of the evening and he had promised to call at the Weights and Measures with that object punctually at five You can get away in time for that I suppose said Harry Well I ll try and manage it said Charley laughing Nothing could be kinder nay more affectionate than Norman had been to his fellow lodger during the last year and a half It seemed as though he had transferred to Alaric s cousin all the friendship which he had once felt for Alaric and the deeper were Charley s sins of idleness and extravagance the wider grew Norman s forgiveness and the more sincere his efforts to befriend him As one result of this Charley was already deep in his debt Not that Norman had lent him money or even paid bills for him but the lodgings in which they lived had been taken by Norman and when the end of the quarter came he punctually paid his landlady Charley had once a few weeks before the period of which we are now writing told Norman that he had no money to pay his long arrear and that he would leave the lodgings and shift for himself as best he could He had said the same thing to missus Richards the landlady and had gone so far as to pack up all his clothes but his back was no sooner turned than missus Richards under Norman s orders unpacked them all and hid away the portmanteau It was well for him that this was done He had bespoken for himself a bedroom at the public house in Norfolk Street and had he once taken up his residence there he would have been ruined for ever He was still living with Norman and ever increasing his debt In his misery at this state of affairs he had talked over with Harry all manner of schemes for increasing his income but he had never told him a word about mister M Ruen Why his salary which was now Lone hundred fifty per annum should not be able to support him Norman never asked Charley the while was very miserable and the more miserable he was the less he found himself able to rescue himself from his dissipation What moments of ease he had were nearly all spent in Norfolk Street and such being the case how could he abstain from going there Well Charley and how do Crinoline and Macassar go on said Norman as they sauntered away together up the towing path above Putney Now there were those who had found out that Charley Tudor in spite of his wretched idle vagabond mode of life was no fool indeed that there was that talent within him which if turned to good account might perhaps redeem him from ruin and set him on his legs again at least so thought some of his friends among whom missus Woodward was the most prominent She insisted that if he would make use of his genius he might employ his spare time to great profit by writing for magazines or periodicals and inspirited by so flattering a proposition Charley had got himself introduced to the editor of a newly projected publication At his instance he was to write a tale for approval and Crinoline and Macassar was the name selected for his first attempt The affair had been fully talked over at Hampton and it had been arranged that the young author should submit his story when completed to the friendly criticism of the party assembled at Surbiton Cottage before he sent it to the editor He had undertaken to have Crinoline and Macassar ready for perusal on the next Saturday and in spite of mister M Ruen and Norah Geraghty he had really been at work Will it be finished by Saturday Charley said Norman Yes at least I hope so but if that s not done I have another all complete Another and what is that called Oh that s a very short one said Charley modestly But short as it is it must have a name I suppose What s the name of the short one Why the name is long enough it s the longest part about it The editor gave me the name you know and then I had to write the story It s to be called Sir Anthony Allan a dale and the Baron of Ballyporeen Oh two rival knights in love with the same lady of course and Harry gave a gentle sigh as he thought of his own still unhealed grief The scene is laid in Ireland I presume No not in Ireland at least not exactly I don t think the scene is laid anywhere in particular it s up in a mountain near a castle There isn t any lady in it at least not alive Heavens Charley I hope you are not dealing with dead women No that is I have to bring them to life again I ll tell you how it is In the first paragraph Sir Anthony Allan a dale is lying dead and the Baron of Ballyporeen is standing over him with a bloody sword You must always begin with an incident now and then hark back for your explanation and description that s what the editor says is the great secret of the present day and where we beat all the old fellows that wrote twenty years ago Oh yes I see They used to begin at the beginning that was very humdrum A devilish bore you know for a fellow who takes up a novel because he s dull Of course he wants his fun at once If you begin with a long history of who s who and all that why he won t read three pages but if you touch him up with a startling incident or two at the first go off then give him a chapter of horrors then another of fun then a little love or a little slang or something of that sort why you know about the end of the first volume you may describe as much as you like and tell everything about everybody s father and mother for just as many pages as you want to fill At least that s what the editor says Meleager ab ovo may be introduced with safety when you get as far as that suggested Norman Yes you may bring him in too if you like said Charley who was somewhat oblivious of his classicalities Well Sir Anthony is lying dead and the Baron is standing over him when out come Sir Anthony s retainers Out out of what Out of the castle that s all explained afterwards Out come the retainers and pitch into the Baron till they make mincemeat of him They don t kill him too Don t they though I rather think they do and no mistake And so both your heroes are dead in the first chapter First chapter why that s only the second paragraph I m only to be allowed ten paragraphs for each number and I am expected to have an incident for every other paragraph for the first four days That s twenty incidents Yes it s a great bother finding so many I m obliged to make the retainers come by all manner of accidents and I should never have finished the job if I hadn t thought of setting the castle on fire And now forked tongues of liquid fire and greedy lambent flames burst forth from every window of the devoted edifice The devouring element That s the best passage in the whole affair This is for the Daily Delight isn t it Yes for the Daily Delight It is to begin on the first of September with the partridges We expect a most tremendous sale It will be the first halfpenny publication in the market and as the retailers will get them for sixpence a score twenty four to the score they ll go off like wildfire Well Charley and what do you do with the dead bodies of your two heroes Of course I needn t tell you that it was not the Baron who killed Sir Anthony at all Oh wasn t it O dear that was a dreadful mistake on the part of the retainers But as natural as life You see these two grandees were next door neighbours and there had been a feud between the families for seven centuries a sort of Capulet and Montague affair One Adelgitha the daughter of the Thane of Allan a dale there were Thanes in those days you know was betrothed to the eldest son of Sir Waldemar de Ballyporeen This gives me an opportunity of bringing in a succinct little account of the Conquest which will be beneficial to the lower classes The editor peremptorily insists upon that kind of thing Omne tulit punctum said Norman Yes I dare say said Charley who was now too intent on his own new profession to attend much to his friend s quotation Well where was I Oh the eldest son of Sir Waldemar went off with another lady and so the feud began There is a very pretty scene between Adelgitha and her lady s maid What seven centuries before the story begins Why not The editor says that the unities are altogether thrown over now and that they are regular bosh our game is to stick in a good bit whenever we can get it I got to be so fond of Adelgitha that I rather think she s the heroine But doesn t that take off the interest from your dead grandees Not a bit I take it chapter and chapter about Well you see the retainers had no sooner made mincemeat of the Baron a very elegant young man was the Baron just returned from the Continent where he had learnt to throw aside all prejudices about family feuds and everything eke and he had just come over in a friendly way to say as much to Sir Anthony when as he crossed the drawbridge he stumbled over the corpse of his ancient enemy well the retainers had no sooner made mincemeat of him than they perceived that Sir Anthony was lying with an open bottle in his hand and that he had taken poison Having committed suicide asked Norman No not at all The editor says that we must always have a slap at some of the iniquities of the times He gave me three or four to choose from there was the adulteration of food and the want of education for the poor and street music and the miscellaneous sale of poisons And so you chose poisons and killed the knight Exactly at least I didn t kill him for he comes all right again after a bit He had gone out to get something to do him good after a hard night a Seidlitz powder or something of that sort and an apothecary s apprentice had given him prussic acid in mistake And how is it possible he should have come to life after taking prussic acid Why there I have a double rap at the trade The prussic acid is so bad of its kind that it only puts him into a kind of torpor for a week Then we have the trial of the apothecary s boy that is an excellent episode and gives me a grand hit at the absurdity of our criminal code Why Charley it seems to me that you are hitting at everything Oh ah right and left that s the game for us authors The press is the only censor morum going now and who so fit Set a thief to catch a thief you know Well I have my hit at the criminal code and then Sir Anthony comes out of his torpor But how did it come to pass that the Baron s sword was all bloody Ah there was the difficulty I saw that at once It was necessary to bring in something to be killed you know I thought of a stray tiger out of Wombwell s menagerie but the editor says that we must not trespass against the probabilities so I have introduced a big dog The Baron had come across a big dog and seeing that the brute had a wooden log tied to his throat thought he must be mad and so he killed him And what s the end of it Charley Why the end is rather melancholy Sir Anthony reforms leaves off drinking and takes to going to church everyday He becomes a Puseyite puts up a memorial window to the Baron and reads the Tracts At last he goes over to the Pope walks about in nasty dirty clothes all full of vermin and gives over his estate to Cardinal Wiseman Then there are the retainers they all come to grief some one way and some another I do that for the sake of the Nemesis I would not have condescended to notice them I think said Norman Oh I must there must be a Nemesis The editor specially insists on a Nemesis The conclusion of Charley s novel brought them back to the boat Norman when he started had intended to employ the evening in giving good counsel to his friend and in endeavouring to arrange some scheme by which he might rescue the brand from the burning but he had not the heart to be severe and sententious while Charley was full of his fun It was so much pleasanter to talk to him on the easy terms of equal friendship than turn Mentor and preach a sermon Well Charley said he as they were walking up from the boat wharf Norman to his club and Charley towards his lodgings from which route however he meant to deviate as soon as ever he might be left alone well Charley I wish you success with all my heart I wish you could do something I won t say to keep you out of mischief I wish I could Harry said Charley thoroughly abashed I wish I could indeed I wish I could but it is so hard to go right when one has begun to go wrong It is hard I know it is But you never can know how hard Harry for you have never tried and then they went on walking for a while in silence side by side You don t know the sort of place that office of mine is continued Charley You don t know the sort of fellows the men are I hate the place I hate the men I live with It is all so dirty so disreputable so false I cannot conceive that any fellow put in there as young as I was should ever do well afterwards But at any rate you might try your best Charley Yes I might do that still and I know I don t and where should I have been now if it hadn t been for you Never mind about that I sometimes think we might have done more for each other if we had been more together But remember the motto you said you d choose Charley Excelsior We can none of us mount the hill without hard labour Remember that word Charley Excelsior Remember it now now to night remember how you dream of higher things and begin to think of them in your waking moments also and so they parted CHAPTER XX A DAY WITH ONE OF THE NAVVIES EVENING Excelsior said Charley to himself as he walked on a few steps towards his lodgings having left Norman at the door of his club Remember it now now to night Yes now is the time to remember it if it is ever to be remembered to any advantage He went on with stoic resolution to the end of the street determined to press home and put the last touch to Crinoline and Macassar but as he went he thought of his interview with mister M Ruen and of the five sovereigns still in his pocket and altered his course Charley had not been so resolute with the usurer so determined to get Lfive from him on this special day without a special object in view His credit was at stake in a more than ordinary manner he had about a week since borrowed money from the woman who kept the public house in Norfolk Street and having borrowed it for a week only felt that this was a debt of honour which it was incumbent on him to pay Therefore when he had walked the length of one street on his road towards his lodgings he retraced his steps and made his way back to his old haunts The house which he frequented was hardly more like a modern London gin palace than was that other house in the city which mister M Ruen honoured with his custom It was one of those small tranquil shrines of Bacchus in which the god is worshipped perhaps with as constant a devotion though with less noisy demonstrations of zeal than in his larger and more public temples None absolutely of the lower orders were encouraged to come thither for oblivion It had about it nothing inviting to the general eye No gas illuminations proclaimed its midnight grandeur No huge folding doors one set here and another there gave ingress and egress to a wretched crowd of poverty stricken midnight revellers No reiterated assertions in gaudy letters each a foot long as to the peculiar merits of the old tom or Hodge s cream of the valley seduced the thirsty traveller The panelling over the window bore the simple announcement in modest letters of the name of the landlady missus Davis and the same name appeared with equal modesty on the one gas lamp opposite the door missus Davis was a widow and her customers were chiefly people who knew her and frequented her house regularly Lawyers clerks who were either unmarried or whose married homes were perhaps not so comfortable as the widow s front parlour tradesmen not of the best sort glad to get away from the noise of their children young men who had begun the cares of life in ambiguous positions just on the confines of respectability and who finding themselves too weak in flesh to cling on to the round of the ladder above them were sinking from year to year to lower steps and depths even below the level of missus Davis s public house To these might be added some few of a somewhat higher rank in life though perhaps of a lower rank of respectability young men who like Charley Tudor and his comrades liked their ease and self indulgence and were too indifferent as to the class of companions against whom they might rub their shoulders while seeking it The Cat and Whistle for such was the name of missus Davis s establishment had been a house of call for the young men of the Internal Navigation long before Charley s time What first gave rise to the connexion it is not now easy to say but Charley had found it and had fostered it into a close alliance which greatly exceeded any amount of intimacy which existed previously to his day It must not be presumed that he in an ordinary way took his place among the lawyers clerks and general run of customers in the front parlour occasionally he condescended to preside there over the quiet revels to sing a song for the guests which was sure to be applauded to the echo and to engage in a little skirmish of politics with a retired lamp maker and a silversmith s foreman from the Strand who always called him Sir and received what he said with the greatest respect but as a rule he quaffed his Falernian in a little secluded parlour behind the bar in which sat the widow Davis auditing her accounts in the morning and giving out orders in the evening to Norah Geraghty her barmaid and to an attendant sylph who ministered to the front parlour taking in goes of gin and screws of tobacco and bringing out the price thereof with praiseworthy punctuality Latterly indeed Charley had utterly deserted the front parlour for there had come there a pestilent fellow highly connected with the Press as the lamp maker declared but employed as an assistant shorthand writer somewhere about the Houses of Parliament according to the silversmith who greatly interfered with our navvy s authority He would not at all allow that what Charley said was law entertained fearfully democratic principles of his own and was not at all the gentleman So Charley drew himself up declined to converse any further on politics with a man who seemed to know more about them than himself and confined himself exclusively to the inner room On arriving at this elysium on the night in question he found missus Davis usefully engaged in darning a stocking while Scatterall sat opposite with a cigar in his mouth his hat over his nose and a glass of gin and water before him I began to think you weren t coming said Scatterall and I was getting so deuced dull that I was positively thinking of going home That s very civil of you mister Scatterall said the widow Well you ve been sitting there for the last half hour without saying a word to me and it is dull Looking at a woman mending stockings is dull ain t it Charley That depends said Charley partly on whom the woman may be and partly on whom the man may be Where s Norah missus Davis She s not very well to night she has got a headache there ain t many of them here to night so she s lying down A little seedy I suppose said Scatterall Charley felt rather angry with his friend for applying such an epithet to his lady love however he did not resent it but sitting down lighted his pipe and sipped his gin and water And so they sat for the next quarter of an hour saying very little to each other What was the nature of the attraction which induced two such men as Charley Tudor and Dick Scatterall to give missus Davis the benefit of their society while she was mending her stockings it might be difficult to explain They could have smoked in their own rooms as well and have drunk gin and water there if they had any real predilection for that mixture missus Davis was neither young nor beautiful nor more than ordinarily witty Charley it is true had an allurement to entice him thither but this could not be said of Scatterall to whom the lovely Norah was never more than decently civil Had they been desired in their own paternal halls to sit and see their mother s housekeeper darn the family stockings they would probably both of them have rebelled even though the supply of tobacco and gin and water should be gratuitous and unlimited It must be presumed that the only charm of the pursuit was in its acknowledged impropriety They both understood that there was something fast in frequenting missus Davis s inner parlour something slow in remaining at home and so they both sat there and missus Davis went on with her darning needle nothing abashed Well I think I shall go said Scatterall shaking off the last ash from the end of his third cigar Do said Charley you should be careful you know late hours will hurt your complexion It s so deuced dull said Scatterall Why don t you go into the parlour and have a chat with the gentlemen suggested missus Davis there s mister Peppermint there now lecturing about the war upon my word he talks very well He s so deuced low said Scatterall He s a bumptious noisy blackguard too said Charley he doesn t know how to speak to a gentleman when he meets one Scatterall gave a great yawn I suppose you re not going Charley said he Oh yes I am said Charley in about two hours Two hours well good night old fellow for I m off Three cigars missus Davis and two goes of gin and water the last cold Then having made this little commercial communication to the landlady he gave another yawn and took himself away missus Davis opened her little book jotted down the items and then having folded up her stockings and put them into a basket prepared herself for conversation But though missus Davis prepared herself for conversation she did not immediately commence it Having something special to say she probably thought that she might improve her opportunity of saying it by allowing Charley to begin She got up and pottered about the room went to a cupboard and wiped a couple of glasses and then out into the bar and arranged the jugs and pots This done she returned to the little room and again sat herself down in her chair Here s your five pounds missus Davis said Charley I wish you knew the trouble I have had to get it for you To give missus Davis her due this was not the subject on which she was anxious to speak She would have been at present well inclined that Charley should remain her debtor Indeed mister Tudor I am very sorry you should have taken any trouble on such a trifle If you re short of money it will do for me just as well in October Charley looked at the sovereigns and bethought himself how very short of cash he was Then he thought of the fight he had had to get them in order that he might pay the money which he had felt so ashamed of having borrowed and he determined to resist the temptation Did you ever know me flush of cash You had better take them while you can get them and as he pushed them across the table with his stick he remembered that all he had left was ninepence I don t want the money at present mister Tudor said the widow We re such old friends that there ought not to be a word between us about such a trifle now don t leave yourself bare take what you want and settle with me at quarter day Well I ll take a sovereign said he for to tell you the truth I have only the ghost of a shilling in my pocket And so it was settled missus Davis reluctantly pocketed four of mister M Ruen s sovereigns and Charley kept in his own possession the fifth as to which he had had so hard a combat in the lobby of the bank He then sat silent for a while and smoked and missus Davis again waited for him to begin the subject on which she wished to speak And what s the matter with Norah all this time he said at last What s the matter with her repeated missus Davis Well I think you might know what s the matter with her You don t suppose she s made of stone do you Charley saw that he was in for it It was in vain that Norman s last word was still ringing in his ears Excelsior What had he to do with Excelsior What miserable reptile on God s earth was more prone to crawl downwards than he had shown himself to be And then again a vision floated across his mind s eye of a young sweet angel face with large bright eyes with soft delicate skin and all the exquisite charms of gentle birth and gentle nurture A single soft touch seemed to press his arm a touch that he had so often felt and had never felt without acknowledging to himself that there was something in it almost divine All this passed rapidly through his mind as he was preparing to answer missus Davis s question touching Norah Geraghty You don t think she s made of stone do you said the widow repeating her words Indeed I don t think she s made of anything but what s suitable to a very nice young woman said Charley A nice young woman Is that all you can say for her I call her a very fine girl Miss Golightly s friends could not say anything more even for that young lady I don t know where you ll pick up a handsomer or a better conducted one either for the matter of that Indeed she is said Charley Oh for the matter of that no one knows it better than yourself mister Tudor and she s as well able to keep a man s house over his head as some others that take a deal of pride in themselves I m quite sure of it said Charley Well the long and the short of it is this mister Tudor And as she spoke the widow got a little red in the face she had as Charley thought an unpleasant look of resolution about her a roundness about her mouth and a sort of fierceness in her eyes The long and the short of it is this mister Tudor what do you mean to do about the girl Do about her said Charley almost bewildered in his misery Yes do about her Do you mean to make her your wife That s plain English Because I ll tell you what I ll not see her put upon any longer It must be one thing or the other and that at once And if you ve a grain of honour in you mister Tudor and I think you are honourable you won t back from your word with the girl now Back from my word said Charley Yes back from your word said missus Davis the flood gates of whose eloquence were now fairly opened I m sure you re too much of the gentleman to deny your own words and them repeated more than once in my presence Cheroots yes are there none there child Oh they are in the cupboard These last words were not part of her address to Charley but were given in reply to a requisition from the attendant nymph outside You re too much of a gentleman to do that I know And so as I m her natural friend and indeed she s my cousin not that far off I think it s right that we should all understand one another Oh quite right said Charley You can t expect that she should go and sacrifice herself for you you know said missus Davis who now that she had begun hardly knew how to stop herself A girl s time is her money She s at her best now and a girl like her must make her hay while the sun shines She can t go on fal lalling with you and then nothing to come of it You mustn t suppose she s to lose her market that way God knows I should be sorry to injure her missus Davis I believe you would because I take you for an honourable gentleman as will be as good as your word Now there s Peppermint there What that fellow in the parlour And an honourable gentleman he is Not that I mean to compare him to you mister Tudor nor yet doesn t Norah not by no means But there he is Well he comes with the most honourablest proposals and will make her missus Peppermint to morrow if so be that she ll have it You don t mean to say that there has been anything between them said Charley who in spite of the intense desire which he had felt a few minutes since to get the lovely Norah altogether off his hands now felt an acute pang of jealousy You don t mean to say that there has been anything between them Nothing as you have any right to object to mister Tudor You may be sure I wouldn t allow of that nor yet wouldn t Norah demean herself to it Then how did she get talking to him She didn t get talking to him But he has eyes in his head and you don t suppose but what he can see with them If a girl is in the public line of course any man is free to speak to her If you don t like it it is for you to take her out of it Not but what for a girl that is in the public line Norah Geraghty keeps herself to herself as much as any girl you ever set eyes on What the d has she to do with this fellow then Why he s a widower and has three young children and he s looking out for a mother for them and he thinks Norah will suit There now you have the truth and the whole truth D his impudence said Charley Well I don t see that there s any impudence He has a house of his own and the means to keep it Now I ll tell you what it is Norah can t abide him Charley looked a little better satisfied when he heard this declaration Norah can t abide the sight of him nor won t of any man as long as you are hanging after her She s as true as steel and proud you ought to be of her Proud thought Charley as he again muttered to himself Excelsior But mister Tudor I won t see her put upon that s the long and the short of it If you like to take her there she is I don t say she s just your equal as to breeding though she s come of decent people too but she s good as gold She ll make a shilling go as far as any young woman I know and if Lone hundred or Lone hundred fifty are wanting for furniture or the like of that why I ve that regard for her that that shan t stand in the way Now mister Tudor I ve spoke honest and if you re the gentleman as I takes you to be you ll do the same To do missus Davis justice it must be acknowledged that in her way she had spoken honestly Of course she knew that such a marriage would be a dreadful misalliance for young Tudor of course she knew that all his friends would be heart broken when they heard of it But what had she to do with his friends Her sympathies her good wishes were for her friend Had Norah fallen a victim to Charley s admiration and then been cast off to eat the bitterest bread to which any human being is ever doomed what then would Charley s friends have cared for her There was a fair fight between them If Norah Geraghty as a reward for her prudence could get a husband in a rank of life above her instead of falling into utter destruction as might so easily have been the case who could do other than praise her praise her and her clever friend who had so assisted her in her struggle Dolus an virtus Had missus Davis ever studied the classics she would have thus expressed herself Poor Charley was altogether thrown on his beam ends He had altogether played missus Davis s game in evincing jealousy at mister Peppermint s attentions He knew this and yet for the life of him he could not help being jealous He wanted to get rid of Miss Geraghty and yet he could not endure that anyone else should lay claim to her favour He was very weak He knew how much depended on the way in which he might answer this woman at the present moment he knew that he ought now to make it plain to her that however foolish he might have been however false he might have been it was quite out of the question that he should marry her barmaid But he did not do so He was worse than weak It was not only the disinclination to give pain or even the dread of the storm that would ensue which deterred him but an absurd dislike to think that mister Peppermint should be graciously received there as the barmaid s acknowledged admirer Is she really ill now said he She s not so ill but what she shall make herself well enough to welcome you if you ll say the word that you ought to say The most that ails her is fretting at the long delay Bolt the door child and go to bed there will be no one else here now Go up and tell Miss Geraghty to come down she hasn t got her clothes off yet I know missus Davis was too good a general to press Charley for an absolute immediate fixed answer to her question She knew that she had already gained much by talking thus of the proposed marriage by setting it thus plainly before Charley without rebuke or denial from him He had not objected to receiving a visit from Norah on the implied understanding that she was to come down to him as his affianced bride He had not agreed to this in words but silence gives consent and missus Davis felt that should it ever hereafter become necessary to prove anything what had passed would enable her to prove a good deal Charley puffed at his cigar and sipped his gin and water It was now twelve o clock and he thoroughly wished himself at home and in bed The longer he thought of it the more impossible it appeared that he should get out of the house without the scene which he dreaded The girl had bolted the door put away her cups and mugs and her step upstairs had struck heavily on his ears The house was not large or high and he fancied that he heard mutterings on the landing place Indeed he did not doubt but that Miss Geraghty had listened to most of the conversation which had taken place Excuse me a minute mister Tudor said missus Davis who was now smiling and civil enough I will go upstairs myself the silly girl is shamefaced and does not like to come down and up went missus Davis to see that her barmaid s curls and dress were nice and jaunty It would not do now at this moment for Norah to offend her lover by any untidiness Charley for a moment thought of the front door The enemy had allowed him an opportunity for retreating He might slip out before either of the women came down and then never more be heard of in Norfolk Street again He had his hand in his waistcoat pocket with the intent of leaving the sovereign on the table but when the moment came he felt ashamed of the pusillanimity of such an escape and therefore stood or rather sat his ground with a courage worthy of a better purpose Down the two women came and Charley felt his heart beating against his ribs As the steps came nearer the door he began to wish that mister Peppermint had been successful The widow entered the room first and at her heels the expectant beauty We can hardly say that she was blushing but she did look rather shamefaced and hung back a little at the door as though she still had half a mind to think better of it and go off to her bed Come in you little fool said missus Davis You needn t be ashamed of coming down to see him you have done that often enough before now Norah simpered and sidled Well I m sure now said she Here s a start mister Tudor to be brought downstairs at this time of night and I m sure I don t know what it s about and then she shook her curls and twitched her dress and made as though she were going to pass through the room to her accustomed place at the bar Norah Geraghty was a fine girl Putting her in comparison with Miss Golightly we are inclined to say that she was the finer girl of the two and that barring position money and fashion she was qualified to make the better wife In point of education that is the effects of education there was not perhaps much to choose between them Norah could make an excellent pudding and was willing enough to exercise her industry and art in doing so Miss Golightly could copy music but she did not like the trouble and could play a waltz badly Neither of them had ever read anything beyond a few novels In this respect as to the amount of labour done Miss Golightly had certainly far surpassed her rival competitor for Charley s affections Charley got up and took her hand and as he did so he saw that her nails were dirty He put his arms round her waist and kissed her and as he caressed her his olfactory nerves perceived that the pomatum in her hair was none of the best He thought of those young lustrous eyes that would look up so wondrously into his face he thought of the gentle touch which would send a thrill through all his nerves and then he felt very sick Well upon my word mister Tudor said Miss Geraghty you re making very free to night She did not however refuse to sit down on his knee though while sitting there she struggled and tossed herself and shook her long ringlets in Charley s face till he wished her safe at home in mister Peppermint s nursery And is that what you brought me down for missus Davis said Norah Well upon my word I hope the door s locked we shall have all the world in here else If you hadn t come down to him he d have come up to you said missus Davis Would he though said Norah I think he knows a trick worth two of that and she looked as though she knew well how to defend herself if any over zeal on the part of her lover should ever induce him to violate the sanctum of her feminine retirement There was no over zeal now about Charley He ought to have been happy enough for he had his charmer in his arms but he showed very little of the ecstatic joy of a favoured lover There he sat with Norah in his arms and as we have said Norah was a handsome girl but he would much sooner have been copying the Kennett and Avon canal lock entries in mister Snape s room at the Internal Navigation Lawks mister Tudor you needn t hold me so tight said Norah He means to hold you tight enough now said missus Davis He s very angry because I mentioned another gentleman s name Well now you didn t said Norah pretending to look very angry Well I just did and if you d only seen him You must be very careful what you say to that gentleman or there ll be a row in the house I said Norah What I say to him It s very little I have to say to the man But I shall tell him this he d better take himself somewhere else if he s going to make himself troublesome All this time Charley had said nothing but was sitting with his hat on his head and his cigar in his mouth The latter appendage he had laid down for a moment when he saluted Miss Geraghty but he had resumed it having at the moment no intention of repeating the compliment And so you were jealous were you said she turning round and looking at him Well now some people might have more respect for other people than to mix up their names that way with the names of any men that choose to put themselves forward What would you say if I was to talk to you about Miss Charley stopped her mouth It was not to be borne that she should be allowed to pronounce the name that was about to fall from her lips So you were jealous were you said she when she was again able to speak Well my missus Davis told me flatly that you were going to marry the man said Charley so what was I to think It doesn t matter what you think now said missus Davis for you must be off from this Do you know what o clock it is Do you want the house to get a bad name Come you two understand each other now so you may as well give over billing and cooing for this time It s all settled now isn t it mister Tudor Oh yes I suppose so said Charley Well and what do you say Norah Oh I m sure I m agreeable if he is Ha ha ha I only hope he won t think me too forward he he he And then with another kiss and very few more words of any sort Charley took himself off I ll have nothing more to do with him said Norah bursting into tears as soon as the door was well bolted after Charley s exit I m only losing myself with him He don t mean anything and I said he didn t all along He d have pitched me to Old Scratch while I was sitting there on his knee if he d have had his own way so he would and poor Norah cried heartily as she went to her work in her usual way among the bottles and taps Why you fool you what do you expect You don t think he s to jump down your throat do you You can but try it on and then if it don t do why there s the other one to fall back on only if I had the choice I d rather have young Tudor too So would I said Norah I can t abide that other fellow Well there that s how it is you know beggars can t be choosers But come make us a drop of something hot a little drop will do yourself good but it s better not to take it before him unless when he presses you So the two ladies sat down to console themselves as best they might for the reverses which trade and love so often bring with them Charley walked off a miserable man He was thoroughly ashamed of himself thoroughly acknowledged his own weakness and yet as he went out from the Cat and Whistle he felt sure that he should return there again to renew the degradation from which he had suffered this night Indeed what else could he do now He had as it were solemnly plighted his troth to the girl before a third person who had brought them together with the acknowledged purpose of witnessing that ceremony He had before missus Davis and before the girl herself heard her spoken of as his wife and had agreed to the understanding that such an arrangement was a settled thing What else had he to do now but to return and complete his part of the bargain What else but that and be a wretched miserable degraded man for the rest of his days lower viler more contemptible infinitely lower even than his brother clerics at the office whom in his pride he had so much despised He walked from Norfolk Street into the Strand and there the world was still alive though it was now nearly one o clock The debauched misery the wretched outdoor midnight revelry of the world was there streaming in and out from gin palaces and bawling itself hoarse with horrid discordant screech owl slang But he went his way unheeding and uncontaminated Now now that it was useless he was thinking of the better things of the world nothing now seemed worth his grasp nothing now seemed pleasurable nothing capable of giving joy but what was decent good reputable cleanly and polished How he hated now that lower world with which he had for the last three years condescended to pass so much of his time how he hated himself for his own vileness He thought of what Alaric was of what Norman was of what he himself might have been he that was praised by missus Woodward for his talent he that was encouraged to place himself among the authors of the day He thought of all this and then he thought of what he was the affianced husband of Norah Geraghty He went along the Strand over the crossing under the statue of Charles on horseback and up Pall Mall East till he came to the opening into the park under the Duke of York s column The London night world was all alive as he made his way From the Opera Colonnade shrill voices shrieked out at him as he passed and drunken men coming down from the night supper houses in the Haymarket saluted him with affectionate cordiality The hoarse waterman from the cabstand whose voice had perished in the night air croaked out at him the offer of a vehicle and one of the night beggar women who cling like burrs to those who roam the street a these unhallowed hours still stuck to him as she had done ever since he had entered the Strand Get away with you said Charley turning at the wretched creature in his fierce anger get away or I ll give you in charge That you may never know what it is to be in misery yourself said the miserable Irishwoman If you follow me a step farther I ll have you locked up said Charley Oh then it s you that have the hard heart said she and it s you that will suffer yet Charley looked round threw her the odd halfpence which he had in his pocket and then turned down towards the column The woman picked up her prize and with a speedy blessing took herself off in search of other prey His way home would have taken him up Waterloo Place but the space round the column was now deserted and quiet and sauntering there without thinking of what he did he paced up and down between the Clubs and the steps leading into the park There walking to and fro slowly he thought of his past career of all the circumstances of his life since his life had been left to his own control and of the absence of all hope for the future What was he to do He was deeply inextricably in debt That wretch M Ruen had his name on bills which it was impossible that he should ever pay Tradesmen held other bills of his which were either now over due or would very shortly become so He was threatened with numerous writs any one of which would suffice to put him into gaol From his poor father burdened as he was with other children he knew that he had no right to expect further assistance He was in debt to Norman his best he would have said his only friend had it not been that in all his misery he could not help still thinking of missus Woodward as his friend And yet how could his venture to think longer of her contaminated as he now was with the horrid degradation of his acknowledged love at the Cat and Whistle No he must think no more of the Woodwards he must dream no more of those angel eyes which in his waking moments had so often peered at him out of heaven teaching him to think of higher things giving him higher hopes than those which had come to him from the working of his own unaided spirit Ah lessons taught in vain vain hopes lessons that had come all too late hopes that had been cherished only to be deceived It was all over now He had made his bed and he must lie on it he had sown his seed and he must reap his produce there was now no Excelsior left for him within the bounds of human probability He had promised to go to Hampton with Harry Norman on Saturday and he would go there for the last time He would go there and tell missus Woodward so much of the truth as he could bring himself to utter he would say farewell to that blest abode he would take Linda s soft hand in his for the last time for the last time he would hear the young silver ringing happy voice of his darling Katie for the last time look into her bright face for the last time play with her as with a child of heaven and then he would return to the Cat and Whistle And having made this resolve he went home to his lodgings It was singular that in all his misery the idea hardly once occurred to him of setting himself right in the world by accepting his cousin s offer of Miss Golightly s hand and fortune CHAPTER XXI HAMPTON COURT BRIDGE Before the following Saturday afternoon Charley s spirits had somewhat recovered their natural tone Not that he was in a happy frame of mind the united energies of mister M Ruen and missus Davis had been too powerful to allow of that not that he had given over his projected plan of saying a long farewell to missus Woodward or at any rate of telling her something of his position he still felt that he could not continue to live on terms of close intimacy both with her daughters and with Norah Geraghty But the spirits of youth are ever buoyant and the spirits of no one could be endowed with more natural buoyancy than those of the young navvy Charley therefore in spite of his misfortunes was ready with his manuscript when Saturday afternoon arrived and according to agreement met Norman at the railway station Only one evening had intervened since the night in which he had ratified his matrimonial engagement and in spite of the delicate nature of his position he had for that evening allowed mister Peppermint to exercise his eloquence on the heart of the fair Norah without interruption He the while had been engaged in completing the memoirs of Crinoline and Macassar Well Charley they asked one and all as soon as he reached the Cottage have you got the story Have you brought the manuscript Is it all finished and ready for that dreadful editor Charley produced a roll and Linda and Katie instantly pounced upon it Oh it begins with poetry said Linda I am so glad said Katie Is there much poetry in it Charley I do so hope there is Not a word of it said Charley that which Linda sees is a song that the heroine is singing and it isn t supposed to be written by the author at all I m so sorry that there s no poetry said Katie Can t you write poetry Charley At any rate there s lots of love in it said Linda who was turning over the pages Is there said Katie Well that s next best but they should go together You should have put all your love into verse Charley and then your prose would have done for the funny parts Perhaps it s all fun said missus Woodward But come girls this is not fair I won t let you look at the story till it s read in full committee And so saying missus Woodward took the papers from her daughters and tying them up deposited them safe in custody We ll have it out when the tea things are gone But before the tea things had come an accident happened which had been like to dismiss Crinoline and Macassar altogether from the minds of the whole of the Woodward family The young men had as usual dined in town and therefore they were all able to spend the long summer evening out of doors Norman s boat was down at Hampton and it was therefore determined that they should row down as far as Hampton Court Park and back Charley and Norman were to row and missus Woodward agreed to accompany her daughters Uncle Bat was left at home to his nap and rum and water Norman was so expert a Thames waterman that he was quite able to manage the boat without a steersman and Charley was nearly his equal But there is some amusement in steering and Katie was allowed to sit between the tiller ropes I can steer very well mamma can t I Harry I always steer when we go to the island and we run the boat straight into the little creek only just broad enough to hold it Katie s visits to the island however were not so frequent as they had heretofore been for she was approaching to sixteen years of age and wet feet and draggled petticoats had lost some of their charms missus Woodward trusting more to the experience of her two knights than to the skill of the lady at the helm took her seat and they went off merrily down the stream All the world knows that it is but a very little distance from Hampton Church to Hampton Court Bridge especially when one has the stream with one They were very soon near to the bridge and as they approached it they had to pass a huge barge that was lazily making its way down to Brentford There s lots of time for the big arch said Charley Pull away then said Harry They both pulled hard and shot alongside and past the barge But the stream was strong and the great ugly mass of black timber moved behind them quicker than it seemed to do It will be safer to take the one to the left said Harry Oh there s lots of time said Charley No said Harry do as I tell you and go to the left Pull your left hand a little Katie Charley did as he was bid and Katie intended to do the same but unfortunately she pulled the wrong hand They were now very near the bridge and the barge was so close to them as to show that there might have been danger in attempting to get through the same arch with her Your left hand Katie your left shouted Norman your left string Katie was confused and gave first a pull with her right and then a pull with her left and then a strong pull with her right The two men backed water as hard as they could but the effect of Katie s steering was to drive the nose of the boat right into one of the wooden piers of the bridge The barge went on its way and luckily made its entry under the arch before the little craft had swung round into the stream before it as it was the boat still clinging by its nose came round with its stern against the side of the barge and as the latter went on the timbers of Norman s wherry cracked and crumpled in the rude encounter The ladies should all have kept their seats missus Woodward did do so Linda jumped up and being next to the barge was pulled up into it by one of the men Katie stood bolt upright with the tiller ropes still in her hand awe struck at the misfortune she had caused but while she was so standing the stern of the boat was lifted nearly out of the water by the weight of the barge and Katie was pitched behind her mother s back head foremost into the water Norman at the moment was endeavouring to steady the boat and shove it off from the barge and had also lent a hand to assist Linda in her escape Charley was on the other side standing up and holding on by the piers of the bridge keeping his eyes on the ladies so as to be of assistance to them when assistance might be needed And now assistance was sorely needed and luckily had not to be long waited for Charley with a light and quick step passed over the thwarts and disregarding missus Woodward s scream let himself down over the gun wale behind her seat into the water Katie can hardly be said to have sunk at all She had at least never been so much under the water as to be out of sight Her clothes kept up her light body and when Charley got close to her she had been carried up to the piers of the bridge and was panting with her head above water and beating the stream with her little hands She was soon again in comparative safety Charley had her by one arm as he held on with the other to the boat and kept himself afloat with his legs missus Woodward leaned over and caught her daughter s clothes while Linda who had seen what had happened stood shrieking on the barge as it made its way on heedless of the ruin it left behind Another boat soon came to their assistance from the shore and missus Woodward and Katie were got safely into it Charley returned to the battered wherry and assisted Norman in extricating it from its position and a third boat went to Linda s rescue who would otherwise have found herself in rather an uncomfortable position the next morning at Brentford The hugging and kissing to which Katie was subjected when she was carried up to the inn near the boat slip on the Surrey side of the river may be imagined as may also the faces she made at the wineglassful of stiff brandy and water which she was desired to drink She was carried home in a fly and by the time she arrived there had so completely recovered her life and spirits as to put a vehement negative on her mother s proposition that she should at once go to bed And not hear dear Charley s story said she with tears in her eyes And mamma I can t and won t go to bed without seeing Charley I didn t say one word yet to thank him for jumping into the water after me It was in vain that her mother told her that Charley s story would amuse her twice as much when she should read it printed it was in vain that missus Woodward assured her that Charley should come up to her room door and hear her thanks as he stood in the passage with the door ajar Katie was determined to hear the story read It must be read if read at all that Saturday night as it was to be sent to the editor in the course of the week and reading Crinoline and Macassar out loud on a Sunday was not to be thought of at Surbiton Cottage Katie was determined to hear the story read and to sit very near the author too during the reading to sit near him and to give him such praise as even in her young mind she felt that an author would like to hear Charley had pulled her out of the river and no one as far as her efforts could prevent it should be allowed to throw cold water on him Norman and Charley wet as the latter was contrived to bring the shattered boat back to Hampton When they reached the lawn at Surbiton Cottage they were both in high spirits An accident if it does no material harm is always an inspiriting thing unless one feels that it has been attributable to one s own fault Neither of them could in this instance attach any blame to himself and each felt that he had done what in him lay to prevent the possible ill effect of the mischance As for the boat Harry was too happy to think that none of his friends were hurt to care much about that As they walked across the lawn missus Woodward ran out to them My dear dear Charley she said what am I to say to thank you It was the first time missus Woodward had ever called him by his Christian name It had hitherto made him in a certain degree unhappy that she never did so and now the sound was very pleasant to him Oh missus Woodward said he laughing you mustn t touch me for I m all mud My dear dear Charley what can I say to you and dear Harry I fear we ve spoilt your beautiful new boat I fear we ve spoilt Katie s beautiful new hat said Norman missus Woodward had taken and pressed a hand of each of them in spite of Charley s protestations about the mud Oh you re in a dreadful state said she you had better take something at once you ll catch your death of cold I d better take myself off to the inn said Charley and get some clean clothes that s all I want But how is Katie and how is Linda And so after a multitude of such inquiries on both sides and of all manner of affectionate greetings Charley went off to make himself dry preparatory to the reading of the manuscript During his absence Linda and Katie came down to the drawing room Linda was full of fun as to her journey with the bargeman but Katie was a little paler than usual and somewhat more serious and quiet than she was wont to be Norman was the first in the drawing room and received the thanks of the ladies for his prowess in assisting them and Charley was not slow to follow him for he was never very long at his toilet He came in with a jaunty laughing air as though nothing particular had happened and as if he had not a care in the world And yet while he had been dressing he had been thinking almost more than ever of Norah Geraghty O that she and missus Davis with her and Jabesh M Ruen with both of them could be buried ten fathom deep out of his sight and out of his mind When he entered the room Katie felt her heart beat so strongly that she hardly knew how to thank him for saving her life A year ago she would have got up and kissed him innocently but a year makes a great difference She could not do that now so she gave him her little hand and held his till he came and sat down at his place at the table Oh Charley I don t know what to say to you said she and he could see and feel that her whole body was shaking with emotion Then I ll tell you what to say Charley here is your tea and some bread and some butter and some jam and some muffin for I ll tell you what my evening bath has made me as hungry as a hunter I hope it has done the same to you Katie still holding his hand looked up into his face and he saw that her eyes were suffused with tears She then left his side and running round the room filled a plate with all the things he had asked for and bringing them to him again took her place beside him I wish I knew how to do more than that said she I suppose Charley you ll have to make an entry about that barge on Monday morning won t you said Linda Mind you put in it how beautiful I looked sailing through the arch Yes and how very gallant the bargeman was said Norman Yes and how much you enjoyed the idea of going down the river with him while we came back to the Cottage said Charley We ll put it all down at the Navigation and old Snape shall make a special minute about it Katie drank her tea in silence and tried to eat though without much success When chatting voices and jokes were to be heard at the Cottage the sound of her voice was usually the foremost but now she sat demure and quiet She was realizing the danger from which she had escaped and as is so often the case was beginning to fear it now that it was over Ah Katie my bonny bird said her mother seeing that she was not herself and knowing that the excitement and overpowering feelings of gratitude were too much for her come here you should be in bed my foolish little puss should you not Indeed she should said Uncle Bat who was somewhat hard hearted about the affair of the accident and had been cruel enough after hearing an account of it to declare that it was all Katie s fault Indeed she should and if she had gone to bed a little earlier in the evening it would have been all the better for Master Norman s boat Oh mamma don t send me to bed said she with tears in her eyes Pray don t send me to bed now I m quite well only I can t talk because I m thinking of what Charley did for me and so saying she got up and hiding her face on her mother s shoulder burst into tears My dearest child said missus Woodward I m afraid you ll make yourself ill We ll put off the reading won t we Charley We have done enough for one evening Of course we will said he Reading a stupid story will be very slow work after all we ve gone through today No no no said Katie it shan t be put off there won t be any other time for hearing it And mamma it must be read and I know it won t be stupid Oh mamma dear mamma do let us hear it read I m quite well now missus Woodward found herself obliged to give way She had not the heart to bid her daughter go away to bed nor had she done so would it have been of any avail Katie would only have lain and sobbed in her own room and very probably have gone into hysterics The best thing for her was to try to turn the current of her thoughts and thus by degrees tame down her excited feelings Well darling then we will have the story if Charley will let us Go and fetch it dearest Katie raised herself from her mother s bosom and going across the room fetched the roll of papers to Charley As he prepared to take it she took his hand in hers and bending her head over it tenderly kissed it You mustn t think said she that because I say nothing I don t know what it is that you ve done for me but I don t know how to say it Charley was at any rate as ignorant what he ought to say as Katie was He felt the pressure of her warm lips on his hand and hardly knew where he was He felt that he blushed and looked abashed and dreaded fearfully dreaded lest missus Woodward should surmise that he estimated at other than its intended worth her daughter s show of affection for him I shouldn t mind doing it every night said he in such weather as this I think it rather good fun going into the water with my clothes on Katie looked up at him through her tears as though she would say that she well understood what that meant missus Woodward saw that if the story was to be read the sooner they began it the better Come Charley said she now for the romance Katie come and sit by me But Katie had already taken her seat a little behind Charley quite in the shade and she was not to be moved But I won t read it myself said Charley you must read it missus Woodward O yes missus Woodward you are to read it said Norman O yes do read it manna said Linda Katie said nothing but she would have preferred that Charley should have read it himself Well if I can said missus Woodward Snape says I write the worst hand in all Somerset House said Charley but still I think you ll be able to manage it I hate that mister Snape said Katie sotto voce And then missus Woodward unrolled the manuscript and began her task CHAPTER XXII CRINOLINE AND MACASSAR OR MY AUNT S WILL Well Linda was right said missus Woodward it does begin with poetry It s only a song said Charley apologetically and after all there is only one verse of that and then missus Woodward began CRINOLINE AND MACASSAR Ladies and gentlemen that is the name of mister Charles Tudor s new novel Crinoline and Macassar said Uncle Bat Are they intended for human beings names They are the heroine and the hero as I take it said missus Woodward and I presume them to be human unless they turn out to be celestial I never heard such names in my life said the captain At any rate uncle they are as good as Sir Jib Boom and Captain Hardaport said Katie pertly We won t mind about that said missus Woodward I m going to begin and I beg I may not be interrupted CRINOLINE AND MACASSAR The lovely Crinoline was sitting alone at a lattice window on a summer morning and as she sat she sang with melancholy cadence the first part of the now celebrated song which had then lately appeared from the distinguished pen of Sir G H Who is Sir G H Charley Oh it wouldn t do for me to tell that said Charley That must be left to the tact and intelligence of my readers Oh very well said missus Woodward we will abstain from all impertinent questions from the distinguished pen of Sir G H The ditty which she sang ran as follows My heart s at my office my heart is always there My heart s at my office docketing with care Docketing the papers and copying all day My heart s at my office though I be far away Ah me said the Lady Crinoline What is she a peer s daughter said Uncle Bat Not exactly said Charley it s only a sort of semi poetic way one has of speaking of one s heroine Ah me said the Lady Crinoline his heart his heart I wonder whether he has got a heart and then she sang again in low plaintive voice the first line of the song suiting the cadence to her own case His heart is at his office his heart is always there It was evident that the Lady Crinoline did not repeat the words in the feeling of their great author who when he wrote them had intended to excite to high deeds of exalted merit that portion of the British youth which is employed in the Civil Service of the country Crinoline laid down her lute it was in fact an accordion and gazing listlessly over the rails of the balcony looked out at the green foliage which adorned the enclosure of the square below It was Tavistock Square The winds of March and the showers of April had been successful in producing the buds of May Ah Charley that s taken from the old song said Katie only you ve put buds instead of flowers That s quite allowable said missus Woodward successful in producing the buds of May The sparrows chirped sweetly on the house top and the coming summer gladdened the hearts of all of all except poor Crinoline I wonder whether he has a heart said she and if he has I wonder whether it is at his office As she thus soliloquized the door was opened by a youthful page on whose well formed breast buttons seemed to grow like mushrooms in the meadows in August mister Macassar Jones said the page and having so said he discreetly disappeared He was in his line of life a valuable member of society He had brought from his last place a twelvemonth s character that was creditable alike to his head and heart he was now found to be a trustworthy assistant in the household of the Lady Crinoline s mother and was the delight of his aged parents to whom he regularly remitted no inconsiderable portion of his wages Let it always be remembered that the life even of a page may be glorious All honour to the true and brave Goodness Charley how very moral you are said Linda Yes said he that s indispensable It s the intention of the Daily Delight always to hold up a career of virtue to the lower orders as the thing that pays Honesty high wages and hot dinners Those are our principles You ll have a deal to do before you ll bring the lower orders to agree with you said Uncle Bat We have a deal to do said Charley and we ll do it The power of the cheap press is unbounded As the page closed the door a light low melancholy step was heard to make its way across the drawing room Crinoline s heart had given one start when she had heard the announcement of the well known name She had once glanced with eager inquiring eye towards the door But not in vain to her had an excellent mother taught the proprieties of elegant life Long before Macassar Jones was present in the chamber she had snatched up the tambour frame that lay beside her and when he entered she was zealously engaged on the fox s head that was to ornament the toe of a left foot slipper Who shall dare to say that those slippers were intended to grace the feet of Macassar Jones But I suppose they were said Katie You must wait and see said her mother for my part I am not at all so sure of that Oh but I know they must be for she s in love with him said Katie Oh mister Macassar said the Lady Crinoline when he had drawn nigh to her and how are you to day This mention of his Christian name betrayed no undue familiarity as the two families were intimate and Macassar had four elder brothers I am so sorry mamma is not at home she will regret not seeing you amazingly Macassar had his hat in his hand and he stood a while gazing at the fox in the pattern Won t you sit down said Crinoline Is it very dusty in the street to day asked Crinoline and as she spoke she turned upon him a face wreathed in the sweetest smiles radiant with elegant courtesy and altogether expressive of extreme gentility unsullied propriety and a very high tone of female education Is it very dusty in the street to day Charmed by the involuntary grace of her action Macassar essayed to turn his head towards her as he replied he could not turn it much for he wore an all rounder but still he was enabled by a side glance to see more of that finished elegance than was perhaps good for his peace of mind Yes said he it is dusty it certainly is dusty rather but not very and then in most streets they ve got the water carts Ah I love those water carts said Crinoline the dust you know is so trying To the complexion suggested Macassar again looking round as best he might over the bulwark of his collar Crinoline laughed slightly it was perhaps hardly more than a simper and turning her lovely eyes from her work she said Well to the complexion if you will What would you gentlemen say if we ladies were to be careless of our complexions Macassar merely sighed gently perhaps he had no fitting answer perhaps his heart was too full for him to answer He sat with his eye fixed on his hat which still dangled in his hand but his mind s eye was far away Is it in his office thought Crinoline to herself or is it here Is it anywhere Have you learnt the song I sent you said he at last waking as it were from a trance Not yet said she that is not quite that is I could not sing it before strangers yet Strangers said Macassar and he looked at her again with an energy that produced results not beneficial either to his neck or his collar Crinoline was delighted at this expression of feeling At any rate it is somewhere said she to herself and it can hardly be all at his office Well I will not say strangers she said out loud it sounds it sounds I don t know how it sounds But what I mean is that as yet I ve only sung it before mamma I declare I don t know which is the biggest fool of the two said Uncle Bat very rudely As for him if I had him on the forecastle of a man of war for a day or two I d soon teach him to speak out You forget sir said Charley he s not a sailor he s only in the Civil Service we re all very bashful in the Civil Service I think he is rather spooney I must say said Katie whereupon missus Woodward went on reading It s a sweet thing isn t it said Macassar Oh very said Crinoline with a rapturous expression which pervaded her whole head and shoulders as well as her face and bust very sweet and so new It quite comes home to me said Macassar and he sighed deeply Then it is at his office said Crinoline to herself and she sighed also They both sat silent for a while looking into the square Crinoline was at one window and Macassar at the other I must go now said he I promised to be back at three Back where said she At my office said he Crinoline sighed After all it was at his office it was too evident that it was there and nowhere else Well and why should it not be there why should not Macassar Jones be true to his duty and to his country What had she to do with his heart Why should she wish it elsewhere Twas thus she tried to console herself but in vain Had she had an office of her own it might perhaps have been different but Crinoline was only a woman and often she sighed over the degradation of her lot Good morning Miss Crinoline said he Good morning mister Macassar said she mamma will so regret that she has lost the pleasure of seeing you And then she rung the bell Macassar went downstairs perhaps somewhat slower with perhaps more of melancholy than when he entered The page opened the hall door with alacrity and shut it behind him with a slam All honour to the true and brave Crinoline again took up the note of her sorrow and with her lute in her hand she warbled forth the line which stuck like a thorn in her sweet bosom His heart is in his office his heart IS ALWAYS there There said missus Woodward that s the end of the first chapter Well I like the page the best said Linda because he seems to know what he is about Oh so does the lady said Charley but it wouldn t at all do if we made the hero and heroine go about their work like humdrum people You ll see that the Lady Crinoline knows very well what s what Oh Charley pray don t tell us said Katie I do so like mister Macassar he is so spooney pray go on mamma I m ready said missus Woodward again taking up the manuscript CHAPTER II The lovely Crinoline was the only daughter of fond parents and though they were not what might be called extremely wealthy considering the vast incomes of some residents in the metropolis and were not perhaps wont to mix in the highest circles of the Belgravian aristocracy yet she was enabled to dress in all the elegance of fashion and contrived to see a good deal of that society which moves in the highly respectable neighbourhood of Russell Square and Gower Street Her dresses were made at the distinguished establishment of Madame Mantalini in Hanover Square at least she was in the habit of getting one dress there every other season and this was quite sufficient among her friends to give her a reputation for dealing in the proper quarter Once she had got a bonnet direct from Paris which gave her ample opportunity of expressing a frequent opinion not favourable to the fabricators of a British article She always took care that her shoes had within them the name of a French cordonnier and her gloves were made to order in the Rue Du Bac though usually bought and paid for in Tottenham Court Road What a false creature said Linda False said Charley and how is a girl to get along if she be not false What girl could live for a moment before the world if she were to tell the whole truth about the get up of her wardrobe the patchings and make believes the chipped ribbons and turned silks the little bills here and the little bills there How else is an allowance of Ltwenty a year to be made compatible with an appearance of unlimited income How else are young men to be taught to think that in an affair of dress money is a matter of no moment whatsoever Oh Charley Charley don t be slanderous said missus Woodward I only repeat what the editor says to me I know nothing about it myself Only we are requested to hold the mirror up to nature and to art too I believe We are to set these things right you know We who are we said Katie Why the Daily Delight said Charley But I hope there s nothing false in patching and turning said missus Woodward for if there be I m the falsest woman alive To gar the auld claes look amaist as weel s the new is I thought one of the most legitimate objects of a woman s diligence It all depends on the spirit of the stitches said Charley the censor Well I must say I don t like mending up old clothes a bit better than Charley does said Katie but pray go on mamma so missus Woodward continued to read On the day of Macassar s visit in Tavistock Square Crinoline was dressed in a most elegant morning costume It was a very light barege muslin extremely full and which as she had assured her friend Miss Manasseh of Keppel Street had been sent home from the establishment in Hanover Square only the day before I am aware that Miss Manasseh instantly propagated an ill natured report that she had seen the identical dress in a milliner s room up two pairs back in Store Street but then Miss Manasseh was known to be envious and had moreover seen twelve seasons out in those localities whereas the fair Crinoline young thing had graced Tavistock Square only for two years and her mother was ready to swear that she had never passed the nursery door till she came there The ground of the dress was a light pea green and the pattern was ivy wreaths entwined with pansies and tulips each flounce showed a separate wreath and there were nine flounces the highest of which fairy circles was about three inches below the smallest waist that ever was tightly girded in steel and whalebone Macassar had once declared in a moment of ecstatic energy that a small waist was the chiefest grace in woman How often had the Lady Crinoline s maid when in the extreme agony of her labour put a malediction on his name on account of this speech It is unnecessary to speak of the drapery of the arms which showed the elaborate lace of the sleeve beneath and sometimes also the pearly whiteness of that rounded arm This was a sight which would almost drive Macassar to distraction At such moments as that the hopes of the patriotic poet for the good of the Civil Service were not strictly fulfilled in the heart of Macassar Jones Oh if the Lady Crinoline could but have known It is unnecessary also to describe the strange and hidden mechanism of that mysterious petticoat which gave such full dimensions such ample sweeping proportions to the tout ensemble of the lady s appearance It is unnecessary and would perhaps be improper and as far as I am concerned is certainly impossible Here Charley blushed as missus Woodward looked at him from over the top of the paper Let it suffice to say that she could envelop a sofa without the slightest effort throw her draperies a yard and a half from her on either side without any appearance of stretching completely fill a carriage or which was more frequently her fate entangle herself all but inextricably in a cab A word however must be said of those little feet that peeped out now and again so beautifully from beneath the artistic constructions above alluded to of the feet or perhaps rather of the shoes But yet what can be said of them successfully That French name so correctly spelt so elaborately accented so beautifully finished in gold letters which from their form however one would say that the cordonnier must have imported from England was only visible to those favoured knights who were occasionally permitted to carry the shoes home in their pockets But a word must be said about the hair dressed a l imperatrice redolent of the sweetest patchouli disclosing all the glories of that ingenuous but perhaps too open brow A word must be said but alas how inefficacious to do justice to the ingenuity so wonderfully displayed The hair of the Lady Crinoline was perhaps more lovely than abundant to produce that glorious effect that effect which has now symbolized among English lasses the head dress a l imperatrice as the one idea of feminine beauty every hair was called on to give its separate aid As is the case with so many of us who are anxious to put our best foot foremost everything was abstracted from the rear in order to create a show in the front Then to complete the garniture of the head to make all perfect to leave no point of escape for the susceptible admirer of modern beauty some dorsal appendage was necessary of mornings as well as in the more fully bedizened period of evening society Everything about the sweet Crinoline was wont to be green It is the sweetest and most innocent of colours but alas a colour dangerous for the heart s ease of youthful beauty Hanging from the back of her head were to be seen moss and fennel and various grasses rye grass and timothy trefoil and cinquefoil vetches and clover and here and there young fern A story was told but doubtless false as it was traced to the mouth of Miss Manasseh that once while Crinoline was reclining in a paddock at Richmond having escaped with the young Macassar from the heat of a neighbouring drawing room a cow had attempted to feed from her head Oh Charley a cow said Katie Well but you see I don t give it as true said Charley I shall never get it done if Katie won t hold her tongue said missus Woodward But perhaps it was when at the seaside in September at Broadstairs Herne Bay or Dover Crinoline and her mamma invigorated themselves with the sea breezes of the ocean perhaps it was there that she was enabled to assume that covering for her head in which her soul most delighted It was a Tom and Jerry hat turned up at the sides with a short but knowing feather velvet trimmings and a steel buckle blinking brightly in the noonday sun Had Macassar seen her in this he would have yielded himself her captive at once quarter or no quarter It was the most marked and perhaps the most attractive peculiarity of the Lady Crinoline s face that the end of her nose was a little turned up This charm in unison with the upturned edges of her cruel hearted hat was found by many men to be invincible We all know how dreadful is the spectacle of a Saracen s head as it appears or did appear painted on a huge board at the top of Snow Hill From that we are left to surmise with what tremendous audacity of countenance with what terror striking preparations of the outward man an Eastern army is led to battle Can any men so fearfully bold in appearance ever turn their backs and fly They look as though they could destroy by the glance of their ferocious eyes Who could withstand the hirsute horrors of those fiery faces There is just such audacity a courage of a similar description perhaps we may say an equal invincibility in the charms of those Tom and Jerry hats when duly put on over a face of the proper description over such a face as that of the Lady Crinoline They give to the wearer an appearance of concentration of pluck But as the Eastern array does quail before the quiet valour of Europe so we may perhaps say does the open quick audacity of the Tom and Jerry tend to less powerful results than the modest enduring patience of the bonnet So ends the second chapter bravo Charley said missus Woodward In the name of the British female public I beg to thank you for your exertions The editor said I was to write down turned up hats said Charley I rather like them myself I hope my new slouch is not an audacious Saracen s head said Linda Or mine said Katie But you may say what you like about them now for mine is drowned Come girls there are four more chapters I see Let me finish it and then we can discuss it afterwards CHAPTER III Having thus described the Lady Crinoline You haven t described her at all said Linda you haven t got beyond her clothes yet There is nothing beyond them said Charley You haven t even described her face said Katie you have only said that she had a turned up nose There is nothing further that one can say about it said Charley Having thus described the Lady Crinoline continued missus Woodward it now becomes our duty as impartial historians to give some account of mister Macassar Jones We are not prepared to give the exact name of the artist by whom mister Macassar Jones was turned out to the world so perfectly dressed a man Were we to do so the signal service done to one establishment by such an advertisement would draw down on us the anger of the trade at large and the tailors of London would be in league against the Daily Delight It is sufficient to remark that the artist s offices are not a hundred miles from Pall Mall Nor need we expressly name the bootmaker to whom is confided the task of making those feet small by degrees and beautifully less The process we understand has been painful but the effect is no doubt remunerative In three especial walks of dress has Macassar Jones been more than ordinarily careful to create a sensation and we believe we may assert that he has been successful in all We have already alluded to his feet Ascending from them and ascending not far we come to his coat It is needless to say that it is a frock needless to say that it is a long frock long as those usually worn by younger infants and apparently made so for the same purpose But look at the exquisitely small proportions of the collar look at the grace of the long sleeves the length of back the propriety the innate respectability the perfect decorum we had almost said the high moral worth of the whole Who would not willingly sacrifice any individual existence that he might become the exponent of such a coat Macassar Jones was proud to do so But he had bestowed perhaps the greatest amount of personal attention on his collar It was a matter more within his own grasp than those great and important articles to which attention has been already drawn but one nevertheless on which he was able to expend the whole amount of his energy and genius Some people may think that an all rounder is an all rounder and that if one is careful to get an all rounder one has done all that is necessary But so thought not Macassar Jones Some men wear collars of two plies of linen some men of three but Macassar Jones wore collars of four plies Some men some sensual self indulgent men appear to think that the collar should be made for the neck but Macassar Jones knew better He who never spared him self when the cause was good he knew that the neck had been made for the collar it was at any rate evident that such was the case with his own Little can be said of his head except that it was small narrow and genteel but his hat might be spoken of and perhaps with advantage Of the loose but studied tie of his inch wide cravat a paragraph might be made but we would fain not be tedious We will only further remark that he always carried with him a wonderful representation of himself like to him to a miracle only smaller in its dimensions like as a duodecimo is to a folio a babe as it were of his own begetting a little alter ego in which he took much delight It was his umbrella Look at the delicate finish of its lower extremity look at the long narrow and well made coat in which it is enveloped from its neck downwards without speck or blemish or wrinkle look at the little wooden head nicely polished with the effigy of a human face on one side of it little eyes it has and a sort of nose look closer at it and you will perceive a mouth not expressive indeed but still it is there a mouth and chin and is it or is it not an attempt at a pair of whiskers It certainly has a moustache Such were mister Macassar Jones and his umbrella He was an excellent clerk and did great credit to the important office to which he was attached namely that of the Episcopal Audit Board He was much beloved by the other gentlemen who were closely connected with him in that establishment and may be said for the first year or two of his service to have been not exactly the life and soul but we may perhaps say with more propriety the pervading genius of the room in which he sat But alas at length a cloud came over his brow At first it was but a changing shadow but it settled into a dark veil of sorrow which obscured all his virtues and made the worthy senior of his room shake his thin grey locks once and again He shook them more in sorrow than in anger for he knew that Macassar was in love and he remembered the days of his youth Yes Macassar was in love He had seen the lovely Crinoline To see was to admire to admire was to love to love that is to love her to love Crinoline the exalted the sought after the one so much in demand as he had once expressed himself to one of his bosom friends to love her was to despair He did despair and despairing sighed and sighing was idle But he was not all idle The genius of the man had that within it which did not permit itself to evaporate in mere sighs Sighs with the high minded force themselves into the guise of poetry and so it had been with him He got leave of absence for a week and shut himself up alone in his lodgings for a week in his lodgings during the long evenings of winter did he remain unseen and unheard of His landlady thought that he was in debt and his friends whispered abroad that he had caught scarlatina But at the end of the seven days he came forth pale indeed but with his countenance lighted up by ecstatic fire and as he started for his office he carefully folded and put into his pocket the elegantly written poem on which he had been so intently engaged I m so glad we are to have more poetry said Katie Is it another song You ll see said missus Woodward Macassar had many bosom friends at his office to all of whom one by one he had confided the tale of his love For a while he doubted to which of them he should confide the secret of his inspiration but genius will not hide its head under a bushel and thus before long did Macassar s song become the common property of the Episcopal Audit Board Even the Bishops sang it so Macassar was assured by one of his brother clerks who was made of a coarser clay than his colleague even the Bishops sang it when they met in council together on their own peculiar bench It would be useless to give the whole of it here for it contained ten verses The last two were those which Macassar was wont to sing to himself as he wandered lonely under the elms of Kensington Gardens Oh how she walks And how she talks And sings like a bird serene But of this be sure While the world shall endure The loveliest lady that ll ever be seen Will still be the Lady Crinoline The lovely Lady Crinoline With her hair done all a l imperatrice Sweetly done with the best of grease She looks like a Goddess or Queen And so I declare And solemnly swear That the loveliest lady that ever was seen Is still the Lady Crinoline The lovely Lady Crinoline And so ends the third chapter said missus Woodward Both Katie and Linda were beginning to criticize but missus Woodward repressed them sternly and went on with CHAPTER IV It was a lovely day towards the end of May that Macassar Jones presenting himself before the desk of the senior clerk at one o clock begged for permission to be absent for two hours The request was preferred with meek and hesitating voice and with downcast eyes The senior clerk shook his grey locks sadly sadly he shook his thin grey locks for he grieved at the sight which he saw Twas sad to see the energies of this young man thus sapped in his early youth by the all absorbing strength of a hopeless passion Crinoline was now as it were a household word at the Episcopal Audit Board The senior clerk believed her to be cruel and as he knew for what object these two hours of idleness were requested he shook his thin grey locks in sorrow I ll be back at three sir punctual said Macassar But mister Jones you are absent nearly every day for the same period To day shall be the last to day shall end it all said Macassar with a look of wretched desperation What what would Sir Gregory say said the senior clerk Macassar Jones sighed deeply Nature had not made the senior clerk a cruel man but yet this allusion was cruel The young Macassar had drunk deeply of the waters that welled from the fountain of Sir Gregory s philosophy He had been proud to sit humbly at the feet of such a Gamaliel and now it rent his young heart to be thus twitted with the displeasure of the great master whom he so loved and so admired Well go mister Jones said the senior clerk go but as you go resolve that to morrow you will remain at your desk Now go and may prosperity attend you All shall be decided to day said Macassar and as he spoke an unusual spark gleamed in his eye He went and as he went the senior clerk shook his thin grey hairs He was a bachelor and he distrusted the charms of the sex Macassar returning to his desk took up his hat and his umbrella and went forth His indeed was a plight at which that old senior clerk might well shake his thin grey hairs in sorrow for Macassar was the victim of mysterious circumstances which from his youth upwards had marked him out for a fate of no ordinary nature The tale must now be told O dear said Linda is it something horrid I hope it is said Katie perhaps he s already married to some old hag or witch You don t say who his father and mother are but I suppose he ll turn out to be somebody else s son said Linda He s a very nice young man for a small tea party at any rate said Uncle Bat The tale must now be told continued missus Woodward In his early years Macassar Jones had had a maiden aunt This lady died Oh mamma if you read it in that way I shall certainly cry said Katie Well my dear if your heart is so susceptible you had better indulge it This lady died and left behind her What said Linda A diamond ring said Katie A sealed manuscript which was found in a secret drawer suggested Linda Perhaps a baby said Uncle Bat And left behind her a will Did she leave anything else asked Norman Ladies and gentlemen if I am to be interrupted in this way I really must resign my task said missus Woodward we shall never get to bed I won t say another word said Katie In his early years Macassar had had a maiden aunt This lady died and left behind her a will in which with many expressions of the warmest affection and fullest confidence she left Lthree thousand in the three per cents What are the three per cents said Katie The three per cents is a way in which people get some of their money to spend regularly when they have got a large sum locked up somewhere said Linda Oh said Katie Will you hold your tongue miss said missus Woodward Left Lthree thousand in the three per cents to her nephew But she left it on these conditions that he should be married before he was twenty five and that he should have a child lawfully born in the bonds of wedlock before he was twenty six And then the will went on to state that the interest of the money should accumulate till Macassar had attained the latter age and that in the event of his having failed to comply with the conditions and stipulations above named the whole money principal and interest should be set aside and by no means given up to the said Macassar but applied to the uses purposes and convenience of that excellent charitable institution denominated the Princess Charlotte s Lying in Hospital Now the nature of this will had been told in confidence by Macassar to some of his brother clerks and was consequently well known at the Episcopal Audit Board It had given rise there to a spirit of speculation against which the senior clerk had protested in vain Bets were made some in favour of Macassar and some in that of the hospital but of late the odds were going much against our hero It was well known that in three short months he would attain that disastrous age which if it found him a bachelor would find him also denuded of his legacy And then how short a margin remained for the second event The odds were daily rising against Macassar and as he heard the bets offered and taken at the surrounding desks his heart quailed within him And the lovely Crinoline she also had heard of this eccentric will she and her mother Lthree thousand with interest arising for some half score of years would make a settlement by no means despicable in Tavistock Square and would enable Macassar to maintain a house over which even Crinoline need not be ashamed to preside But what if the legacy should be lost She also knew to a day what was the age of her swain she knew how close upon her was that day which if she passed it unwedded would see her resolved to be deaf for ever to the vows of Macassar Still if she managed well there might be time at any rate for the marriage But alas Macassar made no vows none at least which the most attentive ear could consider to be audible Crinoline s ear was attentive but hitherto in vain He would come there daily to Tavistock Square daily would that true and valiant page lay open the path to his mistress s feet daily would Macassar sit there for a while and sigh But the envious hour would pass away while the wished for word was still unsaid and he would hurry back and complete with figures too often erroneous the audit of some diocesan balance You must help him my dear said Crinoline s mamma But he says nothing mamma said Crinoline in tears You must encourage him to speak my dear I do encourage him but by that time it is always three o clock and then he has to go away You should be quicker my dear You should encourage him more at once Now try to day if you can t do anything to day I really must get your papa to interfere Crinoline had ever been an obedient child and now as ever she determined to obey But it was a hard task for her In three months he would be twenty five in fifteen months twenty six She however would do her best and then if her efforts were unavailing she could only trust to Providence and her papa With sad and anxious heart did Macassar that day take up his new silk hat take up also his darling umbrella and descend the sombre steps of the Episcopal Audit Office Seven to one on the Lying in were the last words which reached his ears as the door of his room closed behind him His was a dreadful position What if that sweet girl that angel whom he so worshipped what if she melted by his tale of sorrow that is if he could prevail on himself to tell it should take pity and consent to be hurried prematurely to the altar of Hymen and then if after all the legacy should be forfeited Poverty for himself he could endure at least he thought so but poverty for her could he bear that What if he should live to see her deprived of that green headdress robbed of those copious draperies reduced to English shoes compelled to desert that shrine in Hanover Square and all through him His brain reeled round his head swam his temples throbbed his knees knocked against each other his blood stagnated his heart collapsed a cold clammy perspiration covered him from head to foot he could hardly reach the courtyard and there obtain the support of a pillar Dreadful thoughts filled his mind the Thames the friendly Thames was running close to him should he not put a speedy end to all his misery Those horrid words that seven to one on the Lying in still rang in his ears were the chances really seven to one against his getting his legacy Oh said he my aunt my aunt my aunt my aunt my aunt But at last he roused the spirit of the man within him Faint heart never won fair lady seemed to be whispered to him from every stone in Somerset House The cool air blowing through the passages revived him and he walked forth through the wide portals resolving that he would return a happy thriving lover or that he would return no more that night What would he care for Sir Gregory what for the thin locks of the senior clerk if Crinoline should reject him It was his custom as he walked towards Tavistock Square to stop at a friendly pastry cook s in Covent Garden and revive his spirits for the coming interview with Banbury tarts and cherry brandy In the moments of his misery something about the pastry cook s girl something that reminded him of Crinoline it was probably her nose had tempted him to confide to her his love He had told her everything the kind young creature pitied him and as she ministered to his wants was wont to ask sweetly as to his passion And how was the lovely Lady Crinoline yesterday asked she He had entrusted to her a copy of his poem More beauteous than ever he said but somewhat indistinctly for his mouth was clogged with the Banbury tart And good natured I hope Indeed I don t know how she can resist said the girl I m sure you ll make it all right to day for I see you ve got your winning way with you Winning way with seven to one against him Macassar sighed and spilt some of his cherry brandy over his shirt front The kind hearted girl came and wiped it for him I think I ll have another glass said he with a deep voice He did take another glass and also ate another tart He ll pop to day as sure as eggs now he s taken them two glasses of popping powder said the girl as he went out of the shop Well it s astonishing to me what the men find to be afraid of And so Macassar hastened towards Tavistock Square all too quickly for as he made his way across Great Russell Street he found that he was very hot He leant against the rail and taking off his hat and gloves began to cool himself and wipe away the dust with his pocket handkerchief I wouldn t have minded the expense of a cab said he to himself only the chances are so much against me seven to one But he had no time to lose He had had but two precious hours at his disposal and thirty minutes were already gone He hurried on to Tavistock Square and soon found that well known door open before him The Lady Crinoline sits upstairs alone said the page and is a thinking of you Then he added in a whisper Do you go at her straight mister Macassar slip slap and no mistake All honour to the true and brave CHAPTER V As Macassar walked across the drawing room Crinoline failed to perceive his presence although his boots did creak rather loudly Such at least must be presumed to have been the case for she made no immediate sign of having noticed him She was sitting at the open window with her lute in hand gazing into the vacancy of the square below and as Macassar walked across the room a deep sigh escaped from her bosom The page closed the door and at the same moment Crinoline touched her lute or rather pulled it at the top and bottom and threw one wild witch note to the wind As she did so a line of a song escaped from her lips with a low melancholy but still rapturous cadence His heart is at his office his heart is always there Oh mister Macassar is that you she exclaimed She struggled to rise but finding herself unequal to the effort she sank back again on a chair dropped her lute on a soft footstool and then buried her face in her hands It was dreadful for Macassar to witness such agony Is anything the matter said he The matter said she Ah ah I hope you are not sick said he Sick said she Well I fear I am very sick What is it said he Perhaps only bilious he suggested Oh oh oh said she I see I m in the way and I think I had better go and so he prepared to depart No no no said she jumping up from her chair Oh mister Macassar don t be so cruel Do you wish to see me sink on the carpet before your feet Macassar denied the existence of any such wish and said that he humbly begged her pardon if he gave any offence Offence said she smiling sweetly on him sweetly but yet sadly Offence no no offence Indeed I don t know how you could but never mind I am such a silly thing One s feelings will sometimes get the better of one don t you often find it so O yes quite so said Macassar I think it s the heat He s a downright noodle said Crinoline s mamma to her sister in law who lived with them The two were standing behind a chink in the door which separated the drawing room from a chamber behind it Won t you sit down mister Macassar Macassar sat down Mamma will be so sorry to miss you again She s calling somewhere in Grosvenor Square I believe She wanted me to go with her but I could not bring myself to go with her to day It s useless for the body to go out when the heart still remains at home Don t you find it so Oh quite so said Macassar The cherry brandy had already evaporated before the blaze of all that beauty and he was bethinking himself how he might best take himself off Let the hospital have the filthy lucre He would let the money go and would show the world that he loved for the sake of love alone He looked at his watch and found that it was already past two Crinoline when she saw that watch knew that something must be done at once She appreciated more fully than her lover did the value of this world s goods and much as she doubtless sympathized with the wants of the hospital in question she felt that charity should begin at home So she fairly burst out into a flood of tears Macassar was quite beside himself He had seen her weep before but never with such frightful violence She rushed up from her chair and passing so close to him as nearly to upset him by the waft of her petticoats threw herself on to an ottoman and hiding her face on the stump in the middle of it sobbed and screeched till Macassar feared that the buttons behind her dress would crack and fly off Oh oh oh sobbed Crinoline It must be the heat said Macassar knocking down a flower pot in his attempt to open the window a little wider O dear what have I done said he I think I d better go Never mind the flower pot said Crinoline looking up through her tears Oh oh oh oh me Oh my heart Macassar looked at his watch He had only forty five minutes left for everything The expense of a cab would to be sure be nothing if he were successful but then what chance was there of that Can I do anything for you in the Strand said he I must be at my office at three In the Strand she screeched What could he do for me in the Strand Heartless heartless heartless Well go go go to your office mister Macassar your heart is there I know It is always there Go don t let me stand between you and your duties between you and Sir Gregory Oh how I hate that man Go why should I wish to prevent you Of course I have no such wish To me it is quite indifferent only mamma will be so sorry to miss you You don t know how mamma loves you She loves you almost as a son But go go pray go And then Crinoline looked at him Oh how she looked at him It was as though all the goddesses of heaven were inviting him to come and eat ambrosia with them on a rosy tinted cloud All the goddesses did we say No but one goddess the most beautiful of them all His heart beat violently against his ribs and he felt that he was almost man enough for anything Instinctively his hand went again to his waistcoat pocket You shan t look at your watch so often said she putting up her delicate hand and stopping his There I ll look at it for you It s only just two and you needn t go to your office for this hour and as she squeezed it back into his pocket he felt her fingers pressing against his heart and felt her hair done all a l imperatrice in sweet contact with his cheek There I shall hold it there said she so that you shan t look at it again Will you stay till I bid you go said Crinoline Macassar declared that he did not care a straw for the senior clerk or for Sir Gregory either He would stay there for ever he said What for ever in mamma s drawing room said Crinoline opening wide her lovely eyes with surprise For ever near to you said Macassar Oh mister Macassar said Crinoline dropping her hand from his waistcoat and looking bashfully towards the ground what can you mean Down went Macassar on his knees and down went Crinoline into her chair There was perhaps rather too much distance between them but that did not much matter now There he was on both knees with his hands clasped together as they were wont to be when he said his prayers with his umbrella beside him on one side and his hat on the other making his declaration in full and unmistakable terms A yard or two of floor more or less between them was neither here nor there At first the bashful Crinoline could not bring herself to utter a distinct consent and Macassar was very nearly up and away in a returning fit of despair But her good nature came to his aid and as she quickly said I will I will I will he returned to his posture in somewhat nearer quarters and was transported into the seventh heaven by the bliss of kissing her hand Oh Macassar said she Oh Crinoline said he You must come and tell papa to morrow said she He readily promised to do so You had better come to breakfast before he goes into the city said she And so the matter was arranged and the lovely Lady Crinoline became the affianced bride of the happy Macassar It was past three when he left the house but what did he care for that He was so mad with joy that he did not even know whither he was going He went on straight ahead and came to no check till he found himself waving his hat over his head in the New Road He then began to conceive that his conduct must have been rather wild for he was brought to a stand still in a crossing by four or five cabmen who were rival candidates for his custom Somerset House old brick he shouted out as he jumped into a hansom and as he did so he poked one of the other cabbies playfully in the ribs with his umbrella Is mamma don t know as ow e s hout I shouldn t vonder said the cabman and away went Macassar singing at the top of his voice as he sat in the cab The loveliest lady that ever was seen Is the lovely Lady Crinoline The cab passed through Covent Garden on its way Stop at the pastry cook s at the corner said Macassar up through the little trap door The cab drew up suddenly She s mine she s mine shouted Macassar rushing into the shop and disregarding in the ecstasy of the moment the various customers who were quietly eating their ices She s mine she s mine With her hair done all a l imperatrice Sweetly done with the best of grease And now for Somerset House Arrived at those ancient portals he recklessly threw eighteenpence to the cabman and ran up the stone stairs which led to his office As he did so the clock with iron tongue tolled four But what recked he what it tolled He rushed into his room where his colleagues were now locking their desks and waving abroad his hat and his umbrella repeated the chorus of his song She s mine she s mine The loveliest lady that ever was seen Is the lovely Lady Crinoline and she s mine she s mine Exhausted nature could no more He sank into a chair and his brother clerks stood in a circle around him Soon a spirit of triumph seemed to actuate them all they joined hands in that friendly circle and dancing with joyful glee took up with one voice the burden of the song Oh how she walks And how she talks And sings like a bird serene But of this be sure While the world shall endure The loveliest lady that ever was seen Is still the Lady Crinoline The lovely Lady Crinoline And that old senior clerk with the thin grey hair was he angry at this general ebullition of joy O no The just severity of his discipline was always tempered with genial mercy Not a word did he say of that broken promise not a word of the unchecked diocesan balance not a word of Sir Gregory s anger He shook his thin grey locks but he shook them neither in sorrow nor in anger God bless you Macassar Jones said he God bless you He too had once been young had once loved had once hoped and feared and hoped again and had once knelt at the feet of beauty But alas he had knelt in vain May God be with you Macassar Jones said he as he walked out of the office door with his coloured bandana pressed to his eyes May God be with you and make your bed fruitful For the loveliest lady that ever was seen Is the lovely Lady Crinoline shouted the junior clerks still dancing in mad glee round the happy lover We have said that they all joined in this kindly congratulation to their young friend But no There was one spirit there whom envy had soured one whom the happiness of another had made miserable one whose heart beat in no unison with these jocund sounds As Macassar s joy was at its height in the proud moment of his triumph a hated voice struck his ears and filled his soul with dismay once more There s two to one still on the Lying in said this hateful Lucifer And so Macassar was not all happy even yet as he walked home to his lodgings CHAPTER VI We have but one other scene to record but one short scene and then our tale will be told and our task will be done And this last scene shall not after the usual manner of novelists be that of the wedding but rather one which in our eyes is of a much more enduring interest Crinoline and Macassar were duly married in Bloomsbury Church The dresses are said to have come from the house in Hanover Square Crinoline behaved herself with perfect propriety and Macassar went through his work like a man When we have said that we have said all that need be said on that subject But we must beg our readers to pass over the space of the next twelve months and to be present with us in that front sitting room of the elegant private lodgings which the married couple now prudently occupied in Alfred Place Lodgings yes they were only lodgings for not as yet did they know what might be the extent of their income In this room during the whole of a long autumn day sat Macassar in a frame of mind not altogether to be envied During the greater portion of it he was alone but ever and anon some bustling woman would enter and depart without even deigning to notice the questions which he asked And then after a while he found himself in company with a very respectable gentleman in black who belonged to the medical profession Is it coming asked Macassar Is it is it coming Well we hope so we hope so said the medical gentleman If not to day it will be to morrow If I should happen to be absent missus Gamp is all that you could desire If not to day it will certainly be to morrow and so the medical gentleman went his way Now the coming morrow would be Macassar s birthday On that morrow he would be twenty six All alone he sat there till the autumn sun gave way to the shades of evening Some one brought him a mutton chop but it was raw and he could not eat he went to the sideboard and prepared to make himself a glass of negus but the water was all cold His water at least was cold though missus Gamp s was hot enough It was a sad and mournful evening He thought he would go out for he found that he was not wanted but a low drizzling rain prevented him Had he got wet he could not have changed his clothes for they were all in the wardrobe in his wife s room All alone he sat till the shades of evening were hidden by the veil of night But what sudden noise is that he hears within the house Why do those heavy steps press so rapidly against the stairs What feet are they which are so busy in the room above him He opens the sitting room door but he can see nothing He has been left there without a candle He peers up the stairs but a faint glimmer of light shining through the keyhole of his wife s door is all that meets his eye Oh my aunt my aunt he says as he leans against the banisters My aunt my aunt my aunt What a birthday will this be for him on the morrow He already hears the sound of the hospital bells as they ring with joy at the acquisition of their new wealth he must dash from his lips tear from his heart banish for ever from his eyes that vision of a sweet little cottage at Brompton with a charming dressing room for himself and gas laid on all over the house Lodgings I hate I detest lodgings he said to himself Connubial bliss and furnished lodgings are not compatible My aunt my aunt for what misery hast thou not to answer Oh missus Gamp could you be so obliging as to tell me what o clock it is The last question was asked as missus Gamp suddenly entered the room with a candle Macassar s watch had been required for the use of one of the servants It s just half past heleven this wery moment as is said missus Gamp and the finest boy babby as my heyes which has seen a many has ever sat upon Up up to the ceiling went the horsehair cushion of the lodging house sofa up went the footstool after it and its four wooden legs in falling made a terrible clatter on the mahogany loo table Macassar in his joy got hold of missus Gamp and kissed her heartily forgetful of the fumes of gin Hurrah shouted he hurrah hurrah hurrah Oh missus Gamp I feel so so so I really don t know how I feel He danced round the room with noisy joy till missus Gamp made him understand how very unsuited were such riotous ebullitions to the weak state of his lady love upstairs He then gave over not the dancing but the noise and went on capering round the room with suppressed steps ever and anon singing to himself in a whisper The loveliest lady that ever was seen Is still the Lady Crinoline A few minutes afterwards a knock at the door was heard and the monthly nurse entered She held something in her embrace but he could not see what He looked down pryingly into her arms and at the first glance thought that it was his umbrella But then he heard a little pipe and he knew that it was his child We will not intrude further on the first interview between Macassar and his heir And so ends the romantic history of Crinoline and Macassar said missus Woodward and I am sure Charley we are all very much obliged to you for the excellent moral lessons you have given us I m so delighted with it said Katie I do so like that Macassar So do I said Linda yawning and the old man with the thin grey hair Come girls it s nearly one o clock and we ll go to bed said the mother Uncle Bat has been asleep these two hours And so they went off to their respective chambers CHAPTER XXIII SURBITON COLLOQUIES All further conversation in the drawing room was forbidden for that night missus Woodward would have willingly postponed the reading of Charley s story so as to enable Katie to go to bed after the accident had she been able to do so But she was not able to do so without an exercise of a species of authority which was distasteful to her and which was very seldom heard seen or felt within the limits of Surbiton Cottage It would moreover have been very ungracious to snub Charley s manuscript just when Charley had made himself such a hero and she had therefore been obliged to read it But now that it was done she hurried Katie off to bed not without many admonitions Good night she said to Charley and God bless you and make you always as happy as we are now What a household we should have had to night had it not been for you Charley rubbed his eyes with his hand and muttered something about there not having been the slightest danger in the world And remember Charley she said paying no attention to his mutterings we always liked you liked you very much but liking and loving are very different things Now you are a dear dear friend one of the dearest In answer to this Charley was not even able to mutter so he went his way to the inn and lay awake half the night thinking how Katie had kissed his hand during the other half he dreamt first that Katie was drowned and then that Norah was his bride Linda and Katie had been so hurried off that they had only been just able to shake hands with Harry and Charley There is however an old proverb that though one man may lead a horse to water a thousand cannot make him drink It was easy to send Katie to bed but very difficult to prevent her talking when she was there Oh Linda she said what can I do for him Do for him said Linda I don t know that you can do anything for him I don t suppose he wants you to do anything Linda still looked on her sister as a child but Katie was beginning to put away childish things Couldn t I make something for him Linda something for him to keep as a present you know I would work so hard to get it done Work a pair of slippers as Crinoline did said Linda Katie was brushing her hair at the moment and then she sat still with the brush in her hand thinking No said she after a while not a pair of slippers I shouldn t like a pair of slippers Why not said Linda Oh I don t know but I shouldn t Katie had said that Crinoline was working slippers for Macassar because she was in love with him and having said so she could not now work slippers for Charley Poor Katie she was no longer a child when she thought thus Then make him a purse said Linda A purse is such a little thing Then work him the cover for a sofa like what mamma and I are doing for Gertrude But he hasn t got a house said Katie He ll have a house by the time you ve done the sofa and a wife to sit on it too Oh Linda you are so ill natured Why child what do you want me to say If you were to give him one of those grand long tobacco pipes they have in the shop windows that s what he d like the best or something of that sort I don t think he cares much for girls presents such as purses and slippers Doesn t he said Katie mournfully No not a bit You know he s such a rake Oh Linda I don t think he s so very bad indeed I don t and mamma doesn t think so and you know Harry said on Easter Sunday that he was much better than he used to be I know Harry is very good natured to him And isn t Charley just as good natured to Harry I am quite sure he is Harry has only to ask the least thing and Charley always does it Do you remember how Charley went up to town for him the Sunday before last And so he ought said Linda He ought to do whatever Harry tells him Well Linda I don t know why he ought said Katie They are not brothers you know nor yet even cousins But Harry is very so very so very superior you know said Linda I don t know any such thing said Katie Oh Katie don t you know that Charley is such a rake But rakes are just the people who don t do whatever they are told so that s no reason And I am quite sure that Charley is much the cleverer And I am quite sure he is not nor half so clever nor nearly so well educated Why don t you know the navvies are the most ignorant young men in London Charley says so himself That s his fun said Katie besides he always makes little of himself I am quite sure Harry could never have made all that about Macassar and Crinoline out of his own head No because he doesn t think of such nonsensical things I declare Miss Katie I think you are in love with Master Charley Katie who was still sitting at the dressing table blushed up to her forehead and at the same time her eyes were suffused with tears But there was no one to see either of those tell tale symptoms for Linda was in bed I know he saved my life said Katie as soon as she could trust herself to speak without betraying her emotion I know he jumped into the river after me and very very nearly drowned himself and I don t think any other man in the world would have done so much for me besides him Oh Katie Harry would in a moment Not for me perhaps he might for you though I m not quite sure that he would It was thus that Katie took her revenge on her sister I m quite sure he would for anybody even for Sally Sally was an assistant in the back kitchen But I don t mean to say Katie that you shouldn t feel grateful to Charley of course you should And so I do said Katie now bursting out into tears overdone by her emotion and fatigue and so I do and I do love him and will love him if he s ever so much a rake But you know Linda that is very different from being in love and it was very ill natured of you to say so very Linda was out of bed in a trice and sitting with her arm round her sister s neck Why you darling little foolish child you I was only quizzing said she Don t you know that I love Charley too But you shouldn t quiz about such a thing as that If you d fallen into the river and Harry had pulled you out then you d know what I mean but I m not at all sure that he could have done it Katie s perverse wickedness on this point was very nearly giving rise to another contest between the sisters Linda s common sense however prevailed and giving up the point of Harry s prowess she succeeded at last in getting Katie into bed You know mamma will be so angry if she hears us said Linda and I am sure you will be ill to morrow I don t care a bit about being ill to tomorrow and yet I do too she added after a pause for it s Sunday It would be so stupid not to be able to go out to morrow Well then try to go to sleep at once and Linda carefully tucked the clothes around her sister I think it shall be a purse said Katie A purse will certainly be the best that is if you don t like the slippers and Linda rolled herself up comfortably in the bed No I don t like the slippers at all It shall be a purse I can do that the quickest you know It s so stupid to give a thing when everything about it is forgotten isn t it Very stupid said Linda nearly asleep And when it s worn out I can make another can t I H m m m said Linda quite asleep And then Katie went asleep also in her sister s arms Early in the morning that is to say not very early perhaps between seven and eight missus Woodward came into their room and having inspected her charges desired that Katie should not get up for morning church but lie in bed till the middle of the day Oh mamma it will be so stupid not going to church after tumbling into the river people will say that all my clothes are wet People will about tell the truth as to some of them said missus Woodward but don t you mind about people but lie still and go to sleep if you can Linda do you come and dress in my room And is Charley to lie in bed too said Katie He was in the river longer than I was It s too late to keep Charley in bed said Linda for I see him coming along the road now with a towel he s been bathing Oh I do so wish I could go and bathe said Katie Poor Katie was kept in bed till the afternoon Charley and Harry however were allowed to come up to her bedroom door and hear her pronounce herself quite well How d ye do mister Macassar said she And how d ye do my Lady Crinoline said Harry After that Katie never called Charley mister Macassar again They all went to church and Katie was left to sleep or read or think of the new purse that she was to make as best she might And then they dined and then they walked out but still without Katie She was to get up and dress while they were out so as to receive them in state in the drawing room on their return Four of them walked together for Uncle Bat now usually took himself off to his friend at Hampton Court on Sunday afternoon missus Woodward walked with Charley and Harry and Linda paired together Now said Charley to himself now would have been the time to have told missus Woodward everything but for that accident of yesterday Now I can tell her nothing to do so now would be to demand her sympathy and to ask for assistance and so he determined to tell her nothing But the very cause which made Charley dumb on the subject of his own distresses made missus Woodward inquisitive about them She knew that his life was not like that of Harry steady sober and discreet but she felt that she did not like him or even love him the less on this account Nay it was not clear to her that these failings of his did not give him additional claims on her sympathies What could she do for him how could she relieve him how could she bring him back to the right way She spoke to him of his London life praised his talents encouraged him to exertion besought him to have some solicitude and above all some respect for himself And then with that delicacy which such a woman and none but such a woman can use in such a matter she asked him whether he was still in debt Charley with shame we must own it had on this subject been false to all his friends He had been false to his father and his mother and had never owned to them the half of what he owed he had been false to Alaric and false to Harry but now now at such a moment as this he would not allow himself to be false to missus Woodward Yes he said he was in debt rather missus Woodward pressed him to say whether his debts were heavy whether he owed much It s no use thinking of it missus Woodward said he not the least I know I ought not to come down here and I don t think I will any more Not come down here said missus Woodward Why not There s very little expense in that I dare say you d spend quite as much in London Oh of course three times as much perhaps that is if I had it but I don t mean that What do you mean said she Charley walked on in silence with melancholy look very crestfallen his thumbs stuck into his waistcoat pockets Upon my word I don t know what you mean said missus Woodward I should have thought coming to Hampton might perhaps perhaps have kept you I don t exactly mean out of mischief That however in spite of her denial was exactly what missus Woodward did mean So it does but said Charley now thoroughly ashamed of himself But what said she I am not fit to be here said Charley and as he spoke his manly self control all gave way and big tears rolled down his cheeks missus Woodward in her woman s heart resolved that if it might in any way be possible she would make him fit fit not only to be there but to hold his head up with the best in any company in which he might find himself She questioned him no further then Her wish now was not to torment him further but to comfort him She determined that she would consult with Harry and with her uncle and take counsel from them as to what steps might be taken to save the brand from the burning She talked to him as a mother might have done leaning on his arm as she returned leaning on him as a woman never leans on a man whom she deems unfit for her society All this Charley s heart and instinct fully understood and he was not ungrateful But yet he had but little to comfort him He must return to town on Monday return to mister Snape and the lock entries to mister M Ruen and the three Seasons to missus Davis Norah Geraghty and that horrid mister Peppermint He never once thought of Clementina Golightly to whom at that moment he was being married by the joint energies of Undy Scott and his cousin Alaric And what had Linda and Norman been doing all this time Had they been placing mutual confidence in each other No they had not come to that yet Linda still remembered the pang with which she had first heard of Gertrude s engagement and Harry Norman had not yet been able to open his seared heart to a second love In the course of the evening a letter was brought to Captain Cuttwater which did not seem to raise his spirits Whom is your letter from uncle said missus Woodward From Alaric said he gruffly crumpling it up and putting it into his pocket And then he turned to his rum and water in a manner that showed his determination to say nothing more on the matter In the morning Harry and Charley returned to town Captain Cuttwater went up with them and all was again quiet at Surbiton Cottage CHAPTER XXIV mister M BUFFER ACCEPTS THE CHILTERN HUNDREDS It was an anxious hour for the Honourable Undecimus Scott when he first learnt that mister M Buffer had accepted the Stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds The Stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds Does it never occur to anyone how many persons are appointed to that valuable situation Or does anyone ever reflect why a Member of Parliament when he wishes to resign his post of honour should not be simply gazetted in the newspapers as having done so instead of being named as the new Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds No one ever does think of it resigning and becoming a steward are one and the same thing with this difference however that one of the grand bulwarks of the British constitution is thus preserved Well mister M Buffer who having been elected by the independent electors of the Tillietudlem burghs to serve them in Parliament could not in accordance with the laws of the constitution have got himself out of that honourable but difficult position by any scheme of his own found himself on a sudden a free man the Queen having selected him to be her steward for the district in question We have no doubt but that the deed of appointment set forth that her Majesty had been moved to this step by the firm trust she had in the skill and fidelity of the said mister M Buffer but if so her Majesty s trust would seem to have been somewhat misplaced as mister M Buffer having been a managing director of a bankrupt swindle from which he had contrived to pillage some thirty or forty thousand pounds was now unable to show his face at Tillietudlem or in the House of Commons and in thus retreating from his membership had no object but to save himself from the expulsion which he feared It was however a consolation for him to think that in what he had done the bulwarks of the British constitution had been preserved It was an anxious moment for Undy The existing Parliament had still a year and a half or possibly two years and a half to run He had already been withdrawn from the public eye longer than he thought was suitable to the success of his career He particularly disliked obscurity for he had found that in his case obscurity had meant comparative poverty An obscure man as he observed early in life had nothing to sell Now Undy had once had something to sell and a very good market he had made of it He was of course anxious that those halcyon days should return Fond of him as the electors of Tillietudlem no doubt were devoted as they might be in a general way to his interests still still it was possible that they might forget him if he remained too long away from their embraces Out of sight out of mind is a proverb which opens to us the worst side of human nature But even at Tillietudlem nature s worst side might sometimes show itself Actuated by such feelings as these Undy heard with joy the tidings of M Buffer s stewardship and determined to rush to the battle at once Battle he knew there must be To be brought in for the district of Tillietudlem was a prize which had never yet fallen to any man s lot without a contest Tillietudlem was no poor pocket borough to be disposed of this way or that way according to the caprice or venal call of some aristocrat The men of Tillietudlem knew the value of their votes and would only give them according to their consciences The way to win these consciences to overcome the sensitive doubts of a free and independent Tillietudlem elector Undy knew to his cost It was almost a question as he once told Alaric whether all that he could sell was worth all that he was compelled to buy But having put his neck to the collar in this line of life he was not now going to withdraw Tillietudlem was once more vacant and Undy determined to try it again undaunted by former outlays To make an outlay however at any rate in electioneering matters it is necessary that a man should have in hand some ready cash at the present moment Undy had very little and therefore the news of mister M Buffer s retirement to the German baths for his health was not heard with unalloyed delight He first went into the city as men always do when they want money though in what portion of the city they find it has never come to the author s knowledge Charley Tudor to be sure did get Lfive by going to the Banks of Jordan but the supply likely to be derived from such a fountain as that would hardly be sufficient for Undy s wants Having done what he could in the city he came to Alaric and prayed for the assistance of all his friend s energies in the matter Alaric would not have been and was not unwilling to assist him to the extent of his own immediate means but his own immediate means were limited and Undy s desire for ready cash was almost unlimited There was a certain railway or proposed railway in Ireland in which Undy had ventured very deeply more so indeed than he had deemed it quite prudent to divulge to his friend and in order to gain certain ends he had induced Alaric to become a director of this line The line in question was the Great West Cork which was to run from Skibbereen to Bantry and the momentous question now hotly debated before the Railway Board was on the moot point of a branch to Ballydehob If Undy could carry the West Cork and Ballydehob branch entire he would make a pretty thing of it but if as there was too much reason to fear his Irish foes should prevail and leave as Undy had once said in an eloquent speech at a very influential meeting of shareholders and leave the unfortunate agricultural and commercial interest of Ballydehob steeped in Cimmerian darkness the chances were that poor Undy would be well nigh ruined Such being the case he had striven not unsuccessfully to draw Alaric into the concern Alaric had bought very cheaply a good many shares which many people said were worth nothing and had by dint of Undy s machinations been chosen a director on the board Undy himself meanwhile lay by hoping that fortune might restore him to Parliament and haply put him on that committee which must finally adjudicate as to the great question of the Ballydehob branch Such were the circumstances under which he came to Alaric with the view of raising such a sum of money as might enable him to overcome the scruples of the Tillietudlem electors and place himself in the shoes lately vacated by mister M Buffer They were sitting together after dinner when he commenced the subject He and missus Val and Clementina had done the Tudors the honour of dining with them and the ladies had now gone up into the drawing room and were busy talking over the Chiswick affair which was to come off in the next week and after which missus Val intended to give a small evening party to the most elite of her acquaintance We won t have all the world my dear she had said to Gertrude but just a few of our own set that are really nice Clementina is dying to try that new back step with M Jaquetanape so we won t crowd the room Such were the immediate arrangements of the Tudor and Scott party So M Buffer is off at last said Scott as he seated himself and filled his glass after closing the dining room door He brought his pigs to a bad market after all He was an infernal rogue said Alaric Well I suppose he was said Undy and a fool into the bargain to be found out He was a downright swindler said Alaric After all said the other not paying much attention to Alaric s indignation he did not do so very badly Why M Buffer has been at it now for thirteen years He began with nothing he had neither blood nor money and God knows he had no social merits to recommend him He is as vulgar as a hog as awkward as an elephant and as ugly as an ape I believe he never had a friend and was known at his club to be the greatest bore that ever came out of Scotland and yet for thirteen years he has lived on the fat of the land for five years he has been in Parliament his wife has gone about in her carriage and every man in the city has been willing to shake hands with him And what has it all come to said Alaric whom the question of M Buffer s temporary prosperity made rather thoughtful Well not so bad either he has had his fling for thirteen years and that s something Thirteen good years out of a man s life is more than falls to the lot of every one And then I suppose he has saved something And he is spoken of everywhere as a monster for whom hanging is too good Pshaw that won t hang him Yesterday he was a god to day he is a devil to morrow he ll be a man again that s all But you don t mean to tell me Undy that the consciousness of such crimes as those which M Buffer has committed must not make a man wretched in this world and probably in the next also Judge not and ye shall not be judged said Undy quoting Scripture as the devil did before him and as for consciousness of crime I suppose M Buffer has none at all I have no doubt he thinks himself quite as honest as the rest of the world He firmly believes that all of us are playing the same game and using the same means and has no idea whatever that dishonesty is objectionable And you what do you think about it yourself I think the greatest rogues are they who talk most of their honesty and therefore as I wish to be thought honest myself I never talk of my own They both sat silent for a while Undy bethinking himself what arguments would be most efficacious towards inducing Alaric to strip himself of every available shilling that he had and Alaric debating in his own mind that great question which he so often debated as to whether men men of the world the great and best men whom he saw around him really endeavoured to be honest or endeavoured only to seem so Honesty was preached to him on every side but did he in his intercourse with the world find men to be honest Or did it behove him a practical man like him a man so determined to battle with the world as he had determined did it behove such a one as he to be more honest than his neighbours He also encouraged himself by that mystic word Excelsior To him it was a watchword of battle repeated morning noon and night It was the prevailing idea of his life Excelsior Yes how great how grand how all absorbing is the idea But what if a man may be going down down to Tophet and yet think the while that he is scaling the walls of heaven But you wish to think yourself honest he said disturbing Undy just as that hero had determined on the way in which he would play his present hand of cards I have not the slightest difficulty about that said Undy and I dare say you have none either But as to M Buffer his going will be a great thing for us if as I don t doubt I can get his seat It will be a great thing for you said Alaric who as well as Undy had his Parliamentary ambition And for you too my boy We should carry the Ballydehob branch to a dead certainty and even if we did not do that we d bring it so near it that the expectation of it would send the shares up like mercury in fine weather They are at Ltwo twelves sixd now and if I am in the House next Session they ll be up to Lseven tens before Easter and what s more my dear fellow if we can t help ourselves in that way they ll be worth nothing in a very few months Alaric looked rather blank for he had invested deeply in this line of which he was now a director of a week s standing or perhaps we should say sitting He had sold out all his golden hopes in the Wheal Mary Jane for the sake of embarking his money and becoming a director in this Irish Railway and in one other speculation nearer home of which Undy had a great opinion viz the Limehouse Thames Bridge Company Such being the case he did not like to hear the West Cork with the Ballydehob branch spoken of so slightingly The fact is a man can do anything if he is in the House and he can do nothing if he is not said Undy You know our old Aberdeen saying You scratch me and I ll scratch you It is not only what a man may do himself for himself but it is what others will do for him when he is in a position to help them Now there are those fellows I am hand and glove with all of them but there is not one of them would lift a finger to help me as I am now but let me get my seat again and they ll do for me just anything I ask them Vigil moves the new writ to night I got a line from him asking me whether I was ready There was no good to be got by waiting so I told him to fire away I suppose you ll go down at once said Alaric Well that as may be at least yes that s my intention But there s one thing needful and that is the needful Money suggested Alaric Yes money cash rhino tin ready or by what other name the goddess would be pleased to have herself worshipped money sir there s the difficulty now as ever Even at Tillietudlem money will have its weight Can t your father assist you said Alaric My father I wonder how he d look if he got a letter from me asking for money You might as well expect a goose to feed her young with blood out of her own breast like a pelican as expect that a Scotch lord should give money to his younger sons like an English duke What would my father get by my being member for Tillietudlem No I must look nearer home than my father What can you do for me I Yes you said Undy I am sure you don t mean to say you ll refuse to lend me a helping hand if you can I must realize by the Ballydehobs if I am once in the House and then you d have your money back at once It is not that said Alaric but I haven t got it I am sure you could let me have a thousand or so said Undy I think a couple of thousand would carry it and I could make out the other myself Every shilling I have said Alaric is either in the Ballydehobs or in the Limehouse Bridge Why don t you sell yourself So I have said Undy everything that I can without utter ruin The Ballydehobs are not saleable as you know What can I do for you then Undy set himself again to think I have no doubt I could get a thousand on our joint names That blackguard M Ruen would do it Who is M Ruen asked Alaric A low blackguard of a discounting Jew Christian He would do it but then heaven knows what he would charge and he d make so many difficulties that I shouldn t have the money for the next fortnight I wouldn t have my name on a bill in such a man s hands on any account said Alaric Well I don t like it myself said Undy but what the deuce am I to do I might as well go to Tillietudlem without my head as without money I thought you d kept a lot of the Mary Janes said Alaric So I had but they re gone now I tell you I ve managed Lone thousand myself It would murder me now if the seat were to go into other hands I d get the Committee on the Limehouse Bridge and we should treble our money Vigil told me he would not refuse the Committee though of course the Government won t consent to a grant if they can help it Well Undy I can let you have Ltwo hundred fifty and that is every shilling I have at my banker s They would not let you overdraw a few hundreds suggested Undy I certainly shall not try them said Alaric You are so full of scruple so green so young said Undy almost in an enthusiasm of remonstrance What can be the harm of trying them My credit Fal lal What s the meaning of credit How are you to know whether you have got any credit if you don t try Come I ll tell you how you can do it Old Cuttwater would lend it you for the asking To this proposition Alaric at first turned a deaf ear but by degrees he allowed Undy to talk him over Undy showed him that if he lost the Tillietudlem burghs on this occasion it would be useless for him to attempt to stand for them again In such case he would have no alternative at the next general election but to stand for the borough of Strathbogy in Aberdeenshire whereas if he could secure Tillietudlem as a seat for himself all the Gaberlunzie interest in the borough of Strathbogy which was supposed to be by no means small should be transferred to Alaric himself Indeed Sandie Scott the eldest hope of the Gaberlunzie family would in such case himself propose Alaric to the electors Ca stalk Cottage in which the honorable Sandie lived and which was on the outskirts of the Gaberlunzie property was absolutely within the boundary of the borough Overcome by these and other arguments Alaric at last consented to ask from Captain Cuttwater the loan of Lseven hundred That sum Undy had agreed to accept as a sufficient contribution to that desirable public object the re seating himself for the Tillietudlem borough and as Alaric on reflection thought that it would be uncomfortable to be left penniless himself and as it was just as likely that Uncle Bat would lend him Lseven hundred as Lfive hundred he determined to ask for a loan of the entire sum He accordingly did so and the letter as we have seen reached the captain while Harry and Charley were at Surbiton Cottage The old gentleman was anything but pleased In the first place he liked his money though not with any overweening affection in the next place he had done a great deal for Alaric and did not like being asked to do more and lastly he feared that there must be some evil cause for the necessity of such a loan so soon after Alaric s marriage Alaric in making his application had not done so actually without making any explanation on the subject He wrote a long letter worded very cleverly which only served to mystify the captain as Alaric had intended that it should do Captain Cuttwater was most anxious that Alaric whom he looked on as his adopted son should rise in the world he would have been delighted to think that he might possibly live to see him in Parliament would probably have made considerable pecuniary sacrifice for such an object With the design therefore of softening Captain Cuttwater s heart Alaric in his letter had spoken about great changes that were coming of the necessity that there was of his stirring himself of the great pecuniary results to be expected from a small present expenditure and ended by declaring that the money was to be used in forwarding the election of his friend Scott for the Tillietudlem district burghs Now the fact was that Uncle Bat though he cared a great deal for Alaric did not care a rope s end for Undy Scott and could enjoy his rum punch just as keenly if mister Scott was in obscurity as he could possibly hope to do even if that gentleman should be promoted to be a Lord of the Treasury He was not at all pleased to think that his hard earned moidores should run down the gullies of the Tillietudlem boroughs in the shape of muddy ale or vitriolic whisky and yet this was the first request that Alaric had ever made to him and he did not like to refuse Alaric s first request So he came up to town himself on the following morning with Harry and Charley determined to reconcile all these difficulties by the light of his own wisdom In the evening he returned to Surbiton Cottage having been into the city sold out stock for Lseven hundred and handed over the money to Alaric Tudor On the following morning Undy Scott set out for Scotland properly freighted mister Whip Vigil having in due course moved for a new writ for the Tillietudlem borough in the place of mister M Buffer who had accepted the situation of Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds CHAPTER XXV CHISWICK GARDENS The following Thursday was as fine as a Chiswick flower show day ought to be and so very seldom is The party who had agreed to congregate there the party that is whom we are to meet was very select Linda and Katie had come up to spend a few days with their sister missus Val Clementina Gertrude and Linda were to go in a carriage for which Alaric was destined to pay and which missus Val had hired having selected it regardless of expense as one which by its decent exterior and polished outward graces conferred on its temporary occupiers an agreeable appearance of proprietorship The two Miss Neverbends sisters of Fidus were also to be with them and they with Katie followed humbly as became their station in a cab which was not only hired but which very vulgarly told the fact to all the world Slight as had been the intimacy between Fidus Neverbend and Alaric at Tavistock nevertheless a sort of friendship had since grown up between them Alaric had ascertained that Fidus might in a certain degree be useful to him that the good word of the Aristides of the Works and Buildings might be serviceable and that in short Neverbend was worth cultivating Neverbend on the other hand when he perceived that Tudor was likely to become a Civil Service hero a man to be named with glowing eulogy at all the Government Boards in London felt unconsciously a desire to pay him some of that reverence which a mortal always feels for a god And thus there was formed between them a sort of alliance which included also the ladies of the family Not that missus Val or even missus A Tudor encountered Lactimel and Ugolina Neverbend on equal terms There is a distressing habitual humility in many unmarried ladies of an uncertain age which at the first blush tells the tale against them which they are so painfully anxious to leave untold In order to maintain their places but yet a little longer in that delicious world of love sighs and dancing partners from which it must be so hard for a maiden with all her youthful tastes about her to tear herself for ever away they smile and say pretty things put up with the caprices of married women and play second fiddle though the doing so in no whit assists them in their task Nay the doing so does but stamp them the more plainly with that horrid name from which they would so fain escape Their plea is for mercy Have pity on me have pity on me put up with me but for one other short twelve months and then if then I shall still have failed I will be content to vanish from the world for ever When did such plea for pity from one woman ever find real entrance into the heart of another On such terms however the Misses Neverbend were content to follow missus Val to the Chiswick flower show and to feed on the crumbs which might chance to fall from the rich table of Miss Golightly to partake of broken meat in the shape of cast off adorers and regale themselves with lukewarm civility from the outsiders in the throng which followed that adorable heiress And yet the Misses Neverbend were quite as estimable as the divine Clementina and had once been perhaps as attractive as she is now They had never waltzed it is true as Miss Golightly waltzes It may be doubted indeed whether any lady ever did In the pursuit of that amusement Ugolina was apt to be stiff and ungainly and to turn herself or allow herself to be turned as though she were made of wood she was somewhat flat in her figure looking as though she had been uncomfortably pressed into an unbecoming thinness of substance and a corresponding breadth of surface and this conformation did not assist her in acquiring a graceful flowing style of motion The elder sister Lactimel was of a different form but yet hardly more fit to shine in the mazes of the dance than her sister She had her charms nevertheless which consisted of a somewhat stumpy dumpy comeliness She was altogether short in stature and very short below the knee She had fair hair and a fair skin small bones and copious soft flesh She had a trick of sighing gently in the evolutions of the waltz which young men attributed to her softness of heart and old ladies to her shortness of breath They both loved dancing dearly and were content to enjoy it whenever the chance might be given to them by the aid of Miss Golightly s crumbs The two sisters were as unlike in their inward lights as in their outward appearance Lactimel walked ever on the earth but Ugolina never deserted the clouds Lactimel talked prose and professed to read it Ugolina read poetry and professed to write it Lactimel was utilitarian Cui bono though probably in less classic phrase was the question she asked as to everything Ugolina was transcendental and denied that there could be real good in anything Lactimel would have clothed and fed the hungry and naked so that all mankind might be comfortable Ugolina would have brought mankind back to their original nakedness and have taught them to feed on the grasses of the field so that the claims of the body which so vitally oppose those of the mind might remain unheeded and despised They were both a little nebulous in their doctrines and apt to be somewhat unintelligible in their discourse when indulged in the delights of unrestrained conversation Lactimel had a theory that every poor brother might eat of the fat and drink of the sweet might lie softly and wear fine linen if only some body or bodies could be induced to do their duties and Ugolina was equally strong in a belief that if the mind were properly looked to all appreciation of human ill would cease But they delighted in generalizing rather than in detailed propositions and had not probably even in their own minds realized any exact idea as to the means by which the results they desired were to be brought about They toadied missus Val poor young women how little should they be blamed for this fault which came so naturally to them in their forlorn position they toadied missus Val and therefore missus Val bore with them they bored Gertrude and Gertrude for her husband s sake bore with them also they were confidential with Clementina and Clementina of course snubbed them They called Clementina the sweetest creature Lactimel declared that she was born to grace the position of a wife and mother and Ugolina swore that her face was perfect poetry Whereupon Clementina laughed aloud and elegantly made a grimace with her nose and mouth as she turned the perfect poetry to her mother Such were the ladies of the party who went to the Chiswick flower show and who afterwards were to figure at missus Val s little evening the dansant at which nobody was to be admitted who was not nice They were met at the gate of the Gardens by a party of young men of whom Victoire Jaquetanape was foremost Alaric and Charley were to come down there when their office work was done Undy was by this time on his road to Tillietudlem and Captain Val was playing billiards at his club The latter had given a promise that he would make his appearance a promise however which no one expected or wished him to keep The happy Victoire was dressed up to his eyes That perhaps is not saying much for he was only a few feet high but what he wanted in quantity he fully made up in quality He was a well made shining jaunty little Frenchman who seemed to be perfectly at ease with himself and all the world He had the smallest little pair of moustaches imaginable the smallest little imperial the smallest possible pair of boots and the smallest possible pair of gloves Nothing on earth could be nicer or sweeter or finer than he was But he did not carry his finery like a hog in armour as an Englishman so often does when an Englishman stoops to be fine It sat as naturally on Victoire as though he had been born in it He jumped about in his best patent leather boots apparently quite heedless whether he spoilt them or not and when he picked up Miss Golightly s parasol from the gravel he seemed to suffer no anxiety about his gloves He handed out the ladies one after another as though his life had been passed in handing out ladies as indeed it probably had in handing them out and handing them in and when missus Val s private carriage passed on he was just as courteous to the Misses Neverbend and Katie in their cab as he had been to the greater ladies who had descended from the more ambitious vehicle As Katie said afterwards to Linda when she found the free use of her voice in their own bedroom he was a darling little duck of a man only he smelt so strongly of tobacco But when they were once in the garden Victoire had no time for anyone but missus Val and Clementina He had done his duty by the Misses Neverbend and those other two insipid young English girls and now he had his own affairs to look after He also knew that Miss Golightly had Ltwenty thousand of her own He was one of those butterfly beings who seem to have been created that they may flutter about from flower to flower in the summer hours of such gala times as those now going on at Chiswick just as other butterflies do What the butterflies were last winter or what will become of them next winter no one but the naturalist thinks of inquiring How they may feed themselves on flower juice or on insects small enough to be their prey is matter of no moment to the general world It is sufficient that they flit about in the sunbeams and add bright glancing spangles to the beauty of the summer day And so it was with Victoire Jaquetanape He did no work He made no honey He appeared to no one in the more serious moments of life He was the reverse of Shylock he would neither buy with you nor sell with you but he would eat with you and drink with you as for praying he did little of that either with or without company He was clothed in purple and fine linen as butterflies should be clothed and fared sumptuously everyday but whence came his gay colours or why people fed him with pate and champagne nobody knew and nobody asked Like most Frenchmen of his class he never talked about himself He understood life and the art of pleasing and the necessity that he should please too well to do so All that his companions knew of him was that he came from France and that when the gloomy months came on in England the months so unfitted for a French butterfly he packed up his azure wings and sought some more genial climate certain to return and be seen again when the world of London became habitable If he had means of living no one knew it if he was in debt no one ever heard of it if he had a care in the world he concealed it He abounded in acquaintances who were always glad to see him and would have regarded it as quite de trop to have a friend Nevertheless time was flying on with him as with others and butterfly as he was the idea of Miss Golightly s Ltwenty thousand struck him with delightful amazement five hundred thousand francs five hundred thousand francs and so he resolved to dance his very best warm as the weather undoubtedly was at the present moment Ah he was charmed to see madame and mademoiselle look so charmingly he said walking between mother and daughter but paying apparently much the greater share of attention to the elder lady In this respect we Englishmen might certainly learn much from the manners of our dear allies We know well enough how to behave ourselves to our fair young countrywomen we can be civil enough to young women nature teaches us that but it is so seldom that we are sufficiently complaisant to be civil to old women And yet that after all is the soul of gallantry It is to the sex that we profess to do homage Our theory is that feminine weakness shall receive from man s strength humble and respectful service But where is the chivalry where the gallantry if we only do service in expectation of receiving such guerdon as rosy cheeks and laughing eyes can bestow It may be said that Victoire had an object in being civil to missus Val But the truth is all French Victoires are courteous to old ladies An Englishman may probably be as forward as a Frenchman in rushing into a flaming building to save an old woman s life but then it so rarely happens that occasion offers itself for gallantry such as that A man however may with ease be civil to a dozen old women in one day And so they went on walking through parterres and glass houses talking of theatres balls dinner parties picnics concerts operas of ladies married and single of single gentlemen who should be married and of married gentlemen who should be single of everything indeed except the flowers of which neither Victoire nor his companions took the slightest notice And madame really has a dance to night in her own house O yes said missus Val that is just a few quadrilles and waltzes for Clementina I really hardly know whether the people will take the carpet up or no The people consisting of the cook and housemaid for the page had of course come with the carriage were at this moment hard at work wrenching up the nails as missus Val was very well aware It will be delightful charming said Victoire Just a few people of our own set you know said missus Val no crowd or fuss or anything of that sort just a few people that we know are nice in a quiet homely way Ah that is so pleasing said M Victoire that is just what I like and is mademoiselle engaged for No Mademoiselle was not engaged either for or for or for c c c and then out came the little tablets under the dome of a huge greenhouse filled with the most costly exotics and Clementina and her fellow labourer in the cause of Terpsichore went to work to make their arrangements for the evening And the rest of the party followed them Gertrude was accompanied by an Englishman just as idle and quite as useless as M Victoire of the butterfly tribe also but not so graceful and without colour And then came the Misses Neverbend walking together and with them one on each side two tall Frenchmen whose faces had been remodelled in that mould into which so large a proportion of Parisians of the present day force their heads in order that they may come out with some look of the Emperor about them Were there not some such machine as this in operation it would be impossible that so many Frenchmen should appear with elongated angular hard faces all as like each other as though they were brothers The cut of the beard the long prickly ended clotted moustache which looks as though it were being continually rolled up in saliva the sallow half bronzed apparently unwashed colour these may all perhaps be assumed by any man after a certain amount of labour and culture But how it has come to pass that every Parisian has been able to obtain for himself a pair of the Emperor s long hard bony cruel looking cheeks no Englishman has yet been able to guess That having the power they should have the wish to wear this mask is almost equally remarkable Can it be that a political phase when stamped on a people with an iron hand of sufficient power of pressure will leave its impress on the outward body as well as on the inward soul If so a Frenchman may perhaps be thought to have gained in the apparent stubborn wilfulness of his countenance some recompense for his compelled loss of all political wilfulness whatever Be this as it may the two Misses Neverbend walked on each with a stubborn long faced Frenchman at her side looking altogether not ill pleased at this instance of the excellence of French manners After them came Linda talking to some acquaintance of her own and then poor dear little Katie with another Frenchman sterner more stubborn looking more long faced more like the pattern after whom he and they had been remodelled than any of them Poor little Katie This was her first day in public With many imploring caresses with many half formed tears in her bright eyes with many assurances of her perfect health she had induced her mother to allow her to come to the flower show to allow her also to go to missus Val s dance at which there were to be none but such very nice people Katie was to commence her life to open her ball with this flower show In her imagination it was all to be one long bright flower show in which however the sweet sorrowing of the sensitive plant would ever and anon invite her to pity and tears When she entered that narrow portal she entered the world and there she found herself walking on the well mown grass with this huge stern bearded Frenchman by her side As to talking to him that was quite out of the question At the gate some slight ceremony of introduction had been gone through which had consisted in all the Frenchmen taking off their hats and bowing to the two married ladies and in the Englishmen standing behind and poking the gravel with their canes But in this no special notice had of course been taken of Katie and she had a kind of idea whence derived she knew not that it would be improper for her to talk to this man unless she were actually and bona fide introduced to him And then again poor Katie was not very confident in her French and then her companion was not very intelligible in his English so when the gentleman asked Is it that mademoiselle lofe de fleurs poor little Katie felt herself tremble and tried in vain to mutter something and when again essaying to do his duty he suggested that all de beaute of Londres did delight to valk itself at Chisveek she was equally dumb merely turning on him her large eyes for one moment to show that she knew that he addressed her After that he walked on as silent as herself still keeping close to her side and other ladies who had not the good fortune to have male companions envied her happiness in being so attended But Alaric and Charley were coming she knew Alaric was her brother in law now and therefore she would be delighted to meet him and Charley dear Charley she had not seen him since he went away that morning now four days since and four days was a long time considering that he had saved her life Her busy little fingers had been hard at work the while and now she had in her pocket the purse which she had been so eager to make and which she was almost afraid to bestow Oh Linda she had said I don t think I will after all it is such a little thing Nonsense child you wouldn t give him a worked counterpane little things are best for presents But it isn t good enough she said looking at her handiwork in despair But nevertheless she persevered working in the golden beads with constant diligence so that she might be able to give it to Charley among the Chiswick flowers Oh what a place it was in which to bestow a present with all the eyes of all the world upon her And then this dance to which she was going The thought of what she would do there troubled her Would anyone ask her to dance Would Charley think of her when he had so many grown up girls girls quite grown up all around him It would be very sad if at this London party it should be her fate to sit down the whole evening and see others dance It would suffice for her she thought if she could stand up with Linda but she had an idea that this would not be allowed at a London party and then Linda perhaps might not like it Altogether she had much upon her mind and was beginning to think that perhaps she might have been happier to have stayed at home with her mamma She had not quite recovered from the effect of her toss into the water or the consequent excitement and a very little misery would upset her And so she walked on with her Napoleonic companion from whom she did not know how to free herself through one glass house after another across lawns and along paths attempting every now and then to get a word with Linda and not at all so happy as she had hoped to have been At last Gertrude came to her rescue They were all congregated for a while in one great flower house and Gertrude finding herself near her sister asked her how she liked it all Oh it is very beautiful said Katie only Only what dear Would you let me come with you a little while Look here and she crept softly around to the other side of her sister sidling with little steps away from the Frenchman at whom however she kept furtively looking as though she feared that he would detect her in the act Look here Gertrude she said twitching her sister s arm that gentleman there you see him don t you he s a Frenchman and I don t know how to get away from him How to get away from him said Gertrude That s M Delabarbe de l Empereur a great friend of missus Val s and a very quiet sort of man I believe he won t eat you No he won t eat me I know but I can t look at anything because he will walk so close to me Mayn t I come with you Gertrude told her she might and so Katie made good her escape hiding herself from her enemy as well as she could behind her sister s petticoats He poor man was perhaps as rejoiced at the arrangement as Katie herself at any rate he made no attempt to regain his prey but went on by himself looking as placidly stern as ever till he was absorbed by missus Val s more immediate party and then he devoted himself to her while M Jaquetanape settled with Clementina the properest arrangement for the waltzes of the evening Katie was beginning to be tranquilly happy and was listening to the enthusiasm of Ugolina Neverbend who declared that flowers were the female poet s fitting food it may be doubted whether she had ever tried it when her heart leaped within her on hearing a sharp clear well known voice almost close behind her It was Charley Tudor After her silent promenade with M Delabarbe de l Empereur Katie had been well pleased to put up with the obscure but yet endurable volubility of Ugolina but now she felt almost as anxious to get quit of Ugolina as she had before been to shake off the Frenchman Flowers are Nature s chef d oeuvre said Ugolina they convey to me the purest and most direct essence of that heavenly power of production which is the sweetest evidence which Jehovah gives us of His presence Do they said Katie looking over her shoulder to watch what Charley was doing and to see whether he was coming to notice her They are the bright stars of His immediate handiwork said Ugolina and if our dim eyes could read them aright they would whisper to us the secret of His love Yes I dare say they would said Katie who felt perhaps a little disappointed because Charley lingered a while shaking hands with missus Val and Clementina Golightly It was however but for a moment There was much shaking of hands to be done and a considerable taking off of hats to be gone through and as Alaric and Charley encountered the head of the column first it was only natural that they should work their way through it gradually Katie however never guessed how could she that Charley had calculated that by reaching her last he would be able to remain with her She was still listening to Ugolina who was mounting higher and higher up to heaven when she found her hand in Charley s Ugolina might now mount up and get down again as best she could for Katie could no longer listen to her Alaric had not seen her yet since her ducking She had to listen to and to answer his congratulations Charley standing by and making his comments Charley says you took to the water quite naturally and swam like a duck said Alaric Only she went in head foremost said Charley All bathers ought to do that said Alaric and tell me Katie did you feel comfortable when you were in the water Indeed I don t recollect anything about it said she only that I saw Charley coming to me just when I was going to sink for the last time Sink Why I m told that you floated like a deal board The big hat and the crinoline kept her up said Charley she had no idea of sinking Oh Charley you know I was under the water for a long time and that if you had not come just at that very moment I should never have come up again And then Alaric went on and Charley and Katie were left together How was she to give him the purse It was burning a hole in her pocket till she could do so and yet how was she to get it out of her possession into his and make her little speech here in the public garden She could have done it easily enough at home in the drawing room at Surbiton Cottage And how do you like the gardens asked Charley Oh they are beautiful but I have hardly been able to see anything yet I have been going about with a great big Frenchman there that man there he has such a queer name Did his name prevent your seeing No not his name I didn t know his name then But it seemed so odd to be walking about with such a man as that But I want to go back and look at the black and yellow roses in that house there Would you go with me that is if we may I wonder whether we may Charley was clearly of opinion that they might and should and would and so away they sallied back to the roses and Katie began to enjoy the first instalment of the happiness which she had anticipated In the temple of the roses the crowd at first was great and she could not get the purse out of her pocket nor make her speech but after a while the people passed on and there was a lull before others filled their places and Katie found herself opposite to a beautiful black rose with no one close to her but Charley I have got something for you she said and as she spoke she felt herself to be almost hot with blushing Something for me said Charley and he also felt himself abashed he did not know why It s only a very little thing said Katie feeling in her pocket and I am almost ashamed to ask you to take it But I made it all myself no one else put a stitch in it and so saying and looking round to see that she was not observed she handed her gift to Charley Oh Katie dearest Katie said he I am so much obliged to you I ll keep it till I die I didn t know what to make that was better said she Nothing on earth could possibly be better said he A plate of bread and butter and a purse are a very poor return for saving one s life said she half laughing half crying He looked at her with his eyes full of love and as he looked he swore within himself that come what might he would never see Norah Geraghty again but would devote his life to an endeavour to make himself worthy of the angel that was now with him Katie the while was looking up anxiously into his face She was thinking of no other love than that which it became her to feel for the man who had saved her life She was thinking of no other love but her young heart was opening itself to a very different feeling She was sinking deep deep in waters which were to go near to drown her warm heart much nearer than those other waters which she fancied had all but closed for ever over her life She looked into his face and saw that he was pleased and that for the present was enough for her She was at any rate happy now So they passed on through the roses and then lost themselves among the geraniums and wondered at the gigantic rhododendrons and beautiful azaleas and so went on from house to house and from flower bed to flower bed Katie talking and Charley listening till she began to wonder at her former supineness and to say both to herself and out loud to her companion how very very very glad she was that her mother had let her come Poor Katie dear darling bonny Katie sweet sweetest dearest child why oh why has that mother of thine that tender hearted loving mother put thee unguarded in the way of such peril as this Has she not sworn to herself that over thee at least she would watch as a hen does over her young so that no unfortunate love should quench thy young spirit or blanch thy cheek s bloom Has she not trembled at the thought of what would have befallen thee had thy fate been such as Linda s Has she not often oh how often on her knees thanked the Almighty God that Linda s spirit was not as thine that this evil had happened to the lamb whose temper had been fitted by Him to endure it And yet here thou art all unguarded all unaided left by thyself to drink of the cup of sweet poison and none near to warn thee that the draught is deadly Alas twould be useless to warn thee now The false god has been placed upon the altar the temple all shining with gems and gold has been built around him the incense cup is already swinging nothing will now turn the idolater from her worship nothing short of a miracle Our Katie s childish days are now all gone A woman s passion glows within her breast though as yet she has not scanned it with a woman s intelligence Her mother listening to a child s entreaty had suffered her darling to go forth for a child s amusement It was doomed that the child should return no more but in lieu of her a fair heart laden maiden whose every fondest thought must henceforth be of a stranger s welfare and a stranger s fate But it must not be thought that Charley abused the friendship of missus Woodward and made love to Katie as love is usually made with warm words assurances of affection with squeezing of the hand with sighs and all a lover s ordinary catalogue of resources Though we have said that he was a false god yet he was hardly to be blamed for the temple and gems and gold with which he was endowed not more so perhaps than the unconscious bud which is made so sacred on the banks of the Egyptian river He loved too perhaps as warmly though not so fatally as Katie did but he spoke no word of his love He walked among the flowers with her laughing and listening to her in his usual light hearted easy manner every now and again his arm would thrill with pleasure as he felt on it the touch of her little fingers and his heart would leap within him as he gazed on the speaking beauty of her face but he was too honest hearted to talk to the young girl to missus Woodward s child of love He talked to her as to a child but she listened to him and loved him as a woman And so they rambled on till the hour appointed for quitting this Elysium had arrived Every now and again they had a glimpse of some one of their party which had satisfied Katie that they were not lost At first Clementina was seen tracing with her parasol on the turf the plan of a new dance Then Ugolina passed by them describing the poetry of the motion of the spheres in a full flow of impassioned eloquence to M Delabarbe de l Empereur C est toujours vrai ce que mademoiselle dit est toujours vrai was the Frenchman s answer which they heard thrice repeated And then Lactimel and Captain Val were seen together the latter having disappointed the prophecies which had been made respecting him Lactimel had an idea that as the Scotts were great people they were all in Parliament and she was endeavouring to persuade Captain Val that something ought to be done for the poor Think said she only think Captain Scott of all the money that this fete must cost A doosed sight said the captain hardly articulating from under his thick sandy coloured moustache which growing downwards from his nose looked like a heavy thatch put on to protect his mouth from the inclemency of the clouds above A doosed sight said the captain Now suppose Captain Scott that all this money could be collected The tickets you know and the dresses and I wish I knew how to do it said the captain Lactimel went on with her little scheme for expending the cost of the flower show in bread and bacon for the poor Irish of Saffron Hill but Charley and Katie heard no more for the mild philosopher passed out of hearing and out of sight At last Katie got a poke in her back from a parasol just as Charley had expended half a crown one of mister M Ruen s last in purchasing for her one simple beautiful flower to put into her hair that night You naughty puss said Gertrude we have been looking for you all over the gardens missus Val and the Miss Neverbends have been waiting this half hour Katie looked terribly frightened Come along and don t keep them waiting any longer They are all in the passage This was your fault Master Charley O no it was not said Katie but we thought Never mind thinking said Gertrude but come along And so they hurried on and were soon replaced in their respective vehicles and then went back to town Well I do think the Chiswick Gardens is the nicest place in all the world said Katie leaning back in the cab and meditating on her past enjoyment They are very pretty very said Lactimel Neverbend I only wish every cottar had such a garden behind his cottage I am sure we might manage it if we set about it in the right way What as big as Chiswick said Katie No not so big said Lactimel but quite as nicely kept I think the pigs would get in said Katie It would be much easier and more important too to keep their minds nicely said Ugolina and there the pigs could never get in No I suppose not said Katie I don t know that said Lactimel CHAPTER XXVI KATIE S FIRST BALL In spite of missus Val s oft repeated assurance that they would have none but nice people she had done her best to fill her rooms and not unsuccessfully She had it is true eschewed the Golightly party who resided some north of Oxford Street in the purlieus of Fitzroy Square and some even to the east of Tottenham Court Road She had eschewed the Golightlys and confined herself to the Scott connexion but so great had been her success in life that even under these circumstances she had found herself able to fill her rooms respectably If indeed there was no absolute crowding if some space was left in the front drawing room sufficient for the operations of dancers she could still attribute this apparent want of fashionable popularity to the selections of the few nice people whom she had asked The honorable missus Val was no ordinary woman and understood well how to make the most of the goods with which the gods provided her The Miss Neverbends were to dine with the Tudors and go with them to the dance in the evening and their brother Fidus was to meet them there Charley was of course one of the party at dinner and as there was no other gentleman there Alaric had an excellent opportunity when the ladies went up to their toilets to impress on his cousin the expediency of his losing no time in securing to himself Miss Golightly s twenty thousand pounds The conversation as will be seen at last became rather animated Well Charley what do you think of the beautiful Clementina said Alaric pushing over the bottle to his cousin as soon as they found themselves alone A doosed fine girl as Captain Val says isn t she A doosed fine girl of course said Charley laughing She has too much go in her for me I m afraid Marriage and children will soon pull that down She d make an excellent wife for such a man as you and to tell you the truth Charley if you ll take my advice you ll lose no time in making up to her She has got that d French fellow at her heels and though I don t suppose she cares one straw about him it may be well to make sure But you don t mean in earnest that you think that Miss Golightly would have me Indeed I do you are just the man to get on with girls and as far as I can see you are just the man that will never get on in any other way under the sun Charley sighed as he thought of his many debts his poor prospects and his passionate love There seemed indeed to be little chance that he ever would get on at all in the ordinary sense of the word I m sure she d refuse me said he still wishing to back out of the difficulty I m sure she would I ve not got a penny in the world you know That s just the reason she has got lots of money and you have got none Just the reason why she should refuse me you should say Well what if she does There s no harm done Faint heart never won fair lady You ve everything to back you missus Val is led by Undy Scott and Undy is all on your side But she has got guardians hasn t she Yes her father s first cousin old Sam Golightly He is dying or dead probably by this time only missus Val won t have the news brought to her because of this party He had a fit of apoplexy yesterday Then there s her father s brother in law Figgs he s bedridden When old Golightly is off the hooks altogether another will be chosen and Undy talks of putting in my name as that of a family friend so you ll have everything to assist you Charley looked very grave He had not been in the habit of discussing such matters but it seemed to him that if Alaric was about to become in any legal manner the guardian of Miss Golightly s fortune that that in itself was reason enough why he Alaric should not propose such a match as this Needy men to be sure did often marry rich ladies and the world looked on and regarded it only as a matter of course but surely it would be the duty of a guardian to protect his ward from such a fate if it were in his power to do so Alaric who saw something of what was going on in his cousin s mind essayed to remove the impression which was thus made Besides you know Clementina is no chicken Her fortune is at her own disposal All the guardians on earth cannot prevent her marrying you if she makes up her mind to do so Charley gulped down his glass of wine and then sat staring at the fire saying nothing further It was true enough that he was very poor true enough that Miss Golightly s fortune would set him on his legs and make a man of him true enough perhaps that no other expedient of which he could think would do so But then there were so many arguments that were strong against the deed In the first place he thought it impossible that he should be successful in such a suit and then again it would hardly be honest to obtain such success if it were possible then thirdly he had no sort of affection whatsoever for Miss Golightly and fourthly lastly and chiefly he loved so dearly tenderly loved poor Katie Woodward As he thought of this he felt horror stricken with himself at allowing the idea of his becoming a suitor to another to dwell for an instant on his mind and looking up with all the resolution which he was able to summon he said It s impossible Alaric quite impossible I couldn t do it Then what do you mean to do said Alaric who was angry at having his scheme thus thwarted do you mean to be a beggar or if not how do you intend to get out of your difficulties I trust not a beggar said Charley sadly What other hope have you what rational hope of setting yourself right Perhaps I may do something by writing said Charley very bashfully By writing ha ha ha and Alaric laughed somewhat cruelly at the poor navvy do something by writing what will you do by writing will you make Ltwenty thousand or twenty thousand pence Of all trades going that I should say is likely to be the poorest for a poor man the poorest and the most heart breaking What have you made already to encourage you The editor says that Crinoline and Macassar will come to Lfour tens And when will you get it The editor says that the rule is to pay six months after the date of publication The Daily Delight is only a new thing you know The editor says that if the sale comes up to his expectations he will increase the scale of pay A prospect of Lfour tens for a fortnight s hard work That s a bad look out my boy you had better take the heiress It may be a bad look out said Charley whose spirit was raised by his cousin s sneers but at any rate it s honest And I ll tell you what Alaric I d sooner earn Lfifty by writing for the press than get Lone thousand in any other way you can think of It may be a poor trade in one way and authors I believe are poor but I am sure it has its consolations Well Charley I hope with all my heart that you may find them For my own part seeing what a place the world is seeing what are the general aspirations of other men seeing what as it appears to me the Creator has intended for the goal of our labours I look for advancement prosperity and such rank and station as I may be able to win for myself The labourer is worthy of his hire and I do not mean to refuse such wages as may come in my way Yes said Charley who now that his spirit was roused determined to fight his battle manfully yes the labourer is worthy of his hire but were I to get Miss Golightly s fortune I should be taking the hire without labour Bah said Alaric It would be dishonest in every way for I do not love her and should not love her at the moment that I married her Honesty said Alaric still sneering there is no sign of the dishonesty of the age so strong as the continual talk which one hears about honesty It was quite manifest that Alaric had not sat at the feet of Undy Scott without profiting by the lessons which he had heard With what face continued he can you pretend to be more honest than your neighbours I know that it is wrong and unmanly too to hunt a girl down merely for what she has got There are a great many wrong and unmanly men about then said Alaric Look through the Houses of Parliament and see how many men there have married for money aye and made excellent husbands afterwards I ll tell you what it is Charley it is all humbug in you to pretend to be better than others you are not a bit better mind I do not say you are worse We have none of us too much of this honesty of which we are so fond of prating Where was your honesty when you ordered the coat for which you know you cannot pay or when you swore to the bootmaker that he should have the amount of his little bill after next quarter day knowing in your heart at the time that he wouldn t get a farthing of it If you are so honest why did you waste your money to day in going to Chiswick instead of paying some portion of your debts Honest you are I dare say indifferently honest as the world goes like the rest of us But I think you might put the burden of Clementina s fortune on your conscience without feeling much the worse for it after what you have already gone through Charley became very red in the face as he sat silent listening to Alaric s address nor did he speak at once at the first pause so Alaric went on The truth I take it is that at the present moment you have no personal fancy for this girl No I have not said Charley And you are so incredibly careless as to all prudential considerations as to prefer your immediate personal fancies to the future welfare of your whole life I can say no more If you will think well of my proposition I will do all I can to assist you I have no doubt you would make a good husband to Miss Golightly and that she would be very happy with you If you think otherwise there is an end of it but pray do not talk so much about your honesty your tailor would arrest you to morrow if he heard you There are two kinds of honesty I take it said Charley speaking with suppressed anger and sorrow visible in his face that which the world sees and that which it does not see For myself I have nothing to say in my own defence I have made my bed badly and must lie on it as it is I certainly will not mend it by marrying a girl that I can never love And as for you Alaric all who know you and love you watch your career with the greatest hope We know your ambition and all look to see you rise in the world But in rising as you will do you should remember this that nothing that is wrong can become right because other people do it Well Charley said the other thank you for the lecture I did not certainly expect it from you but it is not on that account the less welcome And now suppose we go upstairs and dress for missus Val and so they went upstairs Katie s heart beat high as she got out of the carriage missus Val s private carriage had been kept on for the occasion and saw before and above her on the stairs a crowd of muslin crushing its way on towards the room prepared for dancing Katie had never been to a ball before We hope that the word ball may not bring down on us the adverse criticism of the Morning Post It was probably not a ball in the strictly fashionable sense of the word but it was so to Katie to all intents and purposes Her dancing had hitherto been done either at children s parties or as a sort of supplemental amusement to the evening tea gatherings at Hampton or Hampton Court She had never yet seen the muse worshipped with the premeditated ceremony of banished carpets chalked floors and hired musicians Her heart consequently beat high as she made her way upstairs linked arm in arm with Ugolina Neverbend Shall you dance much said Ugolina Oh I hope so said Katie I shall not It is an amusement of which I am peculiarly fond and for which my active habits suit me This was probably said with some allusion to her sister who was apt to be short of breath But in the dances of the present day conversation is impossible and I look upon any pursuit as barbaric which stops the feast of reason and the flow of soul Katie did not quite understand this but she thought in her heart that she would not at all mind giving up talking for the whole evening if she could only get dancing enough But on this matter her heart misgave her To be sure she was engaged to Charley for the first quadrille and second waltz but there her engagements stopped whereas Clementina as she was aware had a whole book full of them What if she should get no more dancing when Charley s good nature should have been expended She had an idea that no one would care to dance with her when older partners were to be had Ah Katie you do not yet know the extent of your riches or half the wealth of your own attractions And then they all heard another little speech from missus Val She was really quite ashamed she really was to see so many people she could not wish any of her guests away that would be impossible though perhaps one or two might be spared she said in a confidential whisper to Gertrude Who the one or two might be it would be difficult to decide as she had made the same whisper to every one but she really was ashamed there was almost a crowd and she had quite intended that the house should be nearly empty The fact was everybody asked had come and as she could not of course have counted on that why she had got you see twice as many people as she had expected And then she went on and made the same speech to the next arrival Katie who wanted to begin the play at the beginning kept her eye anxiously on Charley who was still standing with Lactimel Neverbend on his arm Oh now said she to herself if he should forget me and begin dancing with Miss Neverbend But then she remembered how he had jumped into the water and determined that even with such provocation as that she must not be angry with him But there was no danger of Charley s forgetting Come said he we must not lose any more time if we mean to dance the first set Alaric will be our vis a vis he is going to dance with Miss Neverbend and so they stood up Katie tightened her gloves gave her dress a little shake looked at her shoes and then the work of the evening began I shouldn t have liked to have sat down for the first dance she said confidentially to Charley because it s my first ball Sit down I don t suppose you ll be let to sit down the whole evening You ll be crying out for mercy about three or four o clock in the morning It s you to go on now said Katie whose eyes were intent on the figure and who would not have gone wrong herself or allowed her partner to do so on any consideration And so the dance went on right merrily I ve got to dance the first polka with Miss Golightly said Charley And the next with me said Katie You may be sure I shan t forget that You lucky man to get Miss Golightly for a partner I am told she is the most beautiful dancer in the world O no Mademoiselle is much better said Charley naming the principal stage performer of the day If one is to go the whole hog one had better do it thoroughly Katie did not quite understand then what he meant and merely replied that she would look at the performance In this however she was destined to be disappointed for Charley had hardly left her before Miss Golightly brought up to her the identical M Delabarbe de l Empereur who had so terribly put her out in the gardens This was done so suddenly that Katie s presence of mind was quite insufficient to provide her with any means of escape The Frenchman bowed very low and said nothing Katie made a little curtsy and was equally silent Then she felt her own arm gathered up and put within his and she stood up to take her share in the awful performance She felt herself to be in such a nervous fright that she would willingly have been home again at Hampton if she could but as this was utterly impossible she had only to bethink herself of her steps and get through the work as best she might Away went Charley and Clementina leading the throng away went M Jaquetanape and Linda away went another Frenchman clasping in his arms the happy Ugolina Away went Lactimel with a young Weights and Measures and then came Katie s turn She pressed her lips together shut her eyes and felt the tall Frenchman s arms behind her back and made a start Twas like plunging into cold water on the first bathing day of the season ce n est que le premier pas que coute When once off Katie did not find it so bad The Frenchman danced well and Katie herself was a wicked little adept At home at Surbiton dancing with another girl she had with great triumph tired out the fingers both of her mother and sister and forced them to own that it was impossible to put her down M de l Empereur therefore had his work before him and he did it like a man as long as he could Katie who had not yet assumed the airs or will of a grown up young lady thought that she was bound to go on as long as her grand partner chose to go with her He on the other hand accustomed in his gallantry to obey all ladies wishes considered himself bound to leave it to her to stop when she pleased And so they went on with apparently interminable gyrations Charley and the heiress had twice been in motion and had twice stopped and still they were going on Ugolina had refreshed herself with many delicious observations and Lactimel had thrice paused to advocate dancing for the million and still they went on the circle was gradually left to themselves and still they went on people stood round some admiring and others pitying and still they went on Katie thinking of her steps and her business did not perceive that she and her partner were alone and ever and anon others of course joined in and so they went on and on and on M Delabarbe de l Empereur was a strong and active man but he began to perceive that the lady was too much for him He was already melting away with his exertions while his partner was as cool as a cucumber She with her active young legs her lightly filled veins and small agile frame could have gone on almost for ever but M de l Empereur was more encumbered Gallantry was at last beat by nature his overtasked muscles would do no more for him and he was fain to stop dropping his partner into a chair and throwing himself in a state of utter exhaustion against the wall Katie was hardly out of breath as she received the congratulations of her friends but at the moment she could not understand why they were quizzing her In after times however she was often reproached with having danced a Frenchman to death in the evening in revenge for his having bored her in the morning It was observed that M Delabarbe de l Empereur danced no more that evening Indeed he very soon left the house Katie had not been able to see Miss Golightly s performance but it had been well worth seeing She was certainly no ordinary performer and if she did not quite come up to the remarkable movements which one sees on the stage under the name of dancing the fault was neither in her will nor her ability but only in her education Charley also was peculiarly well suited to give her ample verge and room enough to show off all her perfections Her most peculiar merit consisted perhaps in her power of stopping herself suddenly while going on at the rate of a hunt one way and without any pause or apparent difficulty going just as fast the other way This was done by a jerk which must one would be inclined to think have dislocated all her bones and entirely upset her internal arrangements But no it was done without injury or any disagreeable result either to her brain or elsewhere We all know how a steamer is manoeuvred when she has to change her course how we stop her and ease her and back her but Miss Golightly stopped and eased and backed all at once and that without collision with any other craft It was truly very wonderful and Katie ought to have looked at her Katie soon found occasion to cast off her fear that her evening s happiness would be destroyed by a dearth of partners Her troubles began to be of an exactly opposite description She had almost envied Miss Golightly her little book full of engagements and now she found herself dreadfully bewildered by a book of her own Some one had given her a card and a pencil and every moment she could get to herself was taken up in endeavouring to guard herself from perfidy on her own part All down the card at intervals which were not very far apart there were great C s which stood for Charley and her firmest feeling was that no earthly consideration should be allowed to interfere with those landmarks And then there were all manner of hieroglyphics sometimes unfortunately illegible to Katie herself French names and English names mixed together in a manner most vexatious and to make matters worse she found that she had put down both Victoire Jaquetanape and mister Johnson of the Weights by a great I and she could not remember with whom she was bound to dance the lancers and to which she had promised the last polka before supper One thing however was quite fixed when supper should arrive she was to go downstairs with Charley What dreadful news Linda said Charley did you hear it Linda was standing up with mister Neverbend for a sober quadrille and Katie also was close by with her partner Dreadful news indeed What is it said Linda A man can die but once to be sure but to be killed in such a manner as that is certainly very sad Killed who has been killed said Neverbend Well perhaps I shouldn t say killed He only died in the cab as he went home Died in a cab how dreadful said Neverbend Who who was it mister Tudor Didn t you hear How very odd Why M de l Empereur to be sure I wonder what the coroner will bring it in How can you talk such nonsense Charley said Linda Very well Master Charley said Katie All that comes of being a writer of romances I suppose that s to be the next contribution to the Daily Delight Neverbend went off on his quadrille not at all pleased with the joke Indeed he was never pleased with a joke and in this instance he ventured to suggest to his partner that the idea of a gentleman expiring in a cab was much too horrid to be laughed at Oh we never mind Charley Tudor said Linda he always goes on in that way We all like him so much mister Neverbend who though not very young still had a susceptible heart within his bosom had been much taken by Linda s charms He already began to entertain an idea that as a missus Neverbend would be a desirable adjunct to his establishment at some future period he could not do better than offer himself and his worldly goods to the acceptance of Miss Woodward he therefore said nothing further in disparagement of the family friend but he resolved that no such alliance should ever induce him to make mister Charles Tudor welcome at his house But what could he have expected The Internal Navigation had ever been a low place and he was surprised that the honorable missus Val should have admitted one of the navvies inside her drawing room And so the ball went on mister Johnson came duly for the lancers and M Jaquetanape for the polka Johnson was great at the lancers knowing every turn and vagary in that most intricate and exclusive of dances and it need hardly be said that the polka with M Jaquetanape was successful The last honour however was not without evil results for it excited the envy of Ugolina who proud of her own performance had longed but hitherto in vain to be whirled round the room by that wondrously expert foreigner Well my dear said Ugolina with an air that plainly said that Katie was to be treated as a child I hope you have had dancing enough Oh indeed I have not said Katie fully appreciating the purport and cause of her companion s remark not near enough Ah but my dear you should remember said Ugolina your mamma will be displeased if you fatigue yourself My mamma is never displeased because we amuse ourselves and I am not a bit fatigued and so saying Katie walked off and took refuge with her sister Gertrude What business had any Ugolina Neverbend to interfere between her and her mamma Then came the supper There was a great rush to get downstairs but Charley was so clever that even this did not put him out Of course there was no sitting down which means that the bashful retiring and obedient guests were to stand on their legs while those who were forward and impudent and disobedient found seats for themselves wherever they could Charley was certainly among the latter class and he did not rest therefore till he had got Katie into an old arm chair in one corner of the room in such a position as to enable himself to eat his own supper leaning against the chimney piece I say Johnson said he do bring me some ham and chicken it s for a lady I m wedged up here and can t get out and Johnson some sherry The good natured young Weights obeyed and brought the desired provisions And Johnson upon my word I m sorry to be so troublesome but one more plateful if you please for another lady a good deal if you please for this lady for she s very hungry and some more sherry Johnson again obeyed the Weights are always obedient and Charley of course appropriated the second portion to his own purposes Oh Charley that was a fib now wasn t it You shouldn t have said it was for a lady But then I shouldn t have got it Oh but that s no reason according to that everybody might tell a fib whenever they wanted anything Well everybody does everybody except you Katie O no said Katie no they don t mamma and Linda and Gertrude never do nor Harry Norman he never does nor Alaric No Harry Norman never does said Charley with something like vexation in his tone He made no exception to Katie s list of truth tellers but he was thinking within himself whether Alaric had a juster right to be in the catalogue than himself Harry Norman never does certainly You must not compare me with them Katie They are patterns of excellence I am all the other way as everybody knows He was half laughing as he spoke but Katie s sharp ear knew that he was more than half in earnest and she felt she had pained him by what she had said Oh Charley I didn t mean that indeed I did not I know that in all serious things you are as truthful as they are and quite as good that is in many ways Poor Katie she wanted to console him she wanted to be kind and yet she could not be dishonest Quite as good no you know I am not You are as good hearted if not better and you will be as steady won t you Charley I am sure you will and I know you are more clever really more clever than either of them Oh Katie I am quite sure you are I have always said so don t be angry with me for what I said Angry with you I couldn t be angry with you I wouldn t for the world say anything to vex you I like you better than either of them though Alaric is my brother in law Of course I do how could I help it when you saved my life Saved your life Pooh I didn t save your life Any boy could have done the same or any waterman about the place When you fell in the person who was nearest you pulled you out that was all There was something almost approaching to ferocity in his voice as he said this and yet when Katie timidly looked up she saw that he had turned his back to the room and that his eyes were full of tears He had felt that he was loved by this child but that he was loved from a feeling of uncalled for gratitude He could not stop to analyse this to separate the sweet from the bitter but he knew that the latter prevailed It is so little flattering to be loved when such love is the offspring of gratitude And then when that gratitude is unnecessary when it has been given in mistake for supposed favours the acceptance of such love is little better than a cheat That was not all said Katie very decidedly It never shall be all in my mind If you had not been with us I should now have been drowned and cold and dead and mamma where would she have been Oh Charley I shall think myself so wicked if I have said anything to vex you Charley did not analyse his feelings nor did Katie analyse hers It would have been impossible for her to do so But could she have done it and had she done it she would have found that her gratitude was but the excuse which she made to herself for a passionate love which she could not have excused even to herself in any other way He said everything he could to reassure her and make her happy and she soon smiled and laughed again Now that s what my editor would call a Nemesis said Charley Oh that s a Nemesis is it Johnson was cheated into doing my work and getting me my supper and then you scolded me and took away my appetite so that I couldn t eat it that s a Nemesis Johnson is avenged only unluckily he doesn t know it and wickedness is punished Well mind you put it into the Daily Delight But all the girls are going upstairs pray let me get out and so Katie went upstairs again It was then past one About two hours afterwards Gertrude looking for her sister that she might take her home found her seated on a bench with her feet tucked under her dress She was very much fatigued and she looked to be so but there was still a bright laughing sparkle in her eye which showed that her spirits were not even yet weary Well Katie have you had enough dancing Nearly said Katie yawning You look as if you couldn t stand Yes I am too tired to stand but still I think I could dance a little more only Only what Whisper said Katie and Gertrude put down her ear near to her sister s lips Both my shoes are quite worn out and my toes are all out on the floor It was clearly time for them to go home so away they all went CHAPTER XXVII EXCELSIOR The last words that Katie spoke as she walked down missus Val s hall leaning on Charley s arm as he led her to the carriage were these You will be steady Charley won t you you will try to be steady won t you dear Charley and as she spoke she almost imperceptibly squeezed the arm on which she was leaning Charley pressed her little hand as he parted from her but he said nothing What could he say in that moment of time in answer to such a request Had he made the reply which would have come most readily to his lips it would have been this It is too late Katie too late for me to profit by a caution even from you no steadiness now will save me Katie however wanted no other answer than the warm pressure which she felt on her hand And then leaning back in the carriage and shutting her eyes she tried to think quietly over the events of the night But it was alas a dream and yet so like reality that she could not divest herself of the feeling that the ball was still going on She still seemed to see the lights and hear the music to feel herself whirled round the room and to see others whirling whirling whirling on every side of her She thought over all the names on her card and the little contests that had taken place for her hand and all Charley s jokes and M de l Empereur s great disaster and then as she remembered how long she had gone on twisting round with the poor unfortunate ill used Frenchman she involuntarily burst out into a fit of laughter Good gracious Katie what is the matter I thought you were asleep said Gertrude So did I said Linda What on earth can you be laughing at now I was laughing at myself said Katie still going on with her half suppressed chuckle and thinking what a fool I was to go on dancing so long with that M de l Empereur Oh dear Gertrude I am so tired shall we be home soon and then she burst out crying The excitement and fatigue of the day had been too much for her and she was now completely overcome Ugolina Neverbend s advice though not quite given in the kindest way had in itself been good missus Woodward would in truth have been unhappy could she have seen her child at this moment Katie made an attempt to laugh off her tears but she failed and her sobs then became hysterical and she lay with her head on her married sister s shoulder almost choking herself in her attempts to repress them Dear Katie don t sob so said Linda don t cry pray don t cry dear Katie She had better let it have its way said Gertrude she will be better directly won t you Katie In a little time she was better and then she burst out laughing again I wonder why the man went on when he was so tired What a stupid man he must be Gertrude and Linda both laughed in order to comfort her and bring her round Do you know I think it was because he didn t know how to say stop in English and then she burst out laughing again and that led to another fit of hysterical tears When they reached home Gertrude and Linda soon got her into bed Linda was to sleep with her and she also was not very long in laying her head on her pillow But before she did so Katie was fast asleep and twice in her sleep she cried out Oh Charley Oh Charley Then Linda guessed how it was with her sister and in the depths of her loving heart she sorrowed for the coming grief which she foresaw When the morning came Katie was feverish and had a headache It was thought better that she should remain in town and Alaric took Linda down to Hampton The next day missus Woodward came up and as the invalid was better she took her home But still she was an invalid The doctor declared that she had never quite recovered from her fall into the river and prescribed quiet and cod liver oil All the truth about the Chiswick fete and the five hours dancing and the worn out shoes was not told to him or he might perhaps have acquitted the water gods of the injury Nor was it all perhaps told to missus Woodward I m afraid she tired herself at the ball said missus Woodward I think she did a little said Linda Did she dance much said missus Woodward looking anxiously She did dance a good deal said Linda missus Woodward was too wise to ask any further questions As it was a fine night Alaric had declared his intention of walking home from missus Val s party and he and Charley started together They soon parted on their roads but not before Alaric had had time to notice Charley s perverse stupidity as to Miss Golightly So you wouldn t take my advice about Clementina said he It was quite impossible Alaric said Charley in an apologetic voice I couldn t do it and what is more I am sure I never shall No not now you certainly can t do it now If I am not very much mistaken the chance is gone I think you ll find she engaged herself to that Frenchman tonight Very likely said Charley Well I did the best I could for you Good night old fellow I m sure I m much obliged to you Good night said Charley Alaric s suggestion with reference to the heiress was quite correct M Jaquetanape had that night proposed and been duly accepted He was to present himself to his loved one s honourable mother on the following morning as her future son in law comforted and supported in his task of doing so by an assurance from the lady that if her mother would not give her consent the marriage should go on all the same without it How delightful to have such a dancer for her lover thought Clementina That was her Excelsior Charley walked home with a sad heart He had that day given a pledge that he would on the morrow go to the Cat and Whistle and visit his lady love Since the night when he sat there with Norah Geraghty on his knee now nearly a fortnight since he had spent but little of his time there He had indeed gone there once or twice with his friend Scatterall but had contrived to avoid any confidential intercourse with either the landlady or the barmaid alleging as an excuse for his extra ordinary absence that his time was wholly occupied by the demands made on it by the editor of the Daily Delight missus Davis however was much too sharp and so also we may say was Miss Geraghty to be deceived They well knew that such a young man as Charley would go wherever his inclination led him Till lately it had been all but impossible to get him out of the little back parlour at the Cat and Whistle now it was nearly as difficult to get him into it They both understood what this meant You d better take up with Peppermint and have done with it said the widow What s the good of your shilly shallying till you re as thin as a whipping post If you don t mind what you re after he ll be off too And the d go along with him said Miss Geraghty who had still about her a twang of the County Clare from whence she came With all my heart said missus Davis I shall save my hundred pounds but if you ll be led by me you ll not throw Peppermint over till you re sure of the other and take my word for it you re I hate Peppermint Nonsense he s an honest good sort of man and a deal more likely to keep you out of want than the other Hereupon Norah began to cry and to wipe her beautiful eyes with the glass cloth Hers indeed was a cruel position Her face was her fortune and her fortune she knew was deteriorating from day to day She could not afford to lose the lover that she loved and also the lover that she did not love Matrimony with her was extremely desirable and she was driven to confess that it might very probably be either now or never Much as she hated Peppermint she was quite aware that she would take him if she could not do better But then was it absolutely certain that she must lose the lover that so completely suited her taste missus Davis said it was Norah herself confiding as it is so natural that ladies should do a little too much in her own beauty thought that she couldn t but have a chance left She also had her high aspirations she desired to rise in the world to leave goes of gin and screws of tobacco behind her and to reach some position more worthy of the tastes of a woman Excelsior translated doubtless into excellent Irish was her motto also It would be so great a thing to be the wife of Charles Tudor esquire of the Civil Service and more especially as she dearly and truly loved the same Charles Tudor in her heart of hearts She knew however that it was not for her to indulge in the luxury of a heart if circumstances absolutely forbade it To eat and drink and clothe herself and if possible to provide eating and drinking and clothes for her future years this was the business of life this was the only real necessity She had nothing to say in opposition to missus Davis and therefore she went on crying and again wiped her eyes with the glass cloth missus Davis however was no stern monitor unindulgent to the weakness of human nature When she saw how Norah took to heart her sad fate she resolved to make one more effort in her favour She consequently dressed herself very nicely put on her best bonnet and took the unprecedented step of going off to the Internal Navigation and calling on Charley in the middle of his office Charley was poking over the Kennett and Avon lock entries with his usual official energy when the office messenger came up and informed him that a lady was waiting to see him A lady said Charley what lady and he immediately began thinking of the Woodwards whom he was to meet that afternoon at Chiswick I m sure I can t say sir all that she said was that she was a lady answered the messenger falsely for he well knew that the woman was missus Davis of the Cat and Whistle Now the clerks at the Internal Navigation were badly off for a waiting room and in no respect can the different ranks of different public offices be more plainly seen than in the presence or absence of such little items of accommodation as this At the Weights and Measures there was an elegant little chamber carpeted furnished with leathern bottomed chairs and a clock supplied with cream laid note paper new pens and the Times newspaper quite a little Elysium in which to pass half an hour while the Secretary whom one had called to see was completing his last calculation on the matter of the decimal coinage But there were no such comforts at the Internal Navigation There was indeed a little room at the top of the stairs in which visitors were requested to sit down but even here two men were always at work at work or else at play Into this room missus Davis was shown and there Charley found her Long and intimately as the young navvy had been acquainted with the landlady of the Cat and Whistle he had never before seen her arrayed for the outer world It may be doubted whether Sir John Falstaff would at the first glance have known even Dame Quickly in her bonnet that is if Dame Quickly in those days had had a bonnet At any rate Charley was at fault for a moment and was shaking hands with the landlady before he quite recognized who she was The men in the room however had recognized her and Charley well knew that they had done so mister Tudor she began not a bit abashed I want to know what it is you are a going to do Though she was not abashed Charley was and very much so However he contrived to get her out of the room so that he might speak to her somewhat more privately in the passage The gentlemen at the Internal Navigation were well accustomed to this mode of colloquy as their tradesmen not unfrequently called with the view of having a little conversation which could not conveniently be held in the public room And mister Tudor what are you a going to do about that poor girl there said missus Davis as soon as she found herself in the passage and saw that Charley was comfortably settled with his back against the wall She may go to Hong Kong for me That is what Charley should have said But he did not say it He had neither the sternness of heart nor the moral courage to enable him to do so He was very anxious it is true to get altogether quit of Norah Geraghty but his present immediate care was confined to a desire of getting missus Davis out of the office Do said Charley Oh I don t know I ll come and settle something some of these days let me see when say next Tuesday Settle something said missus Davis If you are an honest man as I take you there is only one thing to settle when do you mean to marry her Hush said Charley for as she was speaking mister Snape came down the passage leading from mister Oldeschole s room Hush mister Snape as he passed walked very slowly and looked curiously round into the widow s face I ll be even with you old fellow for that said Charley to himself and it may be taken for granted that he kept his word before long Oh it is no good hushing any more said missus Davis hardly waiting till mister Snape s erect ears were out of hearing Hushing won t do no good there s that girl a dying and her grave ll be a top of your head mister Tudor mind I tell you that fairly so now I want to know what it to you re a going to do And then missus Davis lifted up the lid of a market basket which hung on her left arm took out her pocket handkerchief and began to wipe her eyes Unfortunate Charley An idea occurred to him that he might bolt and leave her But then the chances were that she would make her way into his very room and tell her story there out before them all He well knew that this woman was capable of many things if her temper were fairly roused And yet what could he say to her to induce her to go out from that building and leave him alone to his lesser misfortunes She s a dying I tell you mister Tudor continued the landlady and if she do die be sure of this I won t be slow to tell the truth about it I m the only friend she s got and I m not going to see her put upon So just tell me this in two words what is it you re a going to do And then missus Davis replaced her kerchief in the basket stood boldly erect in the middle of the passage waiting for Charley s answer Just at this moment mister Snape again appeared in the passage going towards mister Oldeschole s room The pernicious old man He hated Charley Tudor and to tell the truth there was no love lost between them Charley afflicted and out of spirits as he was at the moment could not resist the opportunity of being impertinent to his old foe I m afraid you ll make yourself very tired mister Snape if you walk about so much said he mister Snape merely looked at him and then hard at missus Davis and passed on to mister Oldeschole s room Well mister Tudor will you be so good as to tell me what it is you re going to do about this poor girl My goodness missus Davis you know how I am situated how can you expect me to give an answer to such a question in such a place as this I ll come to the Cat and Whistle on Tuesday Gammon said the eloquent lady You know you means gammon Charley perhaps did mean gammon but he protested that he had never been more truthfully in earnest in his life mister Oldeschole s door opened and missus Davis perceiving it whipped out her handkerchief in haste and again began wiping her eyes not without audible sobs Confound the woman said Charley to himself what on earth shall I do with her mister Oldeschole s door opened and out of it came mister Oldeschole and mister Snape following him What means the clerk had used to bring forth the Secretary need not now be inquired Forth they both came and passed along the passage brushing close by Charley and missus Davis mister Oldeschole when he saw that one of the clerks was talking to a woman who apparently was crying looked very intently on the ground and passed by with a quick step mister Snape looked as intently at the woman and passed very slowly Each acted according to his lights I don t mean gammon at all missus Davis indeed I don t I ll be there on Tuesday night certainly if not sooner I will indeed I shall be in a desperate scrape if they see me here talking to you any longer there is a rule against women being in the office at all And there s a rule against the clerks marrying I suppose said missus Davis The colloquy ended in Charley promising to spend the Saturday evening at the Cat and Whistle with the view of then and there settling what he meant to do about that there girl nothing short of such an undertaking on his part would induce missus Davis to budge Had she known her advantage she might have made even better terms He would almost rather have given her a written promise to marry her barmaid than have suffered her to remain there till mister Oldeschole should return and see her there again So missus Davis with her basket and pocket handkerchief went her way about her marketing and Charley as he returned to his room gave the strictest injunctions to the messenger that not on any ground or excuse whatever was any woman to be again allowed to see him at the office When therefore on the fine summer morning with the early daylight all bright around him Charley walked home from missus Val s party he naturally felt sad enough He had one sixpence left in his pocket he was engaged to spend the evening of the following day with the delightful Norah at the Cat and Whistle then and there to plight her his troth in whatever formal and most irretrievable manner missus Davis might choose to devise and as he thought of these things he had ringing in his ears the last sounds of that angel voice You will be steady Charley won t you I know you will dear Charley won t you now Steady Would not the best thing for him be to step down to Waterloo Bridge and throw himself over He still had money enough left to pay the toll though not enough to hire a pistol And so he went home and got into bed On that same day the day that was to witness Charley s betrothal to Miss Geraghty and that of M Jaquetanape with Miss Golightly Alaric Tudor had an appointment with Sir Gregory Hardlines at the new office of the Civil Service Examination Board Alaric had been invited to wait upon the great man in terms which made him perfectly understand that the communication to be made was one which would not be unpleasing or uncomplimentary to himself Indeed he pretty well guessed what was to be said to him Since his promotion at the Weights and Measures he had gone on rising in estimation as a man of value to the Civil Service at large Nearly two years had now passed since that date and in these pages nothing has been said of his official career during the time It had however been everything that he or his friends could have wished it to be He had so put himself forward as absolutely to have satisfied the actual chief clerk of his office and was even felt by some of the secretaries to be treading very closely on their heels And yet a great portion of his time had been spent not at the Weights and Measures but in giving some sort of special assistance to Sir Gregory s Board The authorities at the Weights and Measures did not miss him they would have been well content that he should have remained for ever with Sir Gregory He had also become somewhat known to the official world even beyond the confines of the Weights and Measures or the Examination Board He had changed his club and now belonged to the Downing He had there been introduced by his friend Undy to many men whom to know should be the very breath in the nostrils of a rising official aspirant mister Whip Vigil of the Treasury had more than once taken him by the hand and even the Chancellor of the Exchequer usually nodded to him whenever that o ertasked functionary found a moment to look in at the official club Things had not been going quite smoothly at the Examination Board Tidings had got about that mister Jobbles was interfering with Sir Gregory and that Sir Gregory didn t like it To be sure when this had been indiscreetly alluded to in the House by one of those gentlemen who pass their leisure hours in looking out for raws in the hide of the Government carcass some other gentleman some gentleman from the Treasury bench had been able to give a very satisfactory reply For why indeed should any gentleman sit on the Treasury bench if he be not able when so questioned to give very satisfactory replies Giving satisfactory replies to ill natured questions is one may say the constitutional work of such gentlemen who have generally well learned how to do so and earned their present places by asking the selfsame questions themselves when seated as younger men in other parts of the House But though the answer given in this instance was so eminently satisfactory as to draw down quite a chorus of triumphant acclamations from the official supporters of Government nevertheless things had not gone on at the Board quite as smoothly as might have been desirable mister Jobbles was enthusiastically intent on examining the whole adult male population of Great Britain and had gone so far as to hint that female competitors might at some future time be made subject to his all measuring rule and compass Sir Gregory however who having passed his early days in an office may perhaps be supposed to have had some slight prejudice remaining in favour of ancient customs was not inclined to travel so quickly Moreover he preferred following his own lead to taking any other lead whatever that mister Jobbles might point out as preferable mister Jobbles wanted to crush all patronage at a blow any system of patronage would lamentably limit the number of candidates among whom his examination papers would be distributed He longed to behold crowding around him an attendance as copious as mister Spurgeon s and to see every head bowed over the posing questions which he should have dictated No legion could be too many for him He longed to be at this great work but his energies were crushed by the opposition of his colleagues Sir Gregory thought and Sir Warwick though he hardly gave a firm support to Sir Gregory would not lend his countenance to mister Jobbles Sir Gregory thought that enough would be done for the present if they merely provided that every one admitted into the Service should be educated in such a manner as to be fit for any profession or calling under the sun and that with this slight proviso the question of patronage might for the present remain untouched Do you he would have said to the great officers of Government appoint whom you like In this respect remain quite unfettered I however I am the saint Peter to whom are confided the keys of the Elysium Do you send whatever candidates you please it is for me merely to say whether or not they shall enter But mister Jobbles would have gone much farther He would have had all mankind for candidates and have selected from the whole mass those most worthy of the high reward And so there was a split at the Examination Board which was not to be healed even by the very satisfactory reply given by the Treasury gentleman in the House of Commons Neither Sir Gregory nor his rival were men likely to give way and it soon appeared manifest to the powers that be that something must be done It therefore came to light that mister Jobbles had found that his clerical position was hardly compatible with a seat at a lay board and he retired to the more congenial duties of a comfortable prebendal stall at Westminster So that by his close vicinity as was observed by a newspaper that usually supported the Government he might be able to be of material use whenever his advice should be required by the Board of Commissioners Sir Gregory in the meantime was instructed to suggest the name of another colleague and therefore he sent for Alaric Tudor Alaric of course knew well what had been going on at the Board He had been Sir Gregory s confidential man all through had worked out cases for him furnished him with arguments backed his views and had assisted him whenever such a course had been necessary in holding mister Jobbles head under the pump Alaric knew well on which side his bread was buttered and could see with a glance which star was in the ascendant he perfectly understood the points and merits of the winning horse He went in to win upon Sir Gregory and he won When mister Jobbles made his last little speech at the Board and retired to his house in the Dean s yard Alaric felt tolerably certain that he himself would be invited to fill the vacant place And he was so invited That is Ltwelve hundred a year at any rate said he to himself as with many words of submissive gratitude he thanked his patron for the nomination That is Ltwelve hundred a year So far so good And now what must be the next step Excelsior It is very nice to be a Commissioner and sit at a Board at Sir Gregory s right hand much nicer than being a junior clerk at the Weights and Measures like Harry Norman But there are nicer things even than that there are greater men even than Sir Gregory richer figures than even Ltwelve hundred a year So he went to his old office wrote his resignation and walked home meditating to what next step above he should now aspire to rise Excelsior he still said to himself Excelsior At the same moment Charley was leaving the Internal Navigation and as he moved with unusual slowness down the steps he bethought himself how he might escape from the fangs of his Norah how if such might still be possible he might fit himself for the love of Katie Woodward Excelsior such also was the thought of his mind but he did not dare to bring the word to utterance It was destined that his thoughts should be interrupted by no very friendly hand CHAPTER XXVIII OUTERMAN v TUDOR Charley sat at his office on the Saturday afternoon very meditative and unlike himself What was he to do when his office hours were over In the first place he had not a shilling in the world to get his dinner His habit was to breakfast at home at his lodgings with Harry and then to dine as best he might at some tavern if he had not the good fortune to be dining out He had a little dinner bill at a house which he frequented in the Strand but the bill he knew had reached its culminating point It would he was aware be necessary that it should be decreased not augmented at the next commercial transaction which might take place between him and the tavern keeper This was not the first time by many in which he had been in a similar plight but his resource in such case had been to tell the truth gallantly to his friend missus Davis and some sort of viands not at all unprepossessing to him in his hunger would always be forthcoming for him at the Cat and Whistle This supply was now closed to him Were he under his present circumstances to seek for his dinner from the fair hands of Norah Geraghty it would be tantamount to giving himself up as lost for ever This want of a dinner however was a small misfortune in comparison with others which afflicted him Should or should he not keep his promise to missus Davis and go to the Cat and Whistle that evening That was the question which disturbed his equanimity and hindered him from teasing mister Snape in his usual vivacious manner And here let it not be said that Charley must be altogether despicable in being so weak that he is not only a vulgar rake in his present habits but a fool also and altogether spiritless and of a low disposition Persons who may so argue of him who so argue of those whom they meet in the real living world are ignorant of the twists and turns and rapid changes in character which are brought about by outward circumstances Many a youth abandoned by his friends to perdition on account of his folly might have yet prospered had his character not been set down as gone before in truth it was well formed It is not one calf only that should be killed for the returning prodigal Oh fathers mothers uncles aunts guardians and elderly friends in general kill seven fatted calves if seven should unfortunately be necessary And then there was a third calamity Charley had at this moment in his pocket a certain document which in civil but still somewhat peremptory language invited him to meet a very celebrated learned pundit being no less than one of Her Majesty s puisne judges at some court in Westminster to explain why he declined to pay to one Nathaniel Outerman a tailor the sum of c c c and the document then went on to say that any hesitation on Charley s part to accept this invitation would be regarded as great contempt shown to the said learned pundit and would be treated accordingly Now Charley had not paid the slightest attention to this requisition from the judge It would he conceived have been merely putting his head into the lion s mouth to do so But yet he knew that such documents meant something that the day of grace was gone by and that mister Nathaniel Outerman would very speedily have him locked up So Charley sat meditative over his lock entries and allowed even his proposed vengeance on mister Snape to be delayed I say Charley said Scatterall coming over and whispering to him you couldn t lend me half a crown could you Charley said nothing but looked on his brother navvy in a manner that made any other kind of reply quite unnecessary I was afraid it was so said Scatterall in a melancholy voice And then as if by the brilliance of his thought he had suddenly recovered his spirits he made a little proposition I ll tell you what you might do Charley I put my watch up the spout last week It s a silver turnip so I only got fifteen shillings yours is a Cox and Savary and it s gold I m sure you d get Lthree for it easily perhaps Lthree threes Now if you ll do that and take my turnip down I ll let you have the turnip to wear if you ll let me have ten shillings of the money You see you d get clear let me see how much And Scatterall went to work with a sheet of foolscap paper endeavouring to make some estimate of what amount of ready cash Charley might have in his pocket on completion of this delicate little arrangement You be d said Charley You ll not do it then said Dick Charley merely repeated with a little more emphasis the speech which he had just before made Oh very well said Scatterall there couldn t have been a fairer bargain at least it was all on your side for you would have had the watch to wear and nearly all the money too Charley still repeated the same little speech This was uncivil for it had evidently been looked on by Scatterall as unsatisfactory Oh very well said that gentleman now in a state of mild anger only I saw that you had a fine new purse and I thought you d wish to have something to put in it Charley again repeated his offensive mandate but he did it in a spirit of bravado in order to maintain his reputation The allusion to the purse made him sadder than ever He put his hand into his breast pocket and felt that it was near his heart and then he fancied that he again heard her words You will be steady won t you dear Charley At four o clock he was by no means in his usual hurry to go away and he sat there drawing patterns on his blotting paper and chopping up a stick of sealing wax with his penknife in a very disconsolate way Scatterall went Corkscrew went mister Snape having carefully brushed his hat and taken down from its accustomed peg the old cotton umbrella also took his departure and the fourth navvy who inhabited the same room went also The iron fingered hand of time struck a quarter past four on the Somerset House clock and still Charley Tudor lingered at his office The maid who came to sweep the room was thoroughly amazed and knew that something must be wrong Just as he was about to move mister Oldeschole came bustling into the room Where is Corkscrew said he Gone said Charley And Scatterall asked Oldeschole Gone sir said Charley And mister Snape said the Secretary Oh he is gone of course said Charley taking his revenge at last Then mister Tudor I must trouble you to copy these papers for me at once They are wanted immediately for Sir Gregory Hardlines It was quite clear that mister Oldeschole was very much in earnest about the job and that he was rejoiced to find that he still had one clerk to aid him Charley sat down and did the required work On any other day he would greatly have disliked such a summons but now he did not care much about it He made the copies however as quickly as he could and then took them in to mister Oldeschole The worthy Secretary rewarded him by a lecture a lecture however which as Charley well understood was intended all in kindness He told him how mister Snape complained of him how the office books told against him how the clerks talked and all Somerset House made stories of his grotesque iniquities With penitential air Charley listened and promised mister Oldeschole promised also that bygones should be bygones I wonder whether the old cock would lend me a five pound note I dare say he would said Charley to himself as he left the office He abstained however from asking for it Returning to his room he took his hat and went downstairs As he was sauntering forth through the archway into the Strand a man with a decent coat but a very bad hat came up to him I m afraid I must trouble you to go with me mister Tudor said the man All right said Charley Outerman I suppose isn t it All right said the bailiff And away the two walked together to a sponging house in Cursitor Street Charley had been arrested at the suit of mister Outerman the tailor He perfectly understood the fact and made no special objection to following the bailiff One case was at any rate off his mind he could not now be his will to do so ever so good keep his appointment with Norah Geraghty Perhaps it was quite as well for him to be arrested just at this moment as be left at liberty It must have come sooner or later So he walked on with the bailiff not without some feeling of consolation The man had suggested to him a cab but Charley had told him without the slightest mauvaise honte that he had not about him the means of paying for a cab The man again suggested that perhaps he had better go home and get some money as he would find it in Cursitor Street very desirable to have some To this Charley replied that neither had he any money at home That s blue said the man It is rather blue said Charley and on they went very amicably arm in arm We need not give any detailed description of Charley s prison house He was luckily not detained there so long as to make it necessary that we should become acquainted with his fellow captives or even have much intercourse with his jailers He was taken to the sponging house and it was there imparted to him that he had better send for two things first of all for money which was by far the more desirable of the two and secondly for bail which even if forthcoming was represented as being at best but a dubious advantage There s missus Davis she d bail you of course and willing said the bailiff missus Davis said Charley surprised that the man should know aught of his personal acquaintances Yes missus Davis of the Cat and Whistle She d do it in course along of Miss Geraghty Charley perceived with a shudder that his matrimonial arrangements were known and talked of even in the distant world of Cursitor Street He declined however the assistance of the landlady which no doubt would have been willingly forthcoming and was divided between his three friends Alaric Harry and mister M Ruen Alaric was his cousin and his natural resource in such a position but he had lately rejected Alaric s advice and now felt a disinclination to call upon him in his difficulty Harry he knew would assist him would at once pay mister Outerman s bill and relieve him from all immediate danger but the sense of what he already owed to Norman made him unwilling to incur further obligations so he decided on sending for mister M Ruen In spite of his being so poorly supplied with immediate cash it was surmised from his appearance clothes and known rank that any little outlay made in his behalf would be probably repaid and he was therefore furnished with a messenger on credit This man was first to call at mister M Ruen s with a note and then to go to Charley s lodgings and get his brushes razors c these being the first necessaries of life for which a man naturally looks when once overtaken by such a misfortune as that with which Charley was now afflicted In the process of time the brushes and razors came and so did mister M Ruen This is very kind of you said Charley in rather a doleful voice for he was already becoming tired of Cursitor Street mister M Ruen twisted his head round inside his cravat and put out three fingers by way of shaking hands with the prisoner You seem pretty comfortable here said M Ruen Charley dissented to this and said that he was extremely uncomfortable And what is it that I can do for you mister Tudor said M Ruen Do for me Why bail me to be sure they won t let me out unless somebody bails me You know I shan t run away Bail you said M Ruen Yes bail me said Charley You don t mean to say that you have any objection mister M Ruen looked very sharply at his young client from head to foot I don t know about bail he said it s very dangerous very why didn t you send for mister Norman or your cousin Because I didn t choose said Charley because I preferred sending to some one I could pay for the trouble Ha ha ha laughed M Ruen but that s just it can you pay You owe me a great deal of money mister Tudor You are so unpunctual you know There are two ways of telling that story said Charley but come I don t want to quarrel with you about that now you go bail for me now and you ll find your advantage in it You know that well enough Ha ha ha laughed the good humoured usurer ha ha ha well upon my word I don t know You owe me a great deal of money mister Tudor Now what o clock is it by you I wonder Charley took out his watch the Cox and Savary before alluded to and said that it was past seven Aye you ve a very nice watch I see Come mister Tudor you owe me a great deal of money and you are the most unpunctual young man I know but yet I don t like to see you distressed I ll tell you what now do you hand over your watch to me just as a temporary loan you can t want it here you know and I ll come down and bail you out to morrow Charley declined dealing on these terms and then mister M Ruen at last went away leaving Charley to his fate and lamenting quite pathetically that he was such an unpunctual young man so very unpunctual that it was impossible to do anything to assist him Charley however manfully resisted the second attack upon his devoted watch That s very blue very blue indeed said the master of the house as mister M Ruen took his departure ha n t you got no huncles nor hants nor nothin of that sort Charley declared that he had lots of uncles and aunts grandfathers and grandmothers and a perfect wealth of cousins and that he would send for some of the leading members of his family to morrow Satisfied with this the man supplied him with bread and cheese gin and water and plenty of tobacco and fortified with these comforts Charley betook himself at last very lugubriously to a filthy uninviting bed He had we have seen sent for his brushes and hence came escape but in a manner that he had little recked of and of which had he been asked he would as little have approved missus Richards his landlady was not slow in learning from the messenger how it came to pass that Charley wanted the articles of his toilet so suddenly demanded Why you see he s just been quodded said the boy missus Richards was quite enough up to the world and had dealt with young men long enough to know what this meant nor indeed was she much surprised She had practical knowledge that Charley had no strong propensity to pay his debts and she herself was not unaccustomed to answer the emissaries of mister Outerman and other greedy tradesmen who were similarly situated To missus Richards herself Charley was not in debt and she had therefore nothing to embitter her own feelings against him Indeed she had all that fondness for him which a lodging house keeper generally has for a handsome dissipated easy tempered young man and when she heard that he had been quodded immediately made up her mind that steps must be taken for his release But what was she to do Norman who she was aware would unquod him immediately if he were in the way was down at Hampton and was not expected to be at his lodgings for two or three days After some cogitation missus Richards resolved that there was nothing for it but to go down to Hampton herself and break the news to his friends Charley would not have been a bit obliged to her had he known it but missus Richards acted for the best There was a train down to Hampton Court that night and a return train to bring her home again so off she started missus Woodward had on that same afternoon taken down Katie who was still an invalid Norman had gone down with them and was to remain there for some few days going up and down every morning and evening missus Woodward was sitting in the drawing room Linda and Katie were with her the latter lying in state on her sofa as invalid young ladies should do Captain Cuttwater was at Hampton Court and Norman was on the water when a fly from the railway made its way up to the door of the Cottage missus Richards ma am said the demure parlour maid ushering in the lodging house keeper who in her church going best made a very decent appearance Oh missus Richards how are you said missus Woodward who knew the woman very well pray sit down are there any news from London Oh ma am such news such bad news Mister Charley Up jumped Katie from her sofa and stood erect upon the floor She stood there with her mouth slightly open with her eyes intently fixed on missus Richards with her little hands each firmly clenched drawing her breath with hard short palpitating efforts There she stood but said nothing Oh missus Richards what is it said missus Woodward for Heaven s sake what is the matter Oh ma am he s been took said missus Richards Took repeated missus Woodward Katie dear Katie sit down my child sit down Oh mamma oh mamma said she apparently unable to move and certainly all but unable to stand Tell us missus Richards what is it what has happened to mister Tudor and as she spoke missus Woodward got up and passed her arm around her younger daughter s waist Linda also got up and joined the group Why ma am said missus Richards he s been took by the bailiffs and now he s in prison Katie did not faint She never had fainted and probably did not know the way but she clenched her hands still tighter breathed harder than before and repeated her appeal to her mother in a voice of agony Oh mamma oh mamma Katie had no very accurate conception of what an arrest for debt meant She knew that next to death imprisonment was the severest punishment inflicted on erring mortals and she now heard that Charley was in prison She did not stop to think whether it was for his life or for some more limited period It was enough for her to know that this terrible misfortune had come upon him to him who to her young fancy was so bright so good so clever so excellent upon him who had saved her life upon him whom she so dearly loved Oh mamma oh mamma she said and then in agony she shut her eyes and shuddered violently missus Woodward was greatly afflicted She was indeed sorry to hear such tidings of Charley Tudor but her grief was now deeper even than that She could not be longer blind to the sort of feeling which her child evinced for this young man she could not think that these passionate bursts of overpowering sorrow were the result of mere childish friendship she could not but see that her Katie s bosom now held a woman s heart and that that heart was no longer her own And then missus Woodward reflected of what nature of what sort was this man whom she had allowed to associate with her darling almost as a brother does with his sister whom she had warmed in her bosom till he had found an opportunity of inflicting this deadly wound With terrible bitterness she upbraided herself as she sat down and bade missus Richards go on with her tale She knew that nothing which could now be said would add to Katie s anguish missus Richards story was soon told It simply amounted to this that Mister Charley as she always called him had been arrested for debt at the suit of a tailor and that she had learnt the circumstances from the fact of the prisoner having sent for his brushes And so I thought the best thing was to come and tell mister Norman said missus Richards concluding her speech Nothing could be done till Norman came in Linda went out with missus Richards to get some refreshment in the dining room and missus Woodward sat with her arm round Katie s neck on the sofa comforting her with kisses and little caressing touches but saying nothing Katie still unconscious of her passion gave way to spasmodic utterance of her own grief Oh mamma she said what can be done What can we do You will do something mamma won t you Poor Charley Dear Charley Harry will do something won t he Won t Harry go to London and do something missus Woodward did what she could to quiet her Something should be done she said They must wait till Harry came in and then settle what was best Nothing could be done till Harry came in You must be patient Katie or else you will make yourself really ill Katie became afraid that she would be sent off to bed on the score of her illness before Harry had come and thus lose the advantage of hearing what was the step decided on So she sat silent in the corner of her sofa feigning to be asleep but pondering in her mind what sort of penalties were the penalties of imprisonment how dreadful how endurable or how unendurable Would they put chains on him would they starve him would they cut off his beautiful brown hair missus Woodward sat silent waiting for Harry s return When first she had watched Katie s extreme misery and guessed the secret of her child s heart she had felt something like hard bitter anger against Charley But by degrees this feeling softened down It was by no means natural to her nor akin to her usual tenderness After all the fault hitherto was probably more her own than his missus Richards was sent back to town She was thanked for the trouble she had taken and told that mister Norman would do in the matter all that was necessary to be done So she took her departure and Linda returned to the drawing room Unfortunately Captain Cuttwater came in first They none of them mentioned Charley s misfortune to him Charley was no favourite with Uncle Bat and his remarks would not have been of the most cheering tendency At last Norman came also He came as was his wont through the drawing room window and throwing himself into a chair began to tell the girls how much they had lost by not joining him on the river Harry said missus Woodward step into the dining room with me for a moment Harry got up to follow her Katie and Linda also instantly jumped from their seats to do the same missus Woodward looked round and motioned to them to stay with their uncle Linda obediently though reluctantly remained but Katie s impulse was too strong for her She gave one imploring look at her mother a look which missus Woodward well understood and then taking silence for consent crept into the dining room Harry said missus Woodward as soon as the dining room door was closed Charley has been arrested and then she told him how missus Richards had been at the Cottage and what was the nature of the tidings she had brought Norman was not much surprised nor did he feign to be so He took the news so coolly that Katie almost hated him Did she say who had arrested him or what was the amount he asked missus Woodward replied that she knew no more than what she had already told Katie stood in the shade with her eyes fixed upon her cousin but as yet she said nothing How cruel how stony hearted must he be to hear such dreadful tidings and remain thus undisturbed Had Charley heard that Norman was arrested he would have been half way to London by this time So at least thought Katie Something can be done for him Harry can there not We must contrive to do something eh Harry said missus Woodward I fear it is too late to do anything to night said Harry looking at his watch The last train is gone and I could not possibly find him out before twelve And to morrow is Sunday said missus Woodward Oh Harry pray do something said Katie pray pray pray do Oh Harry think of Charley being in prison Oh Harry he would do anything for you and then she burst into tears and caught hold of Harry s arm and the front of his coat to add force to her entreaty Katie said her mother don t be so foolish Harry will of course do whatever is best But mamma he says he will do nothing why does he not go at once I will go at once dear Katie said he I will go now directly I don t know whether we can set him free to night or even to morrow as to morrow is Sunday but it certainly shall be done on Monday you may be sure of that at any rate Whatever can be done shall be done and without further talk upon the subject he took his hat and went his way May God Almighty bless him said missus Woodward How infinitely greater are truth and honesty than any talent however brilliant She spoke only to herself and no one even guessed what was the nature of the comparison which she thus made As soon as Norman was gone Katie went to bed and in the morning she was pronounced to be too unwell to get up And indeed she was far from well During the night she only slept by short starts and in her sleep she was restless and uneasy then when she woke she would burst out into fits of tears and lie sobbing hysterically till she slept again In the morning missus Woodward said something about Charley s misconduct and this threw her into a wretched state of misery from which nothing would rouse her till her mother promised that the prodigal should not be thrown over and abandoned Poor missus Woodward was in a dreadful state of doubt as to what it now behoved her to do She felt that however anxious she might be to assist Charley for his own sake it was her bounden duty to separate him from her child Whatever merits he might have and in her eyes he had many at any rate he had not those which a mother would desire to see in the future husband of her daughter He was profligate extravagant careless and idle his prospects in life were in every respect bad he had no self respect no self reliance no moral strength Was it not absolutely necessary that she should put a stop to any love that might have sprung up between such a man as this and her own young bright eyed darling Put a stop to it Yes indeed most expedient nay absolutely necessary if it were only possible Now when it was too late she began to perceive that she had not known of what material her own child was formed At sixteen Gertrude and Linda had in reality been little more than children In manner Katie had been more childish even than them and yet missus Woodward as she thought of these things felt her heart faint within her She was resolved that cost what it might Charley must be banished from the Cottage But at the first word of assumed displeasure that she uttered Katie fell into such an agony of grief that her soft heart gave way and she found herself obliged to promise that the sinner should be forgiven Katie the while was entirely unconscious of the state of her own feelings Had she thought that she loved him as women love had any thought of such love and of him together even entered her mind she could not have talked of him as she now talked Had he been her brother she could not have been less guarded in her protestations of affection or more open in her appeals to her mother that he might be forgiven Such was her present state but it was doomed that her eyes should soon be opened and that she should know her own sorrow On the Sunday afternoon Norman returned to Hampton with the tidings that Charley was once more a free man The key of gold which he had taken with him had been found potent enough to open all barriers even those with which the sanctity of Sunday had surrounded the prisoner mister Outerman and the bailiff and the messenger had all been paid their full claims and Charley with his combs and brushes had returned to the more benign custody of missus Richards And why didn t he come down with you said Katie to Norman who had gone up to her bedroom to give her the good tidings Norman looked at missus Woodward but made no reply He would probably prefer remaining in town at present said missus Woodward It will be more comfortable for him to do so And then Katie was left alone to meditate why Charley should be more comfortable after his arrest in London than at Hampton and after a while she thought that she had surmised the truth Poor Charley perhaps he is ashamed He need not be ashamed to come at any rate to me CHAPTER XXIX EASY IS THE SLOPE OF HELL The electors for the Tillietudlem district burghs disgusted by the roguery of mister M Buffer and anxiously on the alert to replace him by a strictly honest man returned our friend Undy by a glorious majority He had no less than three hundred twelve votes as opposed to two hundred ninety seven and though threatened with the pains and penalties of a petition he was not a little elated by his success A petition with regard to the Tillietudlem burghs was almost as much a matter of course as a contest at any rate the threat of a petition was so Undy however had lived through this before and did not fear but that he might do so again Threatened folks live long parliamentary petitions are very costly and Undy s adversaries were if possible even in more need of money than himself He communicated his good fortune to his friend Alaric in the following letter Bellenden Arms Tillietudlem July one hundred eighty five My DEAR DIRECTOR Here I am once more a constituent part of the legislative wisdom of the United Kingdom thanks to the patriotic discretion of the pot wallopers burgage tenants and ten pound freeholders of these loyal towns The situation is a proud one I could only wish that it had been less expensive I am plucked as clean as ever was pigeon and over and above the loss of every feather I carried old M Cleury my agent here will have a bill against me that will hardly be settled before the next election I do not complain however a man cannot have luxuries without paying for them and this special luxury of serving one s country in Parliament is one for which a man has so often to pay without the subsequent fruition of the thing paid for that a successful candidate should never grumble however much he may have been mulcted They talk of a petition but thank God there are still such things as recognizances and moreover to give M Cleury his due I do not think he has left a hole open for them to work at He is a thorough rascal but no man does better work I find there is already a slight rise in the West Corks Keep your eye open If you find you can realize Lfour fours or even Lfour sell and let the West of Cork and Ballydehob go straight to the devil We should then be able to do better with our money But I doubt of such a sale with so large a stock as we hold I got a letter yesterday from that Cork attorney and I find that he is quite prepared to give way about the branch He wants his price of course and he must have it When once we have carried that point then it will be plain sailing our only regret then will be that we didn t go further into it The calls of course must be met I shall be able to do something in October but shall not have a shilling sooner unless I sell which I will not do under eightys I was delighted to hear of your promotion not that you ll remain in the shop long but it gives you a better name and a better claim Old Golightly was buried yesterday as of course you have heard missus Val quite agrees with me that your name had better be put in as that of Clem s trustee She s going to marry that d Frenchman What an unmitigated ass that cousin of yours must be I can t say I admire her taste but nevertheless she is welcome for me It would however be most scandalous if we were to allow him to get possession of her money He would as a matter of course make ducks and drakes of it in no time Speculate probably in some Russian railway or Polish mine and lose every shilling You will of course see it tied up tight in the hands of the trustees and merely pay him or if possible her the interest of it Now that I am once more in I hope we shall be able to do something to protect the fortunes of married women You will be quite safe in laying out Clem s money or a portion of it in the West Corks Indeed I don t know how you could well do better with it You will find Figgs a mere shadow I think we can pull through in this manner If not we must get to take our joint bill He would sooner do that than have the works stopped But then we should have to pay a tremendous price for it So we were well out of the Mary Janes at last The take last month was next to nothing and now she s full of water Manylodes hung on till just the last and yet got out on his feet after all That fellow will make a mint of money yet What a pity that he should be such a rogue If he were honest honest enough I mean to be trusted he might do anything I shall leave this on Wednesday night take the oaths on Thursday and will see you in the evening M Carthy Desmond will at once move that I be put on the West Cork Committee in place of Nogo who won t act My shares are all at present registered in Val s name It will be well however to have them all transferred to you Yours ever U S M Cleury has pledged himself to put me in again without further expense if I have to stand before the next general election in consequence of taking place under Government I earnestly hope his sincerity may be tried During the month of July Alaric was busy enough He had to do the work of his new office to attend to his somewhat critical duties as director of the West Cork Railway to look after the interests of Miss Golightly whose marriage was to take place in August and to watch the Parliamentary career of his friend Undy with whose pecuniary affairs he was now bound up in a manner which he could not avoid feeling to be very perilous July passed by and was now over and members were looking to be relieved from their sultry labours and to be allowed to seek air and exercise on the mountains The Ballydehob branch line had received the sanction of Parliament through the means which the crafty Undy had so well understood how to use but from some cause hitherto not sufficiently fathomed the shares had continued to be depressed in value in spite of that desirable event It was necessary however that calls should be paid up to the amount of Lfive a share and as Undy and Alaric held nearly a thousand shares between them a large amount of money was required This however was made to be forthcoming from Miss Golightly s fortune On the first of August that interesting young lady was married to the man shall we say of her heart or of her feet The marriage went off very nicely but as we have already had one wedding and as others may perhaps be before us we cannot spare much time or many pages to describe how Miss Golightly became Madame Jaquetanape The lady seemed well pleased with everything that was done and had even in secret but one care in the world There was to be a dance after she and her Victoire were gone and she could not join in it We however are in the position as regards Clementina in which needy gentlemen not unfrequently place themselves with reference to rich heiresses We have more concern with her money than herself She was married and M Jaquetanape became the happy possessor of an income of Leight hundred a year Everybody conceived him to behave well on the occasion He acknowledged that he had very little means of his own about four thousand francs a year from rents in Paris He expressed himself willing to agree to any settlement thinking perhaps with wisdom that he might in this way best make sure of his wife s income and was quite content when informed that he would receive his quarterly payments from so respectable a source as one of Her Majesty s Commissioners for the regulation of the Civil Service The Bank of France could not have offered better security Thus Alaric obtained full control of Miss Golightly s fortune for Figgs his company trustee was as has been said a shadow He obtained the full control of Ltwenty thousand and out of it he paid the calls due upon the West Cork shares held both by himself and Undy Scott But he put a salve upon his conscience and among his private memoranda appertaining to that lady s money affairs he made an entry intelligible to any who might read it that he had so invested this money on her behalf The entry was in itself a lie a foolish palpable lie and yet he found in it something to quiet remorse and stupefy his conscience Undy Scott had become tyrannical in his logic as soon as he had persuaded Alaric to make use of a portion of Madame Jaquetanape s marriage portion You have taken part of the girl s money was Undy s argument you have already converted to your own purposes so much of her fortune it is absurd for you now to talk of conscience and honesty of your high duties as a trustee of the inviolable distinction between meum and tuum You have already shown that the distinction is not inviolable let us have no more such nonsense there are still left Lfifteen thousand on which we can trade open the till and let us go on swimmingly with the business Alaric was not addressed absolutely in these words he would not probably have allowed the veil with which he still shrouded his dishonesty to be withdrawn with so rough a hand but that which was said was in effect the same In September he left town for a few weeks and went down to Scotland still with Undy Scott He had at first much liked this man s society for Scott was gay lively clever and a good companion at all points But latterly he had become weary of him He now put up with him as men in business have to put up with partners whom they may not like or perhaps to speak the truth openly he bore with him as a rogue bears with his confederate though he absolutely hates his brother rogue on account of his very roguery Alaric Tudor was now a rogue despite his high office his grand ideas his exalted ambition despite his talent zeal and well directed official labours he was a rogue a thief a villain who had stolen the money of the orphan who had undertaken a trust merely that he might break it a robber doubly disgraced by being a robber with an education a Bill Sykes without any of those excuses which a philanthropist cannot but make for wretches brought up in infamy Alas alas how is it that in these days such men become rogues How is it that we see in such frightful instances the impotency of educated men to withstand the allurements of wealth Men are not now more keen after the pleasures which wealth can buy than were their forefathers One would rather say that they are less so The rich labour now and work with an assiduity that often puts to shame the sweat in which the poor man earns his bread The rich rogue or the rogue that would be rich is always a laborious man He allows himself but little recreation for dishonest labour admits of no cessation His wheel is one which cannot rest without disclosing the nature of the works which move it It is not for pleasure that men Put rancours in the vessel of their peace nor yet primarily for ambition Men do not wish to rise by treachery or to become great through dishonesty The object the ultimate object which a man sets before himself is generally a good one But he sets it up in so enviable a point of view his imagination makes it so richly desirable by being gazed at it becomes so necessary to existence that its attainment is imperative The object is good but the means of attaining it the path to the object ah there is the slip Expediency is the dangerous wind by which so many of us have wrecked our little boats And we do so more now than ever because great ships swimming in deepest waters have unluckily come safe to haven though wafted there by the same pernicious wind Every great man who gains a great end by dishonest means does more to deteriorate his country and lower the standard of his countrymen than legions of vulgar thieves or nameless unaspiring rogues Who has injured us so much in this way as he whose name still stands highest among modern politicians Who has given so great a blow to political honesty has done so much to banish from men s minds the idea of a life ruling principle as Sir Robert Peel It would shock many were we to attribute to him the roguery of the Sadleirs and Camerons of the Robsons and Redpaths of the present day but could we analyse causes and effects we might perhaps do so with no injustice He has taught us as a great lesson that a man who has before him a mighty object may dispense with those old fashioned rules of truth to his neighbours and honesty to his own principles which should guide us in ordinary life At what point ordinary life ends at what crisis objects may be considered great enough to justify the use of a dispensing power that he has not taught us that no Sir Robert Peel can teach us that must unfortunately be left to the judgement of the individual How prone we are each of us to look on our own object as great how ready to make excuses for receiving such a lesson for our guide how willing to think that we may be allowed to use this dispensing power ourselves this experience teaches us in very plain language Thrice in his political life did Sir Robert Peel change his political creed and carry or assist to carry with more or less of self gratulation the measures of his adversaries Thrice by doing so he kept to himself that political power which he had fairly forfeited by previous opposition to the requirements of his country Such an apposition of circumstances is at any rate suspicious But let us give him credit for the expression of a true belief of a belief at first that the corn laws should be maintained and then of a belief that they should not let us with a forced confidence in his personal honesty declare so much of him nevertheless he should surely have felt had he been politically as well as personally honest that he was not the man to repeal them But it was necessary his apologist will say that the corn laws should be repealed he saw the necessity and yielded to it It certainly was necessary very necessary very unavoidable absolutely necessary one may say a fact which the united efforts of all the Peels of the day could in nowise longer delay having already delayed it to the utmost extent of their power It was essential that the corn laws should be repealed but by no means essential that this should be done by Sir Robert Peel It was a matter of indifference to us Englishmen who did the deed But to Sir Robert Peel it was a matter of great moment that he should do it He did it and posterity will point at him as a politician without policy as a statesman without a principle as a worshipper at the altar of expediency to whom neither vows sworn to friends nor declarations made to his country were in any way binding Had Sir Robert Peel lived and did the people now resolutely desire that the Church of England should be abandoned that Lords and Commons should bow the neck that the Crown should fall who can believe that Sir Robert Peel would not be ready to carry out their views Readers it may be that to you such deeds as those are horrible even to be thought of or expressed to me I own that they are so So also to Sir Robert Peel was Catholic Emancipation horrible so was Reform of Parliament so was the Corn Law Repeal They were horrible to him horrible to be thought of horrible to be expressed But the people required these measures and therefore he carried them arguing on their behalf with all the astuteness of a practised statesman That Sir Robert Peel should be a worshipper of expediency might be matter of small moment to any but his biographer were it not that we are so prone to copy the example of those whose names are ever in our mouths It has now become the doctrine of a large class of politicians that political honesty is unnecessary slow subversive of a man s interests and incompatible with quick onward movement Such a doctrine in politics is to be deplored but alas who can confine it to politics It creeps with gradual but still with sure and quick motion into all the doings of our daily life How shall the man who has taught himself that he may be false in the House of Commons how shall he be true in the Treasury chambers or if false there how true on the Exchange and if false there how shall he longer have any truth within him And thus Alaric Tudor had become a rogue and was obliged as it were in his own defence to consort with a rogue He went down to Scotland with Undy leaving his wife and child at home not because he could thus best amuse his few leisure days but because this new work of his this laborious trade of roguery allowed him no leisure days When can villany have either days or hours of leisure Among other things to be done in the north Alaric was to make acquaintance with the constituents of the little borough of Strathbogy which it was his ambition to represent in the next Parliament Strathbogy was on the confines of the Gaberlunzie property and indeed the lord s eldest son who was the present member lived almost within the municipal boundary Ca stocks Cottage as his residence was called was but a humble house for a peer s eldest son but mister Scott was not ashamed to live there and there for a while he entertained his brother Undy and Alaric Tudor mister Scott intended when the present session was over to retire from the labours of parliamentary life It may be that he thought that he had done enough for his country it may be that the men of Strathbogy thought that he had not done enough for them it may be that there was some family understanding between him and his brother This however was clear that he did not intend to stand again himself and that he professed himself ready to put forward Alaric Tudor as a worthy successor and to give him the full benefit and weight of the Gaberlunzie interest But not for nothing was Alaric to receive such important assistance There are but three hundred twelve electors altogether said Undy one morning as they went out shooting and out of these we can command a hundred and twenty It must be odd if you cannot get enough outsiders to turn them into a majority Indeed you may look on it as a certain seat No man in England or Scotland could give you one more certain This was not the first occasion on which Undy had spoken of all that he was doing for his friend and Alaric therefore somewhat disgusted with the subject made no reply I never had things made so easy for me when I wasn t in continued Undy nor have I ever found them so easy since I don t suppose it will cost you above Lfive hundred or at most Lsix hundred altogether Well that will be a comfort said Alaric A comfort why I should say it would What with the election and petition together Tillietudlem never cost me less than Ltwo thousand It cost me just as much too when I was thrown out That was a bore for you said Alaric Upon my word you take it rather coolly said Undy another man would thank a fellow for putting such a nice thing in his way If the obligation be so deep said Alaric becoming very red in the face I would rather not accept it It is not too late for you to take the cheaper seat to yourself if you prefer it and I will look elsewhere Oh of course perhaps at Tillietudlem but for Heaven s sake my dear fellow don t let us quarrel about it You are perfectly welcome to whatever assistance we can give you at Strathbogy I only meant to say that I hope it will be efficacious And on the score of expense I ll tell you what we ll do that is if you think that fair we ll put the cost of the two elections together and share and share alike Considering that the election will not take place for at least more than twelve months there will be time enough to settle that said Alaric Well that s true too said Undy and then they went on and for some time separated on the mountain complaining when they met again of the game being scarce and the dogs wild as men always do But as they walked home Undy who regretted the loss of good time again began about money matters How many of those bridge shares will you take said he This was a projected bridge from Poplar to Rotherhithe which had been got up by some city gentlemen and as to which Undy Scott was or pretended to be very sanguine None said Alaric Unless I can get rid of those confounded West Cork and Ballydehobs I can buy nothing more of anything Believe me my dear fellow the Ballydehobs are no such confounded things at all If you are ever a rich man it will be through the Ballydehobs But what you say about the bridge shares is nonsense You have a large command of capital and you cannot apply it better Alaric winced and wished in his heart that Clementina Jaquetanape nee Golightly with all her money was buried deep in the bogs of Ballydehob Though he was a rogue he could not yet bear his roguery with comfort to himself It sat however as easy on Undy as though he had been to the manner born I have no capital now at my disposal said he and I doubt whether I should be doing right to lay out a ward s money in such a manner A slight smile came over Undy s gay unconcerned features it was very slight but nevertheless it was very eloquent and very offensive also Alaric understood it well it made him hate the owner of it but it made him hate himself still more It is as well to be hung for a sheep as for a lamb said Undy s smile and moreover continued the smile is it not ridiculous enough for you Alaric Tudor rogue as you are to profess to me Undy Scott rogue as I am any solicitude as to your ward s welfare seeing that you have already taken to yourself for your own dishonest purposes a considerable slice of the fortune that has been trusted to your keeping You have done this and yet you talk to me of not having capital at your disposal You have capital and you will dispose of that capital for your own purposes as long as a shilling remains uninvested of your ward s money We are both rogues God knows it and you and I know it but I am not such a hypocritical rogue as to make mock boasts of my honesty to my brother rogue This was certainly a long speech to have been made by a smile which crossed mister Scott s face but for a moment but every word of it was there expressed and every word of it was there read Alaric did not at all like being addressed so uncivilly It seemed to tend but little to that Excelsior for which his soul panted but what could he do how could he help himself Was it not all true could he contradict the smile Alas it was true it was useless for him now to attempt even to combat such smiles Excelsior indeed his future course might now probably be called by some very different designation Easy very easy is the slope of hell Before they had returned to Ca stocks Cottage Undy had succeeded in persuading his friend that the game must be played on on and on and out If a man intends to make a fortune in the share market he will never do it by being bold one day and timid the next No turf betting book can be made up safely except on consistent principles Half measures are always ruinous In matters of speculation one attempt is made safe by another No man it is true can calculate accurately what may be the upshot of a single venture but a sharp fellow may calculate with a fair average of exactness what will be the aggregate upshot of many ventures All mercantile fortunes have been made by the knowledge and understanding of this rule If a man speculates but once and again now and then as it were he must of course be a loser He will be playing a game which he does not understand and playing it against men who do understand it Men who so play always lose But he who speculates daily puts himself exactly in the reversed position He plays a game which experience teaches him to play well and he plays generally against men who have no such advantage Of course he wins All these valuable lessons did Undy Scott teach to Alaric Tudor and the result was that Alaric agreed to order for self and partner a considerable number of shares in the Limehouse Bridge Company Easy very easy is the slope of hell And then in the evening on this evening and other evenings on all evenings they talked over the prospects of the West Cork and Ballydehob branch and of the Limehouse Bridge which according to Undy s theory is destined to work quite a revolution in the East end circles of the metropolis Undy had noble ideas about this bridge The shares at the present moment were greatly at a discount so much the better for they could be bought at a cheaper rate and they were sure to rise to some very respectable figure as soon as Undy should have played out with reference to them the parliamentary game which he had in view And so from morning to morning and from night to night they talked over their unholy trade till the price of shares and the sounds of sums of money entered into Alaric s soul And this perhaps is one of the greatest penalties to which men who embark in such trade are doomed that they can never shake off the remembrance of their calculations they can never drop the shop they have no leisure no ease they can never throw themselves with loose limbs and vacant mind at large upon the world s green sward and call children to come and play with them At the Weights and Measures Alaric s hours of business had been from ten to five In Undy s office they continued from one noon till the next incessantly even in his dreams he was working in the share market On his return to town Alaric found a letter from Captain Cuttwater pressing very urgently for the repayment of his money It had been lent on the express understanding that it was to be repaid when Parliament broke up It was now the end of October and Uncle Bat was becoming uneasy Alaric when he received the letter crushed it in his hand and cursed the strictness of the man who had done so much for him On the next day another slice was taken from the fortune of Madame Jaquetanape and his money with the interest was remitted to Captain Cuttwater CHAPTER XXX missus WOODWARD S REQUEST We will now go back for a while to Hampton The author for one does so with pleasure Though those who dwell there be not angels yet it is better to live with the Woodwards and Harry Norman with Uncle Bat or even with the unfortunate Charley than with such as Alaric and Undy Scott The man who is ever looking after money is fitting company only for the devils of whom indeed he is already one But Charley cannot any longer be called one of the Cottage circle It was now the end of October and since the day of his arrest he had not yet been there He had not been asked nor would he go uninvited as after what had passed at Hampton Court Bridge he surely might have done And consequently they were all unhappy No one was more so than Charley When the prospect of the happy evening with Norah had been so violently interrupted by his arrest he had among his other messages sent word to the Cat and Whistle excusing his absence by a statement of the true cause From that day to this of which we are now speaking he had seen neither missus Davis nor her fair protegee Nor were they better contented at the Cottage missus Woodward was harassed by different feelings and different fears which together made her very unhappy Her Katie was still ill not ill indeed so that she was forced to keep her bed and receive daily visits from pernicious doctors but nevertheless so ill as to make a mother very anxious She had never been quite strong quite herself from the night of missus Val s dance The doctor who had attended her declared that her ducking in the river had given her cold and that this not having been duly checked still hung about her Then she had been taken to a physician in London who poked her on the back and tapped her on the breast listened to her lungs through a wooden pipe such was the account which Katie gave herself when she returned home and prescribed rum and milk and cod liver oil declaring with an authoritative nod that there was no organic disease as yet And what shall we do with her doctor asked missus Woodward Go on with the rum and milk and cod liver oil you can t do better And the cough doctor Why if that doesn t go before the cold weather begins you may as well take her to Torquay for the winter Oh consumption thou scourge of England s beauty how many mothers gasping with ill suppressed fears have listened to such words as these have listened and then hoped listened again and hoped again with fainter hopes have listened again and then hoped no more But there was much on missus Woodward s mind which she could not bring herself to tell to any doctor but which still left in her breast an impression that she was perhaps keeping back the true cause of Katie s illness Charley had not been at Hampton since his arrest and it was manifest to all that Katie was therefore wretched But why do you not ask him mamma she had urged when her mother suggested that he stayed away because he did not like to show himself after what had occurred What will he think of us he that saved my life mamma Oh mamma you promised to forgive him Do ask him You know he will come if you ask him missus Woodward could not explain to her could not explain to any one why she did not invite him Norman guessed it all and missus Woodward saw that he had done so but still she could not talk to him of Katie s feelings could not tell him that she feared her child was heart laden with so sad a love So missus Woodward had no confidant in her sorrow no counsel which she could seek to aid her own wavering judgement It was prudent she thought that Katie and Charley should be kept apart Prudent was it not even imperative on her to save her child from such a fate But then when she saw the rosy cheek grow pale by degrees as she watched the plump little arms grow gradually thin and wan as those high spirits fell and that voice which had ever been so frequent in the house and so clear when the sound of it became low and rare then her heart would misgive her and she would all but resolve to take the only step which she knew would bring a bright gleam on her child s face and give a happy tone to her darling s voice During the earlier portion of these days Katie had with eager constancy reiterated her request that Charley should be asked to Hampton but of a sudden her prayers ceased She spoke no more of Charley asked no longer after his coming ceased even to inquire frequently of his welfare But yet when his name was mentioned she would open wide her bright eyes would listen with all her ears and show only too plainly to one who watched her as a mother only can watch what were the thoughts which filled her heart Linda she had said one night as they sat in their room preparing themselves for bed Linda why does not mamma invite Charley to come down to Hampton Oh I don t know said Linda who however if she did not know was not far wrong in the guess she made I suppose she thinks he d be ashamed to show himself after having been in prison Ashamed Why should he be ashamed after so long Didn t you hear Harry say that the same thing often happens to young men Is he never to come here again Dear Linda I know you know do tell me Well I m sure I do not know if that s not the reason Oh Linda dear Linda yes you do said Katie throwing herself on her knees resting her arms on her sister s lap and looking up wistfully into her sister s face Her long hair was streaming down her back her white naked feet peeped out from beneath her bedroom dress and large tears glistened in her eyes Who could have resisted the prayers of such a suppliant Certainly not Linda the soft hearted Linda Do tell me continued Katie do tell me I am sure you know and Linda if it is wrong to ask mamma about it I ll never never ask her again I know mamma is unhappy about it If my asking is wrong I ll not make her unhappy any more in that way Linda for a while did not know what to answer Her hesitating manner immediately revealed to Katie that there was a secret and that her sister could tell it if she would Oh Linda do tell me do tell me dear Linda you ought to tell me for mamma s sake At last with much hesitation Linda told her the whole tale Perhaps mamma thinks that you are too fond of Charley An instant light flashed across Katie s heart across her heart and brain and senses Not another word was necessary to explain to her the whole mystery to tell the whole tale to reveal to her the secret of her own love of her mother s fears and of his assumed unwillingness She got up slowly from her knees kissed her sister s cheek and neck smiled at her so sweetly so sadly and then sitting on her old seat began playing with her long hair and gazing at vacancy It is only what I guess you know Katie you would make me tell you but I am sure there is nothing in it Dear Linda said she you are so good I am so much obliged to you After that Katie spoke no further of Charley But it was evident to them all that though she said nothing she had not ceased to think of him Nor did her cheek again become rosy nor her arms round nor her voice happy She got weaker than ever and poor missus Woodward was overcome with sorrow Nor was this the only cause of grief at Surbiton Cottage During the last few weeks a bitter estrangement had taken place between the Woodwards and the Tudors Alaric Tudor that is and Gertrude Two years had now passed since Norman had chosen to quarrel with Alaric and during all that period the two had never spoken amicably together though they had met on business very frequently on all such occasions Alaric had been unperturbed and indifferent whereas Norman had been gloomy and had carried a hostile brow and angry eye At their period of life two years generally does much to quiet feelings of ill will and pacify animosity but Norman s feelings had by no means been quieted nor his animosity pacified He had loved Alaric with a close and manly love now he hated him with a close and I fear I may say a manly hatred Alaric had as he thought answered his love by treachery and there was that in Norman s heart which would not allow him to forgive one who had been a traitor to him He had that kind of selfishness so common to us but of which we are so unconscious which will not allow us to pardon a sin against our own amour propre Alaric might have been forgiven though he had taken his friend s money distanced him in his office though he had committed against him all offences which one friend can commit against another all but this Norman had been proud of his love and yet ashamed of it proud of loving such a girl as Gertrude and ashamed of being known to be in love at all He had confided his love to Alaric and Alaric had robbed him of his love and wounded both his pride and his shame Norman lacked the charity which should have been capable of forgiving even this He now looked at all Alaric s doings through a different glass from that which he had used when Alaric had been dear to him He saw or thought that he saw that his successful rival was false ambitious treacherous and dishonest he made no excuses for him gave him no credit for his industry accorded no admiration to his talent He never spoke ill of Alaric Tudor to others but he fed his own heart with speaking and thinking ill of him to himself Of Gertrude he thought very differently He had taught himself to disconnect her from the treachery of her husband or rather her memory for from the day on which he had learnt that she was engaged to Alaric he had never seen her He still loved the remembrance of her In his solitary walks with missus Woodward he would still speak of her as he might of one in some distant clime for whose welfare he was deeply interested He had seen and caressed her baby at Hampton She was still dear to him Had Alaric been called to his long account it would have been his dearest wish to have become at some future time the husband of his widow To all these feelings on Norman s part Alaric was very indifferent but their existence operated as a drawback on his wife s comfort and to a certain degree on his own missus Woodward would not banish Norman from the Cottage even for her daughter s sake and it came by degrees to be understood that the Tudors man and wife should not go there unless they were aware that Norman was absent Norman on the other hand did absent himself when it was understood that Alaric and Gertrude were coming and thus the Woodwards kept up their intercourse with both But this was a bore Alaric thought it most probable that Norman would marry one of the younger sisters and he knew that family quarrels are uncomfortable and injudicious When therefore he became a Civil Service Commissioner and was thus removed from business intercourse with Norman he conceived that it would be wise to arrange a reconciliation He discussed the matter with Gertrude and she fully agreeing with him undertook the task of making the proposal through her mother This she did with all the kindness and delicacy of a woman She desired her mother to tell Harry how much she had valued his friendship how greatly she regretted the loss of it how anxious her husband was to renew if possible their former terms of affection missus Woodward by no means sanguine undertook the commission She undertook it and utterly failed and when Gertrude in her disappointment spoke bitterly of Norman s bitterness both mother and sister both missus Woodward and Linda took Norman s part I wish it could be otherwise said missus Woodward I wish it for all our sakes but he is a man not easily to be turned and I cannot blame him He has suffered very much Gertrude became very red Her mother s words contained a reproach against herself tacit and unintended indeed but not the less keenly felt I am not aware that mister Norman has any cause of just complaint she said against any one unless it be himself For the sake of charity and old associations we have wished that all ideas of injury should be forgiven and forgotten If he chooses still to indulge his rancour he must do so I had taken him to be a better Christian More words had sprung from these missus Woodward who in truth loved Norman the better for the continuance of his sorrow would not give up his part and so the mother and child parted and the two sisters parted not quarrelling indeed not absolutely with angry words but in a tone of mind towards each other widely differing from that of former years missus Woodward had lost none of the love of the parent but Gertrude had forgotten somewhat of the reverence of the child All this had added much to the grief created by Katie s illness And then of a sudden Katie became silent as well as sad and ill silent and sad but so soft so loving in her manner Her gentle little caresses the tender love ever lying in her eye the constant pressure of her thin small hand would all but break her mother s heart Katie would sit beside her on the sofa in the drawing room for hours a book taken up as an excuse would be in her lap and she would sit there gazing listlessly into the vacant daylight till the evening would come and then when the room was shaded and sombre when the light of the fire merely served to make the objects indistinct she would lean gently and by degrees upon her mother s bosom would coax her mother s arm round her neck and would thus creep as it were into her mother s heart of hearts And then slow tears would trickle down her cheeks very slow one by one till they would fall as telltales on her mother s hand Katie my darling Katie the mother would say I m only tired mamma would be her answer Don t move mamma pray don t move I am so comfortable And then at night she would put herself to rest close circled in Linda s arms She would twist up her little feet and lie so quiet there that Linda would remain motionless that she might not disturb her Katie s sleep but soon warm tears would be running on her bosom and she would know that Katie was still thinking of her love Linda among all her virtues had not that of reticence and her mother had soon learnt from her what had been said that night in their bedroom about Charley But this violation of confidence if it was a violation was hardly necessary to make missus Woodward aware of what was passing in her daughter s bosom When Katie ceased to ask that Charley might be sent for when she ceased to plead for his pardon and to praise his virtues missus Woodward knew well the cause of her silence It was not that others suspected her love but that she had learned to suspect it herself It was not that she was ashamed of loving Charley but that she felt at once that such love would distress her mother s heart As she sat there that night fingering her silken hair she had asked herself whether in truth this man was master of her heart she had probed her young bosom which now by a sudden growth became quick with a woman s impulse and she had owned to herself that she did love him He was dearer to her she found than all in the world beside Fondly as she loved her sister sweet to her as were her mother s caresses their love was not as precious to her as his might be And then she remembered what he was what was the manner of his life what his character how different he was from Alaric or Harry Norman she remembered this and knew that her love was an unhappy passion Herself she would have sacrificed prisoner as he had been debtor as he was drunkard penniless and a spendthrift she would not have hesitated to take him for her guide through life and have done what a woman might to guide him in return But she would not sacrifice her mother She saw now why Charley was not asked and silently acquiesced in his banishment She was not yet quite seventeen Not yet seventeen the reader will say She was still such a child and yet arguing to herself about spendthrift debtors and self sacrifice All this bombast at sixteen and a half No my ungentle reader not all this bombast at sixteen and a half The bombast is mine It is my fault if I cannot put into fitting language the thoughts which God put into her young heart In her mind s soliloquy Charley s vices were probably all summed up in the one word unsteady Why is he so unsteady Why does he like these wicked things And then as regarded missus Woodward she did but make a resolve that not even for her love would she add to the unhappiness of that loving tenderest mother There was no bombast in Katie either expressed or unexpressed After much consideration on the matter missus Woodward determined that she should ask Charley down to the Cottage In the first place she felt bitterly her apparent ingratitude to him When last they had been together the day after Katie s escape at the bridge when his tale had just been read she had told him with the warmth of somewhat more than friendly affection that henceforth they must be more than common friends She had promised him her love she had almost promised him the affection and care of a mother and now how was she keeping her promise He had fallen into misfortune and she had immediately deserted him Over and over again she said to herself that her first duty was to her own child but even with this reflection she could hardly reconcile herself to her neglect of him And then moreover she felt that it was impossible that all their friendship all their mutual regard should die away suddenly without any explanation An attempt to bring about this would not cure Katie s love If this were done would not Katie always think of Charley s wrong And lastly it was quite clear that Katie had put a check on her own heart A meeting now might be the reverse of dangerous It would be well that Katie should use herself to be with him now again well at any rate that she should see him once before their proposed journey to Torquay for alas the journey to Torquay was now insisted on by the London physician insisted on although he opined with a nod somewhat less authoritative than his former nod that the young lady was touched by no organic disease And then said missus Woodward to herself his heart is good and I will speak openly to him And so Charley was again invited to the cottage After some demurring between him and Norman he accepted the invitation missus Val s dance had taken place in June and it was now late in October Four months had intervened and during that period Charley had seen none of the Woodwards He had over and over again tried to convince himself that this was his own fault and that he had no right to accuse missus Woodward of ingratitude But he was hardly successful He did feel in spite of himself that he had been dropped because of the disgrace attaching to his arrest that missus Woodward had put him aside as being too bad to associate with her and her daughters and that it was intended that henceforth they should be strangers He still had Katie s purse and he made a sort of resolve that as long as he kept that in his possession as long as he had that near his heart he would not go near Norah Geraghty This resolution he had kept but though he did not go to the Cat and Whistle he frequented other places which were as discreditable or more so He paid many very fruitless visits to mister M Ruen contrived to run up a score with the proprietor of the dancing saloon in Holborn and was as negligent as ever in the matter of the lock entries It is no use now he would say to himself when some aspirations for higher things came across his heart it is too late now to go back Those who once cared for me have thrown me over And then he would again think of Waterloo Bridge and the Monument and of what might be done for threepence or fourpence in a pistol gallery And then at last came the invitation to Hampton He was once more to talk to missus Woodward and associate with Linda to see Katie once more When he had last left the house he had almost been as much at home as any one of the family and now he was to return to it as a perfect stranger As he travelled down with Norman by the railway he could not help feeling that the journey was passing over too quickly He was like a prisoner going to his doom As he crossed the bridge and remembered how Katie had looked when she lay struggling in the water how he had been feted and caressed after pulling her out he made a bitter contrast between his present position and that which he then enjoyed Were it not for very shame he would have found it in his heart to return to London And then in a moment they were at the Cottage door The road had never been so short Norman who had not fathomed Charley s feelings was happy and light hearted more so than was usual with him for he was unaffectedly glad to witness Charley s return to Hampton He rang sharply at the door and when it was opened walked with happy confidence into the drawing room Charley was bound to follow him and there he found himself again in the presence of missus Woodward and her daughters Katie would fain have absented herself but missus Woodward knew that the first meeting could take place in no more favourable manner missus Woodward bade him welcome with a collected voice and assured if not easy manner She shook hands with him cordially and said a few words as to her pleasure of seeing him again Then he next took Linda s hand and she too made a little speech more awkwardly than her mother saying something mal a propos about the very long time he had been away and then she laughed with a little titter trying to recover herself And at last he came to Katie There was no getting over it She also stretched out her now thin hand and Charley as he touched it perceived how altered she was Katie looked up into his face and tried to speak but she could not articulate a word She looked into his face and then at missus Woodward as though imploring her mother s aid to tell her how to act or what to say and then finding her power of utterance impeded by rising sobs she dropped back again on her seat and hid her face upon the arm of the sofa Our Katie is not so well as when you last saw her is she Charley said missus Woodward She is very weak just now but thank God she has we believe no dangerous symptoms about her You have heard perhaps that we are going to Torquay for the winter And so they went on talking The ice was broken and the worst was over They did not talk it is true as in former days there was no confidence between them now and each of them felt that there was none but they nevertheless fell into a way of unembarrassed conversation and were all tolerably at their ease And then they went to dinner and Charley was called on to discuss Admiralty matters with Uncle Bat and then he and Norman sat after dinner a little longer than usual and then they had a short walk during which Katie remained at home but short as it was it was quite long enough for it was very dull and then there was tea and then more constrained conversation in which Katie took no part whatever and then missus Woodward and the girls took their candles and Charley went over to the inn on the other side of the road Oh how different was this from the former evenings at Surbiton Cottage Charley had made no plan for any special interview with Katie had indeed not specially thought about it at all but he could not but feel an intense desire to say one word to her in private and learn whether all her solicitude for him was over Dear Charley you will be steady won t you Those had been her last words to him Nothing could have been sweeter although they brought before his mind the remembrance of his own unworthy career they had been inexpressibly sweet as testifying the interest she felt in him And was that all over now Had it all been talked away by missus Woodward s cautious wisdom because he had lain for one night in a sponging house But the next day came and as it passed it appeared to him that no opportunity of speaking one word to her was to be allowed to him She did not however shun him She was not up at breakfast but she sat next to him at lunch and answered him when he spoke to her In the evening they again went out to walk and then Charley found that Linda and Norman went one way and that he was alone with missus Woodward It was manifest to him that this arrangement had been made on purpose and he felt that he was to undergo some private conversation the nature of which he dreaded He dreaded it very much when he heard it it made him very wretched but it was not the less full of womanly affection and regard for him I cannot let you go from us Charley began missus Woodward without telling you how deep a sorrow it has been to me to be so long without seeing you I know you have thought me very ungrateful Ungrateful missus Woodward O no I have done nothing to make gratitude necessary Yes Charley you have you have done much too much You have saved my child s life O no I did not said he besides I hate gratitude I don t want any one to be grateful to me Gratitude is almost as offensive as pity Of course I pulled Kate out of the water when she fell in and I would have done as much for your favourite cat He said this with something of bitterness in his tone it was not much for though he felt bitterly he did not intend to show it but missus Woodward s ear did not fail to catch it Don t be angry with us Charley don t make us more unhappy than we already are Unhappy said he as though he thought that all the unhappiness in the world was at the present moment reserved for his own shoulders Yes we are not so happy now as we were when you were last with us Poor Katie is very ill But you don t think there is any danger missus Woodward There are many tones in which such a question may be asked and is asked from day to day all differing widely from each other and giving evidence of various shades of feeling in the speaker Charley involuntarily put his whole heart into it missus Woodward could not but love him for feeling for her child though she would have given so much that the two might have been indifferent to each other I do not know she said We hope not But I should not be sent with her to Torquay if she were not very ill She is very ill and it is absolutely essential that nothing should be allowed to excite her painfully I tell you this Charley to excuse our apparent unkindness in not having you here sooner Charley walked by her in silence Why should his coming excite her more than Norman s What could there be painful to her in seeing him Did the fact of his having been arrested attach to his visit any peculiar probability of excitement Do not suppose that we have not thought of you continued missus Woodward We have all done so daily Nay I have done so myself all but hourly Ah Charley you will never know how truly I love you Charley s heart was as soft as it was inflammable He was utterly unable to resist such tenderness as missus Woodward showed to him He had made a little resolution to be stiff and stern to ask for no favour and to receive none not to palliate his own conduct or to allow missus Woodward to condemn it He had felt that as the Woodwards had given him up they had no longer any right to criticize him To them at least one and all to missus Woodward and her daughters his conduct had been sans reproche They had no cause to upbraid him on their own account and they had now abandoned the right to do so on his own With such assumed sternness he began his walk but now it had all melted before the warmth of one tender word from a woman s mouth I know I am not worth thinking about said he Do not say so pray do not say so Do not think that we say so to ourselves I grieve for your faults Charley I know they are grievous and wicked but I know how much there is of good in you I know how clever you are how excellent your heart is how sweet your disposition I trust I trust in God you may reform and be the pride of your friends I trust that I yet may be proud of knowing you No one will ever be proud of me said Charley We shall all be proud of you if you will resolve to turn away from childish things now that you are no longer a child your faults are faults which as yet may be so easily relinquished But oh Charley and then missus Woodward paused and looked wistfully into his face She had now come to the point at which she had to make her prayer to him She had resolved to tell him the cause of her fears and to trust to his honour to free her from them Now was the moment for her to speak out but now that the moment was come the words were wanting She looked wistfully into his face but he did not even guess what was her meaning He knew the secret of his own love but he did not know that Katie also had her secret He had never dreamt that his faults among all their ill effects had paled her cheek made wan her arm silenced her voice and dimmed her eye When he had heard Katie cough he had in nowise connected the hated sound with his own arrest He had thought only of his own love Oh Charley I know I can trust you said missus Woodward I know you are gentle and good You will be gentle and good to us will you not you will not make us all wretched Charley declared that he would not willingly do anything to cause pain to any of them No I am sure you will not And therefore Charley you must not see Katie any more At this time they had turned off the road into a shady lane in which the leaves of autumn were beginning to fall A path led over a stile away from the lane into the fields and missus Woodward had turned towards it as though intending to continue their walk in that direction But when she had reached the stile she had sat down upon the steps of it and Charley had been listening to her standing by leaning on the top rail And therefore Charley you must not see Katie any more So much she said and then she looked into his face with imploring eyes It was impossible that he should answer her at once He had to realize so much that had hitherto not been expressed between them before he could fully understand what she meant and then he was called on to give up so much that he now learnt for the first time was within his reach Before he could answer her he had to assure himself that Katie loved him he had to understand that her love for one so abandoned was regarded as fatal and he had to reply to a mother s prayer that he would remove himself from the reach of a passion which to him was worth all the world beside He turned his face away from her but still stood leaning on the stile with his arms folded on it She watched him for a while in silence and at last she saw big tears drop from his face on to the dust of the path on the farther side There they came rolling down large globules of sorrow Nothing is so painful to a woman as a man in tears and missus Woodward s heart was wrung to its very core Why was he not like Alaric or Norman so that she might make him welcome to her daughter s heart She leant towards him and put her hand caressingly on his arm It shall be so shall it not Charley Oh of course if you say so I have your word then If I have your word that will be a perfect bond I have your word have I not Charley What never see her in my life said he turning almost fiercely on missus Woodward That you know is more than you can promise said she very gently It is not to the letter of the promise that I would bind you but to its spirit You understand well what I mean you know what I wish and why I wish it Say that you will obey my wish and I will leave the mode of doing it to your own honour Have I your promise He shook her hand off his arm almost roughly though unintentionally and turning sharply round leant with his back against the stile The traces of tears were still on his cheeks but he was no longer crying there was however a look on his face of heart rending sorrow which missus Woodward could hardly endure I do understand you said he and since you demand it I will promise and then they walked home side by side without interchanging a single word When they reached the house missus Woodward went to her room and Charley found himself alone with Katie I hope you find yourself better this evening said he Oh I am quite well she answered with her sweetest kindest voice I am quite well only sometimes I am a little weak He walked up to the window as though to pass on to the lawn but the season was too far advanced for that and the window was locked He retraced his steps therefore and passing out of the drawing room into the hall stood at the open front door till he heard missus Woodward come down Then he followed her into the room Good bye he said to her suddenly I shall start by the early train to morrow and shall not see you She pressed his hand but he in nowise returned the pressure Good bye Linda good bye Katie good night Captain Cuttwater And so he went his way as Adam did when he was driven out of Paradise Early on the following morning the cook while engaged in her most matutinal duties was disturbed by a ring at the front door She and she only of the household was up and as she had not completed her toilet with much minuteness she was rather embarrassed when on opening the door she saw mister Charles Tudor I beg your pardon cook for troubling you so early but I have left something in the drawing room I can find it myself and so saying he hurried into the room so as to prevent the servant from following him Katie had a well worn well known little workbox which in years now long past had been given to her either by Alaric or Harry Doubtless she had now work boxes grander both in appearance and size but nevertheless whether from habit or from choice her custom was in her daily needlework to use this old friend Often and often had Charley played with it many wicked pranks Once while Katie had as yet no pretension to be grown up he had put a snail into it and had incurred her severe displeasure He had stuffed it full of acorns and been rewarded by being pelted with them round the lawn and had filled it with nuts for which he had not found it so difficult to obtain pardon He knew every hole and corner in it he was intimate with all her little feminine nicknacks her silver thimble her scissors her bit of wax and the yard measure which twisted itself in and out of an ivory cottage he knew them all as well as though they were his own and he knew also where the workbox stood He closed the door behind him and then with his quickest motion raised the lid and put within the box just under the bit of work on which she was employed a light small paper parcel It contained the purse which she had worked for him and had given to him with such sweet affection at the Chiswick flower show CHAPTER XXXI HOW APOLLO SAVED THE NAVVY About the middle of November the Woodwards went to Torquay and remained there till the following May Norman went with them to see them properly settled in their new lodgings and visited them at Christmas and once again during their stay there He then went down to fetch them home and when they all returned informed Charley with whom he was still living that he was engaged to Linda It was arranged he said that they were to be married in August On the whole the journey to Torquay was considered to have been successful Katie s health had been the only object in going there and the main consideration while they remained She returned if not well at any rate not worse She had got through the winter and her lungs were still pronounced to be free from those dreadful signs of decay the name of which has broken so many mothers hearts and sent dismay into the breasts of so many fathers During her sojourn at Torquay she had grown much and as is often the case with those who grow quickly she had become weak and thin People at Torquay are always weak and thin and missus Woodward had not therefore been greatly frightened at this Her spirits though by no means such as they had been in former days had improved she had occupied herself more than she had done during the last two months at Hampton and had at least so missus Woodward fondly flattered herself ceased to be always thinking of Charley Tudor It was quite clear that she had firmly made up her mind to some certain line of conduct with reference to him she never mentioned his name nor was it mentioned in her hearing by either her mother or sister during their stay at Torquay When Norman came down she always found some opportunity of inquiring from him as to Charley s health and welfare but she did this in a manner which showed that she had succeeded in placing her feelings wonderfully under control On that Monday morning on which Charley had returned to town after his early visit to her workbox she had not failed to find the purse Linda was with her when she did so but she had contrived so to conceal her emotion that nothing was seen and nothing suspected She felt at once that it was intended that all intercourse should be broken off between them She knew instinctively that this was the effect of some precaution on her mother s part and with a sad bosom and a broken heart she acquiesced in it She said nothing even to herself of the truth and constancy of her love she made no mental resolution against any other passion she did not even think whether or not she might ever be tempted to love another but she felt a dumb aching numbness about her heart and looking round about her she seemed to feel that all was dark and dismal And so they sojourned through the winter at Torquay The effort which Katie made was undoubtedly salutary to her She took again to her work and her lessons studies we should probably now call them and before she left Torquay she had again learned how to smile but not to laugh with that gay ringing silver laughter ringing but yet not loud which to Charley s ear had been as sweet as heavenly music During this time Uncle Bat remained at Hampton keeping bachelor s house by himself And then while they were at Torquay Linda and Norman became engaged to each other Their loves were honest true and happy but not of a nature to give much scope to a novelist of a romantic turn Linda knew she was not Norman s first love and requited Norman of course by telling him something not much of Alaric s falseness to her Norman made but one ungenerous stipulation It was this that in marrying him Linda must give up all acquaintance with her brother in law He would never he said be the means of separating two sisters she and Gertrude might have such intercourse together as their circumstances might render possible but it was quite out of the question that either he Harry Norman or his wife should ever again associate with Alaric Tudor In such matters Linda had always been guided by others so she sighed and promised and the engagement was duly ratified by all the parties concerned We must now return to Charley When he got back to town he felt that he had lost his amulet his charm had gone from him and he had nothing now left whereby to save himself from ruin and destruction He was utterly flung over by the Woodwards that now was to him an undoubted fact When missus Woodward told him that he was never again to see Katie that was of course tantamount to turning him out of the Cottage It might be all very well to talk to him of affection and friendship but it was manifest that no further signs of either were to be shown to him He had proved himself to be unworthy and was no more to be considered as one of the circle which made the drawing room at Surbiton Cottage its centre He could not quite explain all this to Norman as he could not tell him what had passed between him and missus Woodward but he said enough to make his friend know that he intended to go to Hampton no more It would be wrong perhaps to describe Charley as being angry with missus Woodward He knew that she was only doing her duty by her child he knew that she was actuated by the purest and best of motives he was not able to say a word against her even to himself but nevertheless he desired to be revenged on her not by injuring her not by injuring Katie but by injuring himself He would make missus Woodward feel what she had done by rushing himself on his own ruin He would return to the Cat and Whistle he would keep his promise and marry Norah Geraghty he would go utterly to destruction and then missus Woodward would know and feel what she had done in banishing him from her daughter s presence Having arrived at this magnanimous resolution after a fortnight s doubt and misery he proceeded to put his purpose into execution It was now some considerable time since he had been at the Cat and Whistle he had had no further visit from missus Davis but he had received one or two notes both from her and Norah to which as long as he had Katie s purse he was resolute in not replying messages also had reached him from the landlady through Dick Scatterall in the last of which he was reminded that there was a trifle due at the bar and another trifle for money lent One night having lashed himself up to a fit state of wretched desperation he found himself at the well known corner of the street leading out of the Strand On his journey thither he had been trying to realize to himself what it would be to be the husband of Norah Geraghty what would be the joy of returning to a small house in some dingy suburb and finding her to receive him Could he really love her when she would be bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh the wife of his bosom and the mother of his children In such a case would he ever be able to forget that he had known Katie Woodward Would those words of hers ever ring in his ears then as now You will be steady dear Charley won t you There are those who boast that a gentleman must always be a gentleman that a man let him marry whom he will raises or degrades his wife to the level of his own condition and that King Cophetua could share his throne with a beggar woman without sullying its splendour or diminishing its glory How a king may fare in such a condition the author knowing little of kings will not pretend to say nor yet will he offer an opinion whether a lowly match be fatally injurious to a marquess duke or earl but this he will be bold to affirm that a man from the ordinary ranks of the upper classes who has had the nurture of a gentleman prepares for himself a hell on earth in taking a wife from any rank much below his own a hell on earth and alas too often another hell elsewhere also He must either leave her or loathe her She may be endowed with all those moral virtues which should adorn all women and which thank God are common to women in this country but he will have to endure habits manners and ideas which the close contiguity of married life will force upon his disgusted palate and which must banish all love Man by instinct desires in his wife something softer sweeter more refined than himself and though in failing to obtain this the fault may be all his own he will not on that account the more easily reconcile himself to the want Charley knew that he was preparing such misery for himself As he went along determined to commit a moral suicide by allying himself to the barmaid he constrained himself to look with his mind s eye upon this picture and on that He had felt of what nature was the sort of love with which Katie Woodward had inspired his heart and he felt also what was that other sort of love to which the charms of Norah Geraghty had given birth Norah was a fine girl smart enough in her outward apparel but apt occasionally to disclose uncomfortable secrets if from any accident more than her outward apparel might momentarily become visible When dressed up for a Sunday excursion she had her attractions and even on ordinary evenings a young man such as Charley after imbibing two or three glasses of spirits and water and smoking two or three cigars might find her to be what some of her friends would have called very good company As to her mind had Charley been asked about it he would probably have said that he was ignorant whether she had any but this he did know that she was sharp and quick alert in counting change and gifted with a peculiar power of detecting bad coin by the touch Such was Norah Geraghty whom Charley was to marry And then that other portrait was limned with equal accuracy before his eyes Katie with all her juvenile spirit was delightfully feminine every motion of hers was easy and every form into which she could twist her young limbs was graceful She had all the nice ideas and ways which a girl acquires when she grows from childhood to woman s stature under the eye of a mother who is a lady Katie could be untidy on occasions but her very untidiness was inviting All her belongings were nice she had no hidden secrets the chance revealing of which would disgrace her She might come in from her island palaces in a guise which would call down some would be censorious exclamation from her mother but all others but her mother would declare that Katie in such moments was more lovely than ever And Katie s beauty pleased more than the eye it came home to the mind and heart of those who saw her It spoke at once to the intelligence and required for its full appreciation an exercise of the mental faculties as well as animal senses If the owner of that outward form were bad or vile one would be inclined to say that Nature must have lied when she endowed her with so fair an index Such was Katie Woodward whom Charley was not to marry As he turned down Norfolk Street he thought of all this as the gambler sitting with his razor before him with which he intends to cut his throat may be supposed to think of the stakes which he has failed to win and the fortune he has failed to make Norah Geraghty was Charley s razor and he plunged boldly into the Cat and Whistle determined to draw it at once across his weasand and sever himself for ever from all that is valuable in the world It was now about eleven o clock at which hour the Cat and Whistle generally does its most stirring trade This Charley knew but he also knew that the little back parlour even if there should be an inmate in it at the time of his going in would soon be made private for his purposes When he went in missus Davis was standing behind the counter dressed in a cap of wonderful grandeur and a red tabinet gown which rustled among the pots and jars sticking out from her to a tremendous width inflated by its own magnificence and a substratum of crinoline Charley had never before seen her arrayed in such royal robes Her accustomed maid was waiting as usual on the guests and another girl also was assisting but Norah did not appear to Charley s first impatient glance He at once saw that something wonderful was going on The front parlour was quite full and the ministering angel was going in and out quickly with more generous supplies of the gifts of Bacchus than were usual at the Cat and Whistle Gin and water was the ordinary tipple in the front parlour and any one of its denizens inclined to cut a dash above his neighbours generally did so with a bottom of brandy But now missus Davis was mixing port wine negus as fast as her hands could make it And then there were standing round the counter four or five customers faces well known to Charley all of whom seemed to be dressed with a splendour second only to that of the landlady One man had on an almost new brown frock coat with a black velvet collar and white trousers Two had blue swallow tailed coats with brass buttons and a fourth a dashing young lawyer s clerk from Clement s Inn was absolutely stirring a mixture which he called a mint julep with a yellow kid glove dangling out of his hand They all stood back when Charley entered they had been accustomed to make way for him in former days and though he had latterly ceased to rule at the Cat and Whistle as he once did they were too generous to trample on fallen greatness He gave his hand to missus Davis across the counter and asked her in the most unconcerned voice which he could assume what was in the wind She tittered and laughed told him he had come too late for the fun and then retreated into the little back parlour whither he followed her She was at any rate in a good humour and seemed quite inclined to forgive his rather uncivil treatment of her notes and messages In the back parlour Charley found more people drinking and among them three ladies of missus Davis s acquaintance They were all very fine in their apparel and very comfortable as to their immediate employment for each had before her a glass of hot tipple One of them a florid faced dame about fifty Charley had seen before and knew to be the wife of a pork butcher and sausage maker in the neighbourhood Directly he entered the room missus Davis formally introduced him to them all A very particular friend of mine missus Allchops and of Norah s too I can assure you said missus Davis Ah mister Tudor and how be you A sight of you is good for sore eyes said she of the sausages rising with some difficulty from her chair and grasping Charley s hand with all the pleasant cordiality of old friendship The general leman seems to be a little too late for the fair said a severe lodging house keeper from Cecil Street Them as wills not when they may When they wills they shall have nay said a sarcastic rival barmaid from a neighbouring public to whom all Norah s wrongs and all mister Tudor s false promises were fully known Charley was not the fellow to allow himself to be put down even by feminine raillery so he plucked up his spirit sad as he was at heart and replied to them all en masse Well ladies what s in the wind now You seem to be very cosy here all of you suppose you allow me to join you With a eart and a alf said missus Allchops squeezing her corpulence up to the end of the horsehair sofa so as to make room for him between herself and the poetic barmaid I d sooner have a gentleman next to me nor a lady hany day of the week so come and sit down my birdie But Charley as he was about to accept the invitation of his friend missus Allchops caught missus Davis s eye and followed her out of the room into the passage Step up to the landing mister Tudor said she and Charley stepped up Come in here mister Tudor you won t mind my bedroom for once And Charley followed her in not minding her bedroom Of course you know what has happened mister Tudor said she Devil a bit said Charley Laws now don t you indeed Well that is odd How the deuce should I know Where s Norah Why she s at Gravesend At Gravesend you don t mean to say she s I just do then she s just gone and got herself spliced to Peppermint this morning They had the banns said these last three Sundays and this morning they was at saint Martin s at eight o clock and has been here junketing ever since and now they re away to Gravesend Gravesend said Charley struck by the suddenness of his rescue as the gambler would have been had some stranger seized the razor at the moment when it was lifted to his throat Yes Gravesend said missus Davis and they ll come up home to his own house by the first boat to morrow So Norah s married said Charley with a slight access of sentimental softness in his voice She s been and done it now mister Tudor and no mistake and it s better so ain t it Why Lord love you she d never have done for you you know and she s the very article for such a man as Peppermint There was something good natured in this and so Charley felt it As long as missus Davis could do anything to assist her cousin s views by endeavouring to seduce or persuade her favourite lover into a marriage she left no stone unturned working on her cousin s behalf But now now that all those hopes were over now that Norah had consented to sacrifice love to prudence why should missus Davis quarrel with an old friend any longer why should not things be made pleasant to him as to the others And now mister Tudor come down and drink a glass to their healths and wish em both well and don t mind what them women says to you You re well out of a mess and now it s all over I m glad it is as it is Charley went down and took his glass and drank prosperity to the bride and bridegroom The sarcastic rival barmaid said little snappish things to him offered him a bit of green ribbon and told him that if he minded hisself somebody might perhaps take him yet But Charley was proof against this He sat there about half an hour and then went his way shaking hands with all the ladies and bowing to the gentlemen On the following day as soon as he left his office he called at the Cat and Whistle and paid his little bill there and said his last farewell to missus Davis He never visited the house again Now that Norah was gone the attractions were not powerful Reader you and I will at the same time say our farewells to missus Davis to mister Peppermint also and to his bride If thou art an elegant reader unaccustomed to the contamination of pipes and glasses I owe thee an apology in that thou hast been caused to linger a while among things so unsavoury But if thou art one who of thine own will hast taken thine ease in thine inn hast enjoyed the freedom of a sanded parlour hast known that ginger is hot in the mouth and made thyself light hearted with a yard of clay then thou wilt confess there are worse establishments than the Cat and Whistle less generous landladies than missus Davis When all this happened the Woodwards had not been long at Torquay mister Peppermint was made a happy man before Christmas and therefore Charley was left to drift before the wind without the ballast of any lady s love to keep him in sailing trim Poor fellow he had had wealth on one side beauty and love on another and on the third all those useful qualities which Miss Geraghty has been described as possessing He had been thus surrounded by feminine attractions and had lost them all Two of those from whom he had to choose had married others and he was banished from the presence of the third Under such circumstances what could he do but drift about the gulfs and straits of the London ocean without compass or rudder and bruise his timbers against all the sunken rocks that might come in his way And then Norman told him of his coming marriage and Charley was more sad than ever And thus matters went on with him till the period at which our story will be resumed at the return of the Woodwards to Hampton In the meantime another winter and another spring had passed over Alaric s head and now the full tide of the London season found him still rising and receiving every day more of the world s homage Sir Gregory Hardlines had had every reason to praise his own judgement in selecting mister Tudor for the vacant seat among the Magi From that moment all had gone smooth with Sir Gregory there was no one to interfere with his hobby or run counter to his opinion Alaric was all that was conciliatory and amiable in a colleague He was not submissive and cringing and had he been so Sir Gregory to do him justice would have been disgusted but neither was he self opinionated nor obstinate like mister Jobbles He insisted on introducing no crotchets of his own and allowed Sir Gregory all the credit of the Commission This all went on delightfully for a while but on one morning early in May Alaric somewhat disturbed the equanimity of his chief by communicating to him his intention of becoming a candidate for the representation of the borough of Strathbogy at the next general election which was to take place very shortly after the close of the session Sir Gregory was dumbfounded and expressed himself as incapable of believing that Tudor really meant to throw up Ltwelve hundred a year on the mere speculation of its being possible that he should get into Parliament Men in general as Sir Gregory endeavoured to explain with much eloquence go into Parliament for the sake of getting places of Ltwelve hundred a year For what earthly reason should Alaric again be going to the bottom of the ladder seeing that he had already attained a rung of such very respectable altitude Alaric said to himself Excelsior To Sir Gregory he suggested that it might be possible that he should get into Parliament without giving up his seat at the Board Earth and heaven it might be hoped would not come together even though so great a violence as this should be done to the time honoured practices of the Government Sir Gregory suggested that it was contrary to the constitution Alaric replied that the constitution had been put upon to as great an extent before this and had survived Sir Gregory regarded it as all but impossible and declared it to be quite unusual Alaric rejoined that something of the same kind had been done at the Poor Law Board To this Sir Gregory replied gently pluming his feathers with conscious greatness that at the Poor Law Board the chief of the Commission was the Parliamentary officer Alaric declared that he was perfectly willing to give way if Sir Gregory would go into the House himself To this Sir Gregory demurred not feeling himself called on to change the sphere of his utility And so the matter was debated between them till at last Sir Gregory promised to consult his friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer The ice was thus broken and Alaric was quite contented with the part which he had taken in the conversation With his own official prospects in spite of the hazardous step which he now meditated he was quite contented He had an idea that in the public service of the Government as well as in all other services men who were known to be worth their wages would find employment He was worth his wages Men who could serve their country well who could adapt themselves to work who were practical easy in harness able to drive and patient to be driven were not unfortunately as plentiful as blackberries He began to perceive that a really useful man could not be found miscellaneously under every hat in Pall Mall He knew his own value and did not fear but that he should find a price for it in some of the world s markets He would not therefore allow himself to be deterred from further progress by any fear that in doing so he risked the security of his daily bread no not though the risk extended to his wife she had taken him for better or worse if the better came she should share it if the worse why let her share that also with such consolation as his affection might be able to offer There was something noble in this courage in this lack of prudence It may be a question whether men in marrying do not become too prudent A single man may risk anything says the world but a man with a wife should be sure of his means Why so A man and a woman are but two units A man and a woman with ten children are but twelve units It is sad to see a man starving sad to see a woman starving very sad to see children starving But how often does it come to pass that the man who will work is seen begging his bread we may almost say never unless indeed he be a clergyman Let the idle man be sure of his wife s bread before he marries her but the working man one would say may generally trust to God s goodness without fear With his official career Alaric was as we have said well contented in his stock jobbing line of business he also had had moments of great exaltation and some moments of considerable depression The West Corks had vacillated Both he and Undy had sold and bought and sold again and on the whole their stake in that stupendous national line of accommodation was not so all absorbing as it had once been But if money had been withdrawn from this it had been invested elsewhere and the great sum borrowed from Madame Jaquetanape s fortune had been in no part replaced one full moiety of it had been taken may one not say stolen to enable Alaric and Undy to continue their speculations The undertaking to which they were now both wedded was the Limehouse and Rotherhithe Bridge Of this Undy was chairman and Alaric was a director and at the present moment they looked for ample fortune or what would nearly be ample ruin to the decision of a committee of the House of Commons which was about to sit with the view of making inquiry as to the necessity of the bridge in question mister Nogo the member for Mile End was the parent of this committee He asserted that the matter was one of such vital importance not only to the whole metropolis but to the country at large that the Government were bound in the first place to give a large subsidy towards building the bridge and afterwards to pay a heavy annual sum towards the amount which it would be necessary to raise by tolls mister Whip Vigil on the other hand declared on the part of Government that the bridge was wholly unnecessary that if it were built it ought to be pulled down again and that not a stiver could be given out of the public purse with such an object On this they joined issue mister Nogo prayed for a committee and mister Vigil having duly consulted his higher brethren in the Government conceded this point It may easily be conceived how high were now the hopes both of Undy Scott and Alaric Tudor It was not at all necessary for them that the bridge should ever be built that probably was out of the question that very likely neither of them regarded as a possibility But if a committee of the House of Commons could be got to say that it ought to be built they might safely calculate on selling out at a large profit But who were to sit on the committee That was now the all momentous question CHAPTER XXXII THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE There is a sport prevalent among the downs in Hampshire to which though not of a high degree much interest is attached Men and boys with social glee and happy boyish shouts congregate together on a hill side at the mouth of a narrow hole and proceed with the aid of a well trained bull dog to draw a badger If the badger be at all commendable in his class this is by no means an easy thing to do He is a sturdy animal and well fortified with sharp and practised teeth his hide is of the toughest his paws of the strongest and his dead power of resistance so great as to give him more than an equal chance with the bull dog The delighted sportsmen stand round listening to the growls and snarls the tearings gnawings and bloody struggles of the combatants within Well done badger Well done bull dog Draw him bulldog Bite him badger Each has his friends and the interest of the moment is intense The badger it is true has done no harm He has been doing as it was appointed for him to do poor badger in that hole of his But then why were badgers created but to be drawn Why indeed but to be drawn or not to be drawn as the case may be See the bull dog returns minus an ear with an eye hanging loose his nether lip torn off and one paw bitten through and through Limping dejected beaten glaring fearfully from his one remaining eye the dog comes out and the badger within rolls himself up with affected ease hiding his bloody wounds from the public eye So it is that the sport is played in Hampshire and so also at Westminster with a difference however In Hampshire the two brutes retain ever their appointed natures The badger is always a badger and the bull dog never other than a bull dog At Westminster there is a juster reciprocity of position The badger when drawn has to take his place outside the hole and fight again for the home of his love while the victorious bull dog assumes a state of badgerdom dons the skin of his enemy and in his turn submits to be baited The pursuit is certainly full of interest but it is somewhat deficient in dignity The parliamentary committee which was to sit with reference to the Limehouse and Rotherhithe Bridge had been one of the effects of a baiting match such as that above described In this contest the enemies of the proud occupier of the den on the mountain side had not been contented to attempt to expel him with a single bull dog A whole pack had been let loose at his devoted throat Bull dogs had been at him and terriers mastiffs blood hounds lurchers and curs but so accustomed was he to the contest so knowing in his fence so ready with all the weapons given to him by nature that in spite of the numbers and venom of his enemies he had contrived to hold his own Some leading hounds had fallen to rise no more others had retreated yelping to their kennels to lie quiet for a while till time might give them courage for a new attack The country round was filled with the noise of their plaints and the yowling and howling of canine defeat The grey old badger meanwhile sat proud in his hole with all his badger kin around him and laughed his well known badger laugh at his disconsolate foes Such a brock had not for years been seen in the country side so cool so resolute so knowing in his badger ways so impregnable in his badger hole and so good humoured withal He could bite full sore with those old teeth of his and yet he never condescended to show them A badger indeed of whom the country might well be proud But in the scramble of the fight some little curs had been permitted to run away with some little bones and in this way mister Nogo the member for Mile End had been allowed to carry his motion for a committee to inquire as to the expediency of the Government s advancing a quarter of a million towards the completion of that momentous national undertaking the building of a bridge from Limehouse to Rotherhithe Very much had been said about this bridge till men living out of the light of parliamentary life nine hundred and ninety nine men that is out of every thousand in the Queen s dominions had begun to think that it was the great want of the age Men living in the light the supporters of the bridge as well as its enemies knew very well that such an erection was quite unneeded and would in all probability never be made But then the firm of Blocks Piles and Cofferdam who held a vast quantity of the bridge shares and who were to be the contractors for building it had an all powerful influence in the borough of Limehouse Where would mister Nogo be if he did not cultivate the friendship of such men as Blocks Piles and Cofferdam And so mister Nogo and those who acted with mister Nogo men that is who had little jobs of their own to do and in the doing of which mister Nogo occasionally assisted Undy Scott for instance and such like these men I say had talked much about the bridge and gentlemen on the Treasury bench who could have afforded to show up the folly of the scheme and to put mister Nogo down at once had he been alone felt themselves under the necessity of temporizing As to giving a penny of the public money for such a purpose that they knew was out of the question that mister Nogo never expected that they all knew mister Nogo never expected But as mister Nogo s numbers were so respectable it was necessary to oppose him in a respectable parliamentary steady manner He had fifteen with him Had he been quite alone mister Vigil would have sneered him off had he had but four to back him the old badger would have laughed them out of face with a brace of grins But fifteen mister Whip Vigil thought that the committee would be the most safe So would the outer world be brought to confess that the interests of Limehouse and Poplar Rotherhithe and Deptford had not been overlooked by a careful Government But of whom was the committee to be made up That was now the question which to mister Nogo in his hour of temporary greatness was truly momentous He of course was to be the chairman and to him appertained the duty of naming the other members of naming them indeed so much he could undoubtedly do by the strength of his own privilege But of what use to name a string of men to whom mister Vigil would not consent mister Nogo did he do so would have to divide on every name and be beaten at every division There would be no triumph in that No mister Nogo fully understood that his triumph must be achieved if he were destined to a triumph by an astute skill in his selection not by an open choice of friends He must obtain a balance on his side but one in which the scale would lean so slightly to his side that mister Vigil s eyes might be deceived Those who knew mister Vigil best were inclined to surmise that such an arrangement was somewhat beyond mister Nogo s political capacity There is a proverb which goes to show that a certain little lively animal may be shaved if he be caught napping but then the difficulty of so catching him is extreme mister Nogo at the head of the list put mister Vigil himself This of course was a necessity to him would that he could have dispensed with it Then he named sundry supporters of the Government sundry members also of the opposition and he filled up the list with certain others who could not be regarded as sure supporters of one side or the other but with whom for certain reasons he thought he might in this particular case be safe Undy Scott was of course not among the number as mister Nogo would only have damaged his cause by naming a man known to have a pecuniary interest in the concern The member for Mile End was doubtless sharp but mister Vigil was sharper His object was in fact merely to do his duty to the country by preventing a profuse and useless expenditure of money His anxiety was a perfectly honest one to save the Exchequer namely But the circumstances of the case required that he should fight the battle according to the tactics of the House and he well understood how to do so When the list was read he objected to two or three names only to two or three They were not those of staunch enemies of the Government nor did he propose in their places the names of staunch supporters He suggested certain gentlemen who from their acquaintance with bridges tolls rivers c would as he said be probably of use He also was sure of his men and as he succeeded with two of them he was also pretty sure of his committee And then the committee met and a lot of witnesses were in attendance The chairman opened his case and proceeded to prove by the evidence of sundry most respectable men connected with Limehouse and with the portions of Surrey and Kent lying immediately opposite to it that the most intense desire for friendly and commercial intercourse was felt but that though absolutely close to each other the districts were so divided by adverse circumstances circumstances which were monstrous considering the advance of science in the nineteenth century that the dearest friends were constrained to perpetual banishment from each other and that the men of Kent were utterly unable to do any trade at Limehouse and the Limehousians equally unable to carry on traffic in Surrey It was wonderful that the narrow river should be so effective for injury One gentleman from Poplar proved that having given his daughter in marriage to a man of Deptford two years since he had not yet been able to see her since that day Her house by the crow s flight was but seven furlongs from his own but as he kept no horse he could not get to her residence without a four hours walk for which he felt himself to be too old He was however able to visit his married daughter at Reading and be back to tea The witness declared that his life was made miserable by his being thus debarred from his child and he wiped his eyes with his pocket handkerchief piteously sitting there in front of the committee In answer to mister Vigil he admitted that there might be a ferry but stated that he did not know Having had from childhood an aversion to the water he had not inquired He was aware that some rash people had gone through the Tunnel but for himself he did not think the Tunnel a safe mode of transit Another gentleman belonging to Rotherhithe who was obliged to be almost daily at Blackwall maintained two horses for the express purpose of going backwards and forwards round by London Bridge They cost him Lseventy per annum each Such a bridge as that now proposed and which the gentleman declared that he regarded as an embryo monument of national glory would save him Lone hundred forty per annum He then proceeded to make a little speech about the spirit of the age and the influence of routine which he described as a gloomy gnome But his oratory was cruelly cut short by mister Vigil who demanded of him whether he ever used the river steamers The witness shuddered fearfully as he assured the committee that he never did and referred to the Cricket whose boilers burst in the year eighteen forty two besides he had he said his things to carry with him Another witness told how unsafe was the transit of heavy goods by barge from one side of the river to another He had had a cargo of marine stores which would go to sea before their time The strong ebb of the tide joined to the river current had positively carried the barge away and its course had not been stopped till it had drifted on shore at Purfleet He acknowledged that something had transpired of the bargemen being drunk but he had no knowledge himself that such had been the case No other cargoes of his own had been carried away but he had heard that such was often the case He thought that the bridge was imperatively demanded Would the tolls pay He felt sure that they would Why then should not the bridge be built as a commercial speculation without Government aid He thought that in such cases a fostering Government was bound to come forward and show the way He had a few shares in the bridge himself He had paid up Lone a share They were now worth twos sixd each They had been worth nothing before the committee had been ordered to sit He declined to give any opinion as to what the shares would be worth if the money were granted Ladies at Limehouse proved that if there were a bridge they could save thirtys a year each by buying their tea and sugar at Rotherhithe and so singular are the usages of trade that the ladies of Rotherhithe would benefit their husbands equally and return the compliment by consuming the bread of Limehouse The shores of Kent were pining for the beef of the opposite bank and only too anxious to give in return the surplus stock of their own poultry Let but a bridge be opened as was asserted by one animated vendor of rope and Poplar would soon rival Pimlico Perhaps that might not be desirable in the eyes of men who lived in the purlieus of the Court and who were desirous to build no new bridge except that over the ornamental water in saint James s Park Upon uttering which the rope vendor looked at mister Vigil as though he expected him to sink at once under the table mister Blocks of the great firm of Blocks Piles and Cofferdam then came forward He declared that a large sum of money was necessary before this great national undertaking could be begun in a spirit worthy of the nineteenth century It was intended to commence the approaches on each side of the river a quarter of a mile from the first abutment of the bridge in order to acquire the necessary altitude without a steep ascent He then described what a glorious bridge this bridge would be how it would eclipse all bridges that had ever been built how the fleets of all nations would ride under it how many hundred thousand square feet of wrought iron would be consumed in its construction how many tons of Portland stone in the abutments parapets and supporting walls how much timber would be buried twenty fathoms deep in the mud of the river how many miles of paving stone would be laid down mister Blocks went on with his astonishing figures till the committee were bewildered and even mister Vigil though well used to calculations could hardly raise his mind to the dimensions of the proposed undertaking The engineer followed and showed how easily this great work could be accomplished There was no difficulty literally none The patronage of the Crown was all that was required The engineer was asked whether by the word patronage he meant money and after a little laughing and a few counter questions he admitted that in his estimation patronage and money did mean the same thing Such was the case made out by the promoters of the bridge and the chairman and his party were very sanguine of success They conceived that mister Blocks figures had completely cowed their antagonists mister Vigil then took his case in hand and brought forward his witnesses It now appeared that the intercourse between the people living on each side of the river was immense and ever on the increase Limehouse it would seem had nothing to do but to go to Deptford and that Deptford consumed all its time in returning the visit Little children were sent across continually on the most trifling errands going and coming for one halfpenny An immense income was made by the owners of the ferry No two adjacent streets in London had more to do with each other than had the lanes of Rotherhithe and the lanes of Limehouse Westminster and Lambeth were further apart and less connected by friendly intercourse The frequenters of the ferry were found to outnumber the passengers over Waterloo Bridge by ten to one Indeed so lamentable a proposition as this of building a bridge across the river had never before been mooted by the public Men conversant with such matters gave it as their opinion that no amount of tolls that could reasonably be expected would pay one per cent on the money which it was proposed to expend that sum however they stated would not more than half cover the full cost of the bridge Traffic would be prohibited by the heavy charges which would be necessary and the probability would be that the ferry would still continue to be the ordinary mode of crossing the river A gentleman accustomed to use strong figures of speech declared that if such a bridge were built the wisest course would be to sow the surface with grass and let it out for grazing This witness was taken specially in hand by mister Nogo and targed very tightly mister Vigil had contrived to prove out of the mouths of inimical witnesses the very reverse of that which they had been summoned thither to assert The secret of the ferry had been first brought to the light by the gentleman who could not visit his daughter at Deptford and so on These triumphs had evidently been very pleasant to mister Vigil and mister Nogo thought that he might judiciously take a leaf out of the Treasury book Actuated by this ambition he with the assistance of his friend the M Carthy Desmond put no less than twenty two fifty questions to the gentleman who suggested the grazing in order to induce him to say that if there were a bridge men would probably walk over it But they could not bring him to own to a single passenger unless they would abandon the tolls The most that they could get from him was that perhaps an old woman with more money than wit might go over it on a Sunday afternoon if which he did not believe any old woman existed in that part of the world who had more money than wit This witness was kept in the chair for three days during which mister Vigil was nearly driven wild by the loss of his valuable time But he did not complain Nor would he have complained though he might have absented himself had the witness been kept in the chair three weeks instead of three days The expense of the committee including witnesses shorthand writers and printing was about Lsixty a day but it never occurred to any one of the number to get up and declare with indignation that such a waste of money and time on so palpably absurd a scheme was degrading and to demand an immediate close of their labours It all went smoothly to the end and mister Nogo walked off from his task with the approving conscience of a patriotic legislator At the close the members met to prepare their report It was then the first week in August and they were naturally in a hurry to finish their work It was now their duty to decide on the merits of what they had heard to form a judgement as to the veracity of the witnesses and declare on behalf of the country which they represented whether or no this bridge should be built at the expense of the nation With his decision each was ready enough but not one of them dreamed of being influenced by anything which had been said before them All the world that is all that were in any way concerned in the matter knew that the witnesses for the bridge were anxious to have it built and that the witnesses against the bridge were anxious to prevent the building It would be the worst of ignorance ignorance of the usage of the world we live in to suppose that any member of Parliament could be influenced by such manoeuvres Besides was not the mind of each man fully known before the committee met Various propositions were made by the members among themselves and various amendments moved The balance of the different parties had been nearly preserved A decided victory was not to be expected on either side At last the resolution to which the committee came was this That this committee is not prepared under existing circumstances to recommend a grant of public money for the purpose of erecting a bridge at Limehouse but that the committee consider that the matter is still open to consideration should further evidence be adduced mister Vigil was perfectly satisfied He did not wish to acerbate the member for Mile End and was quite willing to give him a lift towards keeping his seat for the borough if able to do so without cost to the public exchequer At Limehouse the report of the committee was declared by certain persons to be as good as a decision in their favour it was only postponing the matter for another session But mister Vigil knew that he had carried his point and the world soon agreed with him He at least did his work successfully and considering the circumstances of his position he did it with credit to himself A huge blue volume was then published containing among other things all mister Nogo s twenty two fifty questions and their answers and so the Limehouse and Rotherhithe bridge dropped into oblivion and was forgotten CHAPTER XXXIII TO STAND OR NOT TO STAND Sir Gregory Hardlines had been somewhat startled by Alaric s announcement of his parliamentary intentions It not unnaturally occurred to that great man that should mister Tudor succeed at Strathbogy and should he also succeed in being allowed to hold his office and seat together he Tudor would very soon become first fiddle at the Civil Service Examination Board This was a view of the matter which was by no means agreeable to Sir Gregory Not for this had he devoted his time his energy and the best powers of his mind to the office of which he was at present the chief not for this had he taken by the hand a young clerk and brought him forward and pushed him up and seated him in high places To have kept mister Jobbles would have been better than this he at any rate would not have aspired to parliamentary honours And when Sir Gregory came to look into it he hardly knew whether those bugbears with which he had tried to frighten Tudor were good serviceable bugbears such as would stand the strain of such a man s logic and reason Was there really any reason why one of the commissioners should not sit in Parliament Would his doing so be subversive of the constitution Or would the ministers of the day object to an additional certain vote This last point of view was one in which it did not at all delight Sir Gregory to look at the subject in question He determined that he would not speak on the matter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer or to any of the Government wigs who might be considered to be bigger wigs than himself And Alaric thought over the matter coolly also He looked at it till the bugbears shrank into utter insignificance till they became no more than forms of shreds and patches put up to frighten birds out of cherry orchards Why should the constitution be wounded by the presence of one more commissioner in Parliament Why should not he do his public duty and hold his seat at the same time as was done by so many others But he would have to go out if the ministry went out That was another difficulty another bugbear more substantial perhaps than the others but he was prepared to meet even that He was a poor man his profession was that of the Civil Service his ambition was to sit in Parliament He would see whether he could not combine his poverty with his profession and with his ambition also Sir Gregory resolved in his fear that he would not speak to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the matter Alaric on the other hand in his audacity resolved that he would do so It was thus that Sir Gregory regarded the matter See all that I have done for this man said he to himself see how I have warmed him in my bosom how I have lifted him to fortune and renown how I have heaped benefits on his head If gratitude in this world be possible that man should be grateful to me if one man can ever have another s interest at heart that man should have a heartfelt anxiety as to my interest And yet how is it I have placed him in the chair next to my own and now he is desirous of sitting above me Twas thus Sir Gregory communed with himself But Alaric s soliloquy was very different A listener who could have overheard both would hardly have thought that the same question was being discussed by the two I have got so high said Alaric by my own labour by my own skill and tact and why should I stop here I have left my earliest colleagues far behind me have distanced those who were my competitors in the walk of life why should I not still go on and distance others also why stop when I am only second or third It is very natural that Sir Gregory should wish to keep me out of Parliament I cannot in the least blame him let us all fight as best each may for himself He does not wish a higher career I do Sir Gregory will now do all that he can to impede my views because they are antagonistic to his own very well I must only work the harder to overcome his objections There was no word in all this of gratitude there was no thought in Alaric s mind that it behoved him to be grateful to Sir Gregory It was for his own sake not for his pupil s that Sir Gregory had brought this pupil forward Grateful indeed In public life when is there time for gratitude Who ever thinks of other interest than his own Such was Alaric s theory of life But not the less would he have expected gratitude from those whom he might serve Such also very probably was Sir Gregory s theory when he thought of those who had helped him instead of those whom he himself had helped And so they met and discussed Alaric s little proposition Since I saw you yesterday said Sir Gregory I have been thinking much of what you were saying to me of your wish to go into Parliament I am very much obliged to you said Alaric I need hardly tell you Tudor how anxious I am to further your advancement I greatly value your ability and diligence and have shown that I am anxious to make them serviceable to the public I am fully aware that I owe you a great deal Sir Gregory Oh I don t mean that that s nothing I am not thinking of myself I only want you to understand that I am truly anxious to see you take that line in public matters which may make your services most valuable to the public and which may redound the most to your own advantage I have thought of what you said to me with the most mature deliberation and I am persuaded that I shall best do my duty to you and to the service by recommending you to abandon altogether your idea of going into Parliament Sir Gregory said this in his weightiest manner He endeavoured to assume some of that authority with which he had erst cowed the young Tudor at the Weights and Measures and as he finished his speech he assumed a profound look which ought to have been very convincing But the time was gone by with Alaric when such tricks of legerdemain were convincing to him A grave brow compressed lips and fixed eyes had no longer much effect upon him He had a point to gain and he was thinking of that and not of Sir Gregory s grimaces Then you will not see the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the subject No said Sir Gregory it would be useless for me to do so I could not advocate such a scheme feeling certain that it would be injurious both to yourself and to the service and I would not desire to see the Chancellor with the view of opposing your wishes I am much obliged to you for that at any rate said Alaric But I do hope that you will not carry your plan any farther When I tell you as I do with the utmost sincerity that I feel certain that an attempt to seat yourself in Parliament can only lead to the ruin of your prospects as a Civil servant prospects which are brighter now than those of any other young man in the service I cannot but think that you must hesitate before you take any step which will in my opinion render your resignation necessary I shall be sorry to resign Sir Gregory as I have such true pleasure in serving with you And I presume a salary of Ltwelve hundred a year is not unacceptable said Sir Gregory with the very faintest of smiles By no means said Alaric I am a poor man depending altogether on my own exertions for an income I cannot afford to throw away a chance Then take my word for it you should give up all idea of Parliament said Sir Gregory who thought that he had carried his point But I call a seat in Parliament a chance said Alaric the best chance that a man circumstanced as I am can possibly have I have the offer of a seat Sir Gregory and I can t afford to throw it away Then it is my duty to tell you as the head of your office that it will be your duty to resign before you offer yourself as a candidate That you mean is your present opinion Sir Gregory Yes mister Tudor that is my opinion an opinion which I shall be forced to express to the Chancellor of the Exchequer if you persist in this infatuation Alaric looked very grave but not a whit angry I am sorry for it Sir Gregory very sorry I had hoped to have had your countenance I would give it you mister Tudor if I could consistently with my duty as a public servant but as I cannot I am sure you will not ask for it How Fidus Neverbend would have admired the chief commissioner could he have seen and heard him at this moment But he continued relaxing for a while the muscles of his face I hope I do hope you will think better of this What are you to gain Come Tudor think of it that way What are you to gain You with a wife and young family coming up about your heels what are you to gain by going into Parliament That is what I ask you What are you to gain It was delightful to see how pleasantly practical Sir Gregory could become when he chose to dismount from his high horse It is considered a high position in this country that of a member of Parliament said Alaric A man in gaining that is generally supposed to have gained something True quite true It is a desirable position for a rich man or a rich man s eldest son or even for a poor man if by getting into Parliament he can put himself in the way of improving his income But my dear Tudor you are in none of these positions Abandon the idea my dear Tudor pray abandon it If not for your own sake at any rate do so for that of your wife and child Sir Gregory might as well have whistled Not a word that he said had the slightest effect on Alaric How was it possible that his words should have any effect seeing that Alaric was convinced that Sir Gregory was pleading for his own advantage and not for that of his listener Alaric did listen He received all that Sir Gregory said with the most profound attention schooled his face into a look of the most polite deference and then with his most cruel tone informed Sir Gregory that his mind was quite made up and that he did intend to submit himself to the electors of Strathbogy And as to what you say about my seat at the board Sir Gregory you may probably be right Perhaps it will be as well that I should see the Chancellor of the Exchequer myself Who will to Cupar maun to Cupar said Sir Gregory I can only say mister Tudor that I am very sorry for you and very sorry for your wife very sorry very sorry indeed And who will to Strathbogy maun to Strathbogy said Alaric laughing there is certainly an air of truth about the proverb as applied to myself just at present But the fact is whether for good or for bad I maun to Strathbogy That is my present destiny The fact that I have a wife and a child does make the step a most momentous one But Sir Gregory I should never forgive myself were I to throw away such an opportunity Then I have nothing more to say mister Tudor Of course I shall try to save my place continued Alaric I look upon that as quite impossible said Sir Gregory It can do me no harm at any rate to see the Chancellor of the Exchequer If he tells me that a seat in Parliament and a seat at the board are incompatible and that as one of the Civil Service Commissioners I am not free to stand for the borough I will in that case Sir Gregory put my resignation in your hands before I publish my address And so they parted each determined to do all that in him lay to thwart the wishes of the other Alaric was not in the least influenced by anything that Sir Gregory had said to him he had made up his mind and was determined to be turned from it by no arguments that his colleague could use but nevertheless he could not but be meditative as walking home across the Parks he thought of his wife and child It is true that he had a second trade he was a stock jobber as well as a Civil Service Commissioner but he already perceived how very difficult it was to realize an income to which he could trust from that second precarious pursuit He had also lived in a style considerably beyond that which his official income would have enabled him to assume He had on the whole he thought done very well but yet it would be a dreadful thing to have to trust to so precarious a livelihood He had realized nothing he had not yet been able to pay back the money which he had so fraudulently taken and to acquit himself of a debt which now lay daily heavier and heavier on his soul He felt that he must repay not only that but Undy s share also before he could again pass a happy day or a quiet night This plan of throwing up Ltwelve hundred a year would badly assist him in getting rid of this incubus But still that watchword of his goaded him on Excelsior he still said to himself Excelsior If he halted now now when the ball was at his foot he might never have another chance Very early in life before a beard was on his chin before he could style himself a man according to the laws of his country he had determined within himself that a seat in Parliament was the only fitting ambition for an Englishman That was now within his reach Would he be such a dastard as to draw back his hand and be deterred from taking it by old women s tales of prudence and the self interested lectures of Sir Gregory Hardlines Excelsior There was not much that could be so styled in that debt of his to M and Madame Jaquetanape If he could only pay that off he felt that he could brave the world without a fear Come what come might he would sell out and do so The bridge committee was sitting and his shares were already worth more than he had paid for them mister Blocks had just given his evidence and the commercial world was willing enough to invest in the Limehouse bridge He would sell out and put his conscience at rest But then to do so successfully he must induce Undy to do so too and that he knew would not at present be an easy task Who had ever been successful in getting back money from Undy Scott He had paid the last half year s interest with most commendable punctuality and was not that a great deal from Undy Scott But what if this appropriation of another s money what if this fraud should be detected and exposed before he had succeeded in paying back the Lten thousand What if he should wake some morning and find himself in the grip of some Newgate myrmidon A terrible new law had just been passed for the protection of trust property a law in which he had not felt the slightest interest when he had first seen in the daily newspapers some tedious account of the passing of the various clauses but which was now terrible to his innermost thoughts His walk across the Parks was not made happy by much self triumph In spite of his commissionership and coming parliamentary honours his solitary moments were seldom very happy It was at his club when living with Undy and Undy s peers that he was best able to throw off his cares and enjoy himself But even then high as he was mounted on his fast trotting horse black Care would sit behind him ever mounted on the same steed And bitterly did poor Gertrude feel the misery of these evenings which her husband passed at his club but she never reviled him or complained she never spoke of her sorrow even to her mother or sister She did not even blame him in her own heart She knew that he had other business than that of his office higher hopes than those attached to his board and she taught herself to believe that his career required him to be among public men He had endeavoured to induce her to associate constantly with missus Val so that her evenings might not be passed alone but Gertrude after trying missus Val for a time had quietly repudiated the closeness of this alliance missus Val had her ideas of Excelsior her ambition to rule and these ideas and this ambition did not at all suit Gertrude s temper Not even for her husband s sake could she bring herself to be patronized by missus Val They were still very dear friends of course but they did not live in each other s arms as Alaric had intended they should do He returned home after his interview with Sir Gregory and found his wife in the drawing room with her child He usually went down from his office to his club and she was therefore the more ready to welcome him for having broken through his habit on the present occasion She left her infant sprawling on the floor and came up to greet him with a kiss Ger said he putting his arm round her and embracing her I have come home to consult you on business and then he seated himself on the sofa taking her with him and still in his arms There was but little doubt that she would consent to anything which he could propose to her after such a fashion in such a guise as this that he knew full well Well love said she and what is the business about You know that I always think that to be best which you think to be best Yes Ger but this is a very important matter and then he looked grave but managed at the same time to look happy and contented This is a matter of vital importance to you and I will do nothing in it without your consent What is best for you must be best for me said Gertrude kissing his forehead Then he explained to her what had passed between himself and Sir Gregory and what his own ideas were as regarded the borough of Strathbogy Sir Gregory said he is determined that I shall not remain at the board and sit in Parliament at the same time but I do not see why Sir Gregory is to have his own way in everything If you are not afraid of the risk I will make up my mind to stand it at all events and to resign if the Minister makes it imperative If however you fear the result I will let the matter drop and tell the Scotts to find another candidate I am anxious to go into Parliament I confess but I will never do so at the expense of your peace of mind The way in which he put upon her the whole weight of the decision was not generous Nor was the mode he adopted of inducing her to back his own wishes If there were risk to her and in truth there was fearful risk it was his duty to guard her from the chance not hers to say whether such danger should be encountered or no The nature of her answer may be easily surmised She was generous though he was not She would never retard his advance or be felt as a millstone round his neck She encouraged him with all her enthusiasm and bade him throw prudence to the winds If he rose must she not rise also Whatever step in life was good for him must it not be good for her as well And so that matter was settled between them pleasantly enough He endured a fortnight of considerable excitement during which he and Sir Gregory did not smile at each other and then he saw the Chancellor of the Exchequer That gentleman promised to speak to the Prime Minister feeling himself unable to answer the question put to him definitely out of his own head and then another fortnight passed on At the end of that time the Chancellor of the Exchequer sent for Alaric and they had a second interview Well mister Tudor said the great man this is a matter of very considerable importance and one on which I am not even yet prepared to give you a positive answer This was very good news for Alaric Sir Gregory had spoken of the matter as one on which there could be no possible doubt He had asserted that the British lion would no longer sleep peaceably in his lair if such a violence were put on the constitution as that meditated by the young commissioner It was quite clear that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Prime Minister also looked at it in a very different light They doubted and Alaric was well aware that their doubt was as good as certainty to him The truth was that the Prime Minister had said to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in a half serious half jocular way that he didn t see why he should reject a vote when offered to him by a member of the Civil Service The man must of course do his work and should it be found that his office work and his seat in Parliament interfered with each other why he must take the consequences And if or or made a row about it in the House and complained why in that case also mister Tudor must take the consequences And then enough having been said on that matter the conversation dropped I am not prepared to give a positive answer said the Chancellor of the Exchequer who of course did not choose to commit himself Alaric assured the great man that he was not so unreasonable as to expect a positive answer Positive answers as he well knew were not often forthcoming among official men official men as he had already learnt prefer to do their business by answers which are not positive He himself had become adverse to positive answers since he had become a commissioner and was quite prepared to dispense with them in the parliamentary career which he hoped that he was now about to commence This much however was quite clear that he might offer himself as a candidate to the electors of Strathbogy without resigning and that Sir Gregory s hostile remonstrance on the subject should he choose to make one would not be received as absolute law by the greater powers Accordingly as Alaric was elated Sir Gregory was depressed He had risen high but now this young tyro whom he had fostered was about to climb above his head O the ingratitude of men Alaric however showed no triumph He was more submissive more gracious than ever to his chief It was only to himself that he muttered Excelsior CHAPTER XXXIV WESTMINSTER HALL The parliamentary committee pursued their animated inquiries respecting the Limehouse bridge all through the sultry month of July How mister Vigil must have hated mister Nogo and the M Carthy Desmond how sick he must have been of that eternal witness who with imperturbable effrontery answered the twenty two fifty questions put to him without admitting anything To mister Vigil it was all mere nonsense sheer waste of time Had he been condemned to sit for eight days in close contiguity to the clappers of a small mill he would have learnt as much as he did from the witnesses before the committee Nevertheless he went through it and did not lose his temper He smiled sweetly on mister Nogo every morning and greeted the titled Irishman with his easy familiar nod as though the continued sitting of this very committee was of all things to him the most desirable Such is mister Vigil s peculiar tact such his special talent these are the gifts gifts by no means ordinary which have made him Right Honourable and recommended him to the confidence of successive badgers But though the committee was uninteresting to mister Vigil it was not so to the speculative inhabitants of Limehouse or to the credulous shopkeepers of Rotherhithe On the evening of the day on which mister Blocks was examined the shares went up twenty per cent and when his evidence was published in extenso the next Saturday morning by the Capel Court Share buyer a periodical which served for Bible and Prayer book as well as a Compendium of the Whole Duty of Man to Undy Scott and his friends a further rise in the price of this now valuable property was the immediate consequence Now then was the time for Alaric to sell and get out of his difficulties if ever he could do so Shares which he bought for thirtys were now worth nearly Ltwo tens He was strongly of opinion that they would fall again and that the final result of the committee would leave them of a less value than their original purchase money and probably altogether valueless He could not however act in the matter without consulting Undy so closely linked were they in the speculation and even at the present price his own shares would not enable him to pay back the full amount of what he had taken The joint property of the two was however at its present market price worth Ltwelve thousand Lten thousand would make him a free man He was perfectly willing to let Undy have the full use of the difference in amount nay he was ready enough to give it to him altogether if by so doing he could place the whole of his ward s money once more in safety With the power of offering such a douceur to his friend s rapacity he flattered himself that he might have a chance of being successful He was thus prepared to discuss the matter with his partner It so happened that at the same moment Undy was desirous of discussing the same subject their joint interest namely in the Limehouse bridge there was no difficulty therefore in their coming together They met at the door of the committee room when mister Nogo had just put his nine hundred and ninety ninth question to the adverse witness and as the summons to prayers prevented the one thousandth being proceeded with at that moment Undy and Alaric sauntered back along the passages and then walking up and down the immense space of Westminster Hall said each to the other what he had to say on the matter mooted between them Undy was in great glee and seemed to look on his fortune as already made They had at first confined their remarks to the special evidence of the witness who had last been in the chair and Undy with the volubility which was common to him when he was in high spirits had been denouncing him as an ass who was injuring his own cause by his over obstinacy Nothing that he can say said Undy will tell upon the share market The stock is rising from hour to hour and Piles himself told me that he knew from sure intelligence that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is prepared to give way whatever Vigil may say to the contrary Their firm Piles says is buying every share they can lay their hands on Then in God s name let them buy ours said Alaric Buy ours said Undy You don t mean to tell me that you wish to sell now You don t mean to say that you want to back out now that the game is all going our own way Indeed I do and I intend to do so just listen to me Undy I tell you fairly Tudor I will not sell a share what you may choose to do with your own I cannot say But if you will be guided by me you will keep every share you have got Instead of selling we should both add to our stock I at any rate am resolved to do so Listen to me Undy said Alaric The truth is said Undy who at the present moment preferred talking to listening the truth is you do not understand buying and selling shares We should both be ruined very quickly were I to allow myself to be led by you you are too timid too much afraid of risking your money your speculative pluck hardly rises higher than the Three per cents and never soars above a first class mortgage on land I could be as sanguine as you are and as bold said Alaric were I venturing with my own money In the name of goodness get that bugbear out of your head said Undy Whatever good it might have done you to think of that some time ago it can do you no good now There was a bitter truth in this which made Alaric s heart sink low within his breast Wherever the money came from whose property it may have been or be it has been used and now your only safety is in making the best use of it A little daring a little audacity it is that which ruins men When you sit down to play brag you must brag it out or lose your money But my dear fellow there is no question here of losing money If we sell now we shall realize about Ltwo thousand And will that or the half of that satisfy you Is that your idea of a good thing Will that be sufficient to pay for the dozen of bad things which a fellow is always putting his foot into It won t satisfy me I can tell you that at any rate Alaric felt very desirous of keeping Undy in a good humour He wished if possible to persuade him rather than to drive him to coax him into repaying this money and not absolutely to demand the repayment Come said he what do you call a good thing yourself I call cent per cent a good thing and I ll not sell a share till they come up to that They ll never do that Undy That s your opinion I think differently And I m sure you will own I have had more experience of the share market than you have When I see such men as Blocks and Piles buying fast I know very well which way the wind blows A man may be fishing a long time Tudor in these waters before he gets such a haul as this but he must be a great fool to let go his net when he does get it They both then remained silent for a time for each was doubtful how best to put forward the view which he himself wished to urge Their projects were diametrically different and yet neither could carry his own without the assistance of the other I tell you what I propose said Undy Wait a moment Undy said Alaric listen to me for one moment I can hear nothing till you do so and then I will hear anything Well what is it We have each of us put something near to Lfive thousand into this venture I have put more said Scott Very well But we have each of us withdrawn a sum equal to that I have named from my ward s fortune for this purpose I deny that said Undy I have taken nothing from your ward s fortune I have had no power to do so You have done as you pleased with that fortune But I am ready to admit that I have borrowed Lfive thousand not from your ward but from you Alaric was nearly beside himself but he still felt that he should have no chance of carrying his point if he lost his temper That is ungenerous of you Scott to say the least of it but we ll let that pass To enable me to lend you the Lfive thousand and to enable me to join you in this speculation Lten thousand has been withdrawn from Clementina s fortune I know nothing about that said Scott Know nothing about it said Alaric looking at him with withering scorn But Undy was not made of withering material and did not care a straw for his friend s scorn Nothing whatever said he Well so be it said Alaric but the fact is the money has been withdrawn I don t doubt that in the least said Undy I am not now going to argue whether the fault has been most mine or yours continued Alaric Well that is kind of you said Undy considering that you are the girl s trustee and that I have no more to do with it than that fellow in the wig there I wish at any rate you would let me explain myself said Alaric who felt that his patience was fast going and who could hardly resist the temptation of seizing his companion by the throat and punishing him on the spot for his iniquity I don t prevent you my dear fellow only remember this I will not permit you to assert without contradicting you that I am responsible for Clem s fortune Now go on and explain away as hard as you like Alaric under these circumstances found it not very easy to put what he had to say into any words that his companion would admit He fully intended at some future day to thrust Scott s innocence down his throat and tell him that he was not only a thief but a mean lying beggarly thief But the present was not the time Too much depended on his inducing Undy to act with him Ten thousand pounds has at any rate been taken That I won t deny And half that sum has been lent to you I acknowledge a debt of Lfive thousand It is imperative that Lten thousand should at once be repaid I have no objection in life I can sell my shares in the Limehouse bridge continued Alaric for Lsix thousand and I am prepared to do so The more fool you said Undy if you do it especially as Lsix thousand won t pay Lten thousand and as the same property if overheld another month or two in all probability will do so I am ready to sacrifice that and more than that said Alaric If you will sell out Lfour thousand and let me at once have that amount so as to make up the full sum I owe I will make you a free present of the remainder of the debt Come Undy you cannot but call that a good thing You will have pocketed two thousand pounds according to the present market value of the shares and that without the slightest risk Undy for a while seemed staggered by the offer Whether it was Alaric s extreme simplicity in making it or his own good luck in receiving it or whether by any possible chance some all but dormant remnant of feeling within his heart was touched we will not pretend to say But for a while he walked on silent as though wavering in his resolution and looking as if he wished to be somewhat more civil somewhat less of the bully than he had been There was no one else to whom Alaric could dare to open his heart on this subject of his ward s fortune there was none other but this ally of his to whom he could confide whom he could consult Unpromising therefore though Undy was as a confederate Alaric when he thought he saw this change in his manner poured forth at once the full tide of his feelings Undy said he pray bear with me a while The truth is I cannot endure this misery any longer I do not now want to blame anyone but myself The thing has been done and it is useless now to talk of blame The thing has been done and all that now remains for me is to undo it to put this girl s money back again and get this horrid weight from off my breast Upon my word my dear fellow I did not think that you took it in such a light as that said Undy I am miserable about it said Alaric It keeps me awake all night and destroys all my energy during the day Oh that s all bile said Undy You should give up fish for a few days and take a blue pill at night Scott this money must be paid back at once or I shall lose my senses Fortune has so far favoured me as to enable me to put my hand at once on the larger portion of it You must let me have the remainder In God s name say that you will do so Undy Scott unfortunately had not the power to do as he was asked Whether he would have done so had he had the power may be doubtful He was somewhat gravelled for an answer to Alaric s earnest supplication and therefore made none till the request was repeated In God s name let me have this money repeated Alaric You will then have made two thousand pounds by the transaction My dear Tudor said he your stomach is out of order I can see it as well as possible from the way you talk Here was an answer for a man to get to the most earnest appeal which he could make Here was comfort for a wretch suffering from fear remorse and shame as Alaric was suffering He had spoken of his feelings and his heart but these were regions quite out of Undy Scott s cognizance Take a blue pill said he and you ll be as right as a trivet in a couple of days What was Alaric to say What could he say to a man who at such a crisis could talk to him of blue pills For a while he said nothing but the form of his face changed a darkness came over his brow which Scott had never before seen there the colour flew from his face his eyes sparkled and a strange appearance of resolute defiance showed itself round his mouth Scott began to perceive that his medical advice would not be taken in good part Scott said he stopping short in his walk and taking hold of the collar of his companion s coat not loosely by the button but with a firm grip which Undy felt that it would be difficult to shake off Scott you will find that I am not to be trifled with You have made a villain of me I can see no way to escape from my ruin without your aid but by the living God if I fall you shall fall with me Tell me now will you let me have the sum I demand If you do not I will go to your brother s wife and tell her what has become of her daughter s money You may go to the devil s wife if you like it said Undy and tell her whatever you please You refuse then said Alaric still keeping hold of Undy s coat Come take your hand off said Undy You will make me think your head is wrong as well as your stomach if you go on like this Take your hand off and listen to me I will then explain to you why I cannot do what you would have me Take your hand away I say do you not see that people are looking at us They were now standing at the upper end of the hall close under the steps which lead to the Houses of Parliament and as Undy said the place was too public for a display of physical resentment Alaric took his hand away Well said he now tell me what is to hinder you from letting me have the money you owe me Only this said Undy that every share I have in the concern is made over by way of security to old M Cleury and he now holds them Till I have redeemed them I have no power of selling Alaric when he heard these words could hardly prevent himself from falling in the middle of the hall All his hopes were then over he had no chance of shaking this intolerable burden from his shoulders he had taken the woman s money this money which had been entrusted to his honour and safe keeping and thrown it into a bottomless gulf And now listen to me said Undy looking at his watch I must be in the House in ten or fifteen minutes for this bill about married women is on and I am interested in it listen to me now for five minutes All this that you have been saying is sheer nonsense I think you ll find that it is not all nonsense said Alaric Oh I am not in the least afraid of your doing anything rash You ll be cautious enough I know when you come to be cool especially if you take a little physic What I want to say is this Clem s money is safe enough I tell you these bridge shares will go on rising till the beginning of next session Instead of selling what we should do is to buy up six or seven thousand pounds more What with Clementina s money It s as well to be hung for a sheep as a lamb Besides your doing so is your only safety My brother Val insists upon having two hundred fifty shares Your brother Val said Alaric Yes Val and why shouldn t he I would give them to him if I could but I can t M Cleury as I tell you has every share of mine in his possession Your brother Val wants two hundred fifty shares And does he expect me to give them to him Well I rather think he does That is not to give them of course you don t suppose he wants you to make him a present of money But he wants you to accommodate him with the price of them You can either do that or let him have so many of your own it will be as broad as it is long and he ll give you his note of hand for the amount Now it was well known among the acquaintance of the Scott family that the note of hand of the Honourable Captain Val was not worth the paper on which it was written Alaric was so astonished at this monstrous request coming as it did after such a conversation that he did not well know how to take it Was Undy mad or was he in joke What man in his senses would think of lending six or seven hundred pounds to Val Scott I suppose you are in jest said he somewhat bitterly I never was more in earnest in my life said Undy I ll just explain how the matter is and as you are sharp enough you ll see at once that you had better oblige him Val you know is always hard up he can t touch a shilling of that woman s money and just at present he has none of his own So he came to me this morning to raise the wind And you are kind enough to pass him on to me Listen a moment I did not do anything of the kind I never lend money to Val It s a principle with me not to do so and he knows it Then just tell him that my principles in this respect are identical with your own That s all very well and you may tell him so yourself if you like it but hear first of all what his arguments are Of course I told him I could do nothing for him But said he you can get Tudor to do it I told him of course that I could do nothing of the kind Oh said Val I know the game you are both playing I know all about Clem s money Val you know never says much He was playing pool at the time at the club but he came back after his stroke and whispered to me You and Tudor must let me have two hundred fifty of those shares and then it ll be all right Now Val you know is a most determined fellow Alaric when he heard this looked up into his companion s face to see whether he was talking to the Evil One himself Oh what a net of ruin was closing round him how inextricable were the toils into which he had fallen After all continued Undy what he asks is not much and I really think you should do it for him He is quite willing to give you his assistance at Strathbogy and he is entitled to some accommodation Some accommodation repeated Alaric almost lost in the consideration of his own misery Yes I really think he is And Tudor you may be sure of this you know you will be quite safe with him Val is the very soul of honour Do this for him and you ll hear no more about it You may be quite sure he ll ask for nothing further and that he ll never say a word to annoy you He s devilish honourable is Val no man can be more so though perhaps you wouldn t think it Devilish honourable said Alaric Only he would like to have a bribe A bribe said Scott Come my dear fellow don t you make an ass of yourself Val is like the rest of us when money is going he likes to have a share of it If you come to that every man who is paid either for talking or for not talking is bribed I don t know that I ever heard of a much clearer case of a bribe than this which you now demand for your brother Bribe or no bribe said Undy looking at his watch I strongly advise you to do for him what he asks it will be better for all of us And let me give you another piece of advice never use hard words among friends Do you remember the Mary Janes which Manylodes brought for you in his pocket to the hotel at Tavistock Here Alaric turned as pale as a spectre Don t talk of bribes my dear fellow We are all of us giving and taking bribes from our cradles to our graves but men of the world generally call them by some prettier names Now if you are not desirous to throw your cards up altogether get these shares for Val and let him or me have them to morrow morning And so saying Undy disappeared into the House through the side door out of the hall which is appropriated to the use of honourable members And then Alaric was left alone He had never hitherto realized the true facts of the position in which he had placed himself but now he did so He was in the hands of these men these miscreants these devils he was completely at their mercy and he already felt that they were as devoid of mercy as they were of justice A cold sweat broke out all over him and he continued walking up and down the hall ignorant as to where he was and what he was doing almost thoughtless stunned as it were by his misery and the conviction that he was a ruined man He had remained there an hour after Undy had left him before he roused himself sufficiently to leave the hall and think of returning home It was then seven o clock and he remembered that he had asked his cousin to dine with him He got into a cab therefore and desired to be driven home What was he to do On one point he instantly made up his mind He would not give one shilling to Captain Val he would not advance another shilling to Undy and he would at once sell out his own shares and make such immediate restitution as might now be in his power The mention of Manylodes and the mining shares had come home to him with frightful reality and nearly stunned him What right indeed had he to talk of bribes with scorn he who so early in his own life had allowed himself to be bought How could he condemn the itching palm of such a one as Val Scott he who had been so ready to open his own when he had been tempted by no want by no poverty He would give nothing to Captain Val to bribe him to silence He knew that if he did so he would be a slave for ever The appetite of such a shark as that when once he has tasted blood is unappeasable There is nothing so ruinous as buying the silence of a rogue who has a secret What you buy you never possess and the price that is once paid must be repaid again and again as often as the rogue may demand it Any alternative must be better than this And yet what other alternative was there He did not doubt that Val when disappointed of his prey would reveal whatever he might know to his wife or to his stepson Then there would be nothing for Alaric but confession and ruin And how could he believe what Undy Scott had told him Who else could have given information against him but Undy himself Who else could have put up so heavily stupid a man as Captain Scott to make such a demand Was it not clear that his own colleague his own partner his own intimate associate Undy Scott himself was positively working out his ruin Where were now his high hopes where now his seat in Parliament his authority at the board his proud name his soaring ambition his constant watchword Excelsior ah me no no longer Excelsior but he thought of the cells of Newgate of convict prisons and then of his young wife and of his baby He made an effort to assume his ordinary demeanour and partially succeeded He went at once up to his drawing room and there he found Charley and Gertrude waiting dinner for him luckily he had no other guests Are you ill Alaric said Gertrude directly she saw him Ill No said he only fagged dearest fagged and worried and badgered and bored but thank God not ill and he endeavoured to put on his usual face and speak in his usual tone I have kept you waiting most unmercifully for your dinner Charley but then I know you navvies always lunch on mutton chops Oh I am not particularly in a hurry said Charley but I deny the lunch This has been a bad season for mutton chops in the neighbourhood of Somerset House somehow they have not grown this year Alaric ran up to prepare for dinner and his wife followed him Oh Alaric said she you are so pale what is the matter Do tell me and she put her arm through his took hold of his hand and looked up into his face The matter Nothing is the matter a man can t always be grinning and he gently shook her off and walked through their bedroom to his own dressing room Having entered it he shut the door and then sitting down bowed his head upon a small table and buried it in his hands All the world seemed to go round and round with him he was giddy and he felt that he could not stand Gertrude paused a moment in the bedroom to consider and then followed him What is it you want said he as soon as he heard the handle turn do leave me alone for one moment I am fagged with the heat and I want one minute s rest Oh Alaric I see you are ill said she For God s sake do not send me from you and coming into the room she knelt down beside his chair I know you are suffering Alaric do let me do something for you He longed to tell her everything He panted to share his sorrows with one other bosom to have one near him to whom he could speak openly of everything to have one counsellor in his trouble In that moment he all but resolved to disclose everything to her but at last he found that he could not do it Charley was there waiting for his dinner and were he now to tell his secret to his wife neither of them neither he nor she would be able to act the host or hostess If done at all it could not at any rate be done at the present moment I am better now said he giving a long and deep sigh and then he threw his arms round his wife and passionately embraced her My own angel my best best love how much too good or much too noble you are for such a husband as I am I wish I could be good enough for you she replied as she began to arrange his things for dressing You are so tired dearest wash your hands and come down don t trouble yourself to dress this evening unless indeed you are going out again Gertrude said he if there be a soul on earth that has not in it a spark of what is good or generous it is the soul of Undy Scott and so saying he began the operations of his toilet Now Gertrude had never liked Undy Scott she had attributed to him whatever faults her husband might have as a husband and at the present moment she was not inclined to fight for any of the Scott family He is a very worldly man I think said she Worldly no but hellish said Alaric hellish and damnable and fiendish Oh Alaric what has he done Never mind I cannot tell you he has done nothing It is not that he has done anything or can do anything to me but his heart but never mind I wish I wish I had never seen him Alaric if it be about money tell me the worst and I ll bear it without a murmur As long as you are well I care for nothing else have you given up your place No dearest no I can keep my place It is nothing about that I have lost no money I have rather made money It is the ingratitude of that man which almost kills me But come dearest we will go down to Charley And Gertrude mind this be quite civil to missus Val at present We will break from the whole set before long but in the meantime I would have you be very civil to missus Val And so they went down to dinner and Alaric after taking a glass of wine played his part almost as though he had no weight upon his soul After dinner he drank freely and as he drank his courage rose Why should I tell her he said to himself as he went to bed The chances are that all will yet go well CHAPTER XXXV missus VAL S NEW CARRIAGE On the next morning Alaric went to his office without speaking further as to the trouble on his mind and endeavoured to comfort himself as best he might as he walked down to his office Then he had also to decide whether it would better suit his purpose to sell out at once and pay up every shilling that he could or whether he would hold on and hope that Undy s predictions would be fulfilled and that the bridge shares would go on rising till they would sell for all that was required of him Unfortunate man what would he have given now to change his position for Norman s single clerkship or even for Charley s comparative poverty Gertrude stayed within all day but not all day in solitude About four in the afternoon the honorable missus Val called and with her came her daughter Clem now Madame Jaquetanape and the two Misses Neverbend M Jaquetanape had since his marriage made himself very agreeable to his honourable mother in law so much so that he now occupied the place in her good graces which Undy had formerly filled and which after Undy s reign had fallen to Alaric s lot missus Val liked to have about her some confidential gentleman and as she never thought of placing her confidence in her husband she was prone to select first one man and then another as her taste and interest dictated Immediately after their marriage Victoire and Clem had consented to join housekeeping with their parent Nothing could be more pleasant than this their income was unembarrassed and missus Val for the first time in her life was able to set up her carriage Among the effects arising from this cause the female Neverbends who had lately been worshippers of Gertrude veered round in their idolatry and paid their vows before missus Val s new yellow panels In this new carriage now came the four ladies to pay a morning visit to missus Tudor It was wonderful to see into how small dimensions the Misses Neverbend had contrived to pack not themselves but their crinoline As has before been hinted Gertrude did not love missus Val nor did she love Clem the danseuse nor did she specially love the Misses Neverbend They were all of a class essentially different from that in which she had been brought up and moreover missus Val was not content to allow Gertrude into her set without ruling over her or at any rate patronizing her Gertrude had borne with them all for her husband s sake and was contented to do so yet for a while longer but she thought in her heart that she would be able to draw some consolation from her husband s misfortune if it should be the means of freeing her from missus Val Oh my dear said missus Val throwing herself down into a sofa as though she were exhausted what a dreadful journey it is to you up here How those poor horses will stand it this weather I don t know but it nearly kills me it does indeed The Tudors as has been said lived in one of the quiet streets of Westbournia not exactly looking into Hyde Park but very near to it missus Val on the other hand lived in Ebury Street Pimlico her house was much inferior to that of the Tudors it was small ill built and afflicted with all the evils which bad drainage and bad ventilation can produce but then it was reckoned to be within the precincts of Belgravia and was only five minutes walk from Buckingham Palace missus Val therefore had fair ground for twitting her dear friend with living so far away from the limits of fashion You really must come down somewhat nearer to the world indeed you must my dear said the honorable missus Val We are thinking of moving but then we are talking of going to saint John s Wood or Islington said Gertrude wickedly Islington said the Honourable missus Val nearly fainting Is not Islington and saint Giles the same place asked the innocent Clem with some malice however to counterbalance her innocence O no said Lactimel saint Giles is where the poor wretched starving Irish dwell Their utter misery in the middle of this rich metropolis is a crying disgrace to the Prime Minister Poor Badger how much he has to bear Only think continued Lactimel with a soft pathetic drawl they have none to feed them none to clothe them none to do for them It is a great question said Ugolina whether promiscuous charity is a blessing or a curse It is probably the greatest question of the age I myself am inclined to think But ma said Madame Jaquetanape missus Tudor doesn t really mean that she is going to live at saint Giles does she I said Islington said Gertrude We may go to saint Giles next perhaps Had she known all how dreadful would such jokes have been to her missus Val saw that she was being quizzed and not liking it changed the conversation Ugolina said she might I trouble you to look out of the front window I hope those stupid men of mine are not letting the horses stand still They were so warm coming here that they will be sure to catch cold The stupid men however were round the corner at the public house and Ugolina could only report that as she did not see them she supposed the horses were walking about And so said missus Val mister Tudor is thinking of resigning his place at the Civil Service Board and standing for that borough of Lord Gaberlunzie s in Aberdeenshire I really cannot say said Gertrude but I believe he has some idea of going into Parliament I rather believe he will continue to hold his place Oh that I know to be impossible I was told that by a gentleman who has been much longer in the service than mister Tudor and who understands all its bearings She here alluded to Fidus Neverbend I cannot say said Gertrude I do not think mister Tudor has quite made up his mind yet Well my dear I ll tell you fairly what I think about it You know the regard I have for you and mister Tudor He too is Clementina s trustee that is to say her fortune is partly consigned to his care so I cannot but have a very great interest about him and be very anxious that he should do well Now my dear I ll tell you fairly what I think and what all the world is saying He ought not to think of Parliament He ought not indeed my dear I speak for your sake and your child s He is not a man of fortune and he ought not to think of Parliament He has a very fine situation and he really should be contented This was intolerable to Gertrude She felt that she must put missus Val down and yet she hardly knew how to do it without being absolutely rude whereas her husband had specially begged her to be civil to this woman at present Oh said she with a slight smile mister Tudor will be able to take care of himself you will find I hope that there is no cause for uneasiness Well I hope not I am sure I hope not said missus Val looking very grave But I tell you fairly that the confidence which we all have in your husband will be much shaken if he does anything rash He should think of this you know He has no private fortune to back him we must remember that Gertrude became very red in the face but she would not trust herself to answer missus Val at the spur of the moment It makes such a difference when one has got no private fortune said Madame Jaquetanape the heiress Does it not Lactimel Oh indeed it does said Lactimel I wish every one had a private fortune it would be so nice wouldn t it There would be very little poetry in the world if you were to banish poverty said Ugolina Poverty may be called the parent of poetry Look at Milton how poor he was and Homer he begged his bread But Lord Byron was not a beggar said Clem contemptuously I do hope mister Tudor will think of what he is doing continued missus Val It is certainly most good natured and most disinterested of my dear father in law Lord Gaberlunzie to place his borough at mister Tudor s disposal It is just like him dear good old nobleman But my dear it will be a thousand pities if mister Tudor should be led on by his lordship s kindness to bring about his own ruin missus Val had once in her life seen his good natured lordship Soon after her marriage she had insisted on Captain Val taking her down to the family mansion She stayed there one night and then left it and since that had shown no further desire to visit Cauldkail Castle She did not the less delight to talk about her dear good father in law the lord Why should she give his son Val board and lodging but that she might be enabled to do so She was not the woman to buy an article and not make of it all the use of which it might be capable Pray do not concern yourself said Gertrude I can assure you mister Tudor will manage very well for himself but should any misfortune happen to him he will not you may be certain attribute it to Lord Gaberlunzie I am told that Sir Gregory is most opposed to it continued missus Val I heard that from mister Neverbend who is altogether in Sir Gregory s confidence did not you my dears and she turned round to the sisters of Fidus for confirmation I heard my brother say that as mister Tudor s office is not parliamentary but permanent and as he has to attend from ten till four Alaric has not to attend from ten till four said Gertrude who could not endure the idea that her husband should be ranked with common clerks like Fidus Neverbend Oh I didn t know said Lactimel meekly Perhaps Fidus only meant that as it is one of those offices where the people have something to do the commissioners couldn t be in their offices and in Parliament at the same time I did understand said Ugolina that Sir Gregory Hardlines had put his veto upon it but I must confess that it is a subject which I have not sufficiently studied to enable me It s Ltwelve hundred a year isn t it asked the bride Twelve hundred pounds a year said her mother a very serious consideration when there is no private fortune to back it on either side Now if it were Victoire He couldn t sit in Parliament ma because he s an alien only for that I shouldn t think of his doing anything else Perhaps that may be altered before long said Lactimel graciously If Jews are to be admitted said Ugolina who certainly belong to an alien nation a nation expressly set apart and separated from all people a peculiar nation distinct from all others I for one cannot discern What Ugolina could or could not discern about the Jews was communicated perhaps to Madame Jaquetanape or to Lactimel but not to Gertrude or to missus Val for the latter taking Gertrude apart into a corner as it were of the sofa began confidentially to repeat to her her fears about her husband I see my dear said she that you don t like my speaking about it Upon my word said Gertrude I am very indifferent about it But would it not be better if you said what you have to say to my husband I intend to do so I intend to do that also But I know that a wife ought to have influence over her husband and I believe that you have influence over yours Not the least said Gertrude who was determined to contradict missus Val in everything I am sorry to hear it said missus Val who among all her excellent acquirements did not possess that specially excellent one of understanding repartee I am very sorry to hear it and I shall certainly speak to him the more seriously on that account I think I have some influence over him at any rate I ought to have I dare say you have said Gertrude Alaric always says that no experience is worth anything that is not obtained by years missus Val at least understood this and continued her lecture with some additional severity Well my dear I am glad he has so much wisdom But what I was going to say is this you know how much we have at stake with mister Tudor what a very large sum of Clementina s money lies in his hands Now I really should not have consented to the arrangement had I thought it possible that mister Tudor would have given up his income with the idea of going into Parliament It wouldn t have been right or prudent of me to do so I have the greatest opinion of your husband s talents and judgement or I should not of course have entrusted him with the management of Clementina s fortune but I really shall think it right to make some change if this project of his goes on Why what is it you suspect said Gertrude Do you think that mister Tudor intends to use your daughter s income if he loses a portion of his own I never heard such a thing in my life Hush my dear gently I would not for worlds let Clementina hear a word of this it might disturb her young happiness She is so charmed with her husband her married life is so fortunate Victoire is so so so everything that we all wish that I would not for the world breathe in her hearing a shadow of a suspicion Good gracious missus Scott what do you mean Suspicion what suspicion Do you suspect my husband of robbing you Oh Gertrude poor Gertrude she was doomed to know it all before long Oh dear no said missus Val nothing of the kind I assure you Of course we suspect nothing of the sort But one does like to have one s money in safe hands Of course mister Tudor wouldn t have been chosen as trustee if he hadn t had a good income of his own and look here my dear and missus Val whispered very confidentially mister Tudor we all know is greatly concerned in this bridge that the committee is sitting about and he and my brother in law Undecimus are always dealing in shares Gentlemen do I know and therefore I don t say that there is anything against it But considering all I hope mister Tudor won t take it ill if we propose to change our trustee I am very certain he will not said Gertrude It is a laborious business and he will be glad enough to be rid of it When he was asked to accept it he thought it would be ill natured to refuse I am certain however he will be very glad to give up the work to any other person who may be appointed I will be sure to tell him this evening what you have said You need not trouble yourself to do that said missus Val I shall see him myself before long It will be no trouble said Gertrude very indignantly for she was very angry and had as she thought great cause for anger I shall certainly think it my duty to do so after what has passed Of course you will now take steps to relieve him as soon as possible You have taken me up a great deal too quick my dear said missus Val I did not intend Oh one can t be too quick on such a matter as this said Gertrude When confidence is once lost between two persons it is better that the connexion which has grown out of confidence should be put an end to as soon as possible Lost confidence I said nothing about lost confidence Alaric will so understand it I am quite sure at any rate I will tell him what you have said Suspicion indeed who has dared to suspect him of anything not honest or upright Gertrude s eyes flashed with anger as she vindicated her absent lord missus Val had been speaking with bated breath so that no one had heard her but she to whom she was speaking but Gertrude had been unable so to confine her answers and as she made her last reply Madame Jaquetanape and the Misses Neverbend were all ears Ha ha ha laughed missus Val Upon my word my dear it is amusing to hear you take it up However I assure you I meant nothing but what was kind and friendly Come Clementina we have been sitting here a most unconscionable time Will you allow me my dear to ring for my carriage Mamma said Clem have you asked missus Tudor to our little dance No my dear I have left that for you to do It s your party you know but I sincerely hope missus Tudor will come Oh yes said Clementina the tongue of whose eloquence was now loosened You must come missus Tudor indeed you must It will be so charming just a few nice people you know and nothing more Thank you said Gertrude but I never dance now She had inwardly resolved that nothing should ever induce her again to enter missus Val s house Oh but you must come said Clementina It will be so charming We only mean to dance one kind of dance that new thing they have just brought over from Spain the Contrabandista It is a polka step only very quick and you take every other turn by yourself so you have to take your partner up and let him go as quick as possible You don t know how charming it is and it will be all the rage We are to have the music out in the street just as they have in Spain It would be much too difficult for me said Gertrude It is difficult said the enthusiastic Clem but Victoire gives us lessons in it everyday from twelve to two doesn t he Ugolina I m afraid I shouldn t have time to go to school said Gertrude Oh it doesn t take much time six or seven or eight lessons will do it pretty well I have almost learnt it already and Ugolina is coming on very fast Lactimel is not quite so perfect She has learnt the step but she cannot bring herself to let Victoire go quick enough Do come and bring mister Tudor with you As he has not to attend from ten till four he could come and take lessons too said Lactimel who now that she was no longer a hanger on of Gertrude s could afford to have her little revenge That would be delightful said Clem mister Charles Tudor does come in sometimes at twelve o clock and I think he does it almost as well as Victoire Gertrude however would go neither to the rehearsals nor to the finished performance and as missus Val s men had by this time been induced to leave the beershop the whole party went away leaving Gertrude to her meditations CHAPTER XXXVI TICKLISH STOCK Alaric returned from his office worn and almost as wretched as he had been on the day before He had spent a miserable day In the morning Sir Gregory had asked him whether he had finally made up his mind to address the electors of Strathbogy No not finally said Alaric but I think I shall do so Then I must tell you Tudor said Sir Gregory speaking more in sorrow than in anger that you will not have my countenance I cannot but think also that you are behaving with ingratitude Alaric prepared to make some petulant answer but Sir Gregory in the meantime left the room Every one was falling away from him He felt inclined to rush after Sir Gregory and promise to be guided in this matter solely by him but his pride prevented him though he was no longer sanguine and confident as he had been a week ago still his ambition was high Those who play brag must brag it out or they will lose their money This had been said by Undy but it was not the less true on that account Alaric felt that he was playing brag and that his only game was to brag it out He walked home slowly through the Parks His office and house were so circumstanced that though they were some two miles distant he could walk from one to the other almost without taking his feet off the grass This had been the cause of great enjoyment to him but now he sauntered on with his hands behind his back staring straight before him with fixed eyes going by his accustomed route but never thinking for a moment where he was The time was gone when he could watch the gambols of children smile at the courtships of nursery maids watch the changes in the dark foliage of the trees and bend from his direct path hither and thither to catch the effects of distant buildings and make for his eye half rural landscapes in the middle of the metropolis No landscapes had beauty for him now the gambols even of his own baby were unattractive to him leaves might bud forth and nourish and fall without his notice How went the share market that was the only question that had an interest for him The dallyings of Capel Court were the only courtships that he now cared to watch And with what a terribly eager eye had he now to watch them If his shares went up quickly at once with an unprecedented success he might possibly be saved That was all But if they did not Such was the phase of life under which at the present moment it behoved him to exist And then when he reached his home how was he welcomed With all the fond love which a loving wife can show so much at least was his but before he had felt the sweetness of her caresses before he had acknowledged how great was the treasure that he possessed forth from her eager lips had come the whole tale of missus Val s impertinence I will never see her again Alaric never she talked of her daughter s money and said something of suspicion Suspicion Gertrude s eye again flashed fire with anger and she all but stamped with her little foot upon the ground Suspicion suspect him her husband the choice of her heart her Alaric the human god whom she worshipped suspect him of robbery her lord her heart her soul the strong staff on which she leaned so securely with such true feminine confidence Suspect him of common vile dishonesty You will never ask me to see her again will you Alaric What was he to say to her how was he to bear this His heart yearned to tell her all he longed for the luxury of having one bosom to whom he could entrust his misery his slight remaining hope But how could he himself at one blow by one word destroy the high and polished shaft on which she whom he loved had placed him He could not do it He would suffer by himself hope by himself cease to hope by himself and endure all till either his sufferings or his hopes should be over He had to pretend that he was indignant at missus Val s interference he had to counterfeit the feelings of outraged honour which was so natural to Gertrude This he failed to do well Had he been truly honest had that woman s suspicion really done him injustice he would have received his wife s tidings with grave displeasure and have simply resolved to acquit himself as soon as possible of the disagreeable trust which had been reposed in him But such was not now his conduct He contented himself by calling missus Val names and pretended to laugh at her displeasure But you will give up this trust won t you said Gertrude I will think about it said he Before I do anything I must consult old Figgs Things of that kind can t be put out of their course by the spleen of an old woman like missus Val Oh Alaric I do so wish you had had nothing to do with these Scotts So do I said he bitterly I hate them but Gertrude don t talk about them now my head aches and I am tired He sat at home the whole evening and though he was by no means gay and hardly affectionate in his demeanour to her yet she could not but feel that some good effect had sprung from his recent dislike to the Scotts since it kept him at home with her Lately he had generally spent his evenings at his club She longed to speak to him of his future career of his proposed seat in Parliament of his office work but he gave her no encouragement to speak of such things and as he pleaded that he was ill she left him in quiet on the sofa On the next morning he again went to his office and in the course of the morning a note was brought to him from Undy It ran as follows MY DEAR TUDOR Is Val to have the shares Let me have a line by the bearer Yours ever U S To this he replied by making an appointment to meet Undy before dinner at his own office At the time fixed Undy came and was shown by the sole remaining messenger into Alaric s private room The two shook hands together in their accustomed way Undy smiled good humouredly as he always did and Alaric maintained his usual composed and uncommunicative look Well said Undy sitting down how about those shares I am glad you have come said Alaric because I want to speak to you with some earnestness I am quite in earnest myself said Undy and so by G is Val I never saw a fellow more in earnest nor yet apparently more hard up I hope you have the shares ready or else a cheque for the amount Look here Undy if my doing this were the only means of saving both you and me from rotting in gaol by the Creator that made me I would not do it I don t know that it will have much effect upon me one way or the other said Undy coolly but it seems to me to be the only way that can save yourself from some such fate Shall I tell you what the clauses are of this new bill about trust property I know the clauses well enough I know my own position and I know yours also D your impudence said Undy how do you dare to league me with your villany Have I been the girl s trustee have I drawn or could I have drawn a shilling of her money I tell you Tudor you are in the wrong box You have one way of escape and one only I don t want to ruin you I ll save you if I can I think you have treated the girl in a most shameful way nevertheless I ll save you if I can but mark this if this money be not at once produced I cannot save you Alaric felt that he was covered with cold perspiration His courage did not fail him he would willingly have taken Undy by the throat could his doing so have done himself or his cause any good but he felt that he was nearly overset by the cool deep villany of his companion I have treated the girl badly very badly he said after a pause whether or no you have done so too I leave to your own conscience if you have a conscience I do not now mean to accuse you but you may know this for certain my present anxiety is to restore to her that which I have taken from her and for no earthly consideration not to save my own wife will I increase the deficiency Why man what nonsense you talk as if I did not know all the time that you have your pocket full of these shares Whatever I have I hold for her If I could succeed in getting out of your hands enough to make up the full sum that I owe her You will succeed in getting nothing from me When I borrowed Lfive thousand from you it was not understood that I was to be called upon for the money in three or four months time Now look here Scott you have threatened me with ruin and a prison and I will not say but your threats may possibly prove true It may be that I am ruined but if I fall you shall share my fall That s false said Undy I am free to hold my head before the world which you are not I have done nothing to bring me to shame Nothing to bring you to shame and yet you would now have me give you a further portion of this girl s money Nothing I care nothing about the girl s money I have not touched it nor do I want to touch it I bring you a message from my brother you have ample means of your own to comply with his request Then tell your brother said Alaric now losing all control over his temper tell your brother if indeed he have any part in this villany tell your brother that if it were to save me from the gallows he should not have a shilling I have done very badly in this matter I have acted shamefully and I am ashamed but Oh I want to hear none of your rhapsodies said Undy If you will not now do what I ask you I may as well go and you may take the consequences and he lifted his hat as though preparing to take his leave But you shall hear me said Alaric rising quickly from his seat and standing between Undy and the door Undy very coolly walked to the bell and rang it I have much to answer for continued Alaric but I would not have your sin on my soul I would not be as black as you are though by being so I could save myself with certainty from all earthly punishment As he finished the messenger opened the door Show mister Scott out said Alaric By by said Undy You will probably hear from missus Val and her daughter to morrow and so saying he walked jauntily along the passage and went jauntily to his dinner at his club It was part of his philosophy that nothing should disturb the even tenor of his way or interfere with his animal comforts He was at the present moment over head and ears in debt he was playing a game which in all human probability would end in his ruin the ground was sinking beneath his feet on every side and yet he thoroughly enjoyed his dinner Alaric could not make such use of his philosophy Undy Scott might be the worse man of the two but he was the better philosopher Not on the next day or on the next did Alaric hear from missus Val but on the following Monday he got a note from her begging him to call in Ebury Street She underscored every line of it once or twice and added in a postscript that he would she was sure at once acknowledge the NECESSITY of her request as she wished to communicate with him on the subject of her DAUGHTER S FORTUNE Alaric immediately sent an answer to her by a messenger My dear missus Scott said he I am very sorry that an engagement prevents my going to you this evening but as I judge by your letter and by what I have heard from Gertrude that you are anxious about this trust arrangement I will call at ten to morrow morning on my way to the office Having written and dispatched this he sat for an hour leaning with his elbows on the table and his hands clasped looking with apparent earnestness at the rows of books which stood inverted before him trying to make up his mind as to what step he should now take Not that he sat an hour undisturbed Every five minutes some one would come knocking at the door the name of some aspirant to the Civil Service would be brought to him or the card of some influential gentleman desirous of having a little job perpetrated in favour of his own peculiarly interesting but perhaps not very highly educated young candidate But on this morning Alaric would see no one to every such intruder he sent a reply that he was too deeply engaged at the present moment to see any one After one he would be at liberty c c And so he sat and looked at the books but he could in nowise make up his mind He could in nowise bring himself even to try to make up his mind that is to make any true effort towards doing so His thoughts would run off from him not into the happy outer world but into a multitude of noisy unpleasant paths all intimately connected with his present misery but none of which led him at all towards the conclusions at which he would fain arrive He kept on reflecting what Sir Gregory would think when he heard of it what all those clerks would say at the Weights and Measures among whom he had held his head so high what shouts there would be among the navvies and other low pariahs of the service how Harry Norman would exult but he did not yet know Harry Norman how the Woodwards would weep how Gertrude and then as he thought of that he bowed his head for he could no longer endure the open light of day At one o clock he was no nearer to any decision than he had been when he reached his office At three he put himself into a cab and was taken to the city Oh the city the weary city where men go daily to look for money but find none where every heart is eaten up by an accursed famishing after gold where dark gloomy banks come thick on each other like the black ugly apertures to the realms below in a mining district each of them a separate little pit mouth into hell Alaric went into the city and found that the shares were still rising That imperturbable witness was still in the chair at the committee and men said that he was disgusting the members by the impregnable endurance of his hostility A man who could answer twenty two fifty questions without admitting anything must be a liar Such a one could convince no one And so the shares went on rising rising and rising and Messrs Blocks Piles and Cofferdam were buying up every share either doing that openly or else selling on the sly Alaric found that he could at once realize Lseven thousand six hundred Were he to do this there would be at any rate seven eighths of his ward s fortune secure Might he not in such a case calculate that even missus Val s heart would be softened and that time would be allowed him to make up the small remainder Oh but in such case he must tell missus Val and could he calculate on her forbearance Might he not calculate with much more certainty on her love of triumphing Would he not be her slave if she had the keeping of his secret And why should he run so terrible a risk of destroying himself Why should he confide in missus Val and deprive himself of the power of ever holding up his head again when possibly he might still run out his course with full sails and bring his vessel into port giving no knowledge to the world of the perilous state in which she had been thus ploughing the deep He need not at any rate tell everything to missus Val at his coming visit on the morrow He consulted his broker with his easiest air of common concern as to his money and the broker gave him a dubious opinion They may go a little higher sir indeed I think they will But they are ticklish stock sir uncommon ticklish I should not like to hold many myself sir Alaric knew that the man was right they were ticklish stock but nevertheless he made up his mind to hold on a little longer He then got into another cab and went back to his office and as he went he began to bethink himself to whom of all his friends he might apply for such a loan as would enable him to make up this sum of money if he sold his shares on the morrow Captain Cuttwater was good for Lone thousand but he knew that he could not get more from him It would be bad borrowing he thought from Sir Gregory Intimate as he had been with that great man he knew nothing of his money concerns but he had always heard that Sir Gregory was a close man Sir Warwick his other colleague was in easy circumstances but then he had never been intimate with Sir Warwick Norman ah if he had known Norman now Norman would have pulled him through but hope in that quarter there was of course none Norman was gone and Norman s place had been filled by Undy Scott What could be done with Undy Scott he had already tried Fidus Neverbend he had a little money saved but Fidus was not the man to do anything without security He he Alaric Tudor he whose credit had stood did stand so high did not know where to borrow how to raise a thousand pounds and yet he felt that had he not wanted it so sorely he could have gotten it easily He was in a bad state for work when he got back to the office on that day He was flurried ill at ease wretched all but distracted nevertheless he went rigidly to it and remained there till late in the evening He was a man generally blessed with excellent health but now he suddenly found himself ill and all but unable to accomplish the task which he had prescribed to himself His head was heavy and his eyes weak and he could not bring himself to think of the papers which lay before him Then at last he went home and had another sad and solitary walk across the Parks during which he vainly tried to rally himself again and collect his energies for the work which he had to do It was in such emergencies as this that he knew that it most behoved a man to fall back upon what manliness there might be within him now was the time for him to be true to himself he had often felt proud of his own energy of purpose and now was the opportunity for him to use such energy if his pride in this respect had not been all in vain Such were the lessons with which he endeavoured to strengthen himself but it was in vain he could not feel courageous he could not feel hopeful he could not do other than despair When he got home he again prostrated himself again declared himself ill again buried his face in his hands and answered the affection of his wife by saying that a man could not always be cheerful could not always laugh Gertrude though she was very far indeed from guessing the truth felt that something extraordinary was the matter and knew that her husband s uneasiness was connected with the Scotts He came down to dinner and though he ate but little he drank glass after glass of sherry He thus gave himself courage to go out in the evening and face the world at his club He found Undy there as he expected but he had no conversation with him though they did not absolutely cut each other Alaric fancied that men stared at him and sat apart by himself afraid to stand up among talking circles or to put himself forward as it was his wont to do He himself avoided other men and then felt that others were avoiding him He took up one evening paper after another pretending to read them but hardly noticing a word that came beneath his eye at last however a name struck him which riveted his attention and he read the following paragraph which was among many others containing information as to the coming elections STRATHBOGY We hear that Lord Gaberlunzie s eldest son will retire from this borough and that his place will be filled by his brother the Honourable Captain Valentine Scott The family have been so long connected with Strathbogy by ties of friendship and near neighbourhood and the mutual alliance has been so much to the taste of both parties that no severance need be anticipated Alaric s first emotion was one of anger at the whole Scott tribe and his first resolve was to go down to Strathbogy and beat that inanimate fool Captain Val on his own ground but he was not long in reflecting that under his present circumstances it would be madness in him to bring his name prominently forward in any quarrel with the Scott family This disappointment he might at any rate bear it would be well for him if this were all He put the paper down with an affected air of easy composure and walked home through the glaring gas lights still trying to think still trying but in vain to come to some definite resolve And then on the following morning he went off to call on missus Val He had as yet told Gertrude nothing When she asked him what made him start so early he merely replied that he had business to do on his road As lie went he had considerable doubt whether or no it would be better for him to break his word to missus Val and not go near her at all In such event he might be sure that she would at once go to work and do her worst but nevertheless he would gain a day or probably two and one or two days might do all that he required whereas he could not see missus Val without giving her some explanation which if false would be discovered to be false and if true would be self condemnatory He again however failed to decide and at last knocked at missus Val s door merely because he found himself there He was shown up into the drawing room and found of course missus Val seated on a sofa and he also found which was not at all of course Captain Val on a chair on one side of the table and M Victoire Jaquetanape on the other missus Val shook hands with him much in her usual way but still with an air of importance in her face the Frenchman was delighted to see M Tudere and the Honourable Val got up from his chair said How do and then sat down again I requested you to call mister Tudor said missus Val opening her tale in a most ceremonious manner because we all think it necessary to know somewhat more than has yet been told to us of the manner in which my daughter s money has been invested Captain Val wiped his moustache with the middle finger of his right hand by way of saying that he quite assented to his wife s proposition and Victoire remarked that Madame was a leetle anxious just a leetle anxious not that anything could be wrong with M Tudere but because she was one excellent mamma I thought you knew missus Scott said Alaric that your daughter s money is in the funds Then I may understand clearly that none of the amount so invested has been sold out or otherwise appropriated by you said missus Val Will you allow me to inquire what has given rise to these questions just at the present moment asked Alaric Yes certainly said missus Val rumours have reached my husband rumours which I am happy to say I do not believe that my daughter s money has been used for purposes of speculation Whereupon Captain Val again wiped his upper lip but did not find it necessary to speak May I venture to ask Captain Scott from what source such rumours have reached him Ah ha what source d lies very likely d lies I dare say but people do talk eh you know so much the eloquent embryo member for Strathbogy vouchsafed And therefore mister Tudor you mustn t be surprised that we should ask you this question It is one simple simple question said Victoire and if M Tudere will say that it is all right I for myself will be satisfied The amiable Victoire to tell the truth was still quite satisfied to leave his wife s income in Alaric s hands and would not have been at all satisfied to remove it to the hands of his respected step papa in law or even his admired mamma in law When I undertook this trust said Alaric which I did with considerable hesitation I certainly did not expect to be subjected to any such cross examination as this I consider such questions as insults and therefore I shall refuse to answer them You missus Scott have of course a right to look after your daughter s interests as has M Jaquetanape to look after those of his wife but I will not acknowledge that Captain Scott has any such right whatsoever nor can I think that his conduct in this matter is disinterested and as he spoke he looked at Captain Val but he might just as well have looked at the door Captain Val only wiped his moustache with his finger once more My answer to your inquiries missus Scott is this I shall not condescend to go into any details as to Madame Jaquetanape s fortune with anyone but my company trustee I shall however on Saturday next be ready to give up my trust to any other person who may be legally appointed to receive it and will then produce all the property that has been entrusted to my keeping and so saying Alaric got up and took his hat as though to depart And do you mean to say mister Tudor that you will not answer my question said missus Scott I mean to say most positively that I will answer no questions said Alaric Oh confound not do at all d said the captain The girl s money all gone and you won t answer questions No shouted Alaric walking across the room till he closely confronted the captain No no I will answer no questions that may be asked in your hearing But that your wife s presence protects you I would kick you down your own stairs before me Captain Val retreated a step he could retreat no more and wiped his moustache with both hands at once missus Val screamed Victoire took hold of the back of a chair as though he thought it well that he should be armed in the general battle that was to ensue and Alaric without further speech walked out of the room and went away to his office So you have given up Strathbogy said Sir Gregory to him in the course of the day I think I have said Alaric considering all things I believe it will be the best for me to do so Not a doubt of it said Sir Gregory not a doubt of it my dear fellow and then Sir Gregory began to evince by the cordiality of his official confidence that he had fully taken Alaric back into his good graces It was nothing to him that Strathbogy had given up Alaric instead of Alaric giving up Strathbogy He was sufficiently pleased at knowing that the danger of his being supplanted by his own junior was over And then Alaric again went into the weary city again made inquiries about his shares and again returned to his office and thence to his home But on his return to his office he found lying on his table a note in Undy s handwriting but not signed in which he was informed that things would yet be well if the required shares should be forthcoming on the following day He crumpled the note tight in his hand and was about to fling it among the waste paper but in a moment he thought better of it and smoothing the paper straight he folded it and laid it carefully on his desk That day on his visit into the city he had found that the bridge shares had fallen to less than the value of their original purchase money and that evening he told Gertrude everything The author does not dare to describe the telling CHAPTER XXXVII TRIBULATION We must now return for a short while to Surbiton Cottage It was not so gay a place as it once had been merry laughter was not so often heard among the shrubbery walks nor was a boat to be seen so often glancing in and out between the lawn and the adjacent island The Cottage had become a demure staid abode of which Captain Cuttwater was in general the most vivacious inmate and yet there was soon to be marrying and giving in marriage Linda s wedding day had twice been fixed That first named had been postponed in consequence of the serious illness of Norman s elder brother The life of that brother had been very different in its course from Harry s it had been dissipated at college in riotous living and had since been stained with debauchery during the career of his early manhood in London The consequence had been that his health had been broken down and he was now tottering to an early grave Cuthbert Norman was found to be so ill when the day first named for Linda s marriage approached that it had been thought absolutely necessary to postpone the ceremony What amount of consolation missus Woodward might have received from the knowledge that her daughter by this young man s decease would become missus Norman of Normansgrove we need not inquire but such consolation if it existed at all did not tend to dispel the feeling of sombre disappointment which such delay was sure to produce The heir however rallied and another day early in August was fixed Katie the while was still an invalid and as such puzzled all the experience of that very experienced medical gentleman who has the best aristocratic practice in the neighbourhood of Hampton Court He and the London physician agreed that her lungs were not affected but yet she would not get well The colour would not come to her cheeks the flesh would not return to her arms nor the spirit of olden days shine forth in her eyes She did not keep her bed or confine herself to her room but she went about the house with a slow noiseless gentle tread so unlike the step of that Katie whom we once knew But that which was a mystery to the experienced medical gentleman was no mystery to her mother missus Woodward well knew why her child was no longer rosy plump and debonnaire As she watched her Katie move about so softly as she saw her constant attempt to smile whenever her mother s eye was on her that mother s heart almost gave way she almost brought herself to own that she would rather see her darling the wife of an idle ruined spendthrift than watch her thus drifting away to an early grave These days were by no means happy days for missus Woodward When that July day was fixed for Linda s marriage certain invitations were sent out to bid the family friends to the wedding These calls were not so numerous as they had been when Gertrude became a bride No Sir Gregory was to come down from town no gallant speech makers from London clubs were to be gathered there to wake the echoes of the opposite shore with matrimonial wit missus Woodward could not bear that her daughter should be married altogether as it were in the dark but for many considerations the guests were to be restricted in numbers and the mirth was to be restrained and quiet When the list was made out Katie saw it and saw that Charley s name was not there Mamma she said touching her mother s arm in her sweet winning way may not Charley come to Linda s wedding You know how fond Harry is of him would not Harry wish that he should be here missus Woodward s eyes immediately filled with tears and she looked at her daughter not knowing how to answer her She had never spoken to Katie of her love no word had ever passed between them on the subject which was now always nearest to the hearts of them both missus Woodward had much in her character as a mother that was excellent nay all but perfect but she could not bring herself to question her own children as to the inward secrets of their bosoms She knew not at once how to answer Katie s question and so she looked up at her with wistful eyes laden with tears You may do so mamma said Katie Katie was already a braver woman than her mother I think Harry would like it and poor Charley will feel hurt at being left out you may do it mamma if you like it will not do any harm missus Woodward quite understood the nature of the promise conveyed in her daughter s assurance and replied that Charley should be asked He was asked and promised of course to come But when the wedding was postponed when the other guests were put off he also was informed that his attendance at Hampton was not immediately required and so he still remained a stranger to the Cottage And then after a while another day was named the guests and Charley with them were again invited and Norman was again assured that he should be made happy But alas his hopes were again delusive News arrived at Surbiton Cottage which made it indispensable that the marriage should be again postponed news worse than any which had ever yet been received there news which stunned them all and made it clear to them that this year was no time for marrying Alaric had been arrested Alaric their own Gertrude s own husband their son in law and brother in law the proud the high the successful the towering man of the world Alaric had been arrested and was to be tried for embezzling the money of his ward These fatal tidings were brought to Hampton by Harry Norman himself how they were received we must now endeavour to tell But that it would be tedious we might describe the amazement with which that news was received at the Weights and Measures Though the great men at the Weights were jealous of Alaric they were not the less proud of him They had watched him rise with a certain amount of displeasure and yet they had no inconsiderable gratification in boasting that two of the Magi the two working Magi of the Civil Service had been produced by their own establishment When therefore tidings reached them that Tudor had been summoned in a friendly way to Bow Street that he had there passed a whole morning and that the inquiry had ended in his temporary suspension from his official duties and in his having to provide two bailsmen each for Lone thousand as security that he would on a certain day be forthcoming to stand his trial at the Old Bailey for defrauding his ward when I say these tidings were carried from room to room at the Weights and Measures the feelings of surprise were equalled by those of shame and disappointment No one knew who brought this news to the Weights and Measures No one ever does know how such tidings fly one of the junior clerks had heard it from a messenger to whom it had been told downstairs then another messenger who had been across to the Treasury Chambers with an immediate report as to a projected change in the size of the authorized butter firkin heard the same thing and so the news by degrees was confirmed But all this was not sufficient for Norman As soon as the rumour reached him he went off to Bow Street and there learnt the actual truth as it has been above stated Alaric was then there and the magistrates had decided on requiring bail he had in fact been committed It would be dreadful that the Woodwards should first hear all this from the lips of a stranger and this reflection induced Norman at once to go to Hampton but it was dreadful also to find himself burdened with the task of first telling such tidings When he found himself knocking at the Cottage door he was still doubtful how he might best go through the work he had before him He found that he had a partial reprieve but then it was so partial that it would have been much better for him to have had no such reprieve at all missus Woodward was at Sunbury with Linda and no one was at home but Katie What was he to do was he to tell Katie or was he to pretend that all was right that no special business had brought him unexpectedly to Hampton Oh Harry Linda will be so unhappy said Katie as soon as she saw him They have gone to dine at Sunbury and they won t be home till ten or eleven Uncle Bat dined early with me and he has gone to Hampton Court Linda will be so unhappy But good gracious Harry is there anything the matter missus Woodward has not heard from Gertrude to day has she No not a word Gertrude is not ill is she Oh do tell me said Katie who now knew that there was some misfortune to be told No Gertrude is not ill Is Alaric ill then Is there anything the matter with Alaric He is not ill said Norman but he is in some trouble I came down as I thought your mother should be told So much he said but would say no more In this he probably took the most unwise course that was open to him He might have held his tongue altogether and let Katie believe that love alone had brought him down as it had done so often before or he might have told her all feeling sure that all must be told her before long But he did neither he left her in suspense and the consequence was that before her mother s return she was very ill It was past eleven before the fly was heard in which Linda and her mother returned home Katie had then gone upstairs but not to bed She had seated herself in the armchair in her mother s dressing room and sitting there waited till she should be told by her mother what had occurred When the sound of the wheels caught her ears she came to the door of the room and held it in her hand that she might learn what passed She heard Linda s sudden and affectionate greeting she heard missus Woodward s expression of gratified surprise and then she heard also Norman s solemn tone by which as was too clear all joy all gratification was at once suppressed Then she heard the dining room door close and she knew that he was telling his tale to Linda and her mother O the misery of that next hour For an hour they remained there talking and Katie knew nothing of what they were talking she knew only that Norman had brought unhappiness to them all A dozen different ideas passed across her mind First she thought that Alaric was dismissed then that he was dead was it not possible that Harry had named Alaric s name to deceive her might not this misfortune whatever it was be with Charley might not he be dead Oh better so than the other She knew and said as much to herself over and over again but she did not the less feel that his death must involve her own also At last the dining room door opened and she heard her mother s step on the stairs Her heart beat so that she could hardly support herself She did not get up but sat quite quiet waiting for the tidings which she knew that she should now hear Her mother s face when she entered the room nearly drove her to despair missus Woodward had been crying bitterly violently convulsively crying and when one has reached the age of forty the traces of such tears are not easily effaced even from a woman s cheek Mamma mamma what is it pray pray tell me oh mamma what is it said Katie jumping up and rushing into her mother s arms Oh Katie said missus Woodward why are you not in bed Oh my darling I wish you were in bed I do so wish you were in bed my child my child and seating herself in the nearest chair missus Woodward again gave herself up to uncontrolled weeping Then Linda came up with the copious tears still streaming down her face She made no effort to control them at her age tears are the easiest resource in time of grief Norman had kept her back a moment to whisper one word of love and she then followed her mother into the room Katie was now kneeling at her mother s feet Linda she said with more quietness than either of the others was able to assume what has happened what makes mamma so unhappy Has anything happened to Alaric But Linda was in no state to tell anything Do tell me mamma said Katie do tell me all at once Has anything anything happened to to Charley Oh it is worse than that a thousand times worse than that said missus Woodward who in the agony of her own grief became for the instant ungenerous Katie s blood rushed back to her heart and for a moment her own hand relaxed the hold which she had on that of her mother She had never spoken of her love for her mother s sake she had been silent for her mother s sake she had determined to suffer and be silent now and ever Well she would bear this also It was but for a moment she relaxed her hold and then again she tightened her fingers round her mother s hand and held it in a firmer grasp It is Alaric then she said God forgive me said missus Woodward speaking through her sobs God forgive me I am a brokenhearted woman and say I know not what My Katie my darling my best of darlings will you forgive me Oh mamma said Katie kissing her mother s hands and her arms and the very hem of her garment oh mamma do not speak so But I wish I knew what this sorrow is so that I might share it with you may I not be told mamma is it about Alaric Yes Katie Alaric is in trouble What trouble is he ill No he is not ill It is about money Has he been arrested asked Katie thinking of Charley s misfortune Could not Harry get him out Harry is so good he would do anything even for Alaric when he is in trouble He will do everything for him that he can said Linda through her tears He has not been arrested said missus Woodward he is still at home but he is in trouble about Miss Golightly s money and and he is to be tried Tried said Katie tried like a criminal Katie might well express herself as horrified Yes he had to be tried like a criminal tried as pickpockets housebreakers and shoplifters are tried and for a somewhat similar offence with this difference however that pickpockets housebreakers and shoplifters are seldom educated men and are in general led on to crime by want He was to be tried for the offence of making away with some of Miss Golightly s money for his own purposes This was explained to Katie with more or less perspicuity and then Gertrude s mother and sisters lifted up their voices together and wept He might it is true be acquitted they would none of them believe him to be guilty though they all agreed that he had probably been imprudent but then the public shame of the trial the disgrace which must follow such an accusation What a downfall was here Oh Gertrude oh Gertrude sobbed missus Woodward and indeed at that time it did not fare well with Gertrude It was very late before missus Woodward and her daughters went to bed that night and then Katie though she did not specially complain was very ill She had lately received more than one wound which was still unhealed and now this additional blow though she apparently bore it better than the others altogether upset her When the morning came she complained of headache and it was many days after that before she left her bed But missus Woodward was up early Indeed she could hardly be said to have been in bed at all for though she had lain down for an hour or two she had not slept Early in the morning she knocked at Harry s door and begged him to come out to her He was not long in obeying her summons and soon joined her in the little breakfast parlour Harry said she you must go and see Alaric Harry s brow grew black On the previous evening he had spoken of Alaric without bitterness nay almost with affection of Gertrude he had spoken with the truest brotherly love he had assured missus Woodward that he would do all that was in his power for them that he would spare neither his exertions nor his purse He had a truer idea than she had of what might probably be the facts of the case and was prepared by all the means at his disposal to help his sister in law if such aid would help her But he had not thought of seeing Alaric I do not think it would do any good said he Yes Harry it will it will do the greatest good whom else can I get to see him who else can find out and let us know what really is required of us what we ought to do I would do it myself but I could not understand it and he would never trust us sufficiently to tell me all the truth We will make Charley go to him He will tell everything to Charley if he will to anyone We cannot trust Charley he is so thoughtless so imprudent Besides Harry I cannot tell everything to Charley as I can to you If there be any deficiency in this woman s fortune of course it must be made good and in that case I must raise the money I could not arrange all this with Charley There cannot I think be very much wanting said Norman who had hardly yet realized the idea that Alaric had actually used his ward s money for his own purposes He has probably made some bad investment or trusted persons that he should not have trusted My small property is in the funds and I can get the amount at a moment s notice I do not think there will be any necessity to raise more money than that At any rate whatever happens you must not touch your own income think of Katie But Harry dear good generous Harry you are so good so generous But Harry we need not talk of that now You will see him though won t you It will do no good said Harry we have no mutual trust in each other Do not be unforgiving Harry now that he requires forgiveness If he does require forgiveness missus Woodward if it shall turn out that he has been guilty God knows that I will forgive him I trust this may not be the case and it would be useless for me to thrust myself upon him now when a few days may replace us again in our present relations to each other I don t understand you Harry why should there always be a quarrel between two brothers between the husbands of two sisters I know you mean to be kind I know you are most kind most generous but why should you be so stern What I mean is this if I find him in adversity I shall be ready to offer him my hand it will then be for him to say whether he will take it But if the storm blow over in such case I would rather that we should remain as we are Norman talked of forgiveness and accused himself of no want of charity in this respect He had no idea that his own heart was still hard as the nether millstone against Alaric Tudor But yet such was the truth His money he could give he could give also his time and mind he could lend his best abilities to rescue his former friend and his own former love from misfortune He could do this and he thought therefore that he was forgiving but there was no forgiveness in such assistance There was generosity in it for he was ready to part with his money there was kindness of heart for he was anxious to do good to his fellow creature but there were with these both pride and revenge Alaric had out topped him in everything and it was sweet to Norman s pride that his hand should be the one to raise from his sudden fall the man who had soared so high above him Alaric had injured him and what revenge is so perfect as to repay gross injuries by great benefits Is it not thus that we heap coals of fire on our enemies heads Not that Norman indulged in thoughts such as these not that he resolved thus to gratify his pride thus to indulge his revenge He was unconscious of his own sin but he was not the less a sinner No said he I will not see him myself it will do no good missus Woodward found that it was useless to try to bend him That indeed she knew from a long experience It was then settled that she should go up to Gertrude that morning travelling up to town together with Norman and that when she had learned from her daughter or from Alaric if Alaric would talk to her about his concerns what was really the truth of the matter she should come to Norman s office and tell him what it would be necessary for him to do And then the marriage was again put off This in itself was a great misery as young ladies who have just been married or who may now be about to be married will surely own The words put off are easily written the necessity of such a put off is easily arranged in the pages of a novel an enforced delay of a month or two in an affair which so many folk willingly delay for so many years sounds like a slight thing but nevertheless a matrimonial put off is under any circumstances a great grief To have to counter write those halcyon notes which have given glad promise of the coming event to pack up and put out of sight and if possible out of mind the now odious finery with which the house has for the last weeks been strewed to give the necessary information to the pastry cook from whose counter the sad tidings will be disseminated through all the neighbourhood to annul the orders which have probably been given for rooms and horses for the happy pair to live during the coming interval a mark for Pity s unpitying finger to feel and know and hourly calculate how many slips there may be between the disappointed lip and the still distant cup all these things in themselves make up a great grief which is hardly lightened by the knowledge that they have been caused by a still greater grief These things had Linda now to do and the poor girl had none to help her in the doing of them A few hurried words were spoken on that morning between her and Norman and for the second time she set to work to put off her wedding Katie the meantime lay sick in bed and missus Woodward had gone to London to learn the worst and to do the best in this dire affliction that had come upon them CHAPTER XXXVIII ALARIC TUDOR TAKES A WALK There is undoubtedly a propensity in human love to attach itself to excellence but it has also as undoubtedly a propensity directly antagonistic to this and which teaches it to put forth its strongest efforts in favour of inferiority Watch any fair flock of children in which there may be one blighted bud and you will see that that blighted one is the mother s darling What filial affection is ever so strong as that evinced by a child for a parent in misfortune Even among the rough sympathies of schoolboys the cripple the sickly one or the orphan without a home will find the warmest friendship and a stretch of kindness Love that must bow and do reverence to superiority can protect and foster inferiority and what is so sweet as to be able to protect Gertrude s love for her husband had never been so strong as when she learnt that that love must now stand in the place of all other sympathies of all other tenderness Alaric told her of his crime and in his bitterness he owned that he was no longer worthy of her love She answered by opening her arms to him with more warmth than ever and bidding him rest his weary head upon her breast Had they not taken each other for better or for worse had not their bargain been that they would be happy together if such should be their lot or sad together if God should so will it and would she be the first to cry off from such a bargain It seldom happens that a woman s love is quenched by a man s crime Women in this respect are more enduring than men they have softer sympathies and less acute less selfish appreciation of the misery of being joined to that which has been shamed It was not many hours since Gertrude had boasted to herself of the honour and honesty of her lord and tossed her head with defiant scorn when a breath of suspicion had been muttered against his name Then she heard from his own lips the whole truth learnt that that odious woman had only muttered what she soon would have a right to speak out openly knew that fame and honour high position and pride of life were all gone and then in that bitter hour she felt that she had never loved him as she did then He had done wrong he had sinned grievously but no sooner did she acknowledge so much than she acknowledged also that a man may sin and yet not be all sinful that glory may be tarnished and yet not utterly destroyed that pride may get a fall and yet live to rise again He had sinned and had repented and now to her eyes he was again as pure as snow Others would now doubt him that must needs be the case but she would never doubt him no not a whit the more in that he had once fallen He should still be the cynosure of her eyes the pride of her heart the centre of her hopes Marina said of her lord when he came to her shattered in limb from the hands of the torturer I would not change My exiled mangled persecuted husband Alive or dead for prince or paladin In story or in fable with a world To back his suit Gertrude spoke to herself in the same language She would not have changed her Alaric branded with infamy as he now was or soon would be for the proudest he that carried his head high among the proud ones of the earth Such is woman s love such is the love of which a man s heart is never capable Alaric s committal had taken place very much in the manner in which it was told at the Weights and Measures He had received a note from one of the Bow Street magistrates begging his attendance in the private room at the police office There he had passed nearly the whole of one day and he was also obliged to pass nearly the whole of another in the same office On this second day the proceedings were not private and he was accompanied by his own solicitor It would be needless to describe how a plain case was as usual made obscure by the lawyers how Acts of Parliament were consulted how the magistrate doubted how indignant Alaric s attorney became when it was suggested that some insignificant piece of evidence should be admitted which whether admitted or rejected could have no real bearing on the case In these respects this important examination was like other important examinations of the same kind such as one sees in the newspapers whenever a man above the ordinary felon s rank becomes amenable to the outraged laws It ended however in Alaric being committed and giving bail to stand his trial in about a fortnight s time and in his being assured by his attorney that he would most certainly be acquitted That bit of paper on which he had made an entry that certain shares bought by him had been bought on behalf of his ward would save him so said the attorney to which however Alaric answered not much Could any acutest lawyer let him be made of never so fine an assortment of forensic indignation now whitewash his name and set him again right before the world He of course communicated with Sir Gregory and agreed to be suspended from his commissionership till the trial should be over His two colleagues then became bail for him So much having been settled he got into a cab with his attorney and having dropped that gentleman on the road he returned home The excitement of the examination and the necessity for action had sustained him but now what was to sustain him now How was he to get through the intervening fortnight banished as he was from his office from his club and from all haunts of men His attorney who had other rogues to attend to besides him made certain set appointments with him and for the rest he might sit at home and console himself as best he might with his own thoughts Excelsior This was the pass to which Excelsior had brought Sic itur ad astro Alas his road had taken him hitherto in quite a different direction He sent for Charley and when Charley came he made Gertrude explain to him what had happened He had confessed his own fault once to his own wife and he could not bring himself to do it again Charley was thunderstruck at the greatness of the ruin but he offered what assistance he could give Anything that he could do he would Alaric had sent for him for a purpose and that purpose at any rate Charley could fulfil He went into the city to ascertain what was now the price of the Limehouse bridge shares and returned with the news that they were falling falling falling No one else called at Alaric s door that day missus Val though she did not come there by no means allowed her horses to be idle she went about sedulously among her acquaintance dropping tidings of her daughter s losses They will have enough left to live upon thank God said she but did you ever hear of so barefaced so iniquitous a robbery Well I am not cruel but my own opinion is that he should certainly be hanged To this Ugolina assented fully adding that she had been so shocked by the suddenness and horror of the news as to have become perfectly incapacitated ever since for any high order of thought Lactimel whose soft bosom could not endure the idea of putting an end to the life of a fellow creature suggested perpetual banishment to the penal colonies perhaps Norfolk Island And what will she do said Lactimel Indeed I cannot guess said Ugolina her education has been sadly deficient None but Charley called on Alaric that day and he found himself shut up alone with his wife and child His own house seemed to him a prison He did not dare to leave it he did not dare to walk out and face the public as long as daylight continued he was ashamed to show himself and so he sat alone in his dining room thinking thinking thinking Do what he would he could not get those shares out of his mind they had entered like iron into his soul as poison into his blood they might still rise they might yet become of vast value might pay all his debts and enable him to begin again And then this had been a committee day he had had no means of knowing how things had gone there of learning the opinions of the members of whispering to mister Piles or hearing the law on the matter laid down by the heavy deep voice of the great mister Blocks And so he went on thinking thinking thinking but ever as though he had a clock weight fixed to his heart and pulling at its strings For after all what were the shares or the committee to him Let the shares rise to ever so fabulous a value let the Chancellor of the Exchequer be ever so complaisant in giving away his money what avail would it be to him what avail now He must stand his trial for the crime of which he had been guilty With the utmost patience Gertrude endeavoured to soothe him and to bring his mind into some temper in which it could employ itself She brought him their baby thinking that he would play with his child but all that he said was My poor boy I have ruined him already and then turning away from the infant he thrust his hands deep into his trousers pockets and went on calculating about the shares When the sun had well set and the daylight had at last dwindled out he took up his hat and wandered out among the new streets and rows of houses which lay between his own house and the Western Railway He got into a district in which he had never been before and as he walked about here he thought of the fate of other such swindlers as himself yes though he did not speak the word he pronounced it as plainly and as often in the utterance of his mind as though it was being rung out to him from every steeple in London he thought of the fate of such swindlers as himself how one had been found dead in the streets poisoned by himself how another after facing the cleverest lawyers in the land was now dying in a felon s prison how a third had vainly endeavoured to fly from justice by aid of wigs false whiskers painted furrows and other disguises Should he try to escape also and avoid the ignominy of a trial He knew it would be in vain he knew that at this moment he was dogged at the distance of some thirty yards by an amiable policeman in mufti placed to watch his motions by his two kind bailsmen who preferred this small expense to the risk of losing a thousand pounds a piece As he turned short round a corner into the main road leading from the railway station to Bayswater he came close upon a man who was walking quickly in the opposite direction and found himself face to face with Undy Scott How on earth should Undy Scott have come out there to Bayswater at that hour of the night he the constant denizen of clubs the well known frequenter of Pall Mall the member for the Tillietudlem burghs whose every hour was occupied in the looking after things political or things commercial Who could have expected him in a back road at Bayswater There however he was and Alaric before he knew of his presence had almost stumbled against him Scott said Alaric starting back Hallo Tudor what the deuce brings you here but I suppose you ll ask me the same question said Undy Alaric Tudor could not restrain himself You scoundrel said he seizing Undy by the collar you utterly unmitigated scoundrel You premeditated wilful villain and he held Undy as though he intended to choke him But Undy Scott was not a man to be thus roughly handled with impunity and in completing the education which he had received the use of his fists had not been overlooked He let out with his right hand and struck Alaric twice with considerable force on the side of his jaw so that the teeth rattled in his mouth But Alaric at the moment hardly felt it You have brought me and mine to ruin said he you have done it purposely like a fiend But low as I have fallen I would not change places with you for all that the earth holds I have been a villain but such villany as yours ugh and so saying he flung his enemy from him and Undy tottering back saved himself against the wall In a continued personal contest between the two men Undy would probably have had the best of it for he would certainly have been the cooler of the two and was also the more skilful in such warfare but he felt in a moment that he could gain nothing by thrashing Tudor whereas he might damage himself materially by having his name brought forward at the present moment in connexion with that of his old friend You reprobate said he preparing to pass on it has been my misfortune to know you and one cannot touch pitch and not be defiled But thank God you ll come by your deserts now If you will take my advice you ll hang yourself and so they parted The amiable policeman in mufti remained at a convenient distance during this little interview having no special mission to keep the peace pending his present employment but as he passed by he peered into Undy s face and recognized the honourable member for the Tillietudlem burghs A really sharp policeman knows every one of any note in London It might perhaps be useful that evidence should be given at the forthcoming trial of the little contest which we have described If so our friend in mufti was prepared to give it On the following morning at about eleven a cab drove up to the door and Alaric standing at the dining room window saw missus Woodward get out of it There s your mother said Alaric to his wife I will not see her let her go up to the drawing room Oh Alaric will you not see mamma How can I with my face swollen as it is now Besides what would be the good What can I say to her I know well enough what she has to say to me without listening to it Dear Alaric mamma will say nothing to you that is not kind do see her for my sake Alaric But misery had not made him docile He merely turned from her and shook his head impatiently Gertrude then ran out to welcome her mother who was in the hall And what a welcoming it was Come upstairs mamma come into the drawing room said Gertrude who would not stop even to kiss her mother till they found themselves secured from the servants eyes She knew that one word of tenderness would bring her to the ground Mamma mamma she almost shrieked and throwing herself into her mother s arms wept convulsively missus Woodward wanted no more words to tell her that Alaric had been guilty But Gertrude how much is it whispered the mother as after a few moments of passionate grief they sat holding each other s hands on the sofa How much money is wanting Can we not make it up If it be all paid before the day of trial will not that do will not that prevent it Gertrude could not say She knew that Lten thousand had been abstracted missus Woodward groaned as she heard the sum named But then there were those shares which had not long since been worth much more than half that sum which must still be worth a large part of it But we must know dearest before Harry can do anything said missus Woodward Gertrude blushed crimson when Harry Norman s name was mentioned And had it come to that that they must look to him for aid Can you not ask him love said missus Woodward I saw him in the dining room go and ask him when he knows that we are doing our best for him surely he will help us Gertrude with a heavy heart went down on her message and did not return for fifteen or twenty minutes It may easily be conceived that Norman s name was not mentioned between her and her husband but she made him understand that an effort would be made for him if only the truth could be ascertained It will be of no use said he Don t say so Alaric we cannot tell what may be of use But at any rate it will be weight off your heart to know that this money has been paid It is that which overpowers you now and not your own misfortune At last he suffered her to lead him and she put down on paper such figures as he dictated to her It was however impossible to say what was the actual deficiency that must depend upon the present value of the shares these he said he was prepared to give over to his own attorney if it was thought that by so doing he should be taking the best steps towards repairing the evil he had done and then he began calculating how much the shares might possibly be worth and pointing out under what circumstances they should be sold and under what again they should be overheld till the market had improved All this was worse than Greek to Gertrude but she collected what facts she could and then returned to her mother And they discussed the matter with all the wit and all the volubility which women have on such occasions Paper was brought forth and accounts were made out between them not such as would please the eyes of a Civil Service Examiner but yet accurate in their way How they worked and racked their brains and strained their women s nerves in planning how justice might be defeated and the dishonesty of the loved one covered from shame Uncle Bat was ready with his share He had received such explanation as missus Woodward had been able to give and though when he first heard the news he had spoken severely of Alaric still his money should be forthcoming for the service of the family He could produce some fifteen hundred pounds and would if needs be that he should do so Then Harry but the pen fell from Gertrude s fingers as she essayed to write down Harry Norman s contribution to the relief of her husband s misery Remember Gertrude love in how short a time he will be your brother But when will it be mamma Is it to be on Thursday as we had planned Of course mamma I cannot be there And then there was a break in their accounts and missus Woodward explained to Gertrude that they had all thought it better to postpone Linda s marriage till after the trial and this of course was the source of fresh grief When men such as Alaric Tudor stoop to dishonesty the penalties of detection are not confined to their own hearthstone The higher are the branches of the tree and the wider the greater will be the extent of earth which its fall will disturb Gertrude s pen however again went to work The shares were put down at Lfive thousand If they can only be sold for so much I think we may manage it said missus Woodward I am sure that Harry can get the remainder indeed he said he could have more than that And what will Linda do Linda will never want it love and if she did what of that would she not give all she has for you And then missus Woodward went her way to Norman s office without having spoken to Alaric You will come again soon mamma said Gertrude missus Woodward promised that she would And mamma and she whispered close into her mother s ear as she made her next request and mamma you will be with me on that day We need not follow Norman in his efforts to have her full fortune restored to Madame Jaquetanape He was daily in connexion with Alaric s lawyer and returned sometimes with hope and sometimes without it missus Val s lawyer would receive no overtures towards a withdrawal of the charge or even towards any mitigation in their proceedings unless the agent coming forward on behalf of the lady s late trustee did so with the full sum of Ltwenty thousand in his hands We need not follow Charley who was everyday with Alaric and who was unknown to Alaric an agent between him and Norman Well Charley what are they doing to day was Alaric s constant question to him even up to the very eve of his trial If any spirit ever walks it must be that of the stockjobber for how can such a one rest in its grave without knowing what shares are doing CHAPTER XXXIX 
7307-276146-0000	train-other-500	THE LAST BREAKFAST And that day was not long in coming indeed it came with terrible alacrity much too quickly for Gertrude much too quickly for Norman and much too quickly for Alaric s lawyer
7307-276146-0001	train-other-500	To Alaric only did the time pass slowly for he found himself utterly without employment
none	none	 Norman and Uncle Bat between them had raised something about Lsix thousand but when the day came on which they were prepared to dispose of the shares 
7307-276146-0002	train-other-500	the Limehouse bridge was found to be worth nothing They were as the broker had said ticklish stock so ticklish that no one would have them at any price
none	none	 When Undy together with his agent from Tillietudlem 
7307-276146-0003	train-other-500	went into the market about the same time to dispose of theirs they were equally unsuccessful How the agent looked and spoke and felt may be imagined for the agent had made large advances and had no other security
7307-276146-0004	train-other-500	but Undy had borne such looks and speeches before and merely said that it was very odd extremely odd he had been greatly deceived by mister Piles mister Piles also said it was very odd
none	none	 but he did not appear to be nearly so much annoyed as the agent from Tillietudlem 
7307-276146-0005	train-other-500	and it was whispered that queer as things now looked Messrs Blocks Piles and Cofferdam had not made a bad thing of the bridge Overture after overture was made to the lawyer employed by missus Val s party
none	none	 Norman first offered the Lsix thousand and the shares 
7307-276146-0006	train-other-500	then when the shares were utterly rejected by the share buying world he offered to make himself personally responsible for the remainder of the debt and to bind himself by bond to pay it within six months
7307-276146-0007	train-other-500	At first these propositions were listened to and Alaric s friends were led to believe that the matter would be handled in such a way that the prosecution would fall to the ground But at last all composition was refused
7307-276146-0008	train-other-500	The adverse attorney declared first that he was not able to accept any money payment short of the full amount with interest and then he averred that as criminal proceedings had been taken they could not now be stayed
7307-276146-0009	train-other-500	Whether or no Alaric s night attack had anything to do with this whether Undy had been the means of instigating this rigid adherence to justice we are not prepared to say
7307-276146-0010	train-other-500	That day for which Gertrude had prayed her mother s assistance came all too soon They had become at last aware that the trial must go on Charley was with them on the last evening and completed their despair
7307-276146-0011	train-other-500	by telling them that their attorney had resolved to make no further efforts at a compromise Perhaps the most painful feeling to Gertrude through the whole of the last fortnight had been the total prostration of her husband s energy
7307-276146-0012	train-other-500	and almost of his intellect he seemed to have lost the power of judging for himself and of thinking and deciding what conduct would be best for him in his present condition He who had been so energetic so full of life
7307-276146-0013	train-other-500	so ready for all emergencies so clever at devices so able to manage not only for himself but for his friends
none	none	 he was as it were paralysed and unmanned 
7307-276146-0014	train-other-500	He sat from morning to night looking at the empty fire grate and hardly ventured to speak of the ordeal that he had to undergo His lawyer was to call for him on the morning of the trial
7307-276146-0015	train-other-500	and missus Woodward was to be at the house soon after he had left it He had not yet seen her since the inquiry had commenced and it was very plain that he did not wish to do so missus Woodward was to be there and to remain till his fate had been decided and then
none	none	 Not a word had yet been said as to the chance of his not returning 
7307-276146-0016	train-other-500	but missus Woodward was aware that he would probably be unable to do so and felt that if such should be the case she could not leave her daughter alone And so Alaric and his wife sat down to breakfast on that last morning
7307-276146-0017	train-other-500	She had brought their boy down but as she perceived that the child s presence did not please his father he had been sent back to the nursery and they were alone She poured out his tea for him put bread upon his plate
7307-276146-0018	train-other-500	and then sat down close beside him endeavouring to persuade him to eat She had never yet found fault with him
none	none	 she had never even ventured to give him counsel 
7307-276146-0019	train-other-500	but now she longed to entreat him to collect himself and take a man s part in the coming trial He sat in the seat prepared for him but instead of eating he thrust his hands after his accustomed manner into his pockets
7307-276146-0020	train-other-500	and sat glowering at the teacups
none	none	 Come Alaric 
7307-276146-0021	train-other-500	won t you eat your breakfast said she No
none	none	 breakfast no how can I eat now how can you think that I could eat at such a time as this 
7307-276146-0022	train-other-500	Do you take yours never mind me But dearest you will be faint if you do not eat think what you have to go through remember how many eyes will be on you to day He shuddered violently as she spoke
7307-276146-0023	train-other-500	and motioned to her with his hand not to go on with what she was saying I know I know said she passionately dearest dearest love I know how dreadful it is would that I could bear it for you would that I could
7307-276146-0024	train-other-500	He turned away his head for a tear was in his eye It was the first that had come to his assistance since this sorrow had come upon him Don t turn from me dearest Alaric do not turn from me now at our last moments
7307-276146-0025	train-other-500	To me at least you are the same noble Alaric that you ever were Noble said he with all the self scorn which he so truly felt To me you are now as ever
7307-276146-0026	train-other-500	but Alaric I do so fear that you will want strength physical strength you know to go through all this I would have you bear yourself like a man before them all It will be but little matter said he
none	none	 It will be matter It will be matter to me 
7307-276146-0027	train-other-500	My darling darling husband rouse yourself and she knelt before his knees and prayed to him for my sake do it eat and drink that you may have the power of a man when all the world is looking at you
7307-276146-0028	train-other-500	If God forgives us our sins surely we should so carry ourselves that men may not be ashamed to do so He did not answer her but he turned to the table and broke the bread and put his lips to the cup
7307-276146-0029	train-other-500	And then she gave him food as she would give it to a child and he with a child s obedience ate and drank what was put before him As he did so every now and again a single tear forced itself beneath his eyelid
7307-276146-0030	train-other-500	and trickled down his face and in some degree Gertrude was comforted He had hardly finished his enforced breakfast when the cab and the lawyer came to the door
7307-276146-0031	train-other-500	The learned gentleman had the good taste not to come in and so the servant told them that mister Gitemthruet was there Say that your master will be with him in a minute said Gertrude quite coolly
7307-276146-0032	train-other-500	and then the room door was again closed and the husband and wife had now to say adieu Alaric rose from his chair and made a faint attempt to smile Well Gertrude said he it has come at last
7307-276146-0033	train-other-500	She rushed into his embrace and throwing her arms around him buried her face upon his breast
none	none	 Alaric Alaric my husband

7307-276146-0035	train-other-500	but still holding him and looking up earnestly into his face See you and then she poured out her love with all the passion of a Ruth Whither thou goest I will go and where thou lodgest I will lodge
none	none	 Where thou diest will I die 
7307-276146-0036	train-other-500	and there will I be buried the Lord do so to me and more also if aught but death part thee and me See you Alaric oh it cannot be that they will hinder the wife from being with her husband But Alaric she went on
7307-276146-0037	train-other-500	do not droop now love will you I cannot brazen it out said he I know too well what it is that I have done No not that Alaric I would not have that But remember all is not over whatever they may do

none	none	 You have repented have you not Alaric 
7307-276146-0039	train-other-500	I think so I hope so said Alaric with his eyes upon the ground You have repented and are right before God do not fear then what man can do to you I would not have you brazen Alaric but be manly
7307-276146-0040	train-other-500	be collected be your own self the man that I have loved the man that I do now love so well better better than ever and she threw herself on him and kissed him and clung to him and stroked his hair
7307-276146-0041	train-other-500	and put her hand upon his face and then holding him from her looked up to him as though he were a hero whom she all but worshipped Gertrude Gertrude
none	none	 that I should have brought you to this 
7307-276146-0042	train-other-500	Never mind said she we will win through it yet we will yet be happy together far far away from here remember that let that support you through all And now Alaric you will come up for one moment and kiss him before you go

7307-276146-0044	train-other-500	And she took him by the hand and led him like a child into the nursery Where is the nurse bring him here papa is going away Alley boy give papa a big kiss
7307-276146-0045	train-other-500	Alaric for the first time for the fortnight took the little fellow into his arms and kissed him God bless you my bairn said he and grant that all this may never be visited against you here or hereafter
7307-276146-0046	train-other-500	And now go said Gertrude as they descended the stairs together and may God in His mercy watch over and protect you and give you back to me

7307-276146-0048	train-other-500	Now one kiss oh dearest dearest Alaric there there now go And so he went
none	none	 and Gertrude shutting herself into her room threw herself on to the bed and wept aloud CHAPTER XL mister CHAFFANBRASS We must now follow Alaric to his trial He was of course much too soon at court All people always are who are brought to the court perforce criminals for instance and witnesses and other such like unfortunate wretches whereas many of those who only go there to earn their bread are very often as much too late He was to be tried at the Old Bailey As I have never seen the place and as so many others have seen it I will not attempt to describe it Here mister Gitemthruet was quite at home he hustled and jostled elbowed and ordered as though he were the second great man of the place and the client whom he was to defend was the first In this latter opinion he was certainly right Alaric was the hero of the day and people made way for him as though he had won a victory in India and was going to receive the freedom of the city in a box As he passed by a gleam of light fell on him from a window and at the instant three different artists had him photographed daguerreotyped and bedevilled four graphic members of the public press took down the details of his hat whiskers coat trousers and boots and the sub editor of the Daily Delight observed that there was a slight tremor in the first footstep which he took within the precincts of the prison but in every other respect his demeanour was dignified and his presence manly he had light brown gloves one of which was on his left hand but the other was allowed to swing from his fingers The court was extremely crowded and some fair ladies appeared there to grace its customarily ungracious walls On the bench we observed Lord Killtime Sir Gregory Hardlines and mister Whip Vigil mister Undecimus Scott who had been summoned as a witness by the prisoner was also accommodated by the sheriffs with a seat Such was the opening paragraph of the seven columns which were devoted by the Daily Delight to the all absorbing subject But mister Gitemthruet made his way through artists reporters and the agitated crowd with that happy air of command which can so easily be assumed by men at a moment s notice when they feel themselves to be for that moment of importance Come this way mister Tudor follow me and we will get on without any trouble just follow me close said mister Gitemthruet to his client in a whisper which was audible to not a few Tudor who was essaying and not altogether unsuccessfully to bear the public gaze undismayed did as he was bid and followed mister Gitemthruet Now said the attorney we ll sit here mister Chaffanbrass will be close to us there so that I can touch him up as we go along of course you know you can make any suggestion only you must do it through me Here s his lordship uncommon well he looks don t he You d hardly believe him to be seventy seven but he s not a day less if he isn t any more and he has as much work in him yet as you or I pretty nearly If you want to insure a man s life mister Tudor put him on the bench then he ll never die We lawyers are not like bishops who are always for giving up and going out on a pension But Alaric was not at the moment inclined to meditate much on the long years of judges He was thinking or perhaps trying to think whether it would not be better for him to save this crowd that was now gathered together all further trouble and plead guilty at once He knew he was guilty he could not understand that it was possible that any juryman should have a doubt about it he had taken the money that did not belong to him that would be made quite clear he had taken it and had not repaid it there was the absolute corpus delicti in court in the shape of a deficiency of some thousands of pounds What possible doubt would there be in the breast of anyone as to his guilt Why should he vex his own soul by making himself for a livelong day the gazing stock for the multitude Why should he trouble all those wigged counsellors when one word from him would set all at rest mister Gitemthruet I think I ll plead guilty said he Plead what said mister Gitemthruet turning round upon his client with a sharp angry look It was the first time that his attorney had shown any sign of disgust displeasure or even disapprobation since he had taken Alaric s matter in hand Plead what Ah you re joking I know upon my soul you gave me a start Alaric endeavoured to explain to him that he was not joking nor in a mood to joke but that he really thought the least vexatious course would be for him to plead guilty Then I tell you it would be the most vexatious proceeding ever I heard of in all my practice But you are in my hands mister Tudor and you can t do it You have done me the honour to come to me and now you must be ruled by me Plead guilty Why with such a case as you have got you would disgrace yourself for ever if you did so Think of your friends mister Tudor if you won t think of me or of yourself His lawyer s eloquence converted him and he resolved that he would run his chance During this time all manner of little legal preliminaries had been going on and now the court was ready for business the jury were in their box the court keeper cried silence and mister Gitemthruet was busy among his papers with frantic energy But nothing was yet seen of the great mister Chaffanbrass I believe we may go on with the trial for breach of trust said the judge I do not know why we are waiting Then up and spoke mister Younglad who was Alaric s junior counsel mister Younglad was a promising common law barrister now commencing his career of whom his friends were beginning to hope that he might if he kept his shoulders well to the collar at some distant period make a living out of his profession He was between forty and forty five years of age and had already overcome the natural diffidence of youth in addressing a learned bench and a crowded court My lud said Younglad my learned friend mister Chaffanbrass who leads for the prisoner is not yet in court Perhaps my lud on behalf of my client I may ask for a few moments delay And if mister Chaffanbrass has undertaken to lead for the prisoner why is he not in court said the judge looking as though he had uttered a poser which must altogether settle mister Younglad s business But mister Younglad had not been sitting and walking and listening let alone talking occasionally in criminal courts for the last twenty years to be settled so easily My lud if your ludship will indulge me with five minutes delay we will not ask more than five minutes your ludship knows no one better the very onerous duties When I was at the bar I took no briefs to which I could not attend said the judge I am sure you did not my lud and my learned friend should he ever sit in your ludship s seat will be able to say as much for himself when at some future time he may be but my lud mister Chaffanbrass is now in court And as he spoke mister Chaffanbrass carrying in his hand a huge old blue bag which as he entered he took from his clerk s hands and bearing on the top of his head a wig that apparently had not been dressed for the last ten years made his way in among the barristers caring little on whose toes he trod whose papers he upset or whom he elbowed on his road mister Chaffanbrass was the cock of this dunghill and well he knew how to make his crowing heard there And now pray let us lose no more time said the judge My lord if time has been lost through me I am very sorry but if your lordship s horse had fallen down in the street as mine did just now My horse never falls down in the street mister Chaffanbrass Some beasts my lord can always keep their legs under them and others can t and men are pretty much in the same condition I hope the former may be the case with your lordship and your lordship s cob for many years The judge knowing of old that nothing could prevent mister Chaffanbrass from having the last word now held his peace and the trial began There are not now too many pages left to us for the completion of our tale but nevertheless we must say a few words about mister Chaffanbrass He was one of an order of barristers by no means yet extinct but of whom it may be said that their peculiarities are somewhat less often seen than they were when mister Chaffanbrass was in his prime He confined his practice almost entirely to one class of work the defence namely of culprits arraigned for heavy crimes and in this he was if not unrivalled at least unequalled Rivals he had who thick as the skins of such men may be presumed to be not unfrequently writhed beneath the lashes which his tongue could inflict To such a perfection had he carried his skill and power of fence so certain was he in attack so invulnerable when attacked that few men cared to come within the reach of his forensic flail To the old stagers who were generally opposed to him the gentlemen who conducted prosecutions on the part of the Crown and customarily spent their time and skill in trying to hang those marauders on the public safety whom it was the special business of mister Chaffanbrass to preserve unhung to these he was if not civil at least forbearing but when any barrister who was comparatively a stranger to him ventured to oppose him there was no measure to his impudent sarcasm and offensive sneers Those however who most dreaded mister Chaffanbrass and who had most occasion to do so were the witnesses A rival lawyer could find a protection on the bench when his powers of endurance were tried too far but a witness in a court of law has no protection He comes there unfeed without hope of guerdon to give such assistance to the State in repressing crime and assisting justice as his knowledge in this particular case may enable him to afford and justice in order to ascertain whether his testimony be true finds it necessary to subject him to torture One would naturally imagine that an undisturbed thread of clear evidence would be best obtained from a man whose position was made easy and whose mind was not harassed but this is not the fact to turn a witness to good account he must be badgered this way and that till he is nearly mad he must be made a laughingstock for the court his very truths must be turned into falsehoods so that he may be falsely shamed he must be accused of all manner of villany threatened with all manner of punishment he must be made to feel that he has no friend near him that the world is all against him he must be confounded till he forget his right hand from his left till his mind be turned into chaos and his heart into water and then let him give his evidence What will fall from his lips when in this wretched collapse must be of special value for the best talents of practised forensic heroes are daily used to bring it about and no member of the Humane Society interferes to protect the wretch Some sorts of torture are as it were tacitly allowed even among humane people Eels are skinned alive and witnesses are sacrificed and no one s blood curdles at the sight no soft heart is sickened at the cruelty To apply the thumbscrew the boot and the rack to the victim before him was the work of mister Chaffanbrass s life And it may be said of him that the labour he delighted in physicked pain He was as little averse to this toil as the cat is to that of catching mice And indeed he was not unlike a cat in his method of proceeding for he would as it were hold his prey for a while between his paws and pat him with gentle taps before he tore him He would ask a few civil little questions in his softest voice glaring out of his wicked old eye as he did so at those around him and then when he had his mouse well in hand out would come his envenomed claw and the wretched animal would feel the fatal wound in his tenderest part Mankind in general take pleasure in cruelty though those who are civilized abstain from it on principle On the whole mister Chaffanbrass is popular at the Old Bailey Men congregate to hear him turn a witness inside out and chuckle with an inward pleasure at the success of his cruelty This mister Chaffanbrass knows and like an actor who is kept up to his high mark by the necessity of maintaining his character he never allows himself to grow dull over his work Therefore mister Chaffanbrass bullies when it is quite unnecessary that he should bully it is a labour of love and though he is now old and stiff in his joints though ease would be dear to him though like a gladiator satiated with blood he would as regards himself be so pleased to sheathe his sword yet he never spares himself He never spares himself and he never spares his victim As a lawyer in the broad and high sense of the word it may be presumed that mister Chaffanbrass knows little or nothing He has indeed no occasion for such knowledge His business is to perplex a witness and bamboozle a jury and in doing that he is generally successful He seldom cares for carrying the judge with him such tactics indeed as his are not likely to tell upon a judge That which he loves is that a judge should charge against him and a jury give a verdict in his favour When he achieves that he feels that he has earned his money Let others the young lads and spooneys of his profession undertake the milk and water work of defending injured innocence it is all but an insult to his practised ingenuity to invite his assistance to such tasteless business Give him a case in which he has all the world against him Justice with her sword raised high to strike Truth with open mouth and speaking eyes to tell the bloody tale outraged humanity shrieking for punishment a case from which Mercy herself with averted eyes has loathing turned and bade her sterner sister do her work give him such a case as this and then you will see mister Chaffanbrass in his glory Let him by the use of his high art rescue from the gallows and turn loose upon the world the wretch whose hands are reeking with the blood of father mother wife and brother and you may see mister Chaffanbrass elated with conscious worth rub his happy hands with infinite complacency Then will his ambition be satisfied and he will feel that in the verdict of the jury he has received the honour due to his genius He will have succeeded in turning black into white in washing the blackamoor in dressing in the fair robe of innocence the foulest filthiest wretch of his day and as he returns to his home he will be proudly conscious that he is no little man In person however mister Chaffanbrass is a little man and a very dirty little man He has all manner of nasty tricks about him which make him a disagreeable neighbour to barristers sitting near to him He is profuse with snuff and very generous with his handkerchief He is always at work upon his teeth which do not do much credit to his industry His wig is never at ease upon his head but is poked about by him sometimes over one ear sometimes over the other now on the back of his head and then on his nose and it is impossible to say in which guise he looks most cruel most sharp and most intolerable His linen is never clean his hands never washed and his clothes apparently never new He is about five feet six in height and even with that stoops greatly His custom is to lean forward resting with both hands on the sort of desk before him and then to fix his small brown basilisk eye on the victim in the box before him In this position he will remain unmoved by the hour together unless the elevation and fall of his thick eyebrows and the partial closing of his wicked eyes can be called motion But his tongue that moves there is the weapon which he knows how to use Such is mister Chaffanbrass in public life and those who only know him in public life can hardly believe that at home he is one of the most easy good tempered amiable old gentlemen that ever was pooh poohed by his grown up daughters and occasionally told to keep himself quiet in a corner Such however is his private character Not that he is a fool in his own house mister Chaffanbrass can never be a fool but he is so essentially good natured so devoid of any feeling of domestic tyranny so placid in his domesticities that he chooses to be ruled by his own children But in his own way he is fond of hospitality he delights in a cosy glass of old port with an old friend in whose company he may be allowed to sit in his old coat and old slippers He delights also in his books in his daughters music and in three or four live pet dogs and birds and squirrels whom morning and night he feeds with his own hands He is charitable too and subscribes largely to hospitals founded for the relief of the suffering poor Such was mister Chaffanbrass who had been selected by the astute mister Gitemthruet to act as leading counsel on behalf of Alaric If any human wisdom could effect the escape of a client in such jeopardy the wisdom of mister Chaffanbrass would be likely to do it but in truth the evidence was so strong against him that even this Newgate hero almost feared the result I will not try the patience of anyone by stating in detail all the circumstances of the trial In doing so I should only copy or at any rate might copy the proceedings at some of those modern causes celebres with which all those who love such subjects are familiar And why should I force such matters on those who do not love them The usual opening speech was made by the chief man on the prosecuting side who in the usual manner declared that his only object was justice that his heart bled within him to see a man of such acknowledged public utility as mister Tudor in such a position that he sincerely hoped that the jury might find it possible to acquit him but that And then went into his but with so much venom that it was clearly discernible to all that in spite of his protestations his heart was set upon a conviction When he had finished the witnesses for the prosecution were called the poor wretches whose fate it was to be impaled alive that day by mister Chaffanbrass They gave their evidence and in due course were impaled mister Chaffanbrass had never been greater The day was hot and he thrust his wig back till it stuck rather on the top of his coat collar than on his head his forehead seemed to come out like the head of a dog from his kennel and he grinned with his black teeth and his savage eyes twinkled till the witnesses sank almost out of sight as they gazed at him And yet they had very little to prove and nothing that he could disprove They had to speak merely to certain banking transactions to say that certain moneys had been so paid in and so drawn out in stating which they had their office books to depend on But not the less on this account were they made victims To one clerk it was suggested that he might now and then once in three months or so make an error in a figure and having acknowledged this he was driven about until he admitted that it was very possible that every entry he made in the bank books in the course of the year was false And you such as you said mister Chaffanbrass do you dare to come forward to give evidence on commercial affairs Go down sir and hide your ignominy The wretch convinced that he was ruined for ever slunk out of court and was ashamed to show himself at his place of business for the next three days There were ten or twelve witnesses all much of the same sort who proved among them that this sum of twenty thousand pounds had been placed at Alaric s disposal and that now alas the twenty thousand pounds were not forthcoming It seemed to be a very simple case and to Alaric s own understanding it seemed impossible that his counsel should do anything for him But as each impaled victim shrank with agonized terror from the torture mister Gitemthruet would turn round to Alaric and assure him that they were going on well quite as well as he had expected mister Chaffanbrass was really exerting himself and when mister Chaffanbrass did really exert himself he rarely failed And so the long day faded itself away in the hot sweltering court and his lordship at about seven o clock declared his intention of adjourning Of course a cause celebre such as this was not going to decide itself in one day Alaric s guilt was clear as daylight to all concerned but a man who had risen to be a Civil Service Commissioner and to be entrusted with the guardianship of twenty thousand pounds was not to be treated like a butcher who had merely smothered his wife in an ordinary way or a housebreaker who had followed his professional career to its natural end more than that was due to the rank and station of the man and to the very respectable retaining fee with which mister Gitemthruet had found himself enabled to secure the venom of mister Chaffanbrass So the jury retired to regale themselves en masse at a neighbouring coffee house Alaric was again permitted to be at large on bail the amiable policeman in mufti still attending him at a distance and mister Chaffanbrass and his lordship retired to prepare themselves by rest for the morrow s labours But what was Alaric to do He soon found himself under the guardianship of the constant Gitemthruet in a neighbouring tavern and his cousin Charley was with him Charley had been in court the whole day except that he had twice posted down to the West End in a cab to let Gertrude and missus Woodward know how things were going on He had posted down and posted back again and crowded as the court had been he had contrived to make his way in using that air of authority to which the strongest minded policeman will always bow till at last the very policemen assisted him as though he were in some way connected with the trial On his last visit at Gertrude s house he had told her that it was very improbable that the trial should be finished that day She had then said nothing as to Alaric s return to his own house it had indeed not occurred to her that he would be at liberty to do so Charley at once caught at this and strongly recommended his cousin to remain where he was You will gain nothing by going home said he Gertrude does not expect you missus Woodward is there and it will be better for all parties that you should remain mister Gitemthruet strongly backed his advice and Alaric so counselled resolved to remain where he was Charley promised to stay with him and the policeman in mufti without making any promise at all silently acquiesced in the arrangement Charley made one more visit to the West saw Norman at his lodgings and missus Woodward and Gertrude in Albany Place and then returned to make a night of it with Alaric We need hardly say that Charley made a night of it in a very different manner from that to which he and his brother navvies were so well accustomed CHAPTER XLI THE OLD BAILEY The next morning at ten o clock the court was again crowded The judge was again on his bench prepared for patient endurance and Lord Killtime and Sir Gregory Hardlines were alongside of him The jury were again in their box ready with pen and paper to give their brightest attention a brightness which will be dim enough before the long day be over the counsel for the prosecution were rummaging among their papers the witnesses for the defence were sitting there among the attorneys with the exception of the Honourable Undecimus Scott who was accommodated with a seat near the sheriff and whose heart to tell the truth was sinking somewhat low within his breast in spite of the glass of brandy with which he had fortified himself Alaric was again present under the wings of mister Gitemthruet and the great mister Chaffanbrass was in his place He was leaning over a slip of paper which he held in his hand and with compressed lips was meditating his attack upon his enemies on this occasion his wig was well over his eyes and as he peered up from under it to the judge s face he cocked his nose with an air of supercilious contempt for all those who were immediately around him It was for him to begin the day s sport by making a speech not so much in defence of his client as in accusation of the prosecutors It had never he said been his fate he might say his misfortune to hear a case against a man in a respectable position opened by the Crown with such an amount of envenomed virulence He was then reminded that the prosecution was not carried on by the Crown Then said he we may attribute this virulence to private malice that it is not to be attributed to any fear that this English bride should lose her fortune or that her French husband should be deprived of any portion of his spoil I shall be able to prove to a certainty Did I allow myself that audacity of denunciation which my learned friend has not considered incompatible with the dignity of his new silk gown Could I permit myself such latitude of invective as he has adopted a slight laugh was here heard in the court and an involuntary smile played across the judge s face yes continued mister Chaffanbrass I boldly aver that I have never forgotten myself and what is due to humanity as my learned friend did in his address to the jury Gentlemen of the jury you will not confound the natural indignation which counsel must feel when defending innocence from the false attacks with the uncalled for the unprofessional acerbity which has now been used in promoting such an accusation as this I may at times be angry when I see mean falsehood before me in vain assuming the garb of truth for with such juries as I meet here it generally is in vain I may at times forget myself in anger but if we talk of venom virulence and eager hostility I yield the palm without a contest to my learned friend in the new silk gown He then went on to dispose of the witnesses whom they had heard on the previous day and expressed a regret that an expose should have been made so disgraceful to the commercial establishments of this great commercial city It only showed what was the effect on such establishments of that undue parsimony which was now one of the crying evils of the times Having thus shortly disposed of them he came to what all men knew was the real interest of the day s doings But said he the evidence in this case to which your attention will be chiefly directed will be not that for the accusation but that for the defence It will be my business to show to you not only that my client is guiltless but to what temptations to be guilty he has been purposely and wickedly subjected I shall put into that bar an honourable member of the House of Commons who will make some revelations as to his own life who will give us an insight into the ways and means of a legislator which will probably surprise us all not excluding his lordship on the bench He will be able to explain to us and I trust I may be able to induce him to do so for it is possible that he may be a little coy he will be able to explain to us why my client who is in no way connected either with the Scotts or the Golightlys or the Figgs or the Jaquetanapes why he was made the lady s trustee and he will also perhaps tell us after some slight gentle persuasion whether he has himself handled or attempted to handle any of this lady s money mister Chaffanbrass then went on to state that as the forms of the court would not give him the power of addressing the jury again he must now explain to them what he conceived to be the facts of the case He then admitted that his client in his anxiety to do the best he could with the fortune entrusted to him had invested it badly The present fate of these unfortunate bridge shares as to which the commercial world had lately held so many different opinions proved that but it had nevertheless been a bona fide investment made in conjunction with and by the advice of mister Scott the lady s uncle who thus for his own purposes got possession of money which was in truth confided to him for other purposes His client mister Chaffanbrass acknowledged had behaved with great indiscretion but the moment he found that the investment would be an injurious one to the lady whose welfare was in his hands he at once resolved to make good the whole amount from his own pocket That he had done so or at any rate would have done so but for this trial would be proved to them Nobler conduct than this it was impossible to imagine Whereas the lady s uncle the honourable member of Parliament the gentleman who had made a stalking horse of his mister Chaffanbrass s client refused to refund a penny of the spoil and was now the instigator of this most unjust proceeding As mister Chaffanbrass thus finished his oration Undy Scott tried to smile complacently on those around him But why did the big drops of sweat stand on his brow as his eye involuntarily caught those of mister Chaffanbrass Why did he shuffle his feet and uneasily move his hands and feet hither and thither as a man does when he tries in vain to be unconcerned Why did he pull his gloves on and off and throw himself back with that affected air which is so unusual to him All the court was looking at him and every one knew that he was wretched Wretched aye indeed he was for the assurance even of an Undy Scott the hardened man of the clubs the thrice elected and twice rejected of Tillietudlem fell prostrate before the well known hot pincers of Chaffanbrass the torturer The first witness called was Henry Norman Alaric looked up for a moment with surprise and then averted his eyes mister Gitemthruet had concealed from him the fact that Norman was to be called He merely proved this that having heard from missus Woodward who was the prisoner s mother in law and would soon be his own mother in law that a deficiency had been alleged to exist in the fortune of Madame Jaquetanape he had on the part of missus Woodward produced what he believed would cover this deficiency and that when he had been informed that more money was wanting he had offered to give security that the whole should be paid in six months Of course on him mister Chaffanbrass exercised none of his terrible skill and as the lawyers on the other side declined to cross examine him he was soon able to leave the court This he did speedily for he had no desire to witness Alaric s misery And then the Honourable Undecimus Scott was put into the witness box It was suggested on his behalf that he might give his evidence from the seat which he then occupied but this mister Chaffanbrass would by no means allow His intercourse with mister Scott he said must be of a nearer closer and more confidential nature than such an arrangement as that would admit A witness to his way of thinking was never an efficient witness till he had his arm on the rail of a witness box He must trouble mister Scott to descend from the grandeur of his present position he might return to his seat after he had been examined if he then should have a mind to do so Our friend Undy found that he had to obey and he was soon confronted with mister Chaffanbrass in the humbler manner which that gentleman thought so desirable You are a member of the House of Commons I believe mister Scott began mister Chaffanbrass Undy acknowledged that he was so And you are the son of a peer I believe A Scotch peer said Undy Oh a Scotch peer said mister Chaffanbrass bringing his wig forward over his left eye in a manner that was almost irresistible a Scotch peer a member of Parliament and son of a Scotch peer and you have been a member of the Government I believe mister Scott Undy confessed that he had been in office for a short time A member of Parliament a son of a peer and one of the Government of this great and free country You ought to be a proud and a happy man You are a man of fortune too I believe mister Scott That is a matter of opinion said Undy different people have different ideas I don t know what you call fortune Why I call Ltwenty thousand a fortune this sum that the lady had who married the Frenchman Have you Ltwenty thousand I shall not answer that question Have you Lten thousand You surely must have as much as that as I know you married a fortune yourself unless indeed a false hearted trustee has got hold of your money also Come have you got Lten thousand I shall not answer you Have you got any income at all Now I demand an answer to that on your oath sir My lord must I answer such questions said Undy Yes sir you must answer them and many more like them said mister Chaffanbrass My lord it is essential to my client that I should prove to the jury whether this witness is or is not a penniless adventurer if he be a respectable member of society he can have no objection to let me know whether he has the means of living Perhaps mister Scott said the judge you will not object to state whether or no you possess any fixed income Have you or have you not got an income on which you live demanded mister Chaffanbrass I have an income said Undy not however in a voice that betokened much self confidence in the strength of his own answer You have an income have you And now mister Scott will you tell us what profession you follow at this moment with the object of increasing your income I think we may surmise by the tone of your voice that your income is not very abundant I have no profession said Undy On your oath you are in no profession Not at present On your oath you are not a stock jobber Undy hesitated for a moment By the virtue of your oath sir are you a stock jobber or are you not No I am not At least I believe not You believe not said mister Chaffanbrass and it would be necessary to hear the tone in which this was said to understand the derision which was implied You believe you are not a stock jobber Are you or are you not constantly buying shares and selling shares railway shares bridge shares mining shares and such like I sometimes buy shares And sometimes sell them Yes and sometimes sell them Where mister Chaffanbrass had got his exact information we cannot say but very exact information he had acquired respecting Undy s little transactions He questioned him about the Mary Janes and Old Friendships about the West Corks and the Ballydehob Branch about sundry other railways and canals and finally about the Limehouse bridge and then again he asked his former question And now said he will you tell the jury whether you are a stock jobber or no It is all a matter of opinion said Undy Perhaps I may be in your sense of the word My sense of the word said mister Chaffanbrass You are as much a stock jobber sir as that man is a policeman or his lordship is a judge And now mister Scott I am sorry that I must go back to your private affairs respecting which you are so unwilling to speak I fear I must trouble you to tell me this How did you raise the money with which you bought that latter batch the large lump of the bridge shares of which we were speaking I borrowed it from mister Tudor said Undy who had prepared himself to answer this question glibly You borrowed it from mister Alaric Tudor that is from the gentleman now upon his trial You borrowed it I believe just at the time that he became the lady s trustee Yes said Undy I did so You have not repaid him as yet No not yet said Undy I thought not Can you at all say when mister Tudor may probably get his money I am not at present prepared to name a day When the money was lent it was not intended that it should be repaid at an early day Oh mister Tudor did not want his money at an early day didn t he But nevertheless he has I believe asked for it since and that very pressingly He has never asked for it said Undy Allow me to remind you mister Scott that I have the power of putting my client into that witness box although he is on his trial and having so reminded you let me again beg you to say whether he has not asked you for repayment of this large sum of money very pressingly No he has never done so By the value of your oath sir if it has any value did not my client beseech you to allow these shares to be sold while they were yet saleable in order that your niece s trust money might be replaced in the English funds He said something as to the expediency of selling them and I differed from him You thought it would be better for the lady s interest that they should remain unsold I made no question of the lady s interest I was not her trustee But the shares were bought with the lady s money What shares asked Undy What shares sir Those shares which you had professed to hold on the lady s behalf and which afterwards you did not scruple to call your own Those shares of yours since you have the deliberate dishonesty so to call them those shares of yours were they not bought with the lady s money They were bought with the money which I borrowed from mister Tudor And where did mister Tudor get that money That is a question you must ask himself said Undy It is a question sir that just at present I prefer to ask you Now sir be good enough to tell the jury whence mister Tudor got that money or tell them if you dare do so that you do not know Undy for a minute remained silent and mister Chaffanbrass remained silent also But if the fury of his tongue for a moment was at rest that of his eyes was as active as ever He kept his gaze steadily fixed upon the witness and stood there with compressed lips still resting on his two hands as though he were quite satisfied thus to watch the prey that was in his power For an instant he glanced up to the jury and then allowed his eyes to resettle on the face of the witness as though he might have said There gentlemen there he is the son of a peer a member of Parliament what do you think of him The silence of that minute was horrible to Undy and yet he could hardly bring himself to break it The judge looked at him with eyes which seemed to read his inmost soul the jury looked at him condemning him one and all Alaric looked at him with fierce glaring eyes of hatred the same eyes that had glared at him that night when he had been collared in the street the whole crowd looked at him derisively but the eyes of them all were as nothing to the eyes of mister Chaffanbrass I never saw him so great I never did said mister Gitemthruet whispering to his client and Alaric even he felt some consolation in the terrible discomfiture of his enemy I don t know where he got it said Undy at last breaking the terrible silence and wiping the perspiration from his brow Oh you don t said mister Chaffanbrass knocking his wig back and coming well out of his kennel After waiting for a quarter of an hour or so you are able to tell the jury at last that you don t know anything about it He took the small trifle of change out of his pocket I suppose I don t know where he took it from And you didn t ask No You got the money that was all you know But this was just at the time that mister Tudor became the lady s trustee I think you have admitted that It may have been about the time Yes it may have been about the time as you justly observe mister Scott Luckily you know we have the dates of the two transactions But it never occurred to your innocent mind that the money which you got into your hands was a part of the lady s fortune that never occurred to your innocent mind eh mister Scott I don t know that my mind is a more innocent mind than your own said Undy I dare say not Well did the idea ever occur to your guilty mind Perhaps my mind is not more guilty than your own either Then may God help me said mister Chaffanbrass for I must be at a bad pass You told us just now mister Scott that some time since mister Tudor advised you to sell these shares what made him give you this advice He meant he said to sell his own And he pressed you to sell yours Yes He urged you to do so more than once Yes I believe he did And now mister Scott can you explain to the jury why he was so solicitous that you should dispose of your property I do not know why he should have done so unless he wanted back his money Then he did ask for his own money No he never asked for it But if I had sold the shares perhaps he might have asked for it Oh said mister Chaffanbrass and as he uttered the monosyllable he looked up at the jury and gently shook his head and gently shook his hands mister Chaffanbrass was famous for these little silent addresses to the jury box But not even yet had he done with this suspicious loan We cannot follow him through the whole of his examination for he kept our old friend under the harrow for no less than seven hours Though he himself made no further statement to the jury he made it perfectly plain by Undy s own extracted admissions or by the hesitation of his denials that he had knowingly received this money out of his niece s fortune and that he had refused to sell the shares bought with this money when pressed to do so by Tudor in order that the trust money might be again made up There were those who blamed mister Chaffanbrass for thus admitting that his client had made away with his ward s money by lending it to Undy but that acute gentleman saw clearly that he could not contend against the fact of the property having been fraudulently used but he saw that he might induce the jury to attach so much guilt to Undy that Tudor would as it were be whitened by the blackness of the other s villany The judge he well knew would blow aside all this froth but then the judge could not find the verdict Towards the end of the day when Undy was thoroughly worn out at which time however mister Chaffanbrass was as brisk as ever for nothing ever wore him out when he was pursuing his game when the interest of those who had been sweltering in the hot court all the day was observed to flag mister Chaffanbrass began twisting round his finger a bit of paper of which those who were best acquainted with his manner knew that he would soon make use mister Scott said he suddenly dropping the derisive sarcasm of his former tone and addressing him with all imaginable courtesy could you oblige me by telling me whose handwriting that is and he handed to him the scrap of paper Undy took it and saw that the writing was his own his eyes were somewhat dim and he can hardly be said to have read it It was a very short memorandum and it ran as follows All will yet be well if those shares be ready to morrow morning Well mister Scott said the lawyer do you recognize the handwriting Undy looked at it and endeavoured to examine it closely but he could not his eyes swam and his head was giddy and he felt sick Could he have satisfied himself that the writing was not clearly and manifestly his own he would have denied the document altogether but he feared to do this the handwriting might be proved to be his own It is something like my own said he Something like your own is it said mister Chaffanbrass as though he were much surprised Like your own Well will you have the goodness to read it Undy turned it in his hand as though the proposed task were singularly disagreeable to him Why thought he to himself should he be thus browbeaten by a dirty old Newgate lawyer Why not pluck up his courage and at any rate show that he was a man No said he I will not read it Then I will Gentlemen of the jury have the goodness to listen to me Of course there was a contest then between him and the lawyers on the other side whether the document might or might not be read but equally of course the contest ended in the judge s decision that it should be read And mister Chaffanbrass did read it in a voice audible to all men All will yet be well if those shares be ready to morrow morning We may take it as admitted I suppose that this is in your handwriting mister Scott It probably may be though I will not say that it is Do you not know sir with positive certainty that it is your writing To this Undy made no direct answer What is your opinion mister Scott said the judge you can probably give an opinion by which the jury would be much guided I think it is my lord said Undy He thinks it is said mister Chaffanbrass addressing the jury Well for once I agree with you I think it is also and how will you have the goodness to explain it To whom was it addressed I cannot say When was it written I do not know What does it mean I cannot remember Was it addressed to mister Tudor I should think not Now mister Scott have the goodness to look at the jury and to speak a little louder You are in the habit of addressing a larger audience than this and cannot therefore be shamefaced You mean to tell the jury that you think that that note was not intended by you for mister Tudor I think not said Undy But you can t say who it was intended for No And by the virtue of your oath you have told us all that you know about it Undy remained silent but mister Chaffanbrass did not press him for an answer You have a brother named Valentine I think Now Captain Val had been summoned also and was at this moment in court mister Chaffanbrass requested that he might be desired to leave it and consequently he was ordered out in charge of a policeman And now mister Scott was that note written by you to mister Tudor with reference to certain shares which you proposed that mister Tudor should place in your brother s hands Now sir I ask you as a member of Parliament as a member of the Government as the son of a peer to give a true answer to that question And then again Undy was silent and again mister Chaffanbrass leant on the desk and glared at him And remember sir member of Parliament and nobleman as you are you shall be indicted for perjury if you are guilty of perjury My lord said Undy writhing in torment am I to submit to this mister Chaffanbrass said the judge you should not threaten your witness mister Scott surely you can answer the question mister Chaffanbrass seemed not to have even heard what the judge said so intently were his eyes fixed on poor Undy Well mister Scott he said at last very softly is it convenient for you to answer me Did that note refer to a certain number of bridge shares which you required mister Tudor to hand over to the stepfather of this lady Undy had no trust in his brother He felt all but sure that under the fire of mister Chaffanbrass he would confess everything It would be terrible to own the truth but it would be more terrible to be indicted for perjury So he sat silent My lord perhaps you will ask him said mister Chaffanbrass mister Scott you understand the question why do you not answer it asked the judge But Undy still remained silent You may go now said mister Chaffanbrass Your eloquence is of the silent sort but nevertheless it is very impressive You may go now and sit on that bench again if after what has passed the sheriff thinks proper to permit it Undy however did not try that officer s complaisance He retired from the witness box and was not again seen during the trial in any conspicuous place in the court It was then past seven o clock but mister Chaffanbrass insisted on going on with the examination of Captain Val It did not last long Captain Val also was in that disagreeable position that he did not know what Undy had confessed and what denied So he also refused to answer the questions of mister Chaffanbrass saying that he might possibly damage himself should he do so This was enough for mister Chaffanbrass and then his work was done At eight o clock the court again adjourned again Charley posted off for the third time that day to let Gertrude know that even as yet all was not over and again he and Alaric spent a melancholy evening at the neighbouring tavern and then again on the third morning all were re assembled at the Old Bailey Or rather they were not all re assembled But few came now and they were those who were obliged to come The crack piece of the trial that portion to which among the connoisseurs the interest was attached that was all over mister Chaffanbrass had done his work Undy Scott the member of Parliament had been gibbeted and the rest was in comparison stale flat and unprofitable The judge and jury however were there so were the prosecuting counsel so were mister Chaffanbrass and mister Younglad and so was poor Alaric The work of the day was commenced by the judge s charge and then Alaric to his infinite dismay found how all the sophistry and laboured arguments of his very talented advocate were blown to the winds and shown to be worthless Gentlemen said the judge to the jurors after he had gone through all the evidence and told them what was admissible and what was not gentlemen I must especially remind you that in coming to a verdict in the matter no amount of guilt on the part of any other person can render guiltless him whom you are now trying or palliate his guilt if he be guilty An endeavour has been made to affix a deep stigma on one of the witnesses who has been examined before you and to induce you to feel rather than to think that mister Tudor is at any rate comparatively innocent innocent as compared with that gentleman That is not the issue which you are called on to decide not whether mister Scott for purposes of his own led mister Tudor on to guilt and then turned against him but whether mister Tudor himself has or has not been guilty under this Act of Parliament that has been explained to you As regards the evidence of mister Scott I am justified in telling you that if the prisoner s guilt depended in any way on that evidence it would be your duty to receive it with the most extreme caution and to reject it altogether if not corroborated That evidence was not trustworthy and in a great measure justified the treatment which the witness encountered from the learned barrister who examined him But mister Scott was a witness for the defence not for the prosecution The case for the prosecution in no way hangs on his evidence If it be your opinion that mister Tudor is guilty and that he was unwarily enticed into guilt by mister Scott that the whole arrangement of this trust was brought about by mister Scott or others to enable him or them to make a cat s paw of this new trustee and thus use the lady s money for their own purposes such an opinion on your part may justify you in recommending the prisoner to the merciful consideration of the bench but it cannot justify you in finding a verdict of not guilty As Alaric heard this and much more to the same effect his hopes which certainly had been high during the examination of Undy Scott again sank to zero and left him in despair He had almost begun to doubt the fact of his own guilt so wondrously had his conduct been glossed over by mister Chaffanbrass so strikingly had any good attempt on his part been brought to the light so black had Scott been made to appear Ideas floated across his brain that he might go forth not only free of the law but whitewashed also in men s opinions that he might again sit on his throne at the Civil Service Board again cry to himself Excelsior and indulge the old dreams of his ambition But alas the deliberate and well poised wisdom of the judge seemed to shower down cold truth upon the jury from his very eyes His words were low in their tone though very clear impassive delivered without gesticulation or artifice such as that so powerfully used by mister Chaffanbrass but Alaric himself felt that it was impossible to doubt the truth of such a man impossible to suppose that any juryman should do so Ah me why had he brought himself thus to quail beneath the gaze of an old man seated on a bench with what object had he forced himself to bend his once proud neck He had been before in courts such as this and had mocked within his own spirit the paraphernalia of the horsehair wigs the judges faded finery and the red cloth he had laughed at the musty stale solemnity by which miscreants were awed and policemen enchanted now these things told on himself heavily enough he felt now their weight and import And then the jury retired from the court to consider their verdict and mister Gitemthruet predicted that they would be hungry enough before they sat down to their next meal His lordship was dead against us said mister Gitemthruet but that was a matter of course we must look to the jury and the city juries are very fond of mister Chaffanbrass I am not quite sure however that mister Chaffanbrass was right I would not have admitted so much myself but then no one knows a city jury so well as mister Chaffanbrass Other causes came on and still the jury did not return to court mister Chaffanbrass seemed to have forgotten the very existence of Alaric Tudor and was deeply engaged in vindicating a city butcher from an imputation of having vended a dead ass by way of veal All his indignation was now forgotten and he was full of boisterous fun filling the court with peals of laughter One o clock came two three four five six seven and still no verdict At the latter hour when the court was about to be adjourned the foreman came in and assured the judge that there was no probability that they could agree eleven of them thought one way while the twelfth was opposed to them You must reason with the gentleman said the judge I have my lord said the foreman but it s all thrown away upon him Reason with him again said the judge rising from his bench and preparing to go to his dinner And then one of the great fundamental supports of the British constitution was brought into play Reason was thrown away upon this tough juryman and therefore it was necessary to ascertain what effect starvation might have upon him A verdict that is a unanimous decision from these twelve men as to Alaric s guilt was necessary it might be that three would think him innocent and nine guilty or that any other division of opinion might take place but such divisions among a jury are opposed to the spirit of the British constitution Twelve men must think alike or if they will not they must be made to do so Reason with him again said the judge as he went to his own dinner Had the judge bade them remind him how hungry he would soon be if he remained obstinate his lordship would probably have expressed the thought which was passing through his mind There is one of us my lord said the foreman who will I know be very ill before long he is already so bad that he can t sit upright There are many ludicrous points in our blessed constitution but perhaps nothing so ludicrous as a juryman praying to a judge for mercy He has been caught shut up in a box perhaps for five or six days together badgered with half a dozen lawyers till he is nearly deaf with their continual talking and then he is locked up until he shall die or find a verdict Such at least is the intention of the constitution The death however of three or four jurymen from starvation would not suit the humanity of the present age and therefore when extremities are nigh at hand the dying jurymen with medical certificates are allowed to be carried off It is devoutly to be wished that one juryman might be starved to death while thus serving the constitution the absurdity then would cure itself and a verdict of a majority would be taken But in Alaric s case reason or hunger did prevail at the last moment and as the judge was leaving the court he was called back to receive the verdict Alaric also was brought back still under mister Gitemthruet s wing and with him came Charley A few officers of the court were there a jailer and a policeman or two those whose attendance was absolutely necessary but with these exceptions the place was empty Not long since men were crowding for seats and the policemen were hardly able to restrain the pressure of those who pushed forward but now there was no pushing the dingy dirty benches a few inches of which had lately been so desirable were not at all in request and were anything but inviting in appearance Alaric sat himself down on the very spot which had lately been sacred to mister Chaffanbrass and mister Gitemthruet seated above him might also fancy himself a barrister There they sat for five minutes in perfect silence the suspense of the moment cowed even the attorney and Charley who sat on the other side of Alaric was so affected that he could hardly have spoken had he wished to do so And then the judge who had been obliged to re array himself before he returned to the bench again took his seat and an officer of the court inquired of the foreman of the jury in his usual official language what their finding was Guilty on the third count said the foreman Not guilty on the four others We beg however most strongly to recommend the prisoner to your lordship s merciful consideration believing that he has been led into this crime by one who has been much more guilty than himself I knew mister Chaffanbrass was wrong said mister Gitemthruet I knew he was wrong when he acknowledged so much God bless my soul in a court of law one should never acknowledge anything what s the use And then came the sentence He was to be confined at the Penitentiary at Millbank for six months The offence said the judge of which you have been found guilty and of which you most certainly have been guilty is one most prejudicial to the interests of the community That trust which the weaker of mankind should place in the stronger that reliance which widows and orphans should feel in their nearest and dearest friends would be destroyed if such crimes as these were allowed to pass unpunished But in your case there are circumstances which do doubtless palliate the crime of which you have been guilty the money which you took will I believe be restored the trust which you were courted to undertake should not have been imposed on you and in the tale of villany which has been laid before us you have by no means been the worst offender I have therefore inflicted on you the slightest penalty which the law allows me mister Tudor I know what has been your career how great your services to your country how unexceptionable your conduct as a public servant I trust I do trust I most earnestly most hopefully trust that your career of utility is not over Your abilities are great and you are blessed with the power of thinking I do beseech you to consider while you undergo that confinement which you needs must suffer how little any wealth is worth an uneasy conscience And so the trial was over Alaric was taken off in custody the policeman in mufti was released from his attendance and Charley with a heavy heart carried the news to Gertrude and missus Woodward And as for me said Gertrude when she had so far recovered from the first shock as to be able to talk to her mother as for me I will have lodgings at Millbank CHAPTER XLII A PARTING INTERVIEW missus Woodward remained with her eldest daughter for two days after the trial and then she was forced to return to Hampton She had earnestly entreated Gertrude to accompany her with her child but missus Tudor was inflexible She had she said very much to do so much that she could not possibly leave London the house and furniture were on her hands and must be disposed of their future plans must be arranged and then nothing she said should induce her to sleep out of sight of her husband s prison or to omit any opportunity of seeing him which the prison rules would allow her missus Woodward would not have left one child in such extremity had not the state of another child made her presence at the Cottage indispensable Katie s anxiety about the trial had of course been intense so intense as to give her a false strength and somewhat to deceive Linda as to her real state Tidings of course passed daily between London and the Cottage but for three days they told nothing On the morning of the fourth day however Norman brought the heavy news and Katie sank completely under it When she first heard the result of the trial she swooned away and remained for some time nearly unconscious But returning consciousness brought with it no relief and she lay sobbing on her pillow till she became so weak that Linda in her fright wrote up to her mother begging her to return at once Then wretched as it made her to leave Gertrude in her trouble missus Woodward did return For a fortnight after this there was an unhappy household at Surbiton Cottage Linda s marriage was put off till the period of Alaric s sentence should be over and till something should be settled as to his and Gertrude s future career It was now August and they spoke of the event as one which perhaps might occur in the course of the following spring At this time also they were deprived for a while of the comfort of Norman s visits by his enforced absence at Normansgrove Harry s eldest brother was again ill and at last the news of his death was received at Hampton Under other circumstances such tidings as those might to a certain extent have brought their own consolation with them Harry would now be mister Norman of Normansgrove and Linda would become missus Norman of Normansgrove Harry s mother had long been dead and his father was an infirm old man who would be too glad to give up to his son the full management of the estate now that the eldest son was a man to whom that estate could be trusted All those circumstances had of course been talked over between Harry and Linda and it was understood that Harry was now to resign his situation at the Weights and Measures But Alaric s condition Gertrude s misery and Katie s illness threw all such matters into the background Katie became no better but then the doctors said that she did not become any worse and gave it as their opinion that she ought to recover She had youth they said on her side and then her lungs were not affected This was the great question which they were all asking of each other continually The poor girl lived beneath a stethoscope and bore all their pokings and tappings with exquisite patience She herself believed that she was dying and so she repeatedly told her mother missus Woodward could only say that all was in God s hands but that the physicians still encouraged them to hope the best One day missus Woodward was sitting with a book in her usual place at the side of Katie s bed she looked every now and again at her patient and thought that she was slumbering and at last she rose from her chair to creep away so sure was she that she might be spared for a moment But just as she was silently rising a thin slight pale hand crept out from beneath the clothes and laid itself on her arm I thought you were asleep love said she No mamma I was not asleep I was thinking of something Don t go away mamma just now I want to ask you something missus Woodward again sat down and taking her daughter s hand in her own caressed it I want to ask a favour of you mamma said Katie A favour my darling what is it you know I will do anything in my power that you ask me Ah mamma I do not know whether you will do this What is it Katie I will do anything that is for your good I am sure you know that Katie Mamma I know I am going to die Oh mamma don t say anything now don t cry now dear dear mamma I don t say it to make you unhappy but you know when I am so ill I ought to think about it ought I not mamma But Katie the doctor says that he thinks you are not so dangerously ill you should not therefore despond it will increase your illness and hinder your chance of getting well That would be wrong wouldn t it love Mamma I feel that I shall never again be well and therefore It was useless telling missus Woodward not to cry what else could she do Dear mamma I am so sorry to make you unhappy but you are my own mamma and therefore I must tell you I can be happy still mamma if you will let me talk to you about it You shall talk dearest I will hear what you say but oh Katie I cannot bear to hear you talk of dying I do not think you are dying If I did think so my child my trust in your goodness is so strong that I should tell you You know mamma it might have been much worse suppose I had been drowned when he when Charley you know saved me and as she mentioned his name a tear for the first time ran down each cheek how much worse that would have been think mamma what it would be to be drowned without a moment for one s prayers It is quite right we should prepare ourselves for death Whether we live or whether we die we shall be better for doing that Katie still held her mother s hand in hers and lay back against the pillows which had been placed behind her back And now mamma she said at last I am going to ask you this favour I want to see Charley once more missus Woodward was so much astonished at the request that at first she knew not what answer to make To see Charley she said at last Yes mamma I want to see Charley once more there need be no secrets between us now mamma There have never been any secrets between us said missus Woodward embracing her You have never had any secrets from me Not intentionally mamma I have never meant to keep anything secret from you And I know you have known what I felt about Charley I know that you have behaved like an angel my child I know your want of selfishness your devotion to others has been such as to shame me I know your conduct has been perfect oh my Katie I have understood it and I have so loved you so admired you Katie smiled through her tears as she returned her mother s embrace Well mamma she said at any rate you know that I love him Oh mamma I do love him so dearly It is not now like Gertrude s love or Linda s I know that I can never be his wife I did know before that for many reasons I ought not to wish to be so but now I know I never never can be missus Woodward was past the power of speaking and so Katie went on But I do not love him the less for that reason I think I love him the more I never never could have loved anyone else mamma never never and that is one reason why I do not so much mind being ill now missus Woodward bowed forward and hid her face in the counterpane but she still kept hold of her daughter s hand And mamma she continued as I do love him so dearly I feel that I should try to do something for him I ought to do so and mamma I could not be happy without seeing him He is not just like a brother or a brother in law such as Harry and Alaric we are not bound to each other as relations are but yet I feel that something does bind me to him I know he doesn t love me as I love him but yet I think he loves me dearly and if I speak to him now mamma now that I am that I am so ill perhaps he will mind me Mamma it will be as though one came unto him from the dead missus Woodward did not know how to refuse any request that Katie might now make to her and felt herself altogether unequal to the task of refusing this request For many reasons she would have done so had she been able in the first place she did not think that all chance of Katie s recovery was gone and then at the present moment she felt no inclination to draw closer to her any of the Tudor family She could not but feel that Alaric had been the means of disgracing and degrading one child and truly deeply warmly as she sympathized with the other she could not bring herself to feel the same sympathy for the object of her love It was a sore day for her and hers that on which the Tudors had first entered her house Nevertheless she assented to Katie s proposal and undertook the task of asking Charley down to Hampton Since Alaric s conviction Charley led a busy life and as men who have really something to do have seldom time to get into much mischief he had been peculiarly moral and respectable It is not surprising that at such a moment Gertrude found that Alaric s newer friends fell off from him Of course they did nor is it a sign of ingratitude or heartlessness in the world that at such a period of great distress new friends should fall off New friends like one s best coat and polished patent leather dress boots are only intended for holiday wear At other times they are neither serviceable nor comfortable they do not answer the required purposes and are ill adapted to give us the ease we seek A new coat however has this advantage that it will in time become old and comfortable so much can by no means be predicted with certainty of a new friend Woe to those men who go through the world with none but new coats on their backs with no boots but those of polished leather with none but new friends to comfort them in adversity But not the less when misfortune does come are we inclined to grumble at finding ourselves deserted Gertrude though she certainly wished to see no missus Val and no Miss Neverbends did feel lonely enough when her mother left her and wretched enough But she was not altogether deserted At this time Charley was true to her and did for her all those thousand nameless things which a woman cannot do for herself He came to her everyday after leaving his office and on one excuse or another remained with her till late every evening He was not a little surprised one morning on receiving missus Woodward s invitation to Hampton missus Woodward in writing had had some difficulty in wording her request She hardly liked asking Charley to come because Katie was ill nor did she like to ask him without mentioning Katie s illness I need not explain to you she said in her note that we are all in great distress poor Katie is very ill and you will understand what we must feel about Alaric and Gertrude Harry is still at Normansgrove We shall all be glad to see you and Katie who never forgets what you did for her insists on my asking you at once I am sure you will not refuse her so I shall expect you to morrow Charley would not have refused her anything and it need hardly be said that he accepted the invitation missus Woodward was at a loss how to receive him or what to say to him Though Katie was so positive that her own illness would be fatal a symptom which might have confirmed those who watched her in their opinion that her disease was not consumption her mother was by no means so desponding She still thought it not impossible that her child might recover and so thinking could not but be adverse to any declaration on Katie s part of her own feelings She had endeavoured to explain this to her daughter but Katie was so carried away by her enthusiasm was at the present moment so devoted and as it were exalted above her present life that all that her mother said was thrown away upon her missus Woodward might have refused her daughter s request and have run the risk of breaking her heart by the refusal but now that the petition had been granted it was useless to endeavour to teach her to repress her feelings Charley said missus Woodward when he had been some little time in the house our dear Katie wants to see you she is very ill you know Charley said he knew she was ill You remember our walk together Charley Yes said Charley I remember it well I made you a promise then and I have kept it I have now come here only because you have sent for me This he said in the tone which a man uses when he feels himself to have been injured I know it Charley you have kept your promise I knew you would and I know you will I have the fullest trust in you and now you shall come and see her Charley was to return to town that night and they had not therefore much time to lose they went upstairs at once and found Linda and Uncle Bat in the patient s room It was a lovely August evening and the bedroom window opening upon the river was unclosed Katie as she sat propped up against the pillows could look out upon the water and see the reedy island on which in happy former days she had so delighted to let her imagination revel It is very good of you to come and see me Charley said she as he made his way up to her bedside He took her wasted hand in his own and pressed it and as he did so a tear forced itself into each corner of his eyes She smiled as though to cheer him and said that now she saw him she could be quite happy only for poor Alaric and Gertrude She hoped she might live to see Alaric again but if not Charley was to give him her best best love Live to see him of course you will said Uncle Bat What s to hinder you Uncle Bat like the rest of them tried to cheer her and make her think that she might yet live After a while Uncle Bat went out of the room and Linda followed him missus Woodward would fain have remained but she perfectly understood that it was part of the intended arrangement with Katie that Charley should be alone with her I will come back in a quarter of an hour she said rising to follow the others You must not let her talk too much Charley you see how weak she is Mamma when you come knock at the door will you said Katie missus Woodward who found herself obliged to act in complete obedience to her daughter promised that she would and then they were left alone Sit down Charley said she he was still standing by her bedside and now at her bidding he sat in the chair which Captain Cuttwater had occupied Come here nearer to me said she this is where mamma always sits and Linda when mamma is not here Charley did as he was bid and changing his seat came and sat down close to her bed head Charley do you remember how you went into the water for me said she again smiling and pulling her hand out and resting it on his arm which lay on the bed beside her Indeed I do Katie I remember the day very well That was a very happy day in spite of the tumble was it not Charley And do you remember the flower show and the dance at missus Val s Charley did remember them all well Ah me how often had he thought of them I think of those days so often too often continued Katie But dear Charley I cannot remember too often that you saved my life Charley once more tried to explain to her that there was nothing worthy of notice in his exploit of that day Well Charley I may think as I like you know she said with something of the obstinacy of old days I think you did save my life and all the people in the world won t make me think anything else but Charley I have something now to tell you He sat and listened It seemed to him as though he were only there to listen as though were he to make his own voice audible he would violate the sanctity of the place His thoughts were serious enough but he could not pitch his voice so as to suit the tone in which she addressed him We were always friends were we not said she we were always good friends Charley Do you remember how you were to build a palace for me in the dear old island out there You were always so kind so good to me Charley said he remembered it all they were happy days the happiest days he said that he had ever known And you used to love me Charley Used said he do you think I do not love you now I am sure you do And Charley I love you also That it is that I want to tell you I love you so well that I cannot go away from this world in peace without wishing you farewell Charley if you love me you will think of me when I am gone and then for my sake you will be steady Here were all her old words over again You will be steady won t you Charley I know you will be steady now How much must she have thought of him How often must his career have caused her misery and pain How laden must that innocent bosom have been with anxiety on his account He had promised her then that he would reform but he had broken his promise He now promised her again but how could he hope that she would believe him You know how ill I am don t you You know that I am dying Charley Charley of course declared that he still hoped that she would recover If I thought so said she I should not say what I am now saying but I feel that I may tell the truth Dear Charley dearest Charley I love you with all my heart I do not know how it came so I believe I have always loved you since I first knew you I used to think it was because you saved my life but I know it was not that I was so glad it was you that came to me in the water and not Harry so that I know I loved you before that Dear Katie you have not loved me or thought of me more than I have loved and thought of you Ah Charley she said smiling in her sad sweet way I don t think you know how a girl can love you have so many things to think of so much to amuse you up in London you don t know what it is to think of one person for days and days and nights and nights together That is the way I have thought of you I don t think there can be any harm she continued in loving a person as I have loved you Indeed how could I help it I did not love you on purpose But I think I should be wrong to die without telling you When I am dead Charley will you think of this and try try to give up your bad ways When I tell you that I love you so dearly and ask you on my deathbed I think you will do this Charley went down on his knees and bowing his head before her and before his God he made the promise He made it and we may so far anticipate the approaching end of our story as to declare that the promise he then made was faithfully kept Katie Katie my own Katie my own own own Katie oh Katie you must not die you must not leave me Oh Katie I have so dearly loved you Oh Katie I do so dearly love you If you knew all if you could know all you would believe me At this moment missus Woodward knocked at the door and Charley rose from his knees Not quite yet mamma said Katie as missus Woodward opened the door Not quite yet in five minutes mamma you may come missus Woodward not knowing how to refuse again went away Charley I never gave you anything but once and you returned it to me did you not Yes said he the purse I put it in your box because And then he remembered that he could not say why he had returned it without breaking in a manner that confidence which missus Woodward had put in him I understand it all You must not think I am angry with you I know how good you were about it But Charley you may have it back now here it is and putting her hand under the pillow she took it out carefully folded up in new tissue paper There Charley you must never part with it again as long as there are two threads of it together but I know you never will and Charley you must never talk of it to anybody but to your wife and you must tell her all about it He took the purse and put it to his lips and then pressed it to his heart No said he I will never part with it again I think I can promise that And now dearest good bye said she dearest dearest Charley good bye perhaps we shall know each other in heaven Kiss me Charley before you go So he stooped down over her and pressed his lips to hers Charley leaving the room found missus Woodward at the other end of the passage standing at the door of her own dressing room You are to go to her now he said Good bye and without further speech to any of them he hurried out of the house None but missus Woodward had seen him but she saw that the tears were streaming down his cheeks as he passed her and she expressed no surprise that he had left the Cottage without going through the formality of making his adieux And then he walked up to town as Norman once had done after a parting interview with her whom he had loved It might be difficult to say which at the moment suffered the bitterest grief CHAPTER XLIII MILLBANK The immediate neighbourhood of Millbank Penitentiary is not one which we should for its own sake choose for our residence either on account of its natural beauty or the excellence of its habitations That it is a salubrious locality must be presumed from the fact that it has been selected for the site of the institution in question but salubrity though doubtless a great recommendation would hardly reconcile us to the extremely dull and one might almost say ugly aspect which this district bears To this district however ugly as it is we must ask our readers to accompany us while we pay a short visit to poor Gertrude It was certainly a sad change from her comfortable nursery and elegant drawing room near Hyde Park Gertrude had hitherto never lived in an ugly house Surbiton Cottage and Albany Place were the only two homes that she remembered and neither of them was such as to give her much fitting preparation for the melancholy shelter which she found at No five Paradise Row Millbank But Gertrude did not think much of this when she changed her residence Early one morning leaning on Charley s arm she had trudged down across the Park through Westminster and on to the close vicinity of the prison and here they sought for and obtained such accommodation as she thought fitting to her present situation Charley had begged her to get into a cab and when she refused that had implored her to indulge in the luxury of an omnibus but Gertrude s mind was now set upon economy she would come back she said in an omnibus when the day would be hotter and she would be alone but she was very well able to walk the distance once She procured for seven shillings a week a sitting room and bedroom from whence she could see the gloomy prison walls and also a truckle bed for the young girl whom she was to bring with her as her maid This was a little Hampton maiden whom she had brought from the country to act as fag and deputy to her grand nurse but the grand nurse was now gone and the fag was promoted to the various offices of nurse lady s maid and parlour servant The rest of the household in Albany Place had already dispersed with the discreet view of bettering their situations Everything in the house was given up to pay what Alaric owed Independently of his dreadful liability to Madame Jaquetanape he could not have been said to be in debt but still like most other men who live as he had done when his career was thus brought to a sudden close it was found that there were many people looking for money There were little bills as the owners said of them which had been forgotten of course on account of their insignificance but which being so very little might now be paid equally of course without any trouble It is astonishing how easy it is to accumulate three or four hundred pounds worth of little bills when one lives before the world in a good house and in visible possession of a good income At the moment of Alaric s conviction there was but a slender stock of money forthcoming for these little bills The necessary expense of his trial and it had been by no means trifling he had of course been obliged to pay His salary had been suspended and all the money that he could lay his hands on had been given up towards making restitution towards the dreadful sum of Ltwenty thousand that had been his ruin The bills however did not come in till after his trial and then there was but little left but the furniture As the new trustees employed on behalf of Madame Jaquetanape and mister Figgs were well aware that they had much more to expect from the generosity of Tudor s friends than from any legal seizure of his property they did not interfere in the disposal of the chairs and tables But not on that account did Gertrude conceive herself entitled to make any use on her own behalf of such money as might come into her hands The bills should be paid and then every farthing that could be collected should be given towards lessening the deficiency Six thousand pounds had already been made up by the joint efforts of Norman and Captain Cuttwater Undy Scott s acknowledgement for the other four thousand had been offered but the new trustees declined to accept it as of any value whatsoever They were equally incredulous as to the bridge shares which from that day to this have never held up their heads even to the modest height of half a crown a share Gertrude s efforts to make the most of everything had been unceasing When her husband was sentenced she had in her possession a new dress and some finery for her baby which were not yet paid for these she took back with her own hand offering to the milliners her own trinkets by way of compensation for their loss When the day for removal came she took with her nothing that she imagined could be sold She would have left the grander part of her own wardrobe if the auctioneers would have undertaken to sell it Some few things books and trifling household articles which she thought were dear to Alaric she packed up and such were sent to Hampton On the day of her departure she dressed herself in a plain dark gown one that was almost mourning and then with her baby in her lap and her young maid beside her and Charley fronting her in the cab she started for her new home I had almost said that her pride had left her Such an assertion would be a gross libel on her No she was perhaps prouder than ever as she left her old home There was a humility in her cheap dress in her large straw bonnet coming far over her face in her dark gloves and little simple collar nay there was a humility in her altered voice and somewhat chastened mien but the spirit of the woman was wholly unbroken She had even a pride in her very position in her close and dear tie with the convicted prisoner She was his for better and for worse she would now show him what was her idea of the vow she had made To the men who came to ticket and number the furniture to the tradesmen s messengers who called for money to the various workmen with whom the house was then invaded she was humble enough but had missus Val come across her with pity or the Miss Neverbends with their sententious twaddlings she would have been prouder than ever Fallen indeed She had had no fall nor had he he was still a man with a greater aggregate of good in him than falls to the average lot of mortals Who would dare to tell her that he had fallen Twas thus that her pride was still strong within her and as it supported her through this misery who can blame her for it She was allowed into the prison twice a week on Tuesdays and Fridays she was permitted to spend one hour with her husband and to take her child with her It is hardly necessary to say that she was punctual to the appointed times This however occupied but a short period even of those looked for days and in spite of her pride and her constant needle the weary six months went from her all too slowly Nor did they pass with swifter foot within the prison Alaric was allowed the use of books and pens and paper but even with these he found a day in prison to be almost an unendurable eternity This was the real punishment of his guilt it was not that he could not eat well and lie soft or enjoy the comforts which had always surrounded him but that the day would not pass away The slowness of the lagging hours nearly drove him mad He made a thousand resolutions as to reading writing and employment for his mind He attempted to learn whole pages by rote and to fatigue himself to rest by exercise of his memory But his memory would not work his mind would continue idle he was impotent over his own faculties Oh if he could only sleep while these horrid weeks were passing over him All hope of regaining his situation had of course passed from him all hope of employment in England Emigration must now be his lot and hers also and the lot of that young one that was already born to them and of that other one who was alas now coming to the world whose fate it would be first to see the light under the walls of its father s prison Yes they must emigrate But there was nothing so very terrible in that Alaric felt that even his utter poverty would be no misfortune if only his captivity were over Poverty how could any man be poor who had liberty to roam the world We all of us acknowledge that the educated man who breaks the laws is justly liable to a heavier punishment than he who has been born in ignorance and bred as it were in the lap of sin but we hardly realize how much greater is the punishment which when he be punished the educated man is forced to undergo Confinement to the man whose mind has never been lifted above vacancy is simply remission from labour Confinement with labour is simply the enforcement of that which has hitherto been his daily lot But what must a prison be to him whose intellect has received the polish of the world s poetry who has known what it is to feed more than the belly to require other aliment than bread and meat And then what does the poor criminal lose His all it will be said and the rich can lose no more But this is not so No man loses his all by any sentence which a human judge can inflict No man so loses anything approaching to his all however much he may have lost before But the one man has too often had no self respect to risk the other has stood high in his own esteem has held his head proudly before the world has aspired to walk in some way after the fashion of a god Alaric had so aspired and how must he have felt during those prison days Of what nature must his thoughts have been when they turned to Gertrude and his child His sin had indeed been heavy and heavy was the penalty which he suffered When they had been thus living for about three months Gertrude s second child was born missus Woodward was with her at the time and she had suffered but little except that for three weeks she was unable to see her husband then in the teeth of all counsel and in opposition to all medical warning she could resist no longer and carried the newborn stranger to his father Poor little wretch said Alaric as he stooped to kiss him Wretch said Gertrude looking up to him with a smile upon her face he is no wretch He is a sturdy little man that shall yet live to make your heart dance with joy missus Woodward came often to see her She did not stay for there was no bed in which she could have slept but the train put her down at Vauxhall and she had but to pass the bridge and she was close to Gertrude s lodgings And now the six months had nearly gone by when by appointment she brought Norman with her At this time he had given up his clerkship at the Weights and Measures and was about to go to Normansgrove for the remainder of the winter Both Alaric and Norman had shown a great distaste to meet each other But Harry s heart softened towards Gertrude Her conduct during her husband s troubles had been so excellent that he could not but forgive her the injuries which he fancied he owed to her Everything was now prepared for their departure They were to sail on the very day after Alaric s liberation so as to save him from the misery of meeting those who might know him And now Harry came with missus Woodward to bid farewell probably for ever on this side the grave to her whom he had once looked on as his own How different were their lots now Harry was mister Norman of Normansgrove immediately about to take his place as the squire of his parish to sit among brother magistrates to decide about roads and poachers parish rates and other all absorbing topics to be a rural magistrate and fill a place among perhaps the most fortunate of the world s inhabitants Gertrude was the wife of a convicted felon who was about to come forth from his prison in utter poverty a man who in such a catalogue as the world makes of its inhabitants would be ranked among the very lowest And did Gertrude even now regret her choice No not for a moment She still felt certain in her heart of hearts that she had loved the one who was the most worthy of a woman s love We cannot probably all agree in her opinion but we will agree in this at least that she was now right to hold such opinion Had Normansgrove stretched from one boundary of the county to the other it would have weighed as nothing Had Harry s virtues been as bright as burnished gold and indeed they had been bright they would have weighed as nothing A nobler stamp of manhood was on her husband so at least Gertrude felt and manhood is the one virtue which in a woman s breast outweighs all others They had not met since the evening on which Gertrude had declared to him that she never could love him and Norman as he got out of the cab with missus Woodward at No five Paradise Row Millbank felt his heart beat within him almost as strongly as he had done when he was about to propose to her He followed missus Woodward into the dingy little house and immediately found himself in Gertrude s presence I should exaggerate the fact were I to say that he would not have known her but had he met her elsewhere met her where he did not expect to meet her he would have looked at her more than once before he felt assured that he was looking at Gertrude Woodward It was not that she had grown pale or worn or haggard though indeed her face had on it that weighty look of endurance which care will always give it was not that she had lost her beauty and become unattractive in his eyes but that the whole nature of her mien and form the very trick of her gait was changed Her eye was as bright as ever but it was steady composed and resolved her lips were set and compressed and there was no playfulness round her mouth Her hair was still smooth and bright but it was more brushed off from her temples than it had been of yore and was partly covered by a bit of black lace which we presume we must call a cap here and there too through it Norman s quick eye detected a few grey hairs She was stouter too than she had been or else she seemed to be so from the changes in her dress Her step fell heavier on the floor than it used to do and her voice was quicker and more decisive in its tones When she spoke to her mother she did so as one sister might do to another and indeed missus Woodward seemed to exercise over her very little of the authority of a parent The truth was that Gertrude had altogether ceased to be a girl had altogether become a woman Linda with whom Norman at once compared her though but one year younger was still a child in comparison with her elder sister Happy happy Linda Gertrude had certainly proved herself to be an excellent wife but perhaps she might have made herself more pleasing to others if she had not so entirely thrown off from herself all traces of juvenility Could she in this respect have taken a lesson from her mother she would have been a wiser woman We have said that she consorted with missus Woodward as though they had been sisters but one might have said that Gertrude took on herself the manners of the elder sister It is true that she had hard duties to perform a stern world to overcome an uphill fight before her with poverty distress and almost nay absolutely with degradation It was well for her and Alaric that she could face it all with the true courage of an honest woman But yet those who had known her in her radiant early beauty could not but regret that the young freshness of early years should all have been laid aside so soon Linda at any rate far exceeds her in beauty was Norman s first thought as he stood for a moment to look at her and then Linda too is so much more feminine Twas thus that Harry Norman consoled himself in the first moment of his first interview with Alaric s wife And he was right in his thoughts The world would now have called Linda the more lovely of the two and certainly the more feminine in the ladylike sense of the word If however devotion be feminine and truth to one selected life s companion if motherly care be so and an indomitable sense of the duties due to one s own household then Gertrude was not deficient in feminine character You find me greatly altered Harry do you not said she taking his hand frankly and perceiving immediately the effect which she had made upon him I am a steady old matron am I not with a bairn on each side of me and she pointed to her baby in the cradle and to her other boy sitting on his grandmother s knee Harry said he did find her altered It was her dress he said and the cap on her head Yes Harry and some care and trouble too To you you know to a friend such as you are I must own that care and trouble do tell upon one Not thank God that I have more than I can bear not that I have not blessings for which I cannot but be too thankful And so these are your boys Gertrude Yes said she cheerfully these are the little men that in the good times coming will be managing vast kingdoms and giving orders to this worn out old island of yours Alley my boy sing your new song about the good and happy land But Alley who had got hold of his grandmother s watch and was staring with all his eyes at the stranger did not seem much inclined to be musical at the present moment And this is Charley s godson continued Gertrude taking up the baby Dear Charley he has been such a comfort to me I have heard all about you daily from him said Harry I know you have and he is daily talking of you Harry And so he should do so we all should do What a glorious change this is for him is it not Harry Charley by this time had torn himself away from mister Snape and the navvies and transferred the whole of his official zeal and energies to the Weights and Measures The manner and reason of this must however be explained in a subsequent chapter Yes said Harry he has certainly got into a better office And he will do well there I am sure he will It was impossible he should do well at that other place No man could do so He is quite an altered man now The only fault I find with him is that he is so full of his heroes and heroines So he is Harry he is always asking me what he is to do with some forlorn lady or gentleman Oh smother her I said the other day Well said he with a melancholy gravity I ll try it but I fear it won t answer Poor Charley what a friend you have been to him Harry A friend said missus Woodward who was still true to her adoration of Norman Indeed he has been a friend a friend to us all Who is there like him Gertrude could have found it in her heart to go back to the subject of old days and tell her mother that there was somebody much better even than Harry Norman But the present was hardly a time for such an assertion of her own peculiar opinion Yes Harry she said we have all much too much to thank you for I have to thank you on his account Oh no said he ungraciously there is nothing to thank me for not on his account Your mother and Captain Cuttwater and then he stopped himself What he meant was that he had sacrificed his little fortune for at the time his elder brother had still been living not to rescue or in attempting to rescue his old friend from misfortune not at least because that man had been his friend but because he was the husband of Gertrude Woodward and of missus Woodward s daughter Could he have laid bare his heart he would have declared that Alaric Tudor owed him nothing that he had never forgiven never could forgive the wrongs he had received from him but that he had forgiven Alaric s wife and that having done so in the tenderness of his heart he had been ready to give up all that he possessed for her protection He would have spared Gertrude what pain he could but he would not lie and speak of Alaric Tudor with affection But there is Harry there is said Gertrude much too much greatly too much It is that now weighs me down more than anything Oh Harry how are we to pay to you all this money It is with missus Woodward said he coldly and Captain Cuttwater not with me that you should speak of that mister Tudor owes me nothing Oh Harry Harry said she do not call him mister Tudor pray pray now that we are going now that we shall never wound your sight again do not call him mister Tudor He has done wrong I do not deny it but which of us is there that has not It was not on that account said he I could forgive all that Gertrude understood him and her cheeks and brow became tinged with red It was not from shame nor yet wholly from a sense of anger but mingled feelings filled her heart feelings which she could in nowise explain If you have forgiven him that she would have said had she thought it right to speak out her mind if you have forgiven him that then there is nothing left for further forgiveness Gertrude had twice a better knowledge of the world than he had twice a quicker perception of how things were going and should be made to go She saw that it was useless to refer further to her husband Norman had come there at her request to say adieu to her that she and he who had been friends since she was a child might see each other before they were separated for ever by half a world and that they might part in love and charity She would be his sister in law he would be son to her mother husband to her Linda he had been though he now denied it her husband s staunchest friend in his extremity and it would have added greatly to the bitterness of her departure had she been forced to go without speaking to him one kindly word The opportunity was given to her and she would not utterly mar its sweetness by insisting on his injustice to her husband They all remained silent for a while during which Gertrude fondled her baby and Norman produced before the elder boy some present that he had brought for him Now Alley said missus Woodward you re a made man won t that do beautifully to play with on board the big ship And so Harry you have given up official life altogether said Gertrude Yes said he the last day of the last year saw my finale at the Weights and Measures I did not live long officially to enjoy my promotion I almost wish myself back again You ll go in on melting days like the retired tallow chandler said Gertrude but joking apart I wish you joy on your freedom from thraldom a government office in England is thraldom If a man were to give his work only it would be well All men who have to live by labour must do that but a man has to give himself as well as his work to sacrifice his individuality to become body and soul a part of a lumbering old machine This hardly came well from Gertrude seeing that Alaric at any rate had never been required to sacrifice any of his individuality But she was determined to hate all the antecedents of his life as though those antecedents and not the laxity of his own principles had brought about his ruin She was prepared to live entirely for the future and to look back on her London life as bad tasteless and demoralizing England to her was no longer a glorious country for England s laws had made a felon of her husband She would go to a new land new hopes new ideas new freedom new work new life and new ambition Excelsior there was no longer an excelsior left for talent and perseverance in this effete country She and hers would soon find room for their energies in a younger land and as she went she could not but pity those whom she left behind Her reasoning was hardly logical but perhaps it was not unfortunate For myself said Norman not quite following all this I always liked the Civil Service and now I leave it with a sort of regret I am quite glad that Charley has my old desk it will keep up a sort of tie between me and the place What does Linda say about it mamma Linda and I are both of Harry s way of thinking said missus Woodward because Normansgrove is such a distance Distance repeated Gertrude with something of sorrow but more of scorn in her tone Distance mamma why you can get to her between breakfast and dinner Think where Melbourne is mamma It has nearly broken my heart to think of it said missus Woodward And you will still have Linda mamma and our darling Katie and Harry and dear Charley If the idea of distance should frighten anyone it is me But nothing shall frighten me while I have my husband and children Harry you must not let mamma be too often alone when some other knight shall have come and taken away Katie We will take her to Normansgrove for good and all if she will let us said Harry And now the time came for them to part Harry was to say good bye to her and then to see her no more Early on the following morning Gertrude was to go to Hampton and see Katie for the last time to see Katie for the last time and the Cottage and the shining river and all the well known objects among which she had passed her life To missus Woodward to Linda and Katie all this was subject of inexpressible melancholy but with Gertrude every feeling of romance seemed to have been absorbed by the realities of life She would of course go to Katie and give her a farewell embrace since Katie was still too weak to come to her she would say farewell to Uncle Bat to whom she and Alaric owed so much she would doubtless shed a tear or two and feel some emotion at parting even from the inanimate associations of her youth but all this would now impress no lasting sorrow on her She was eager to be off eager for her new career eager that he should stand on a soil where he could once more face his fellow creatures without shame She panted to put thousands of leagues of ocean between him and his disgrace On the following morning Gertrude was to go to Hampton for two hours and then to return to Millbank with her mother and sister for whose accommodation a bed had been hired in the neighbourhood On that evening Alaric would be released from his prison and then before daybreak on the following day they were to take their way to the far off docks and place themselves on board the vessel which was to carry them to their distant home God bless you Gertrude said Norman whose eyes were not dry God Almighty bless you Harry you and Linda and make you happy If Linda does not write constantly very constantly you must do it for her We have delayed the happiness of your marriage Harry you must forgive us that as well as all our other trespasses I fear Linda will never forgive that You won t find her unmerciful on that score said he Dear Gertrude good bye She put up her face to him and he kissed her for the first time in his life He bade me give you his love said she in her last whisper I must you know do his bidding Norman s heart palpitated so that he could hardly compose his voice for his last answer but even then he would not be untrue to his inexorable obstinacy he could not send his love to a man he did not love Tell him said he that he has my sincerest wishes for success wherever he may be and Gertrude I need hardly say but he could get no further And so they parted CHAPTER XLIV THE CRIMINAL POPULATION IS DISPOSED OF Before we put Alaric on board the ship which is to take him away from the land in which he might have run so exalted a career we must say one word as to the fate and fortunes of his old friend Undy Scott This gentleman has not been represented in our pages as an amiable or high minded person He has indeed been the bad spirit of the tale the Siva of our mythology the devil that has led our hero into temptation the incarnation of evil which it is always necessary that the novelist should have personified in one of his characters to enable him to bring about his misfortunes his tragedies and various requisite catastrophes Scott had his Varney and such like Dickens his Bill Sykes and such like all of whom are properly disposed of before the end of those volumes in which are described their respective careers 
6583-48224-0000	train-other-500	I have ventured to introduce to my readers as my devil mister Undy Scott M P for the Tillietudlem district burghs and I also feel myself bound to dispose of him though of him
6583-48224-0001	train-other-500	I regret I cannot make so decent an end as was done with Sir Richard Varney and Bill Sykes He deserves however as severe a fate as either of those heroes With the former we will not attempt to compare him
none	none	 as the vices and devilry of the days of Queen Elizabeth are in no way similar to those in which we indulge but with Bill Sykes we may contrast him as they flourished in the same era and had their points of similitude as well as their points of difference 
6583-48224-0002	train-other-500	They were both apparently born to prey on their own species they both resolutely adhered to a fixed rule
none	none	 that they would in nowise earn their bread 
6583-48224-0003	train-other-500	and to a rule equally fixed that though they would earn no bread they would consume much They were both of them blessed with a total absence of sensibility and an utter disregard to the pain of others and had
6583-48224-0004	train-other-500	no other use for a heart than that of a machine for maintaining the circulation of the blood It is but little to say that neither of them ever acted on principle on a knowledge that is of right and wrong
6583-48224-0005	train-other-500	and a selection of the right in their studies of the science of evil they had progressed much further than this and had taught themselves to believe that that which other men called virtue was on its own account to be regarded as mawkish insipid and useless
6583-48224-0006	train-other-500	for such purposes as the acquisition of money or pleasure whereas vice was on its own account to be preferred as offering the only road to those things which they were desirous of possessing
6583-48224-0007	train-other-500	So far there was a great resemblance between Bill Sykes and mister Scott but then came the points of difference which must give to the latter a great pre eminence in the eyes of that master whom they had both so worthily served
6583-48224-0008	train-other-500	Bill could not boast the merit of selecting the course which he had run he had served the Devil having had as it were no choice in the matter he was born and bred and educated an evil doer
none	none	 and could hardly have deserted from the colours of his great Captain without some spiritual interposition to enable him to do so To Undy a warmer reward must surely be due he had been placed fairly on the world s surface with power to choose between good and bad and had deliberately taken the latter 
6583-48224-0009	train-other-500	to him had at any rate been explained the theory of meum and tuum and he had resolved that he liked tuum better than meum he had learnt that there is a God ruling over us and a Devil hankering after us
none	none	 and had made up his mind 
6583-48224-0010	train-other-500	that he would belong to the latter Bread and water would have come to him naturally without any villany on his part aye and meat and milk and wine and oil the fat things of the world but he elected to be a villain
6583-48224-0011	train-other-500	he liked to do the Devil s bidding Surely he was the better servant surely he shall have the richer reward And yet poor Bill Sykes for whom here I would willingly say a word or two
none	none	 could I by so saying mitigate the wrath against him 
6583-48224-0012	train-other-500	is always held as the more detestable scoundrel Lady
none	none	 you now know them both Is it not the fact that knowing him as you do you could spend a pleasant hour enough with mister Scott sitting next to him at dinner 
6583-48224-0013	train-other-500	whereas your blood would creep within you your hair would stand on end your voice would stick in your throat if you were suddenly told that Bill Sykes was in your presence Poor Bill I have a sort of love for him
6583-48224-0014	train-other-500	as he walks about wretched with that dog of his though I know that it is necessary to hang him Yes Bill I your friend cannot gainsay that must acknowledge that Hard as the case may be you must be hung
none	none	 hung out of the way of further mischief my spoons my wife s throat my children s brains demand that You Bill and polecats and such like must be squelched when we can come across you 
6583-48224-0015	train-other-500	seeing that you make yourself so universally disagreeable It is your ordained nature to be disagreeable you plead silently I know it I admit the hardship of your case but still my Bill
none	none	 self preservation is the first law of nature You must be hung But while hanging you I admit that you are more sinned against than sinning There is another Bill another who will surely take account of this in some way though it is not for me to tell you how Yes I hang Bill Sykes with soft regret 
6583-48224-0016	train-other-500	but with what a savage joy with what exultation of heart with what alacrity of eager soul with what aptitude of mind to the deed would I hang my friend Undy Scott the member of Parliament for the Tillietudlem burghs
none	none	 if I could but get at his throat for such a purpose Hang him aye as high as Haman 
6583-48224-0017	train-other-500	In this there would be no regret no vacillation of purpose no doubt as to the propriety of the sacrifice no feeling that I was so treating him not for his own desert but for my advantage We hang men I believe
none	none	 with this object only 
6583-48224-0018	train-other-500	that we should deter others from crime but in hanging Bill we shall hardly deter his brother Bill Sykes must look to crime for his bread seeing that he has been so educated seeing that we have not yet taught him another trade
6583-48224-0019	train-other-500	But if I could hang Undy Scott I think I should deter some others The figure of Undy swinging from a gibbet at the broad end of Lombard Street would have an effect
none	none	 Ah my fingers itch to be at the rope 
6583-48224-0020	train-other-500	Fate however and the laws are averse To gibbet him in one sense would have been my privilege had I drunk deeper from that Castalian
none	none	 rill whose dark waters are tinged with the gall of poetic indignation 
6583-48224-0021	train-other-500	but as in other sense I may not hang him I will tell how he was driven from his club
none	none	 and how he ceased to number himself among the legislators of his country 
6583-48224-0022	train-other-500	Undy Scott among his other good qualities possessed an enormous quantity of that which schoolboys in these days call cheek He was not easily browbeaten and was generally prepared to browbeat others
6583-48224-0023	train-other-500	mister Chaffanbrass certainly did get the better of him but then mister Chaffanbrass was on his own dunghill Could Undy Scott have had mister Chaffanbrass down at the clubs there would have been perhaps another tale to tell
none	none	 Give me the cock that can crow in any yard such cocks however we know are scarce Undy Scott as he left the Old Bailey was aware that he had cut a sorry figure and felt that he must immediately do something to put himself right again 
6583-48224-0024	train-other-500	at any rate before his portion of the world He must perform some exploit uncommonly cheeky in order to cover his late discomfiture
6583-48224-0025	train-other-500	To get the better of mister Chaffanbrass at the Old Bailey had been beyond him but he might yet do something at the clubs to set aside the unanimous verdict which had been given against him in the city Nay he must do something
none	none	 unless he was prepared to go to the wall utterly and at once Going to the wall with Undy would mean absolute ruin he lived but on the cheekiness of his gait and habits he had become member of Parliament Government official railway director and club aristocrat merely by dint of cheek 
6583-48224-0026	train-other-500	He had now received a great blow he had stood before a crowd and been annihilated by the better cheek of mister Chaffanbrass and therefore it behoved him at once to do something When the perfume of the rose grows stale
6583-48224-0027	train-other-500	the flower is at once thrown aside and carried off as foul refuse It behoved Undy to see that his perfume was maintained in its purity or he too would be carried off
6583-48224-0028	train-other-500	The club to which Undy more especially belonged was called the Downing and of this Alaric was also a member having been introduced into it by his friend
none	none	 Here had Alaric spent by far too many of the hours of his married life and had become well known and popular At the time of his conviction the summer was far advanced it was then August but Parliament was still sitting 
6583-48224-0029	train-other-500	and there were sufficient club men remaining in London to create a daily gathering at the Downing On the day following that on which the verdict was found Undy convened a special committee of the club in order that he might submit to it a proposition
6583-48224-0030	train-other-500	which he thought it indispensable should come from him so at least he declared The committee did assemble and when Undy met it he saw among the faces before him not a few with whom he would willingly have dispensed However
none	none	 he had come there to exercise his cheek no one there should cow him the wig of mister Chaffanbrass was at any rate absent And so he submitted his proposition 
6583-48224-0031	train-other-500	I need not trouble my readers with the neat little speech in which it was made Undy was true to himself and the speech was neat The proposition was this that as he had unfortunately been the means of introducing mister Alaric Tudor to the club
6583-48224-0032	train-other-500	he considered it to be his duty to suggest that the name of that gentleman should be struck off the books He then expressed his unmitigated disgust at the crime of which Tudor had been found guilty uttered some nice little platitudes
none	none	 in the cause of virtue 
6583-48224-0033	train-other-500	and expressed a hope that he might so far refer to a personal matter as to say that his father s family would take care that the lady whose fortune had been the subject of the trial should not lose one penny through the dishonesty of her trustee
none	none	 Oh Undy as high as Haman if I could as high as Haman and if not in Lombard Street then on that open ground where Waterloo Place bisects Pall Mall so that all the clubs might see thee He would advert he said to one other matter though perhaps his doing so was unnecessary It was probably known to them all that he had been a witness at the late trial an iniquitous attempt had been made by the prisoner s counsel to connect his name with the prisoner s guilt They all too well knew the latitude allowed to lawyers in the criminal courts to pay much attention to this Had he Undy Scott in any way infringed the laws of his country he was there to answer for it But he would go further than this and declare that if any member of that club doubted his probity in the matter he was perfectly willing to submit to such member documents which would c c He finished his speech and an awful silence reigned around him No enthusiastic ardour welcomed the well loved Undy back to his club and comforted him after the rough usage of the unpolished Chaffanbrass 
6583-48224-0034	train-other-500	No ten or twenty combined voices expressed by their clamorous negation of the last proposed process that their Undy was above reproach The eyes around looked into him
none	none	 with no friendly alacrity 
6583-48224-0035	train-other-500	Undy Undy more cheek still still more cheek or you are surely lost If said he in a well assumed indignant tone of injured innocence there be
none	none	 any in the club who do suspect me of anything unbecoming a gentleman in this affair I am willing to retire from it till the matter shall have been investigated 
6583-48224-0036	train-other-500	but in such case I demand that the investigation be immediate Oh Undy Undy
none	none	 the supply of cheek is not bad it is all but unlimited 
6583-48224-0037	train-other-500	but yet it suffices thee not Can there be positions in this modern West End world of mine thought Undy to himself in which cheek unbounded cheek will not suffice Oh Undy they are rare
none	none	 but still there are such and this unfortunately for thee seemeth to be one of them And then got up a discreet old baronet one who moveth not often in the affairs around him but who when he moveth stirreth many waters a man of broad acres and a quiet well assured fame which has grown to him without his seeking it as barnacles grow to the stout keel when it has been long a swimming him of all men 
6583-48224-0038	train-other-500	would Undy have wished to see unconcerned with these matters
none	none	 Not in many words nor eloquent did Sir Thomas speak He felt it his duty he said to second the proposal made by mister Scott 
6583-48224-0039	train-other-500	for removing mister Tudor from amongst them He had watched this trial with some care and he pitied mister Tudor from the bottom of his heart
none	none	 He would not have thought that he could have felt so strong a sympathy for a man convicted of dishonesty 
6583-48224-0040	train-other-500	But mister Tudor had been convicted
none	none	 and he must incur the penalties of his fault 
6583-48224-0041	train-other-500	One of these penalties must undoubtedly be his banishment from this club He therefore seconded mister Scott s proposal He then stood silent for a moment having finished that task but yet he did not sit down
6583-48224-0042	train-other-500	Why oh why does he not sit down why O Undy does he thus stand
none	none	 looking at the surface of the table on which he is leaning 
6583-48224-0043	train-other-500	And now he said he had another proposition to make
none	none	 and that was that mister Undecimus Scott should also be expelled from the club 
6583-48224-0044	train-other-500	and having so spoken in a voice of unusual energy he then sat down And now Undy you may as well pack up and be off without further fuss to Boulogne Ostend or some such idle
6583-48224-0045	train-other-500	Elysium with such money scrapings as you may be able to collect together No importunity will avail thee
none	none	 anything against the judges and jurymen who are now trying thee One word from that silent old baronet was worse to thee 
6583-48224-0046	train-other-500	than all that mister Chaffanbrass could say Come pack up and begone But he was still a Member of Parliament
none	none	 The Parliament however was about to be dissolved and of course 
6583-48224-0047	train-other-500	it would be useless for him to stand again he like mister
none	none	 M Buffer had had his spell of it 
6583-48224-0048	train-other-500	and he recognized the necessity of vanishing He at first thought that his life as a legislator might be allowed to come to a natural end that he might die as it were in his bed without suffering the acute pain of applying for the
none	none	 Chiltern Hundreds In this however he found himself wrong The injured honour of all the Tillietudlemites rose against him with one indignant shout and a rumour a horrid rumour of a severer fate met his ears 
6583-48224-0049	train-other-500	He applied at once for the now coveted sinecure and was refused Her Majesty could not consent to entrust to him the duties of the situation in question
none	none	 and in lieu thereof the House expelled him by its unanimous voice 
6583-48224-0050	train-other-500	And now indeed it was time for him to pack and begone He was now liable to the vulgarest persecution from the vulgar herd his very tailor and bootmaker would beleaguer him
6583-48224-0051	train-other-500	and coarse unwashed bailiffs take him by the collar Yes now indeed it was time to be off And off he was
none	none	 He paid one fleeting visit to my Lord 
6583-48224-0052	train-other-500	at Cauldkail Castle collecting what little he might another to his honourable wife adding some slender increase to his little budget and then he was off Whither it is needless to say to Hamburg perhaps
6583-48224-0053	train-other-500	or to Ems or the richer tables of Homburg How he flourished for a while with ambiguous success how he talked to the young English tourists of what he had done when in Parliament especially for the rights of married women
6583-48224-0054	train-other-500	how he poked his Honourable card in every one s way and lugged Lord Gaberlunzie into all conversations
none	none	 how his face became pimply and his wardrobe seedy and how at last his wretched life will ooze out from him in some dark corner like the filthy juice of a decayed fungus which makes hideous the hidden wall on which it bursts all this is unnecessary more particularly to describe He is probably still living and those who desire his acquaintance will find him creeping round some gambling table 
6583-48224-0055	train-other-500	and trying to look as though he had in his pocket ample means to secure those hoards of money which men are so listlessly raking about From our view he has now vanished It was a bitter February morning
none	none	 when two cabs stood packing themselves at No five Paradise Row 
6583-48224-0056	train-other-500	Millbank It was hardly yet six o clock and Paradise Row was dark as Erebus that solitary gas light sticking out from the wall of the prison only made darkness visible
none	none	 the tallow candles which were brought in and out with every article that was stuffed under a seat or into a corner would get themselves blown out and the sleet which was falling fast made the wicks wet so that they could with difficulty 
6583-48224-0057	train-other-500	be relighted But at last the cabs were packed with luggage and into one got Gertrude with her husband her baby and her mother and into the other Charley handed Linda then Alley and lastly
none	none	 the youthful maiden who humbly begged his pardon as she stepped up to the vehicle 
6583-48224-0058	train-other-500	and then having given due directions to the driver he not without difficulty squeezed himself into the remaining space Such journeys as these are always made at a slow pace
6583-48224-0059	train-other-500	Cabmen know very well who must go fast and who may go slow Women with children going on board an emigrant vessel at six o clock on a February morning may be taken very slowly
6583-48224-0060	train-other-500	And very slowly Gertrude and her party were taken Time had been nay it was but the other day when Alaric s impatient soul would have spurned at such a pace as this But now he sat tranquil enough
none	none	 His wife held one of his hands and the other he pressed against his eyes as though shading them from the light Light there was none but he had not yet learnt to face missus Woodward even in the darkness He had come out of the prison on the day before and had spent an evening with her It is needless to say that no one had upbraided him that no one had hinted that his backslidings had caused all this present misery had brought them all to that wretched cabin 
6583-48224-0061	train-other-500	and would on the morrow separate perhaps for ever a mother and a child who loved each other so dearly No one spoke to him of this perhaps no one thought of it he however
6583-48224-0062	train-other-500	did so think of it that he could not hold his head up before them He was ill Gertrude said his long confinement had prostrated him but the sea air would revive him in a day or two
none	none	 And then she made herself busy and got the tea for them and strove not wholly in vain to drive dull care away But slowly as the cabs went in spite of Charley s vocal execrations they did get to the docks in time Who indeed was ever too late at the docks Who that ever went there had not to linger 
6583-48224-0063	train-other-500	linger linger till every shred of patience was clean worn out They got to the docks in time and got on board that fast sailing clipper built never beaten always healthy ship the Flash of Lightning
6583-48224-0064	train-other-500	five thousand six hundred tons A one Why
none	none	 we have often wondered are ships designated as A one 
6583-48224-0065	train-other-500	seeing that all ships are of that class Where is the excellence seeing that all share it
none	none	 Of course the Flash of Lightning was A one 
6583-48224-0066	train-other-500	The author has for years been looking out and has not yet found a ship advertised as A two or even as B one What is this catalogue of comparative excellence of which there is but one visible number
6583-48224-0067	train-other-500	The world we think makes a great mistake on the subject of saying or acting farewell
none	none	 The word or deed should partake of the suddenness of electricity 
6583-48224-0068	train-other-500	but we all drawl through it at a snail s pace We are supposed to tear ourselves from our friends but tearing is a process which should be done quickly What is so wretched as lingering over a last kiss
6583-48224-0069	train-other-500	giving the hand for the third time saying over and over again Good bye John God bless you and mind you write Who has not seen his dearest friends standing round the window of a railway carriage while the train would not start
6583-48224-0070	train-other-500	and has not longed to say to them Stand not upon the order of your going but go at once And of all such farewells the ship s farewell is the longest and the most dreary One sits on a damp bench
none	none	 snuffing up the odour of oil and ropes cudgelling one s brains to think what further word of increased tenderness can be spoken No tenderer word can be spoken One returns again and again to the weather 
6583-48224-0071	train-other-500	to coats and cloaks perhaps even to sandwiches and the sherry flask All effect is thus destroyed and a trespass is made even on the domain of feeling I remember a line of poetry
none	none	 learnt in my earliest youth and which I believe to have emanated from a sentimental Frenchman a man of genius with whom my parents were acquainted It is as follows Are you go Is you gone 
6583-48224-0072	train-other-500	And I left Vera vell Now the whole business of a farewell is contained in that line When the moment comes let that be said let that be said and felt and then let the dear ones depart
6583-48224-0073	train-other-500	missus Woodward and Gertrude God bless them had never studied the subject They knew no better than to sit in the nasty cabin surrounded by boxes stewards porters children and abominations of every kind
6583-48224-0074	train-other-500	holding each other s hands and pressing damp handkerchiefs to their eyes The delay the lingering upset even Gertrude and brought her for a moment down to the usual level of leave taking womanhood Alaric the meanwhile
none	none	 stood leaning over the taffrail with Charley as mute as the fishes beneath him Write to us the moment you get there said Charley How often had the injunction been given 
6583-48224-0075	train-other-500	And now we had better get off you ll be better when we are gone Alaric Charley had some sense of the truth about
none	none	 him and Alaric take my word for it I ll come and set the Melbourne Weights and Measures to rights before long I ll come and weigh your gold for you We had better be going now said Charley looking down into the cabin they may let loose and be off any moment now Oh Charley not yet not yet 
6583-48224-0076	train-other-500	said Linda clinging to her sister You ll have to go down to the Nore if you stay that s all said Charley And then again began the kissing and the crying Yes
6583-48224-0077	train-other-500	ye dear ones it is hard to part it is hard for the mother to see the child of her bosom torn from her for ever
none	none	 it is cruel that sisters should be severed it is a harsh sentence for the world to give 
6583-48224-0078	train-other-500	that of such a separation as this These O ye loving hearts are the penalties of love Those that are content to love
none	none	 must always be content to pay them 
6583-48224-0079	train-other-500	Go mamma go said Gertrude
none	none	 dearest best sweetest mother my own own mother go Linda darling Linda Give my kindest love to Harry Charley you and Harry will be good to mamma I know you will And mamma and then she whispered to her mother one last prayer in Charley s favour she may love him now indeed she may Alaric came to them at the last moment missus Woodward said he say that you forgive me I do said she embracing him God knows that I do but Alaric remember what a treasure you possess And so they parted May God speed the wanderers CHAPTER XLV THE FATE OF THE NAVVIES And now having dispatched Alaric and his wife and bairns on their long journey we must go back for a while and tell how Charley had been transformed from an impudent idle young Navvy into a well conducted zealous young Weights When Alaric was convicted Charley had as we all know belonged to the Internal Navigation when the six months sentence had expired Charley was in full blow at the decorous office in Whitehall and during the same period Norman had resigned and taken on himself the new duties of a country squire The change which had been made had affected others than Charley It had been produced by one of those far stretching world moving commotions which now and then occur sometimes twice or thrice in a generation and perhaps not again for half a century causing timid men to whisper in corners and the brave and high spirited to struggle with the struggling waves so that when the storm subsides they may be found floating on the surface A moral earthquake had been endured by a portion of the Civil Service of the country The Internal Navigation had No my prognostic reader it had not been reformed no new blood had been infused into it no attempt had been made to produce a better discipline by the appointment of a younger secretary there had been no carting away of decayed wood in the shape of mister Snape or gathering of rank weeds in the form of mister Corkscrew nothing of the kind had been attempted No the disease had gone too far either for phlebotomy purging or cautery The Internal Navigation had ceased to exist Its demise had been in this wise It may be remembered that some time since mister Oldeschole had mentioned in the hearing of mister Snape that things were going wrong Sir Gregory Hardlines had expressed an adverse opinion as to the Internal Navigation and worse ten times worse than that there had been an article in the Times Now we all know that if anything is ever done in any way towards improvement in these days the public press does it And we all know also of what the public press consists mister Oldeschole knew this well and even mister Snape had a glimmering idea of the truth When he read that article mister Oldeschole felt that his days were numbered and mister Snape when he heard of it began to calculate for the hundredth time to what highest amount of pension he might be adjudged to be entitled by a liberal minded Treasury minute mister Oldeschole began to set his house in order hopelessly for any such effort the time was gone by It was too late for the office to be so done by and too late for mister Oldeschole to do it He had no aptitude for new styles and modern improvements he could not understand Sir Gregory s code of rules and was dumbfounded by the Civil Service requisitions that were made upon him from time to time Then came frequent calls for him to attend at Sir Gregory s office There a new broom had been brought in in the place of our poor friend Alaric a broom which seemed determined to sweep all before it with an unmitigable energy mister Oldeschole found that he could not stand at all before this young Hercules seeing that his special stall was considered to be the foulest in the whole range of the Augean stables He soon saw that the river was to be turned in on him and that he was to be officially obliterated in the flood The civility of those wonder doing demigods those Magi of the Civil Service office was most oppressive to him When he got to the board he was always treated with a deference which he knew was but a prelude to barbaric tortures They would ask him to sit down in a beautiful new leathern arm chair as though he were really some great man and then examine him as they would a candidate for the Custom House smiling always but looking at him as though they were determined to see through him They asked him all manner of questions but there was one question which they put to him day after day for four days that nearly drove him mad It was always put by that horrid young lynx eyed new commissioner who sat there with his hair brushed high from off his forehead peering out of his capacious excellently washed shirt collars a personification of conscious official zeal And now mister Oldeschole if you have had leisure to consider the question more fully perhaps you can define to us what is the hum hm the use hm hm the exact use of the Internal Navigation Office And then Sir Warwick would go on looking through his millstone as though now he really had a hope of seeing something and Sir Gregory would lean back in his chair and rubbing his hands slowly over each other like a great Akinetos as he was wait leisurely for mister Oldeschole s answer or rather for his no answer What a question was this to ask of a man who had spent all his life in the Internal Navigation Office O reader should it chance that thou art a clergyman imagine what it would be to thee wert thou asked what is the exact use of the Church of England and that too by some stubborn catechist whom thou wert bound to answer or if a lady happy in a husband and family say what would be thy feelings if demanded to define the exact use of matrimony Use Is it not all in all to thee mister Oldeschole felt a hearty inward conviction that his office had been of very great use In the first place had he not drawn from it a thousand a year for the last five and twenty years had it not given maintenance and employment to many worthy men who might perhaps have found it difficult to obtain maintenance elsewhere had it not always been an office a public office of note and reputation with proper work assigned to it The use of it the exact use of it mister Oldeschole at last declared with some indignation in his tone that he had been there for forty years and knew well that the office was very useful but that he would not undertake to define its exact use Thank you thank you mister Oldeschole that will do I think said the very spruce looking new gentleman out of his shirt collars In these days there was a kind of prescience at the Internal Navigation that something special was going to be done with them mister Oldeschole said nothing openly but it may be presumed that he did whisper somewhat to those of the seniors around him in whom he most confided And then his frequent visits to Whitehall were spoken of even by the most thoughtless of the navvies and the threatenings of the coming storm revealed themselves with more or less distinctness to every mind At last the thundercloud broke and the bolt fell mister Oldeschole was informed that the Lords of the Treasury had resolved on breaking up the establishment and providing for the duties in another way As the word duties passed Sir Gregory s lips a slight smile was seen to hover round the mouth of the new commissioner mister Oldeschole would he was informed receive an official notification to this effect on the following morning and on the following morning accordingly a dispatch arrived of great length containing the resolution of my Lords and putting an absolute extinguisher on the life of every navvy How mister Oldeschole with tears streaming down his cheeks communicated the tidings to the elder brethren and how the elder brethren with palpitating hearts and quivering voices repeated the tale to the listening juniors I cannot now describe The boldest spirits were then cowed the loudest miscreants were then silenced there were but few gibes but little jeering at the Internal Navigation on that day though Charley who had already other hopes contrived to keep up his spirits The men stood about talking in clusters and old animosities were at an end The lamb sat down with the wolf and mister Snape and Dick Scatterall became quite confidential I knew it was going to happen said mister Snape to him Indeed mister Oldeschole has been consulting us about it for some time but I must own I did not think it would be so sudden I must own that If you knew it was coming said Corkscrew why didn t you tell a chap I was not at liberty said mister Snape looking very wise We shall all have liberty enough now said Scatterall I wonder what they ll do with us eh Charley I believe they will send the worst of us to Spike Island or Dartmoor prison said Charley but mister Snape no doubt has heard and can tell us Oh come Charley It don t do to chaff now said a young navvy who was especially down in the mouth I wonder will they do anything for a fellow I heard my uncle in Parliament Street say that when a chap has got any infested interest in a thing they can t turn him out said Corkscrew and my uncle is a parliamentary agent Can t they though said Scatterall It seems to me that they mean to at any rate there wasn t a word about pensions or anything of that sort was there mister Snape Not a word said Snape But those who are entitled to pensions can t be affected injuriously As far as I can see they must give me my whole salary I don t think they can do less You re all serene then mister Snape said Charley you re in the right box Looking at matters in that light mister Snape I think you ought to stand something handsome in the shape of lunch Come what do you say to chops and stout all round Dick will go over and order it in a minute I wish you wouldn t Charley said the navvy who seemed to be most affected and who in his present humour could not endure a joke As mister Snape did not seem to accede to Charley s views the liberal proposition fell to the ground Care killed a cat said Scatterall I shan t break my heart about it I never liked the shop did you Charley Well I must say I think we have been very comfortable here under mister Snape said Charley But if mister Snape is to go why the office certainly would be deuced dull without him Charley said the broken hearted young navvy in a tone of reproach Sorrow however did not take away their appetite and as mister Snape did not see fitting occasion for providing a banquet they clubbed together and among them managed to get a spread of beefsteaks and porter Scatterall as requested went across the Strand to order it at the cookshop while Corkscrew and Charley prepared the tables And now mind it s the thing said Dick who with intimate familiarity had penetrated into the eating house kitchen not dry you know or too much done and lots of fat And then as the generous viands renewed their strength and as the potent stout warmed their blood happier ideas came to them and they began to hope that the world was not all over Well I shall try for the Customs said the unhappy one after a deep pull at the pewter I shall try for the Customs one does get such stunning feeds for tenpence at that place in Thames Street Poor youth his ideas of earning his bread did not in their wildest flight spread beyond the public offices of the Civil Service For a few days longer they hung about the old office doing nothing how could men so circumstanced do anything and waiting for their fate At last their fate was announced mister Oldeschole retired with his full salary Secretaries and such like always retire with full pay as it is necessary that dignity should be supported mister Snape and the other seniors were pensioned with a careful respect to their years of service with which arrangement they all of them expressed themselves highly indignant and loudly threatened to bring the cruelty of their treatment before Parliament by the aid of sundry members who were supposed to be on the look out for such work but as nothing further was ever heard of them it may be presumed that the members in question did not regard the case as one on which the Government of the day was sufficiently vulnerable to make it worth their while to trouble themselves Of the younger clerks two or three including the unhappy one were drafted into other offices some others received one or more years pay and then tore themselves away from the fascinations of London life among those was mister R Scatterall who in after years will doubtless become a lawgiver in Hong Kong for to that colony has he betaken himself Some few others more unfortunate than the rest among whom poor Screwy was the most conspicuous were treated with a more absolute rigour and were sent upon the world portionless Screwy had been constant in his devotion to pork chops and had persisted in spelling blue without the final e He was therefore declared unworthy of any further public confidence whatever He is now in his uncle s office in Parliament Street and it is to be hoped that his peculiar talents may there be found useful And so the Internal Navigation Office came to an end and the dull dingy rooms were vacant Ruthless men shovelled off as waste paper all the lock entries of which Charley had once been so proud and the ponderous ledgers which mister Snape had delighted to haul about were sent away into Cimmerian darkness and probably to utter destruction And then the Internal Navigation was no more Among those who were drafted into other offices was Charley whom propitious fate took to the Weights and Measures But it must not be imagined that chance took him there The Weights and Measures was an Elysium the door of which was never casually open Charley at this time was a much altered man not that he had become a good clerk at his old office such a change one may say was impossible there were no good clerks at the Internal Navigation and Charley had so long been among navvies the most knavish or navviest that any such transformation would have met with no credence but out of his office he had become a much altered man As Katie had said it was as though some one had come to him from the dead He could not go back to his old haunts he could not return like a dog to his vomit as long as he had that purse so near his heart as long as that voice sounded in his ear while the memory of that kiss lingered in his heart He now told everything to Gertrude all his debts all his love and all his despair There is no relief for sorrow like the sympathy of a friend if one can only find it But then the sympathy must be real mock sympathy always tells the truth against itself always fails to deceive He told everything to Gertrude and by her counsel he told much to Norman He could not speak to him true friend as he was of Katie and her love There was that about the subject which made it too sacred for man s ears too full of tenderness to be spoken of without feminine tears It was only in the little parlour at Paradise Row when the evening had grown dark and Gertrude was sitting with her baby in her arms that the boisterous young navvy could bring himself to speak of his love During these months Katie s health had greatly improved and as she herself had gained in strength she had gradually begun to think that it was yet possible for her to live Little was now said by her about Charley and not much was said of him in her hearing but still she did learn how he had changed his office and with his office his mode of life she did hear of his literary efforts and of his kindness to Gertrude and it would seem as though it were ordained that his moral life and her physical life were to gain strength together CHAPTER XLVI mister NOGO S LAST QUESTION But at this time Charley was not idle The fate of Crinoline and Macassar has not yet been told nor has that of the two rival chieftains the Baron of Ballyporeen and Sir Anthony Allan a dale These heartrending tales appeared in due course bit by bit in the pages of the Daily Delight On every morning of the week Sundays excepted a page and a half of Charley s narrative was given to the expectant public and though I am not prepared to say that the public received the offering with any violent acclamations of applause that his name became suddenly that of a great unknown that literary cliques talked about him to the exclusion of other topics or that he rose famous one morning as Byron did after the publication of the Corsair nevertheless something was said in his praise The Daily Delight on the whole was rather belittled by its grander brethren of the press but a word or two was said here and there to exempt Charley s fictions from the general pooh poohing with which the remainder of the publication was treated Success such as this even is dear to the mind of a young author and Charley began to feel that he had done something The editor was proportionably civil to him and he was encouraged to commence a third historiette We have polished off poison and petticoats pretty well said the editor what do you say to something political Charley had no objection in life This Divorce Bill now we could have half a dozen married couples all separating getting rid of their ribs and buckling again helter skelter every man to somebody else s wife and the parish parson refusing to do the work just to show the immorality of the thing Charley said he d think about it Or the Danubian Principalities and the French Alliance could you manage now to lay your scene in Constantinople Charley doubted whether he could Or perhaps India is the thing The Cawnpore massacre would work up into any lengths you pleased You could get a file of the Times you know for your facts But while the editor was giving these various valuable hints as to the author s future subjects the author himself with base mind was thinking how much he should be paid for his past labours At last he ventured in the mildest manner to allude to the subject Payment said the editor Charley said that he had understood that there was to be some fixed scale of pay so much per sheet or something of that sort Undoubtedly there will said the editor and those who will have the courage and perseverance to work through with us till the publication has obtained that wide popularity which it is sure to achieve will doubtless be paid be paid as no writers for any periodical in this metropolis have ever yet been paid But at present mister Tudor you really must be aware that it is quite out of the question Charley had not the courage and perseverance to work through with the Daily Delight till it had achieved its promised popularity and consequently left its ranks like a dastard He consulted both Gertrude and Norman on the subject and on their advice set himself to work on his own bottom You may perhaps manage to fly alone said Gertrude but you will find it very difficult to fly if you tie the whole weight of the Daily Delight under your wings So Charley prepared himself for solitary soaring While he was thus working the time arrived at which Norman was to leave his office and it occurred to him that it might be possible that he should bequeath his vacancy to Charley He went himself to Sir Gregory and explained not only his own circumstances and his former friendship with Alaric Tudor but also the relationship between Alaric and Charley He then learnt in the strictest confidence of course that the doom of the Internal Navigation had just been settled and that it would be necessary to place in other offices those young men who could in any way be regarded as worth their salt and after considerable manoeuvring had it so arranged that the ne er do well young navvy should recommence his official life under better auspices Nor did Charley come in at the bottom of his office but was allowed by some inscrutable order of the great men who arranged those things to take a position in the Weights and Measures equal in seniority and standing to that which he had held at the Navigation and much higher of course in pay There is an old saying which the unenlightened credit and which declares that that which is sauce for the goose is sauce also for the gander Nothing put into a proverb since the days of Solomon was ever more untrue That which is sauce for the goose is not sauce for the gander and especially is not so in official life Poor Screwy was the goose and certainly got the sauce best suited to him when he was turned adrift out of the Civil Service Charley was the gander and fond as I am of him for his many excellent qualities I am fain to own that justice might fairly have demanded that he should be cooked after the same receipt But it suited certain potent personages to make a swan of him and therefore though it had long been an assured fact through the whole service that no man was ever known to enter the Weights and Measures without the strictest examination though the character of aspirants for that high office was always subjected to a rigid scrutiny though knowledge accomplishments industry morality outward decency inward zeal and all the cardinal virtues were absolutely requisite still Charley was admitted without any examination or scrutiny whatever during the commotion consequent upon the earthquake above described Charley went to the Weights some time during the recess In the process of the next session mister Nogo gave notice that he meant to ask the Government a question as to a gross act of injustice which had been perpetrated so at least the matter had been represented to him on the suppression of the Internal Navigation Office mister Nogo did not at first find it very easy to get a fitting opportunity for asking his question He had to give notice and inquiries had to be made and the responsible people were away and various customary accidents happened so that it was late in June before the question was put mister Nogo however persevered ruthlessly and after six months labour did deliver himself of an indignant and as his friends declared to him a very telling speech It was reported at the time by the opposition newspapers and need not therefore be given here But the upshot was this two men bearing equal character mister Nogo would not say whether the characters of the gentlemen were good or bad he would only say equal characters sat in the same room at this now defunct office one was mister Corkscrew and the other mister Tudor One had no friends in the Civil Service but the other was more fortunate mister Corkscrew had been sent upon the world a ruined blighted man without any compensation without any regard for his interests without any consideration for his past services or future prospects They would be told that the Government had no further need of his labours and that they could not dare to saddle the country with a pension for so young a man But what had been done in the case of the other gentleman Why he had been put into a valuable situation in the best Government office in London had been placed over the heads of a dozen others who had been there before him c c c And then mister Nogo ended with so vehement an attack on Sir Gregory and the Government as connected with him that the dogs began to whet their teeth and prepare for a tug at the great badger But circumstances were mischancy with mister Nogo and all he said redounded only to the credit of our friend Charley His black undoubtedly was black the merits of Charley and mister Corkscrew as public servants had been about equal but mister Whip Vigil turned the black into white in three minutes As he got upon his legs smiling after the manner of his great exemplar he held in his hand a small note and a newspaper A comparison he said had been instituted between the merits of two gentlemen formerly in the employment of the Crown one of them had been selected for further employment and the other rejected The honourable member for Mile End had he regretted to say instituted this comparison They all knew what was the proverbial character of a comparison It was however ready made to his hands and there was nothing left for him mister Whip Vigil but to go on with it This however he would do in as light a manner as possible It had been thought that the one gentleman would not suit the public service and that the other would do so It was for him merely to defend this opinion He now held in his hand a letter written by the protege of the honourable member for Limehouse he would not read it cries of Read read no he would not read it but the honourable member might if he would and could He himself was prepared to say that a gentleman who chose to express himself in such a style in his private notes this note however was not private in the usual sense could hardly be expected to command a proper supply of wholesome English such as the service of the Crown demanded Then mister Vigil handed across to mister Nogo poor Screwy s unfortunate letter about the pork chops As to the other gentleman whose name was now respectably known in the lighter walks of literature he would if permitted read the opinion expressed as to his style of language by a literary publication of the day and then the House would see whether or no the produce of the Civil Service field had not been properly winnowed whether the wheat had not been garnered and the chaff neglected And then the right honourable gentleman read some half dozen lines highly eulogistic of Charley s first solitary flight Poor mister Nogo remained in silence feeling that his black had become white to all intents and purposes and the big badger sat by and grinned not deigning to notice the dogs around him Thus it may be seen that that which is sauce for the goose is not sauce for the gander Early in the spring Norman was married and then as had been before arranged Charley once more went to Surbiton Cottage The marriage was a very quiet affair The feeling of disgrace which had fallen upon them all since the days of Alaric s trial had by no means worn itself away There were none of them yet no not one of the Cottage circle from Uncle Bat down to the parlour maid who felt that they had a right to hold up their faces before the light of day as they had formerly done There was a cloud over their house visible perhaps with more or less distinctness to all eyes but which to themselves appeared black as night That evil which Alaric had done to them was not to be undone in a few moons We are all of us responsible for our friends fathers in law for their sons in law brothers for their sisters husbands for their wives parents for their children and children even for their parents We cannot wipe off from us as with a wet cloth the stains left by the fault of those who are near to us The ink spot will cling Oh Alaric Alaric that thou thou who knewest all this that thou shouldest have done this thing They had forgiven his offence against them but they could not forget their own involuntary participation in his disgrace It was not for them now to shine forth to the world with fine gala doings and gay gaudy colours as they had done when Gertrude had been married But still there was happiness quiet staid happiness at the Cottage missus Woodward could not but be happy to see Linda married to Harry Norman her own favourite him whom she had selected in her heart for her son in law from out of all the world And now too she was beginning to be conscious that Harry and Linda were better suited for each other than he and Gertrude would have been What would have been Linda s fate how unendurable had she been Alaric s wife when Alaric fell How would she have borne such a fall What could she have done poor lamb towards mending the broken thread or binding the bruised limbs What balm could she have poured into such wounds as those which fate had inflicted on Gertrude and her household But at Normansgrove with a steady old housekeeper at her back and her husband always by to give her courage Linda would find the very place for which she was suited And then missus Woodward had another source of joy of liveliest joy in Katie s mending looks She was at the wedding though hardly with her mother s approval As she got better her old spirit returned to her and it became difficult to refuse her anything It was in vain that her mother talked of the cold church and easterly winds and the necessary lightness of a bridesmaid s attire Katie argued that the church was only two hundred yards off that she never suffered from the cold and that though dressed in light colours as became a bridesmaid she would if allowed to go wear over her white frock any amount of cloaks which her mother chose to impose on her Of course she went and we will not say how beautiful she looked when she clung to Linda in the vestry room and all her mother s wrappings fell in disorder from her shoulders So Linda was married and carried off to Normansgrove and Katie remained with her mother and Uncle Bat Mamma we will never part will we mamma said she as they comforted each other that evening after the Normans were gone and when Charley also had returned to London When you go Katie I think you must take me with you said her mother smiling through her tears But what will poor Uncle Bat do I fear you can t take him also I will never go from you mamma Her mother knew what she meant Charley had been there Charley to whom she had declared her love when lying as she thought on her bed of death Charley had been there again and had stood close to her and touched her hand and looked oh how much handsomer he was than Harry how much brighter than Alaric he had touched her hand and spoken to her one word of joy at her recovered health But that had been all There was a sort of compact Katie knew that there should be no other Tudor marriage Charley was not now the scamp he had been but still it was understood that her love was not to win its object I will never go from you mamma But missus Woodward s heart was not hard as the nether millstone She drew her daughter to her and as she pressed her to her bosom she whispered into her ears that she now hoped they might all be happy CHAPTER XLVII CONCLUSION Our tale and toils have now drawn nigh to an end our loves and our sorrows are over and we are soon to part company with the three clerks and their three wives Their three wives Why yes It need hardly be told in so many words to an habitual novel reader that Charley did get his bride at last Nevertheless Katie kept her promise to missus Woodward What promise did she ever make and not keep She kept her promise and did not go from her mother She married mister Charles Tudor of the Weights and Measures that distinguished master of modern fiction as the Literary Censor very civilly called him the other day and mister Charles Tudor became master of Surbiton Cottage Reader take one last leap with me and presume that two years have flown from us since the end of the last chapter or rather somewhat more than two years for we would have it high midsummer when we take our last farewell of Surbiton Cottage But sundry changes had taken place at the Cottage and of such a nature that were it not for the old name s sake we should now find ourselves bound to call the place Surbiton Villa or Surbiton Hall or Surbiton House It certainly had no longer any right to the title of a cottage for Charley in anticipation of what Lucina might do for him had added on sundry rooms a children s room on the ground floor and a nursery above and a couple of additional bedrooms on the other side so that the house was now a comfortable abode for an increasing family At the time of which we are now speaking Lucina had not as yet done much for in truth Charley had been married but little over twelve months but there appeared every reason to believe that the goddess would be propitious There was already one little rocking shrine up in that cosy temple opening out of Katie s bedroom we beg her pardon we should have said missus Charles Tudor s bedroom one precious tabernacle in which was laid a little man deity a young Charley to whom was daily paid a multitude of very sincere devotions How precious are all the belongings of a first baby how dear are the cradle the lace caps the first coral all the little duds which are made with such punctilious care and anxious efforts of nicest needlework to encircle that small lump of pink humanity What care is taken that all shall be in order See that basket lined with crimson silk prepared to hold his various garments while the mother jealous of her nurse insists on tying every string with her own fingers And then how soon the change comes how different it is when there are ten of them and the tenth is allowed to inherit the well worn wealth which the ninth a year ago had received from the eighth There is no crimson silk basket then I trow Jane Jane where are my boots Mary I ve lost my trousers Such sounds are heard shouted through the house from powerful lungs Why Charley says the mother as her eldest hope rushes in to breakfast with dishevelled hair and dirty hands you ve got no handkerchief on your neck what have you done with your handkerchief No mamma it came off in the hay loft and I can t find it Papa says the lady wife turning to her lord who is reading his newspaper over his coffee papa you really must speak to Charley he will not mind me He was dressed quite nicely an hour ago and do see what a figure he has made himself Charley says papa not quite relishing this disturbance in the midst of a very interesting badger baiting Charley my boy if you don t mind your P s and Q s you and I shall fall out mind that and he again goes on with his sport and mamma goes on with her teapot looking not exactly like Patience on a monument Such are the joys which await you mister Charles Tudor but not to such have you as yet arrived As yet there is but the one little pink deity in the rocking shrine above but one at least of your own At the moment of which we are now speaking there were visitors at Surbiton Cottage and the new nursery was brought into full use mister and missus Norman of Normansgrove were there with their two children and two maids and grandmamma Woodward had her hands quite full in the family nursery line It was a beautiful summer evening and the two young mothers were sitting with missus Woodward and Uncle Bat in the drawing room waiting for their lords return from London As usual when they stayed late the two men were to dine at their club and come down to tea The nursemaids were walking on the lawn before the window with their charges and the three ladies were busily employed with some fairly written manuscript pages which they were cutting carefully into shape and arranging in particular form Now mamma said Katie if you laugh once while you are reading it you ll spoil it all I ll do the best I can my dear but I m sure I shall break down you have made it so very abusive said missus Woodward Mamma I think I ll take out that about official priggism hadn t I better Linda Indeed I think you had I m sure mamma would break down there said Linda Mamma I m sure you would never get over the official priggism I don t think I should my dear said missus Woodward What is it you are all concocting said Captain Cuttwater some infernal mischief I know craving your pardons If you tell Uncle Bat I ll never forgive you said Katie Oh you may trust me I never spoil sport if I can t make any but the fun ought to be very good for you ve been a mortal long time about it And then the two younger ladies again went on clipping and arranging their papers while missus Woodward renewed her protest that she would do her best as to reading their production While they were thus employed the postman s knock was heard and a letter was brought in from the far away Australian exiles The period at which these monthly missives arrived were moments of intense anxiety and the letter was seized upon with eager avidity It was from Gertrude to her mother as all these letters were but in such a production they had a joint property and it was hardly possible to say who first mastered its contents It will only be necessary here to give some extracts from the letter which was by no means a short one So much must be done in order that our readers may know something of the fate of those who perhaps may be called the hero and heroine of the tale The author does not so call them he professes to do his work without any such appendages to his story heroism there may be and he hopes there is more or less of it there should be in a true picture of most characters but heroes and heroines as so called are not commonly met with in our daily walks of life Before Gertrude s letter had been disposed of Norman and Charley came in and it was therefore discussed in full conclave Alaric s path in the land of his banishment had not been over roses The upward struggle of men who have fallen from a high place once gained that second mounting of the ladder of life seldom is an easy path He and with him Gertrude and his children had been called on to pay the full price of his backsliding His history had gone with him to the Antipodes and though the knowledge of what he had done was not there so absolute a clog upon his efforts so overpowering a burden as it would have been in London still it was a burden and a heavy one It had been well for Gertrude that she had prepared herself to give up all her luxuries by her six months residence in that Millbank Paradise of luxuries for some time she had little enough in the good and happy land to which she had taught herself and her children to look forward That land of promise had not flowed with milk and honey when first she put her foot upon its soil its produce for her had been gall and bitter herbs for many a weary month after she first landed But her heart had never sunk within her She had never forgotten that he if he were to work well should have at least one cheerful companion by his side She had been true to him then as ever And yet it is so hard to be true to high principles in little things The heroism of the Roman who for his country s sake leapt his horse into a bottomless gulf was as nothing to that of a woman who can keep her temper through poverty and be cheerful in adversity Through poverty scorn and bad repute under the privations of a hard life separated from so many that she had loved and from everything that she had liked Gertrude had still been true to her ideas of her marriage vow true also to her pure and single love She had entwined herself with him in sunny weather and when the storm came she did her best to shelter the battered stem to which she had trusted herself By degrees things mended with them and in this letter which is now passing from eager hand to hand in Katie s drawing room Gertrude spoke with better hope of their future prospects Thank God we are once more all well she said and Alaric s spirits are higher than they were He has indeed had much to try them They think I believe in England that any kind of work here is sure to command a high price of this I am quite sure that in no employment in England are people so tasked as they are here Alaric was four months in these men s counting house and I am sure another four months would have seen him in his grave Though I knew not then what other provision might be made for us I implored him almost on my knees to give up that He was expected to be there for ten sometimes twelve hours a day and they thought he should always be kept going like a steam engine You know Alaric never was afraid of work but that would have killed him And what was it for What did they give him for that for all his talent all his experience all his skill And he did give them all His salary was two pounds ten a week And then when he told them of all he was doing for them they had the baseness to remind him of Dearest mother is not the world hard It was that that made me insist that he should leave them Alaric s present path was by no means over roses This certainly was a change from those days on which he had sat one of a mighty trio at the Civil Service Examination Board striking terror into candidates by a scratch of his pen and making happy the desponding heart by his approving nod His ambition now was not to sit among the magnates of Great Britain and make his voice thunder through the columns of the Times it ranged somewhat lower at this period and was confined for the present to a strong desire to see his wife and bairns sufficiently fed and not left absolutely without clothing He inquired little as to the feeling of the electors of Strathbogy And had he utterly forgotten the stirring motto of his early days Did he ever mutter Excelsior to himself as with weary steps he dragged himself home from that hated counting house Ah he had fatally mistaken the meaning of the word which he had so often used There had been the error of his life Excelsior When he took such a watchword for his use he should surely have taught himself the meaning of it He had now learnt that lesson in a school somewhat of the sternest but as time wore kindly over him he did teach himself to accept the lesson with humility His spirit had been wellnigh broken as he was carried from that court house in the Old Bailey to his prison on the river side and a broken spirit like a broken goblet can never again become whole But Nature was a kind mother to him and did not permit him to be wholly crushed She still left within the plant the germ of life which enabled it again to spring up and vivify though sorely bruised by the heels of those who had ridden over it He still repeated to himself the old watchword though now in humbler tone and more bated breath and it may be presumed that he had now a clearer meaning of its import But his present place continued Gertrude is much very much more suited to him He is corresponding clerk in the first bank here and though his pay is nearly double what it was at the other place his hours of work are not so oppressive He goes at nine and gets away at five that is except on the arrival or dispatch of the English mails Here was a place of bliss for a man who had been a commissioner attending at the office at such hours as best suited himself and having clerks at his beck to do all that he listed And yet as Gertrude said this was a place of bliss to him It was a heaven as compared with that other hell Alley is such a noble boy said Gertrude becoming almost joyous as she spoke of her own immediate cares He is most like Katie I think of us all and yet he is very like his papa He goes to a day school now with his books slung over his back in a bag You never saw such a proud little fellow as he is and so manly Charley is just like you oh so like It makes me so happy that he is He did not talk so early as Alley but nevertheless he is more forward than the other children I see here The little monkeys they are neither of them the least like me But one can always see oneself and it don t matter if one does not If ever there was a brick Gertrude is one said Norman A brick said Charley why you might cut her to pieces and build another Kensington palace out of the slices I believe she is a brick I wonder whether I shall ever see her again said missus Woodward not with dry eyes Oh yes mamma said Katie She shall come home to us some day and we will endeavour to reward her for it all Dear Katie who will not love you for such endeavour But indeed the reward for heroism cometh not here There was much more in the letter but enough has been given for our purpose It will be seen that hope yet remained both for Alaric and his wife and hope not without a reasonable base Bad as he had been it had not been with him as with Undy Scott The devil had not contrived to put his whole claw upon him He had not divested himself of human affections and celestial hopes He had not reduced himself to the present level of a beast with the disadvantages of a soul and of an eternity as the other man had done He had not put himself beyond the pale of true brotherhood with his fellow men We would have hanged Undy had the law permitted us but now we will say farewell to the other hoping that he may yet achieve exaltation of another kind And to thee Gertrude how shall we say farewell to thee excluded as thou art from that dear home where those who love thee so well are now so happy Their only care remaining is now thy absence Adversity has tried thee in its crucible and thou art found to be of virgin gold unalloyed hadst thou still been lapped in prosperity the true ring of thy sterling metal would never have been heard Farewell to thee and may those young budding flowerets of thine break forth into golden fruit to gladden thy heart in coming days The reading of Gertrude s letter and the consequent discussion somewhat put off the execution of the little scheme which had been devised for that evening s amusement but nevertheless it was still broad daylight when missus Woodward consigned the precious document to her desk the drawing room windows were still open and the bairns were still being fondled in the room It was the first week in July when the night almost loses her dominion and when those hours which she generally claims as her own become the pleasantest of the day Oh Charley said Katie at last we have great news for you too Here is another review on The World s Last Wonder Now The World s Last Wonder was Charley s third novel but he was still sensitive enough on the subject of reviews to look with much anxiety for what was said of him These notices were habitually sent down to him at Hampton and his custom was to make his wife or her mother read them while he sat by in lordly ease in his arm chair receiving homage when homage came to him and criticizing the critics when they were uncivil Have you said Charley What is it Why did you not show it me before Why we were talking of dear Gertrude said Katie and it is not so pleasant but that it will keep What paper do you think it is What paper how on earth can I tell show it me No but do guess Charley and then mamma will read it pray guess now Oh bother I can t guess The Literary Censor I suppose I know they have turned against me No it s not that said Linda guess again The Guardian Angel said Charley No that angel has not taken you under his wings as yet said Katie I know it s not the Times said Charley for I have seen that O no said Katie seriously if it was anything of that sort we would not keep you in suspense Well I ll be shot if I guess any more there are such thousands of them But there is only one Daily Delight said missus Woodward Nonsense said Charley You don t mean to tell me that my dear old friend and foster father has fallen foul of me my old teacher and master if not spiritual pastor well well well The ingratitude of the age I gave him my two beautiful stories the first fruits of my vine all for love to think that he should now lay his treacherous axe to the root of the young tree well give it here No mamma will read it we want Harry to hear it O yes let missus Woodward read it said Harry I trust it is severe I know no man who wants a dragging over the coals more peremptorily than you do Thankee sir Well grandmamma go on but if there be anything very bad give me a little notice for I am nervous And then missus Woodward began to read Linda sitting with Katie s baby in her arms and Katie performing a similar office for her sister The World s Last Wonder by Charles Tudor esquire He begins with a lie said Charley for I never called myself Esquire Oh that was a mistake said Katie forgetting herself Men of that kind shouldn t make such mistakes said Charley When one fellow attempts to cut up another fellow he ought to take special care that he does it fairly By the author of Bathos I didn t put that in said Charley that was the publisher I only put Charles Tudor Don t be so touchy Charley and let me go on said missus Woodward Well fire away it s good fun to you I dare say as the fly said to the spider Well Charley at any rate we are not the spiders said Linda Katie said nothing but she could not help feeling that she must look rather spiderish mister Tudor has acquired some little reputation as a humorist but as is so often the case with those who make us laugh his very success will prove his ruin Then upon my word the Daily Delight is safe said Charley It will never be ruined in that way There is an elaborate jocosity about him a determined eternity of most industrious fun which gives us the idea of a boy who is being rewarded for having duly learnt by rote his daily lesson out of Joe Miller Now I ll bet ten to one he has never read the book at all well never mind go on The World s Last Wonder is the description of a woman who kept a secret under certain temptations to reveal it which as mister Tudor supposes might have moved any daughter of Eve to break her faith I haven t supposed anything of the kind said Charley This secret which we shall not disclose as we would not wish to be thought less trustworthy than mister Tudor s wonderful woman We shall find that he does disclose it of course that is the way with all of them Is presumed to permeate the whole three volumes It is told at full length in the middle of the second said Charley And the effect upon the reader of course is that he has ceased to interest himself about it long before it is disclosed to him The lady in question is engaged to be married to a gentleman a circumstance which in the pages of a novel is not calculated to attract much special attention She is engaged to be married but the gentleman who has the honour of being her intended sposo Intended sposo said Charley expressing by his upturned lip a withering amount of scorn how well I know the fellow s low attempts at wit That s the editor himself that s my literary papa I know him as well as though I had seen him at it Katie and missus Woodward exchanged furtive glances but neither of them moved a muscle of her face But the gentleman who has the honour of being her intended sposo continued missus Woodward What the devil s a sposo said Uncle Bat who was sitting in an arm chair with a handkerchief over his head Why you re not a sposo Uncle Bat said Linda but Harry is and so is Charley Oh I see said the captain it s a bird with his wings clipped But the gentleman who has the honour of being her intended sposo again read missus Woodward Now I m sure I m speaking by the card said Charley when I say that there is not another man in London who could have written that line and who would have used so detestable a word I think I remember his using it in one of his lectures to me indeed I m sure I do Sposo I should like to tweak his nose oh Are you going to let me go on said missus Woodward her intended sposo Charley gave a kick with his foot and satisfied himself with that is determined to have nothing to say to her in the matrimonial line till she has revealed to him this secret which he thinks concerns his own honour There I knew he d tell it He has not told it yet said Norman The lady however is obdurate wonderfully so of course seeing that she is the world s last wonder and so the match is broken off But the secret is of such a nature that the lady s invincible objection to revealing it is bound up with the fact of her being a promised bride I wonder he didn t say sposa said Charley I never thought of that said Katie missus Woodward and Linda looked at her but Charley did not and her blunder passed by unnoticed Now that she is free from her matrimonial bonds she is free also to tell the secret and indeed the welfare both of the gentleman and of the lady imperiously demands that it should be told Should he marry her he is destined to learn it after his marriage should he not marry her he may hear it at any time She sends for him and tells him not the first of these facts by doing which all difficulty would have at once been put an end to It is quite clear he has never read the story quite clear said Charley She tells him only the last viz that as they are now strangers he may know the secret but that when once known it will raise a barrier between them that no years no penance no sorrow on his part no tenderness on hers can ever break down She then asks him will he hear the secret She does not ask any such thing said Charley the letter that contains it has been already sent to him She merely gives him an opportunity of returning it unopened The gentleman who is not without a grain of obstinacy in his own composition and many grains of curiosity declares it to be impossible that he can go to the altar in ignorance of facts which he is bound to know and the lady who seems to be of an affectionate disposition falls in tenderness at his feet She is indeed in a very winning mood and quite inclined to use every means allowable to a lady for retaining her lover every means that is short of that specially feminine one of telling her secret We will give an extract from this love scene partly for the sake of its grotesque absurdity Charley kicked out another foot as though he thought that the editor of the Daily Delight might perhaps be within reach And partly because it gives a fair example of the manner in which mister Tudor endeavours to be droll even in the midst of his most tender passages Leonora was at this time seated Oh skip the extract said Charley I suppose there are three or four pages of it It goes down to where Leonora says that his fate and her own are in his hands Yes about three columns said Charley that s an easy way of making an article eh Harry Aliter non fit amice liber said the classical Norman Well skip the extract grandmamma Now did anyone ever before read such a mixture of the bombastic and the burlesque We are called upon to cry over every joke and for the life of us we cannot hold our sides when the catastrophes occur It is a salad in which the pungency of the vinegar has been wholly subdued by the oil and the fatness of the oil destroyed by the tartness of the vinegar His old simile said Charley he was always talking about literary salads The gentleman of course gives way at the last minute continued missus Woodward The scene in which he sits with the unopened letter lying on his table before him has some merit but this probably arises from the fact that the letter is dumb and the gentleman equally so D nation said Charley whose patience could not stand such impudence at this The gentleman who as we should have before said is the eldest son of a man of large reputed fortune There I knew he d tell it Oh but he hasn t told it said Norman Doesn t the word reputed tell it The eldest son of a man of large reputed fortune does at last marry the heroine and then he discovers But what he discovers those who feel any interest in the matter may learn from the book itself we must profess that we felt none We will not say there is nothing in the work indicative of talent The hero s valet Jacob Brush and the heroine s lady s maid Jacintha Pintail are both humorous and good in their way Why it should be so we do not pretend to say but it certainly does appear to us that mister Tudor is more at home in the servants hall than in the lady s boudoir Abominable scoundrel said Charley But what we must chiefly notice continued the article in the furtherance of those views by which we profess that we are governed Now I know we are to have something very grandiloquent and very false said Charley Is this that no moral purpose can be served by the volumes before us The hero acts wrongly throughout but nevertheless he is rewarded at last There is no Nemesis No what said Charley jumping up from his chair and looking over the table No Nemesis said missus Woodward speaking with only half sustained voice and covering with her arms the document which she had been reading Charley looked sharply at his wife then at Linda then at missus Woodward Not one of them could keep her face He made a snatch at the patched up manuscript and as he did so Katie almost threw out of her arms the baby she was holding Take him Harry take him said she handing over the child to his father And then gliding quick as thought through the furniture of the drawing room she darted out upon the lawn to save herself from the coming storm Charley was quickly after her but as he made his exit one chair fell to the right of him and another to the left missus Woodward followed them and so did Harry and Linda each with a baby And then Captain Cuttwater waking from his placid nap rubbed his eyes in wondering amazement What the devil is all the row about said he But there was nobody to answer him END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG
