himselve CHAUCER Prologue to the Canterbury Tales CHAPTER I THE FIR WOOD Of all the flowers in the mead Then love I roost these flowers white and rede Such that men callen daisies in our town I renne blithe As soon as ever the sun ginneth west To see this flower how it will go to rest For fear of night so hateth she darkness Her cheer is plainly spread in the brightness Of the sunne for there it will unclose CHAUCER Prologue to the Legend of Good Women Meg whaur are ye gaein that get like a wull shuttle Come in to the beuk Meg s mother stood at the cottage door with arms akimbo and clouded brow calling through the boles of a little forest of fir trees after her daughter One would naturally presume that the phrase she employed comparing her daughter s motions to those of a shuttle that had gane wull or lost its way implied that she was watching her as she threaded her way through the trees But although she could not see her the fir wood was certainly the likeliest place for her daughter to be in and the figure she employed was not in the least inapplicable to Meg s usual mode of wandering through the trees that operation being commonly performed in the most erratic manner possible It was the ordinary occupation of the first hour of almost every day of Margaret s life As soon as she woke in the morning the fir wood drew her towards it and she rose and went Through its crowd of slender pillars she strayed hither and thither in an aimless manner as if resignedly haunting the neighbourhood of something she had lost or hopefully that of a treasure she expected one day to find It did not seem that she had heard her mother s call for no response followed and Janet Elginbrod returned into the cottage where David of the same surname who was already seated at the white deal table with the beuk or large family bible before him straightway commenced reading a chapter in the usual routine from the Old Testament the New being reserved for the evening devotions The chapter was the fortieth of the prophet Isaiah and as the voice of the reader re uttered the words of old inspiration one might have thought that it was the voice of the ancient prophet himself pouring forth the expression of his own faith in his expostulations with the unbelief of his brethren The chapter finished it is none of the shortest and Meg had not yet returned the two knelt and David prayed thus O Thou who holdest the waters in the hollow of ae han and carriest the lambs o thy own making in thy bosom with the other han it would be altogether unworthy o thee and o thy Maijesty o love to require o us that which thou knowest we cannot bring unto thee until thou enrich us with that same Therefore like thine own bairns we boo doon afore thee an pray that thou wouldst tak thy wull o us thy holy an perfect an blessed wull o us for O God we are a thine ain An for oor lassie wha s oot amo thy trees an wha we dinna think forgets her Maker though she may whiles forget her prayers Lord keep her a bonnie lassie in thy sicht as white and clean in thy een as she is fair an halesome in oors an oh we thank thee Father in heaven for giein her to us An noo for a oor wrang duins an ill min ins for a oor sins and trespasses o mony sorts dinna forget them O God till thou pits them a richt an syne exerceese thy michty power e en ower thine ain sel an clean forget them a thegither cast them ahint thy back whaur e en thine ain een shall ne er see them again that we may walk bold an upricht afore thee for evermore an see the face o Him wha was as muckle God in doin thy biddin as gin he had been ordering a thing Himsel For his sake Ahmen I hope my readers will not suppose that I give this as a specimen of Scotch prayers I know better than that David was an unusual man and his prayers were unusual prayers The present was a little more so in its style from the fact that one of the subjects of it was absent a circumstance that rarely happened But the degree of difference was too small to be detected by any but those who were quite accustomed to his forms of thought and expression How much of it Janet understood or sympathized with it is difficult to say for anything that could be called a thought rarely crossed the threshold of her utterance On this occasion the moment the prayer was ended she rose from her knees smoothed down her check apron and went to the door where shading her eyes from the sun with her hand she peered from under its penthouse into the fir wood and said in a voice softened apparently by the exercise in which she had taken a silent share Whaur can the lassie be And where was the lassie In the fir wood to be sure with the thousand shadows and the sunlight through it all for at this moment the light fell upon her far in its depths and revealed her hastening towards the cottage in as straight a line as the trees would permit now blotted out by a crossing shadow and anon radiant in the sunlight appearing and vanishing as she threaded the upright warp of the fir wood It was morning all around her and one might see that it was morning within her too as emerging at last in the small open space around the cottage Margaret I cannot call her Meg although her mother does her father always called her Maggy my doo Anglice dove Margaret approached her mother with a bright healthful face and the least possible expression of uneasiness on her fair forehead She carried a book in her hand What gars ye gang stravaguin that get Meg whan ye ken weel eneuch ye sud a been in to worship lang syne An sae we maun hae worship our lanes for want o you ye hizzy I didna ken it was sae late mither replied Margaret in a submissive tone musical in spite of the rugged dialect into which the sounds were fashioned Nae dout Ye had yer brakfast an ye warna that hungry for the word But here comes yer father and ye ll no mend for his flytin I se promise Hoots lat the bairn alane Janet my woman The word ll be mair to her afore lang I wat she has a word o her nain there What beuk hae ye gotten there Meg Whaur got ye t Had it not been for the handsome binding of the book in her daughter s hand it would neither have caught the eye nor roused the suspicions of Janet David glanced at the book in his turn and a faint expression of surprise embodied chiefly in the opening of his eyelids a little wider than usual crossed his face But he only said with a smile I didna ken that the tree o knowledge wi sic fair fruit grew in our wud Maggy my doo Whaur gat ye the beuk reiterated Janet Margaret s face was by this time the colour of the crimson boards of the volume in her hand but she replied at once I got it frae Maister Sutherlan I reckon Janet s first response was an inverted whistle her next another question Maister Sutherlan wha s that o t Hoot lass interposed David ye ken weel aneuch It s the new tutor lad up at the hoose a fine douce honest chield an weel faured forby Lat s see the bit beuky lassie Margaret handed it to her father colonel e ridge s Poems read David with some difficulty Tak it hame direckly said Janet Na na said David a the apples o the tree o knowledge are no stappit wi sut an stew an gin this ane be

lads i the wud sae ear i the mornin Is t noo yersel Meg Mither mither said Margaret and her eyes flashed through the watery veil that tried to hide them hoo can ye Ye ken yersel I had nae appintment wi him or ony man Weel weel said Janet and apparently either satisfied with or overcome by the emotion she had excited she turned and went in to pursue her usual house avocations while David handing the book to his daughter went away down the path that led from the cottage door in the direction of a road to be seen at a little distance through the trees which surrounded the cottage on all sides Margaret followed her mother into the cottage and was soon as busy as she with her share of the duties of the household but it was a good many minutes before the cloud caused by her mother s hasty words entirely disappeared from a forehead which might with especial justice be called the sky of her face Meantime David emerged upon the more open road and bent his course still through fir trees towards a house for whose sake alone the road seemed to have been constructed CHAPTER II DAVID ELGINBROD AND THE NEW TUTOR Concord between our wit and will Where highest notes to godliness are raised And lowest sink not down to jot of ill What Languetus taught Sir Philip Sidney THE ARCADIA Third Eclogue The House of Turriepuffit stood about a furlong from David s cottage It was the abode of the Laird or landed proprietor in whose employment David filled several offices ordinarily distinct The estate was a small one and almost entirely farmed by the owner himself who with David s help managed to turn it to good account Upon week days he appeared on horseback in a costume more fitted for following the plough but he did not work with his own hands and on Sundays was at once recognizable as a country gentleman David was his bailiff or grieve to overlook the labourers on the estate his steward to pay them and keep the farm accounts his head gardener for little labour was expended in that direction there being only one lady the mistress of the house and she no patroness of useless flowers David was in fact the laird s general adviser and executor The laird s family besides the lady already mentioned consisted only of two boys of the ages of eleven and fourteen whom he wished to enjoy the same privileges he had himself possessed and to whom therefore he was giving a classical and mathematical education in view of the University by means of private tutors the last of whom for the changes were not few seeing the salary was of the smallest was Hugh Sutherland the young man concerning whom David Elginbrod has already given his opinion But notwithstanding the freedom he always granted his daughter and his good opinion of Hugh as well David could not help feeling a little anxious in his walk along the road towards the house as to what the apparent acquaintance between her and the new tutor might evolve but he got rid of all the difficulty as far as he was concerned by saying at last What richt hae I to interfere even supposin I wanted to interfere But I can lippen weel to my bonny doo an for the rest she maun tak her chance like the lave o s An wha kens but it micht jist be stan in afore Him i the very get that He meant to gang The Lord forgie me for speakin o chance as gin I believed in ony sic havers There s no fear o the lassie Gude mornin t ye Maister Sutherlan That s a braw beuk o ballants ye gae the len o to my Maggy this mornin sir Sutherland was just entering a side door of the house when David accosted him He was not old enough to keep from blushing at David s words but having a good conscience he was ready with a good answer It s a good book mister Elginbrod It will do her no harm though it be ballads I m in no dreed o that sir Bairns maun hae ballants An to tell the truth sir I m no muckle mair nor a bairn in that respeck mysel In fac this verra mornin at the beuk I jist thocht I was readin a gran godly ballant an it soundet nane the waur for the notion o t You should have been a poet yourself mister Elginbrod Na na I ken naething aboot yer poetry I hae read auld John Milton ower an ower though I dinna believe the half o t but oh weel I like some o the bonny bitties at the en o t Il Penseroso for instance Is that hoo ye ca t I ken t weel by the sicht but hardly by the soun I aye missed the name o t an took to the thing itsel Eh man I beg yer pardon sir but its wonnerfu bonny I ll come in some evening and we ll have a chat about it replied Sutherland I must go to my work now We ll a be verra happy to see you sir Good mornin sir Good morning David went to the garden where there was not much to be done in the way of education at this season of the year and Sutherland to the school room where he was busy all the rest of the morning and part of the afternoon with Caesar and Virgil Algebra and Euclid food upon which intellectual babes are reared to the stature of college youths Sutherland was himself only a youth for he had gone early to college and had not yet quite completed the curriculum He was now filling up with teaching the recess between his third and his fourth winter at one of the Aberdeen Universities He was the son of an officer belonging to the younger branch of a family of some historic distinction and considerable wealth This officer though not far removed from the estate and title as well had nothing to live upon but his half pay for to the disgust of his family he had married a Welsh girl of ancient descent in whose line the poverty must have been at least coeval with the history to judge from the perfection of its development in the case of her father and his relations made this the excuse for quarrelling with him so relieving themselves from any obligations they might have been supposed to lie under of rendering him assistance of some sort or other This however rather suited the temperament of Major Robert Sutherland who was prouder in his poverty than they in their riches So he disowned them for ever and accommodated himself with the best grace in the world to his yet more straitened circumstances He resolved however cost what it might in pinching and squeezing to send his son to college before turning him out to shift for himself In this missus Sutherland was ready to support him to the utmost and so they had managed to keep their boy at college for three sessions after the last of which instead of returning home as he had done on previous occasions he had looked about him for a temporary engagement as tutor and soon found the situation he now occupied in the family of William Glasford esquire of Turriepuffit where he intended to remain no longer than the commencement of the session which would be his fourth and last To what he should afterwards devote himself he had by no means made up his mind except that it must of necessity be hard work of some kind or other So he had at least the virtue of desiring to be independent His other goods and bads must come out in the course of the story His pupils were rather stupid and rather good natured so that their temperament operated to confirm their intellectual condition and to render the labour of teaching them considerably irksome But he did his work tolerably well and was not so much interested in the result as to be pained at the moderate degree of his success At the time of which I write however the probability as to his success was scarcely ascertained for he had been only a fortnight at the task It was the middle of the month of April in a rather backward season The weather had been stormy with frequent showers of sleet and snow Old winter was doing his best to hold young Spring back by the skirts of her garment and very few of the wild flowers had yet ventured to look out of their warm beds in the mould Sutherland therefore had made but few discoveries in the neighbourhood Not that the weather would have kept him to the house had he had any particular desire to go out but like many other students he had no predilection for objectless exertion and preferred the choice of his own weather indoors namely from books and his own imaginings to an encounter with the keen blasts of the North charged as they often were with sharp bullets of hail When the sun did shine out between the showers his cold glitter upon the pools of rain or melted snow and on the wet evergreens and gravel walks always drove him back from the window with a shiver The house which was of very moderate size and comfort stood in the midst of plantations principally of Scotch firs and larches some of the former old and of great growth so that they had arrived at the true condition of the tree which seems to require old age for the perfection of its idea There was very little to be seen from the windows except this wood which somewhat gloomy at almost any season was at the present cheerless enough and Sutherland found it very dreary indeed as exchanged for the wide view from his own home on the side of an open hill in the Highlands In the midst of circumstances so uninteresting it is not to be wondered at that the glimpse of a pretty maiden should one morning occasion him some welcome excitement Passing downstairs to breakfast he observed the drawing room door ajar and looked in to see what sort of a room it was for so seldom was it used that he had never yet entered it There stood a young girl peeping with mingled curiosity and reverence into a small gilt leaved volume which she had lifted from the table by which she stood He watched her for a moment with some interest when she seeming to become mesmerically aware that she was not alone looked up blushed deeply put down the book in confusion and proceeded to dust some of the furniture It was his first sight of Margaret Some of the neighbours were expected to dinner and her aid was in requisition to get the grand room of the house prepared for the occasion He supposed her to belong to the household till one day feeling compelled to go out for a stroll he caught sight of her so occupied at the door of her father s cottage that he perceived at once that must be her home she was in fact seated upon a stool paring potatoes She saw him as well and apparently ashamed at the recollection of having been discovered idling in the drawing room rose and went in He had met David once or twice about the house and attracted by his appearance had had some conversation with him but he did not know where he lived nor that he was the father of the girl whom he had seen CHAPTER III THE DAISY AND THE PRIMROSE Dear secret Greenness nursed below Tempests and winds and winter nights Vex not that but one sees thee grow That One made all these lesser lights HENRY VAUGHAN It was of course quite by accident that Sutherland had met Margaret in the fir wood The wind had changed during the night and swept all the clouds from the face of the sky and when he looked out in the morning he saw the fir tops waving in the sunlight and heard the sound of a south west wind sweeping through them with the tune of running waters in its course It is a well practised ear that can tell whether the sound it hears be that of gently falling waters or of wind flowing through the branches of firs Sutherland s heart reviving like a dormouse in its hole began to be joyful at the sight of the genial motions of Nature telling of warmth and blessedness at hand Some goal of life vague but sure seemed to glimmer through the appearances around him and to stimulate him to action Be dressed in haste and went out to meet the Spring He wandered into the heart of the wood The sunlight shone like a sunset upon the red trunks and boughs of the old fir trees but like the first sunrise of the world upon the new green fringes that edged the young shoots of the larches High up hung the memorials of past summers in the rich brown tassels of the clustering cones while the ground under foot was dappled with sunshine on the fallen fir needles and the great fallen cones which had opened to scatter their autumnal seed and now lay waiting for decay Overhead the tops whence they had fallen waved in the wind as in welcome of the Spring with that peculiar swinging motion which made the poets of the sixteenth century call them sailing pines The wind blew cool but not cold and was filled with a delicious odour from the earth which Sutherland took as a sign that she was coming alive at last And the Spring he went out to meet met him For first at the foot of a tree he spied a tiny primrose peeping out of its rough careful leaves and he wondered how by any metamorphosis such leaves could pass into such a flower Had he seen the mother of the next spring messenger he was about to meet the same thought would have returned in another form For next as he passed on with the primrose in his hand thinking it was almost cruel to pluck it the Spring met him as if in her own shape in the person of Margaret whom he spied a little way off leaning against the stem of a Scotch fir and looking up to its top swaying overhead in the first billows of the outburst ocean of life He went up to her with some shyness for the presence of even a child maiden was enough to make Sutherland shy partly from the fear of startling her shyness as one feels when drawing near a couching fawn But she when she heard his footsteps dropped her eyes slowly from the tree top and as if she were in her own sanctuary waited his approach He said nothing at first but offered her instead of speech the primrose he had just plucked which she received with a smile of the eyes only and the sweetest thank you sir he had ever heard But while she held the primrose in her hand her eyes wandered to the book which according to his custom Sutherland had caught up as he left the house It was the only well bound book in his possession and the eyes of Margaret not yet tutored by experience naturally expected an entrancing page within such beautiful boards for the gayest bindings she had seen were those of a few old annuals up at the house and were they not full of the most lovely tales and pictures In this case however her expectation was not vain for the volume was as I have already disclosed Coleridge s Poems Seeing her eyes fixed upon the book Would you like to read it said he If you please sir answered Margaret her eyes brightening with the expectation of deliglit Are you fond of poetry Her face fell The only poetry she knew was the Scotch Psalms and Paraphrases and such last century verses as formed the chief part of the selections in her school books for this was a very retired parish and the newer books had not yet reached its school She had hoped chiefly for tales I dinna ken much about poetry she answered trying to speak English There s an old book o t on my father s shelf but the letters o t are auld fashioned an I dinna care aboot it But this is quite easy to read and very beautiful said Hugh The girl s eyes glistened for a moment and this was all her reply Would you like to read it resumed Hugh seeing no further answer was on the road She held out her hand towards the volume When he in his turn held the volume towards her hand she almost snatched it from him and ran towards the house without a word of thanks or leave taking whether from eagerness or doubt of the propriety of accepting the offer Hugh could not conjecture He stood for some moments looking after her and then retraced his steps towards the house It would have been something in the monotony of one of the most trying of positions to meet one who snatched at the offered means of spiritual growth even if that disciple had not been a lovely girl with the woman waking in her eyes He commenced the duties of the day with considerably more of energy than he had yet brought to bear on his uninteresting pupils and this energy did not flag before its effects upon the boys began to react in fresh impulse upon itself CHAPTER IV THE COTTAGE O little Bethlem poor in walls But rich in furniture JOHN MASON S Spiritual Songs There was one great alleviation to the various discomforts of Sutherland s tutor life It was that except during school hours he was expected to take no charge whatever of his pupils They ran wild all other times which was far better in every way both for them and for him Consequently he was entirely his own master beyond the fixed margin of scholastic duties and he soon found that his absence even from the table was a matter of no interest to the family To be sure it involved his own fasting till the next meal time came round for the lady was quite a household martinet but that was his own concern That very evening he made his way to David s cottage about the country supper time when he thought he should most likely find him at home It was a clear still moonlit night with just an air of frost There was light enough for him to see that the cottage was very neat and tidy looking in the midst of its little forest more like an English than a Scotch habitation He had had the advantage of a few months residence in a leafy region on the other side of the Tweed and so was able to make the comparison But what a different leafage that was from this That was soft floating billowy this hard stiff and straight lined interfering so little with the skeleton form that it needed not to be put off in the wintry season of death to make the trees in harmony with the landscape A light was burning in the cottage visible through the inner curtain of muslin and the outer one of frost As he approached the door he heard the sound of a voice and from the even pitch of the tone he concluded at once that its owner was reading aloud The measured cadence soon convinced him that it was verse that was being read and the voice was evidently that of David and not of Margaret He knocked at the door The voice ceased chairs were pushed back and a heavy step approached David opened the door himself Eh Maister Sutherlan said he I thocht it micht aiblins be yersel Ye re welcome sir Come butt the hoose Our place is but sma but ye ll no min sitttin doon wi our ain sels Janet ooman this is Maister Sutherlan Maggy my doo he s a frien o yours o a day auld already Ye re kindly welcome Maister Sutherlan I m sure it s verra kin o you to come an see the like o huz As Hugh entered he saw his own bright volume lying on the table evidently that from which David had just been reading Margaret had already placed for him a cushioned arm chair the only comfortable one in the house and presently the table being drawn back they were all seated round the peat fire on the hearth the best sort for keeping feet warm at least On the crook or hooked iron chain suspended within the chimney hung a three footed pot in which potatoes were boiling away merrily for supper By the side of the wide chimney or more properly lum hung an iron lamp of an old classical form common to the country from the beak of which projected almost horizontally the lighted wick the pith of a rush The light perched upon it was small but clear and by it David had been reading Margaret sat right under it upon a creepie or small three legged wooden stool Sitting thus with the light falling on her from above Hugh could not help thinking she looked very pretty Almost the only object in the distance from which the feeble light was reflected was the patch work counterpane of a little bed filling a recess in the wall fitted with doors which stood open It was probably Margaret s refuge for the night Well said the tutor after they had been seated a few minutes and had had some talk about the weather surely no despicable subject after such a morning the first of Spring well how do you like the English poet mister Elginbrod Spier that at me this day week Maister Sutherlan an I ll aiblins answer ye but no the nicht no the nicht What for no said Hugh taking up the dialect For ae thing we re nae clean through wi the auld sailor s story yet an gin I hae learnt ae thing aboon anither its no to pass jeedgment upo halves I hae seen ill weather half the simmer an a thrang corn yard after an a an that o the best No that I m ill pleased wi the bonny ballant aither Weel will ye jist lat me read the lave o t till ye Wi muckle pleesur sir an mony thanks He showed Hugh how far they had got in the reading of the Ancient Mariner whereupon he took up the tale and carried it on to the end He had some facility in reading with expression and his few affectations for it must be confessed he was not free of such faults were not of a nature to strike uncritical hearers When he had finished he looked up and his eye chancing to light upon Margaret first he saw that her cheek was quite pale and her eyes overspread with the film not of coming tears but of emotion notwithstanding Well said Hugh again willing to break the silence and turning towards David what do you think of it now you have heard it all Whether Janet interrupted her husband or not I cannot tell but she certainly spoke first Tshavah equivalent to pshaw it s a lees What for are ye knittin yer broos ower a leein ballant a havers as weel as lees I m no jist prepared to say sae muckle Janet replied David there s mony a thing at s lees as ye ca t at s no lees a through Ye see Maister Sutherlan I m no gleg at the uptak an it jist taks me twise as lang as ither fowk to see to the ootside o a thing Whiles a sentence ill leuk to me clean nonsense a thegither an maybe a haill ook efter it ll come upo me a at ance an fegs it s the best thing in a the beuk Margaret s eyes were fixed on her father with a look which I can only call faithfulness as if every word he spoke was truth whether she could understand it or not But perhaps we may look too far for meanings sometimes suggested Sutherland Maybe maybe but when a body has a suspeecion o a trowth he sud never lat sit till he s gotten eyther hit or an assurance that there s nothing there But there s jist ae thing in the poem at I can pit my finger upo an say at it s no richt clear to me whether it s a straucht foret or no What s that mister Elginbrod It s jist this what for a thae sailor men fell doon deid an the chield at shot the bonnie burdie an did a the mischeef cam to little hurt i the en comparateevely Well said Hugh I confess I m not prepared to answer the question If you get any light on the subject Ow I daursay I may A heap o things comes to me as I m takin a daunder by mysel i the gloamin I ll no say a thing s wrang till I hae tried it ower an ower

verra welcome to that or ony ither beuk I hae replied Hugh who began to feel already as if he were in the hands of a superior Mony thanks but ye see sir we hae eneuch to chow upo for an aucht days or so By this time the potatoes wore considered to be cooked and were accordingly lifted off the fire The water was then poured away the lid put aside and the pot hung once more upon the crook hooked a few rings further up in the chimney in order that the potatoes might be thoroughly dry before they were served Margaret was now very busy spreading the cloth and laying spoon and plates on the table Hugh rose to go Will ye no bide said Janet in a most hospitable tone an tak a het pitawta wi us I m afraid of being troublesome answered he Nae fear o that gin ye can jist pit up wi oor hamely meat Mak nae apologies Janet my woman said David A het pitawta s aye guid fare for gentle or semple Sit ye doun again Maister Sutherlan Maggy my doo whaur s the milk I thocht Hawkie wad hae a drappy o het milk by this time said Margaret and sae I jist loot it be to the last but I ll hae t drawn in twa minutes And away she went with a jug commonly called a decanter in that part of the north in her hand That s hardly fair play to Hawkie said David to Janet with a smile Hoot Dawvid ye see we haena a stranger ilka nicht But really said Hugh I hope this is the last time you will consider me a stranger for I shall be here a great many times that is if you don t get tired of me Gie us the chance at least Maister Sutherlan It s no sma preevilege to fowk like us to hae a frien wi sae muckle buik

o s My man ye ought to be thankfu With the true humility that comes of worshipping the Truth David had not the smallest idea that he was immeasurably nearer to the stars than Hugh Sutherland Maggie having returned with her jug full of frothy milk and the potatoes being already heaped up in a wooden bowl or bossie in the middle of the table sending the smoke of their hospitality to the rafters Janet placed a smaller wooden bowl called a caup filled with deliciously yellow milk of Hawkie s latest gathering for each individual of the company with an attendant horn spoon by its side They all drew their chairs to the table and David asking no blessing as it was called but nevertheless giving thanks for the blessing already bestowed namely the perfect gift of food invited Hugh to make a supper Each in primitive but not ungraceful fashion took a potatoe from the dish with the fingers and ate it bite and sup with the help of the horn spoon for the milk Hugh thought he had never supped more pleasantly and could not help observing how far real good breeding is independent of the forms and refinements of what has assumed to itself the name of society Soon after supper was over it was time for him to go so after kind hand shakings and good nights David accompanied him to the road where he left him to find his way home by the star light As he went he could not help pondering a little over the fact that a labouring man had discovered a difficulty perhaps a fault in one of his favourite poems which had never suggested itself to him He soon satisfied himself however by coming to the conclusion that the poet had not cared about the matter at all having had no further intention in the poem than Hugh himself had found in it namely witchery and loveliness But it seemed to the young student a wonderful fact that the intercourse which was denied him in the laird s family simply from their utter incapacity of yielding it should be afforded him in the family of a man who had followed the plough himself once perhaps did so still having risen only to be the overseer and superior assistant of labourers He certainly felt on his way home much more reconciled to the prospect of his sojourn at Turriepuffit than he would have thought it possible he ever should David lingered a few moments looking up at the stars before he re entered his cottage When he rejoined his wife and child he found the Bible already open on the table for their evening devotions I will close this chapter as I began the first with something like his prayer David s prayers were characteristic of the whole man but they also partook in far more than ordinary of the mood of the moment His last occupation had been star gazing O thou wha keeps the stars alicht an our souls burnin wi a licht aboon that o the stars grant that they may shine afore thee as the stars for ever and ever An as thou hauds the stars burnin a the nicht whan there s no man to see so haud thou the licht burnin in our souls whan we see neither thee nor it but are buried in the grave o sleep an forgetfu ness Be thou by us even as a mother sits by the bedside o her ailin wean a the lang nicht only be thou nearer to us even in our verra souls an watch ower the warl o dreams that they mak for themsels Grant that more an more thochts o thy thinkin may come into our herts day by day till there shall be at last an open road atween thee an us an thy angels may ascend and descend upon us so that we may be in thy heaven e en while we are upo thy earth Amen CHAPTER V THE STUDENTS In wood and stone not the softest but hardest be always aptest for portraiture both fairest for pleasure and most durable for profit Hard wits be hard to receive but sure to keep painful without weariness heedful without wavering constant without new fangleness bearing heavy things though not lightly yet willingly entering hard things though not easily yet deeply and so come to that perfectness of learning in the end that quick wits seem in hope but do not in deed or else very seldom ever attain unto ROGER ASCHAM The Schoolmaster Two or three very simple causes united to prevent Hugh from repeating his visit to David so soon as he would otherwise have done One was that the fine weather continuing he was seized with the desire of exploring the neighbourhood The spring which sets some wild animals to the construction of new dwellings incites man to the enlarging of his making as it were by discovery that which lies around him his own So he spent the greater parts of several evenings in wandering about the neighbourhood till at length the moonlight failed him Another cause was that in the act of searching for some books for his boys in an old garret of the house which was at once lumber room and library he came upon some stray volumes of the Waverley novels with which he was as yet only partially acquainted These absorbed many of his spare hours But one evening while reading the Heart of Midlothian the thought struck him what a character David would have been for Sir Walter Whether he was right or not is a question but the notion brought David so vividly before him that it roused the desire to see him He closed the book at once and went to the cottage We re no lik ly to ca ye onything but a stranger yet Maister Sutherlan said David as he entered I ve been busy since I saw you was all the excuse Hugh offered Weel ye r welcome noo and ye ve jist come in time after a for it s no that mony hours sin I fand it oot awthegither to my ain settisfaction Found out what said Hugh for he had forgotten all about the perplexity in which he had left David and which had been occupying his thoughts ever since their last interview Aboot the cross bow an the birdie ye ken answered David in a tone of surprise Yes to be sure How stupid of me said Hugh Weel ye see the meanin o the haill ballant is no that ill to win at seein the poet himsel tells us that It s jist no to be proud or ill natured to oor neebours the beasts and birds for God made ane an a o s But there s harder things in t nor that and yon s the hardest But ye see it was jist an unlucky thochtless deed o the puir auld sailor s an I m thinkin he was sair reprocht in s hert the minit he did it His mates was fell angry at him no for killin the puir innocent craytur but for fear o ill luck in consequence Syne when nane followed they turned richt roun an took awa the character o the puir beastie efter twas deid They appruved o the verra thing at he was nae doot sorry for But onything to haud aff o themsels Nae suner cam the calm than roun they gaed again like the weathercock an naething wad content them bit hingin the deid craytur about the auld man s craig an abusin him forby Sae ye see hoo they war a wheen selfish crayturs an a hantle waur nor the man at was led astray into an ill deed But still he maun rue t Sae Death got them an a kin o leevin Death a she Death as twar an in some respecks may be waur than the ither got grips o him puir auld body It s a fair and richt to the backbane o the ballant Maister Sutherlan an that I se uphaud Hugh could not help feeling considerably astonished to hear this criticism from the lips of one whom he considered an uneducated man For he did not know that there are many other educations besides a college one some of them tending far more than that to develope the common sense or faculty of judging of things by their nature Life intelligently met and honestly passed is the best education of all except that higher one to which it is intended to lead and to which it had led David Both these educations however were nearly unknown to the student of books But he was still more astonished to hear from the lips of Margaret who was sitting by That s it father that s it I was jist ettlin efter that same thing mysel or something like it but ye put it in the richt words exackly The sound of her voice drew Hugh s eyes upon her he was astonished at the alteration in her countenance While she spoke it was absolutely beautiful As soon as she ceased speaking it settled back into its former shadowless calm Her father gave her one approving glance and nod expressive of no surprise at her having approached the same discovery as himself but testifying pleasure at the coincidence of their opinions Nothing was left for Hugh but to express his satisfaction with the interpretation of the difficulty and to add that the poem would henceforth possess fresh interest for him After this his visits became more frequent and at length David made a request which led to their greater frequency still It was to this effect Do ye think mister Sutherlan I could do onything at my age at the mathematics I unnerstan weel eneuch hoo to measur lan an that kin o thing I jist follow the rule But the rule itsel s a puzzler to me I dinna understan it by half Noo it seems to me that the best o a rule is no to mak ye able to do a thing but to lead ye to what maks the rule richt to the prenciple o the thing It s no at I m misbelievin the rule but I want to see the richts o t I ve no doubt you could learn fast enough replied Hugh I shall be very happy to help you with it Na na I m no gaein to trouble you Ye hae eneuch to do in that way But if ye could jist spare me ane or twa o yer beuks whiles ony o them at ye think proper I sud be muckle obleeged te ye Hugh promised and fulfilled but the result was that before long both the father and the daughter were seated at the kitchen table every evening busy with Euclid and Algebra and that on most evenings Hugh was present as their instructor It was quite a new pleasure to him Few delights surpass those of imparting knowledge to the eager recipient What made Hugh s tutor life irksome was partly the excess of his desire to communicate over the desire of his pupils to partake But here there was no labour All the questions were asked by the scholars A single lesson had not passed however before David put questions which Hugh was unable to answer and concerning which he was obliged to confess his ignorance Instead of being discouraged as eager questioners are very ready to be when they receive no answer David merely said Weel weel we maun bide a wee and went on with what he was able to master Meantime Margaret though forced to lag a good way behind her father and to apply much more frequently to their tutor for help yet secured all she got and that is great praise for any student She was not by any means remarkably quick but she knew when she did not understand and that is a sure and indispensable step towards understanding It is indeed a rarer gift than the power of understanding itself The gratitude of David was too deep to be expressed in any formal thanks It broke out at times in two or three simple words when the conversation presented an opportunity or in the midst of their work as by its own self birth ungenerated by association During the lesson which often lasted more than two hours Janet would be busy about the room and in and out of it with a manifest care to suppress all unnecessary bustle As soon as Hugh made his appearance she would put off the stout shoes man s shoes as we should consider them which she always wore at other times and put on a pair of bauchles that is an old pair of her Sunday shoes put down at heel and so converted into slippers with which she could move about less noisily At times her remarks would seem to imply that she considered it rather absurd in her husband to trouble himself with book learning but evidently on the ground that he knew everything already that was worthy of the honour of his acquaintance whereas with regard to Margaret her heart was as evidently full of pride at the idea of the education her daughter was getting from the laird s own tutor Now and then she would stand still for a moment and gaze at them with her bright black eyes from under the white frills of her mutch her bare brown arms akimbo and a look of pride upon her equally brown honest face Her dress consisted of a wrapper or short loose jacket of printed calico and a blue winsey petticoat which she had a habit of tucking between her knees to keep it out of harm s way as often as she stooped to any wet work or more especially when doing anything by the fire Margaret s dress was in ordinary like her mother s with the exception of the cap but every evening when their master was expected she put off her wrapper and substituted a gown of the same material a cotton print and so with her plentiful dark hair gathered neatly under a net of brown silk the usual head dress of girls in her position both in and out of doors sat down dressed for the sacrament of wisdom David made no other preparation than the usual evening washing of his large well wrought hands and bathing of his head covered with thick dark hair plentifully lined with grey in a tub of cold water from which his face which was cremsin dyed ingrayne by the weather emerged glowing He sat down at the table in his usual rough blue coat and plain brass buttons with his breeches of broad striped corduroy his blue ribbed stockings and leather gaiters or cuiticans disposed under the table and his shoes with five rows of broad headed nails in the soles projecting from beneath it on the other side for he was a tall man six feet still although five and fifty and considerably bent in the shoulders with hard work Sutherland s style was that of a gentleman who must wear out his dress coat Such was the group which three or four evenings in the week might be seen in David Elginbrod s cottage seated around the white deal table with their books and slates upon it and searching by the light of a tallow candle substituted as more convenient for the ordinary lamp after the mysteries of the universe The influences of reviving nature and of genial companionship operated very favourably upon Hugh s spirits and consequently upon his whole powers For some time he had as I have already hinted succeeded in interesting his boy pupils in their studies and now the progress they made began to be appreciable to themselves as well as to their tutor This of course made them more happy and more diligent There were no attempts now to work upon their parents for a holiday no real or pretended head or tooth aches whose disability was urged against the greater torture of ill conceded mental labour They began in fact to understand and in proportion to the beauty and value of the thing understood to understand is to enjoy Therefore the laird and his lady could not help seeing that the boys were doing well far better in fact than they had ever done before and consequently began not only to prize Hugh s services but to think more highly of his office than had been their wont The laird would now and then invite him to join him in a tumbler of toddy after dinner or in a ride round the farm after school hours But it must be confessed that these approaches to friendliness were rather irksome to Hugh for whatever the laird might have been as a collegian he was certainly now nothing more than a farmer Where David Elginbrod would have described many a bonny sicht the laird only saw the probable results of harvest in the shape of figures in his banking book On one occasion Hugh roused his indignation by venturing to express his admiration of the delightful mingling of colours in a field where a good many scarlet poppies grew among the green blades of the corn indicating to the agricultural eye the poverty of the soil where they were found This fault in the soil the laird like a child resented upon the poppies themselves Nasty ugly weyds We ll hae ye admirin the smut neist said he contemptuously cause the bairns can bleck ane anither s faces wi t But surely said Hugh putting other considerations aside you must allow that the colour especially when mingled with that of the corn is beautiful Deil hae t It s jist there at I canna bide the sicht o t Beauty ye may ca t I see nane o t I d as sune hae a reid heedit bairn as see thae reid coatit rascals i my corn I houp ye re no gaen to cram stuff like that into the heeds o the twa laddies Faith we ll hae them sawin thae ill faured weyds amang the wheyt neist Poapies ca ye them Weel I wat they re the Popp s ain bairns an the scarlet wumman to the mither o them Ha ha ha Having manifested both wit and Protestantism in the closing sentence of his objurgation the laird relapsed into good humour and stupidity Hugh would gladly have spent such hours in David s cottage instead but he was hardly prepared to refuse his company to mister Glasford CHAPTER VI THE LAIRD S LADY Ye archewyves standith at defence Sin ye been strong as is a great camayle Ne suffer not that men you don offence And slender wives fell as in battaile Beth eager as is a tiger yond in Inde Aye clappith as a mill I you counsaile CHAUCER The Clerk s Tale The length and frequency of Hugh s absences careless as she was of his presence had already attracted the attention of missus Glasford and very little trouble had to be expended on the discovery of his haunt For the servants knew well enough where he went and of course had come to their own conclusions as to the object of his visits So the lady chose to think it her duty to expostulate with Hugh on the subject Accordingly one morning after breakfast the laird having gone to mount his horse and the boys to have a few minutes play before lessons missus Glasford who had kept her seat at the head of the table waiting for the opportunity turned towards Hugh who sat reading the week s news folded her hands on the tablecloth drew herself up yet a little more stiffly in her chair and thus addressed him It s my duty mister Sutherland seein ye have no mother to look after ye Hugh expected something matronly about his linen or his socks and put down his newspaper with a smile but to his astonishment she went on To remonstrate wi ye on the impropriety of going so often to David Elginbrod s They re not company for a young gentleman like you mister Sutherland They re good enough company for a poor tutor missus Glasford replied Hugh foolishly enough Not at all not at all insisted the lady With your connexions Good gracious who ever said anything about my connexions I never pretended to have any Hugh was getting angry already missus Glasford nodded her head significantly as much as to say I know more about you than you imagine and then went on Your mother will never forgive me if you get into a scrape with that smooth faced hussy and if her father honest man hasn t eyes enough in his head other people have ay an tongues too mister Sutherland Hugh was on the point of forgetting his manners and consigning all the above mentioned organs to perdition but he managed to restrain his wrath and merely said that Margaret was one of the best girls he had ever known and that there was no possible danger of any kind of scrape with her This mode of argument however was not calculated to satisfy missus Glasford She returned to the charge She s a sly puss with her shy airs and graces Her father s jist daft wi conceit o her an it s no to be surprised if she cast a glamour ower you mister Sutherland ye re but young yet Hugh s pride presented any alliance with a lassie who had herded the laird s cows barefoot and even now tended their own cow as an all but inconceivable absurdity and he resented more than he could have thought possible the entertainment of such a degrading idea in the mind of missus Glasford Indignation prevented him from replying while she went on getting more vernacular as she proceeded It s no for lack o company at yer driven to seek theirs I m sure There s twa as fine lads an gude scholars as ye ll fin in the haill kintra side no to mention the laird and mysel But Hugh could bear it no longer nor would he condescend to excuse or explain his conduct Madam I beg you will not mention this subject again But I will mention t mister Sutherlan an if ye ll no listen to rizzon I ll go to them at maun do t I am accountable to you madam for my conduct in your house and for the way in which I discharge my duty to your children no further Do ye ca that dischairgin yer duty to my bairns to set them the example o hingin at a quean s apron strings and fillin her lug wi idle havers Ca ye that dischairgin yer duty My certie a bonny dischairgin I never see the girl but in her father and mother s presence Weel weel mister Sutherlan said missus Glasford in a final tone and trying to smother the anger which she felt she had allowed to carry her further than was decorous we ll say nae mair aboot it at present but I maun jist speak to the laird himsel an see what he says till t And with this threat she walked out of the room in what she considered a dignified manner Hugh was exceedingly annoyed at this treatment and thought at first of throwing up his situation at once but he got calmer by degrees and saw that it would be to his own loss and perhaps to the injury of his friends at the cottage So he took his revenge by recalling the excited face of missus Glasford whose nose had got as red with passion as the protuberance of a turkey cock when gobbling out its unutterable feelings of disdain He dwelt upon this soothing contemplation till a fit of laughter relieved him and he was able to go and join his pupils as if nothing had happened Meanwhile the lady sent for David who was at work in the garden into no less an audience chamber than the drawing room the revered abode of all the tutelar deities of the house chief amongst which were the portraits of the laird and herself he plethoric and wrapped in voluminous folds of neckerchief she long necked and lean and bare shouldered The original of the latter work of art seated herself in the most important chair in the room and when David after carefully wiping the shoes he had already wiped three times on his way up entered with a respectful but no wise obsequious bow she ordered him with the air of an empress to shut the door When he had obeyed she ordered him in a similar tone to be seated for she sought to mingle condescension and conciliation with severity David she then began I am informed that ye keep open door to our mister Sutherland and that he spends most forenichts in your company Weel mem it s verra true was all David s answer He sat in an expectant attitude Dawvid I wonner at ye returned missus Glasford forgetting her dignity and becoming confidentially remonstrative Here s a young gentleman o talans wi ilka prospeck o waggin his heid in a poopit some day an ye aid an abet him in idlin awa his time at your chimla lug duin waur nor naething ava I m surprised at ye Dawvid I thocht ye had mair sense David looked out of his clear blue untroubled eyes upon the ruffled countenance of his mistress with an almost paternal smile Weel mem I maun say I dinna jist think the young man s in the warst o company when he s at our ingle neuk An for idlin o his time awa it s weel waurd for himsel forby for us gin holy words binna lees What do ye mean Dawvid said the lady rather sharply for she loved no riddles I mean this mem that the young man is jist actin the pairt o Peter an John at the bonny gate o the temple whan they said Such as I have gie I thee an gin it be more blessed to gie than to receive as Sant Paul says at the Maister himsel said the young man ill no be the waur aff in s ain learnin that he impairts o t to them that hunger for t Ye mean by this Dawvid gin ye could express yersel to the pint at the young man wha s ower weel paid to instruck my bairns neglecks them an lays himsel oot upo ither fowk s weans wha hae no richt to ettle aboon the station in which their Maker pat them This was uttered with quite a religious fervour of expostulation for the lady s natural indignation at the thought of Meg Elginbrod having lessons from her boys tutor was cowed beneath the quiet steady gaze of the noble minded peasant father He lays himsel oot mair upo the ither fowk themsels than upo their weans mem though nae doubt my Maggy comes in for a gude share But for negleckin o his duty to you mem I m sure I kenna hoo that can be for it was only yestreen at the laird himsel said to me at hoo the bairns had never gotten on naething like it wi ony ither body The laird s ower ready wi s clavers quoth the laird s wife nettled to find herself in the wrong and forgetful of her own and her lord s dignity at once But she pursued all I can say is that I consider it verra improper o you wi a young lass bairn to encourage the nichtly veesits o a young gentleman wha s sae far aboon her in station an dootless will some day be farther yet Mem said David with dignity I m willin no to understan what ye mean My Maggy s no ane at needs luikin efter an a body had need to be carefu an no interfere wi the Lord s herdin for he ca s himsel the Shepherd o the sheep an weel as I loe her I maun lea him to lead them wha follow him wherever he goeth She ll be no ill guidit and I m no gaeing to kep her at ilka turn Weel weel that s yer ain affair Dawvid my man rejoined missus Glasford with rising voice and complexion A at I hae to add is jist this at as lang as my tutor veesits her He veesits her no more than me mem interposed David but his mistress went on with dignified disregard of the interruption Veesits her I canna for the sake o my own bairns an the morals o my hoosehold employ her aboot the hoose as I was in the way o doin afore Good mornin Dawvid I ll speak to the laird himsel sin ye ll no heed me It s more to my lassie mem excuse me to learn to unnerstan the works o her Maker than it is to be employed in your household Mony thanks mem for what ye hev done in that way afore an good mornin to ye mem I m sorry we should hae ony misunderstandin but I canna help it for my pairt With these words David withdrew rather anxious about the consequences to Hugh of this unpleasant interference on the part of missus Glasford That lady s wrath kept warm without much nursing till the laird came home when she turned the whole of her battery upon him and kept up a steady fire until he yielded and promised to turn his upon David But he had more common sense than his wife in some things and saw at once how ridiculous it would be to treat the affair as of importance So the next time he saw David he addressed him half jocularly Weel Dawvid you an the mistress hae been haein a bit o a dispute thegither eh Weel sir we warna a thegither o ae min said David with a smile Weel weel we maun humour her ye ken or it may be the waur for us a ye ken And the laird nodded with humorous significance I m sure I sud be glaid sir but this is no sma maitter to me an my Maggie for we re jist gettin food for the verra sowl sir frae him an his beuks Cudna ye be content wi the beuks wi out the man Dawvid We sud mak but sma progress sir that get The laird began to be a little nettled himself at David s stiffness about such a small matter and held his peace David resumed Besides sir that s a maitter for the young man to sattle an no for me It wad ill become me efter a he s dune for us to steek the door in s face Na na as lang s I hae a door to haud open it s no to be steekit to him Efter a the door s mine Dawvid said the laird As lang s I m in your hoose an in your service sir the door s mine retorted David quietly The laird turned and rode away without another word What passed between him and his wife never transpired Nothing more was said to Hugh as long as he remained at Turriepuffit But Margaret was never sent for to the House after this upon any occasion whatever The laird gave her a nod as often as he saw her but the lady if they chanced to meet took no notice of her Margaret on her part stood or passed with her eyes on the ground and no further change of countenance than a slight flush of discomfort The lessons went on as usual and happy hours they were for all those concerned Often in after years and in far different circumstances the thoughts of Hugh reverted with a painful yearning to the dim lighted cottage with its clay floor and its deal table to the earnest pair seated with him at the labours that unfold the motions of the stars and even to the homely thickset but active form of Janet and that peculiar smile of hers with which after an apparently snappish speech spoken with her back to the person addressed she would turn round her honest face half apologetically and shine full upon some one or other of the three whom she honoured with her whole heart and soul and who she feared might be offended at what she called her hame ower fashion of speaking Indeed it was wonderful what a share the motherhood of this woman incapable as she was of entering into the intellectual occupations of the others had in producing that sense of home blessedness which inwrapt Hugh also in the folds of its hospitality and drew him towards its heart Certain it is that not one of the three would have worked so well without the sense of the presence of Janet here and there about the room or in the immediate neighbourhood of it love watching over labour Once a week always on Saturday nights Hugh stayed to supper with them and on these occasions Janet contrived to have something better than ordinary in honour of their guest Still it was of the homeliest country fare such as Hugh could partake of without the least fear that his presence occasioned any inconvenience to his entertainers Nor was Hugh the only giver of spiritual food Putting aside the rich gifts of human affection and sympathy which grew more and more pleasant I can hardly use a stronger word yet to Hugh every day many things were spoken by the simple wisdom of David which would have enlightened Hugh far more than they did had he been sufficiently advanced to receive them But their very simplicity was often far beyond the grasp of his thoughts for the higher we rise the simpler we become and David was one of those of whom is the kingdom of Heaven There is a childhood into which we have to grow just as there is a childhood which we must leave behind a childlikeness which is the highest gain of humanity and a childishness from which but few of those who are counted the wisest among men have freed themselves in their imagined progress towards the reality of things CHAPTER VII THE SECRET OF THE WOOD The unthrift sunne shot vitall gold A thousand pieces And heaven its azure did unfold Chequered with snowy fleeces The air was all in spice And every bush A garland wore Thus fed my Eyes But all the Eare lay hush HENRY VAUGHAN It was not in mathematics alone that Hugh Sutherland was serviceable to Margaret Elginbrod That branch of study had been chosen for her father not for her but her desire to learn had led her to lay hold upon any mental provision with which the table happened to be spread and the more eagerly that her father was a guest at the same feast Before long Hugh bethought him that it might possibly be of service to her in the course of her reading if he taught her English a little more thoroughly than she had probably picked it up at the parish school to which she had been in the habit of going till within a very short period of her acquaintance with the tutor The English reader must not suppose the term parish school to mean what the same term would mean if used in England Boys and girls of very different ranks go to the Scotch parish schools and the fees are so small as to place their education within the reach of almost the humblest means To his proposal to this effect Margaret responded thankfully and it gave Hugh an opportunity of directing her attention to many of the more delicate distinctions in literature for the appreciation of which she manifested at once a remarkable aptitude Coleridge s poems had been read long ago some of them indeed almost committed to memory in the process of repeated perusal No doubt a good many of them must have been as yet too abstruse for her not in the least however from inaptitude in her for such subjects as they treated of but simply because neither the terms nor the modes of thought could possibly have been as yet presented to her in so many different positions as to enable her to comprehend their scope Hugh lent her Sir Walter s poems next but those she read at an eye glance She returned the volume in a week saying merely they were verra bonnie stories He saw at once that to have done them justice with the girl he ought to have lent them first But that could not be helped now and what should come next Upon this he took thought His library was too small to cause much perplexity of choice but for a few days he continued undecided Meantime the interest he felt in his girl pupil deepened greatly She became a kind of study to him The expression of her countenance was far inferior to her intelligence and power of thought It was still to excess almost dull in ordinary not from any fault in the mould of the features except perhaps in the upper lip which seemed deficient in drawing if I may be allowed the expression but from the absence of that light which indicates the presence of active thought and feeling within In this respect her face was like the earthen pitcher of Gideon it concealed the light She seemed to have to a peculiar degree the faculty of retiring inside But now and then while he was talking to her and doubtful from the lack of expression whether she was even listening with attention to what he was saying her face would lighten up with a radiant smile of intelligence not however throwing the light upon him and in a moment reverting to its former condition of still twilight Her person seemed not to be as yet thoroughly possessed or informed by her spirit It sat apart within her and there was no ready transit from her heart to her face This lack of presence in the face is quite common in pretty school girls and rustic beauties but it was manifest to an unusual degree in the case of Margaret Yet most of the forms and lines in her face were lovely and when the light did shine through them for a passing moment her countenance seemed absolutely beautiful Hence it grew into an almost haunting temptation with Hugh to try to produce this expression to unveil the coy light of the beautiful soul Often he tried often he failed and sometimes he succeeded Had they been alone it might have become dangerous I mean for Hugh I cannot tell for Margaret When they first met she had just completed her seventeenth year but at an age when a town bred girl is all but a woman her manners were those of a child This childishness however soon began to disappear and the peculiar stillness of her face of which I have already said so much made her seem older than she was It was now early summer and all the other trees in the wood of which there were not many besides the firs of various kinds had put on their fresh leaves heaped up in green clouds between the wanderer and the heavens In the morning the sun shone so clear upon these that to the eyes of one standing beneath the light seemed to dissolve them away to the most ethereal forms of glorified foliage They were to be claimed for earth only by the shadows that the one cast upon the other visible from below through the transparent leaf This effect is very lovely in the young season of the year when the leaves are more delicate and less crowded and especially in the early morning when the light is most clear and penetrating By the way I do not think any man is compelled to bid good bye to his childhood every man may feel young in the morning middle aged in the afternoon and old at night A day corresponds to a life and the portions of the one are pictures in little of the seasons of the other Thus far man may rule even time and gather up in a perfect being youth and age at once One morning about six o clock Hugh who had never been so early in the wood since the day he had met Margaret there was standing under a beech tree looking up through its multitudinous leaves illuminated as I have attempted to describe with the sidelong rays of the brilliant sun He was feeling young and observing the forms of nature with a keen discriminating gaze that was all Fond of writing verses he was studying nature not as a true lover but as one who would hereafter turn his discoveries to use For it must be confessed that nature affected him chiefly through the medium of poetry and that he was far more ambitious of writing beautiful things about nature than of discovering and understanding for their own sakes any of her hidden yet patent meanings Changing his attitude after a few moments he descried under another beech tree not far from him Margaret standing and looking up fixedly as he had been doing a moment before He approached her and she hearing his advance looked and saw him but did not move He thought he saw the glimmer of tears in her eyes She was the first to speak however What were you seeing up there mister Sutherland I was only looking at the bright leaves and the shadows upon them Ah I thocht maybe ye had seen something What do you mean Margaret I dinna richtly ken mysel But I aye expeck to see something in this fir wood I m here maist mornin s as the day dawns but I m later the day We were later than usual at our work last night But what kind of thing do you expect to see That s jist what I dinna ken An I canna min whan I began to come here first luikin for something I ve tried mony a time but I canna min do what I like Margaret had never said so much about herself before I can account for it only on the supposition that Hugh had gradually assumed in her mind a kind of pastoral superiority which at a favourable moment inclined her to impart her thoughts to him But he did not know what to say to this strange fact in her history She went on however as if having broken the ice she must sweep it away as well The only thing at helps me to account for t is a picter in our auld Bible o an angel sittin aneth a tree and haudin up his han as gin he were speakin to a woman at s stan in afore him Ilka time at I come across that picter I feel direckly as gin I war my lane in this fir wood here sae I suppose that when I was a wee bairn I maun hae come oot some mornin my lane wi the expectation o seein an angel here waitin for me to speak to me like the ane i the Bible But never an angel hae I seen Yet I aye hae an expectation like o seein something I kenna what for the whole place aye seems fu o a presence an it s a hantle mair to me nor the kirk an the sermon forby an for the singin the soun i the fir taps is far mair solemn and sweet at the same time an muckle mair like praisin o God than a the psalms thegither But I aye think at gin I could hear Milton playin on s organ it would be mair like that soun o mony waters than onything else at I can think o Hugh stood and gazed at her in astonishment To his more refined ear there was a strange incongruity between the somewhat coarse dialect in which she spoke and the things she uttered in it Not that he was capable of entering into her feelings much less of explaining them to her He felt that there was something remarkable in them but attributed both the thoughts themselves and their influence on him to an uncommon and weird imagination As of such origin however he was just the one to value them highly Those are very strange ideas he said But what can there be about the wood The very primroses ye brocht me the first this spring yersel mister Sutherland come out at the fit o the trees and look at me as if they said We ken we ken a aboot it but never a word mair they say There s something by ordinar in t Do you like no other place besides said Hugh for the sake of saying something Ou ay mony ane but nane like this What kind of place do you like best I like places wi green grass an flowers amo t You like flowers then Like them whiles they gar me greet an whiles they gar me lauch but there s mair i them than that an i the wood too I canna richtly say my prayers in ony ither place The Scotch dialect especially to one brought up in the Highlands was a considerable antidote to the effect of the beauty of what Margaret said Suddenly it struck Hugh that if Margaret were such an admirer of nature possibly she might enjoy Wordsworth He himself was as yet incapable of doing him anything like justice and with the arrogance of youth did not hesitate to smile at the Excursion picking out an awkward line here and there as especial food for laughter even But many of his smaller pieces he enjoyed very heartily although not thoroughly the element of Christian Pantheism which is their soul being beyond his comprehension almost perception as yet So he made up his mind after a moment s reflection that this should be the next author he recommended to his pupil He hoped likewise so to end an interview in which he might otherwise be compelled to confess that he could render Margaret no assistance in her search after the something in the wood and he was unwilling to say he could not understand her for a power of universal sympathy was one of those mental gifts which Hugh was most anxious to believe he possessed I will bring you another book to night said he which I think you will like and which may perhaps help you to find out what is in the wood He said this smiling half in playful jest and without any idea of the degree of likelihood that there was notwithstanding in what he said For certainly Wordsworth the high priest of nature though perhaps hardly the apostle of nature was more likely than any other writer to contain something of the secret after which Margaret was searching Whether she can find it there may seem questionable Thank you sir said Margaret gratefully but her whole countenance looked troubled as she turned towards her home Doubtless however the trouble vanished before she reached it for hers was not a nature to cherish disquietude Hugh too went home rather thoughtful In the evening he took a volume of Wordsworth and repaired according to his wont to David s cottage It was Saturday and he would stay to supper After they had given the usual time to their studies Hugh setting Margaret some exercises in English to write on her slate while he helped David with some of the elements of Trigonometry and again going over those elements with her while David worked out a calculation after these were over and while Janet was putting the supper on the table Hugh pulled out his volume and without any preface read them the Leech Gatherer All listened very intently Janet included who delayed several of the operations that she might lose no word of the verses David nodding assent every now and then and ejaculating ay ay or eh man or producing that strange muffled sound at once common and peculiar to Scotchmen which cannot be expressed in letters by a nearer approach than hm hm uttered if that can be called uttering with closed lips and open nasal passage and Margaret sitting motionless on her creepie with upturned pale face and eyes fixed upon the lips of the reader When he had ceased all were silent for a moment when Janet made some little sign of anxiety about her supper which certainly had suffered by the delay Then without a word David turned towards the table and gave thanks Turning again to Hugh who had risen to place his chair he said That maun be the wark o a great poet mister Sutherlan It s Wordsworth s said Hugh Ay ay That s Wordsworth s Ay Weel I hae jist heard him made mention o but I never read word o his afore An he never repentit o that same resolution I se warrant at he eynds aff wi Hoo does it gang mister Sutherlan Sutherland read God said I be my help and stay secure I ll think of the leech gatherer on the lonely moor and added It is said Wordsworth never knew what it was to be in want of money all his life Nae doubt nae doubt he trusted in Him It was for the sake of the minute notices of nature and not for the religious lesson which he now seemed to see for the first time that Hugh had read the poem He could not help being greatly impressed by the confidence with which David received the statement he had just made on the authority of De Quincey in his unpleasant article about Wordsworth David resumed He maun hae had a gleg ee o his ain that Maister Wordsworth to notice a thing that get Weel he maun hae likit leevin things puir maukin an a jist like our Robbie Burns for that An see hoo they a ken ane anither thae poets What says he aboot Burns ye needna tell me mister Sutherlan I min t weel aneuch He says Him wha walked in glory an in joy Followin his ploo upo the muntain side Puir Robbie puir Robbie But man he was a gran chield efter a an I trust in God he s won hame by this Both Janet and Hugh who had had a very orthodox education started mentally at this strange utterance but they saw the eye of David solemnly fixed as if in deep contemplation and lighted in its blue depths with an ethereal brightness and neither of them ventured to speak Margaret seemed absorbed for the moment in gazing on her father s face but not in the least as if it perplexed her like the fir wood To the seeing eye the same kind of expression would have been evident in both countenances as if Margaret s reflected the meaning of her father s whether through the medium of intellectual sympathy or that of the heart only it would have been hard to say Meantime supper had been rather neglected but its operations were now resumed more earnestly and the conversation became lighter till at last it ended in hearty laughter and Hugh rose and took his leave CHAPTER VIII A SUNDAY MORNING It is the property of good and sound knowledge to putrifie and dissolve into a number of subtle idle unwholesome and as I may tearme them vermiculate questions which have indeed a kinde of quicknesse and life of spirite but no soundnesse of matter or goodnesse of quality LORD BACON Advancement of Learning The following morning the laird s family went to church as usual and Hugh went with them Their walk was first across fields by pleasant footpaths and then up the valley of a little noisy stream that obstinately refused to keep Scotch Sabbath praising the Lord after its own fashion They emerged into rather a bleak country before reaching the church which was quite new and perched on a barren eminence that it might be as conspicuous by its position as it was remarkable for its ugliness One grand aim of the reformers of the Scottish ecclesiastical modes appears to have been to keep the worship pure and the worshippers sincere by embodying the whole in the ugliest forms that could be associated with the name of Christianity It might be wished however that some of their followers and amongst them the clergyman of the church in question had been content to stop there and had left the object of worship as represented by them in the possession of some lovable attribute so as not to require a man to love that which is unlovable or worship that which is not honourable in a word to bow down before that which is not divine The cause of this degeneracy they share in common with the followers of all other great men as well as of Calvin They take up what their leader urged by the necessity of the time spoke loudest never heeding what he loved most and then work the former out to a logical perdition of everything belonging to the latter Hugh however thought it was all right for he had the same good reasons and no other for receiving it all that a Mohammedan or a Buddhist has for holding his opinions namely that he had heard those doctrines and those alone from his earliest childhood He was therefore a good deal startled when having on his way home strayed from the laird s party towards David s he heard the latter say to Margaret as he came up Dinna ye believe my bonny doo at there s ony mak ups or mak shifts wi Him He s aye bringin things to the licht no covenin them up and lattin them rot an the moth tak them He sees us jist as we are and ca s us jist what we are It wad be an ill day for a o s Maggy my doo gin he war to close his een to oor sins an ca us just in his sicht whan we cudna possibly be just in oor ain or in ony ither body s no to say his The Lord preserve s Dawvid Elginbrod Dinna ye believe i the doctrine o Justification by Faith an you a maist made an elder o Janet was the respondent of course Margaret listening in silence Ou ay I believe in t nae doot but troth the minister honest man near han gart me disbelieve in t a thegither wi his gran sermon this mornin about imputit richteousness an a clean robe hidin a foul skin or a crookit back Na na May Him at woosh the feet o his friens wash us a thegither and straucht oor crookit banes till we re clean and weel faured like his ain bonny sel Weel Dawvid but that s sanctificaition ye ken Ca t ony name at you or the minister likes Janet my woman I daursay there s neither o ye far wrang after a only this is jist my opingan aboot it in sma that that man and that man only is justifeed wha pits himsel into the Lord s han s to sanctifee him Noo An that ll no be dune by pittin a robe o richteousness upo him afore he s gotten a clean skin aneath t As gin a father cudna bide to see the puir scabbit skin o his ain wee bit bairnie ay or o his prodigal son either but bude to hap it a up afore he cud lat it come near him Ahva Here Hugh ventured to interpose a remark But you don t think mister Elginbrod that the minister intended to say that justification left a man at liberty to sin or that the robe of Christ s righteousness would hide him from the work of the Spirit Na but there is a notion in t o hidin frae God himsel I ll tell ye what it is mister Sutherlan the minister s a richt in himsel an sae s my Janet here an mony mair an aiblins there s a kin o trowth in a at they say but this is my quarrel wi a thae words an words an airguments an seemilies as they ca them an doctrines an a that they jist haud a puir body at airm s lenth oot ower frae God himsel An they raise a mist an a stour a aboot him at the puir bairn canna see the Father himsel stan in wi his airms streekit oot as wide s the heavens to tak the worn crater and the mair sinner the mair welcome hame to his verra hert Gin a body wad lea a that and jist get fowk persuadit to speyk a word or twa to God him lane the loss in my opingan wad be unco sma and the gain verra great Even Janet dared not reply to the solemnity of this speech for the seer like look was upon David s face and the tears had gathered in his eyes and dimmed their blue A kind of tremulous pathetic smile flickered about his beautifully curved mouth like the glimmer of water in a valley betwixt the lofty aquiline nose and the powerful but finely modelled chin It seemed as if he dared not let the smile break out lest it should be followed instantly by a burst of tears Margaret went close up to her father and took his hand as if she had been still a child while Janet walked reverentially by him on the other side It must not be supposed that Janet felt any uneasiness about her husband s opinions although she never hesitated to utter what she considered her common sense notions in attempted modification of some of the more extreme of them The fact was that if he was wrong Janet did not care to be right and if he was right Janet was sure to be for said she and in spirit if not in the letter it was quite true I never mint at contradickin him My man sall hae his ain get that sall he But she had one especial grudge at his opinions which was that it must have been in consequence of them that he had declined with a queer smile the honourable position of Elder of the Kirk for which Janet considered him notwithstanding his opinions immeasurably more fitted than any other man in the haill country side ye may add Scotlan forby The fact of his having been requested to fill the vacant place of Elder is proof enough that David was not in the habit of giving open expression to his opinions He was looked upon as a douce man long headed enough and somewhat precise in the exaction of the laird s rights but open hearted and open handed with what was his own Every one respected him and felt kindly towards him some were a little afraid of him but few suspected him of being religious beyond the degree which is commonly supposed to be the general inheritance of Scotchmen possibly in virtue of their being brought up upon oatmeal porridge and the Shorter Catechism Hugh walked behind the party for a short way contemplating them in their Sunday clothes David wore a suit of fine black cloth He then turned to rejoin the laird s company missus Glasford was questioning her boys in an intermittent and desultory fashion about the sermon An what was the fourth heid can ye tell me Willie Willie the eldest who had carefully impressed the fourth head upon his memory and had been anxiously waiting for an opportunity of bringing it out replied at once Fourthly The various appellations by which those who have indued the robe of righteousness are designated in Holy Writ Weel done Willie cried the laird That s richt Willie said his mother Then turning to the younger whose attention was attracted by a strange bird in the hedge in front An what called he them Johnnie that put on the robe she asked Whited sepulchres answered Johnnie indebted for his wit to his wool gathering This put an end to the catechising missus Glasford glanced round at Hugh whose defection she had seen with indignation and who waiting for them by the roadside had heard the last question and reply with an expression that seemed to attribute any defect in the answer entirely to the carelessness of the tutor and the withdrawal of his energies from her boys to that saucy quean Meg Elginbrod CHAPTER IX NATURE When the Soul is kindled or enlightened by the Holy Ghost then it beholds what God its Father does as a Son beholds what his Father does at Home in his own House JACOB BEHMEN S Aurora Law s Translation Margaret began to read Wordsworth slowly at first but soon with greater facility Ere long she perceived that she had found a friend for not only did he sympathize with her in her love for nature putting many vague feelings into thoughts and many thoughts into words for her but he introduced her to nature in many altogether new aspects and taught her to regard it in ways which had hitherto been unknown to her Not only was the pine wood now dearer to her than before but its mystery seemed more sacred and at the same time more likely to be one day solved She felt far more assuredly the presence of a spirit in nature Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns And the round ocean and the living air for he taught her to take wider views of nature and to perceive and feel the expressions of more extended aspects of the world around her The purple hill side was almost as dear to her as the fir wood now and the star that crowned its summit at eve sparkled an especial message to her before it went on its way up the blue She extended her rambles in all directions and began to get with the neighbours the character of an idle girl Little they knew how early she rose and how diligently she did her share of the work urged by desire to read the word of God in his own handwriting or rather to pore upon that expression of the face of God which however little a man may think of it yet sinks so deeply into his nature and moulds it towards its own likeness Nature was doing for Margaret what she had done before for Wordsworth s Lucy she was making of her a lady of her own She grew taller and more graceful The lasting quiet of her face began to look as if it were ever upon the point of blossoming into an expression of lovely feeling The principal change was in her mouth which became delicate and tender in its curves the lips seeming to kiss each other for very sweetness But I am anticipating these changes for it took a far longer time to perfect them than has yet been occupied by my story But even her mother was not altogether proof against the appearance of listlessness and idleness which Margaret s behaviour sometimes wore to her eyes nor could she quite understand or excuse her long lonely walks so that now and then she could not help addressing her after this fashion Meg Meg ye do try my patience lass idlin awa yer time that get It s an awfu wastery o time what wi beuks an what wi stravaguin an what wi naething ava Jist pit yer han to this kirn noo like a gude bairn Margaret would obey her mother instantly but with a look of silent expostulation which her mother could not resist sometimes perhaps if the words were sharper than usual with symptoms of gathering tears upon which Janet would say with her honest smile of sweet relenting Hootoots bairn never heed me My bark s aye waur nor my bite ye ken that Then Margaret s face would brighten at once and she would work hard at whatever her mother set her to do till it was finished upon which her mother would be more glad than she and in no haste to impose any further labour out of the usual routine In the course of reading Wordsworth Margaret had frequent occasion to apply to Hugh for help These occasions however generally involved no more than small external difficulties which prevented her from taking in the scope of a passage Hugh was always able to meet these and Margaret supposed that the whole of the light which flashed upon her mind when they were removed was poured upon the page by the wisdom of her tutor never dreaming such was her humility with regard to herself and her reverence towards him that it came from the depths of her own lucent nature ready to perceive what the poet came prepared to show Now and then it is true she applied to him with difficulties in which he was incapable of aiding her but she put down her failure in discovering the meaning after all which it must be confessed he sometimes tried to say to her own stupidity or peculiarity never to his incapacity She had been helped to so much by his superior acquirements and his real gift for communicating what he thoroughly understood he had been so entirely her guide to knowledge that she would at once have felt self condemned of impiety in the old meaning of the word if she had doubted for a moment his ability to understand or explain any difficulty which she could place clearly before him By and by he began to lend her harder that is more purely intellectual books He was himself preparing for the class of Moral Philosophy and Metaphysics and he chose for her some of the simpler of his books on these subjects of course all of the Scotch school beginning with Abercrombie s Intellectual Powers She took this eagerly and evidently read it with great attention One evening in the end of summer Hugh climbed a waste heathery hill that lay behind the house of Turriepuffit and overlooked a great part of the neighbouring country the peaks of some of the greatest of the Scotch mountains being visible from its top Here he intended to wait for the sunset He threw himself on the heather that most delightful and luxurious of all couches supporting the body with a kindly upholding of every part and there he lay in the great slumberous sunlight of the late afternoon with the blue heavens into which he was gazing full up closing down upon him as the light descended the side of the sky He fell fast asleep If ever there be an excuse for falling asleep out of bed surely it is when stretched at full length upon heather in bloom When he awoke the last of the sunset was dying away and between him and the sunset sat Margaret book in hand waiting apparently for his waking He lay still for a few minutes to come to himself before she should see he was awake But she rose at the moment and drawing near very quietly looked down upon him with her sweet sunset face to see whether or not he was beginning to rouse for she feared to let him lie much longer after sundown Finding him awake she drew back again without a word and sat down as before with her book At length he rose and approaching her said Well Margaret what book are you at now doctor Abercrombie sir replied Margaret How do you like it Verra weel for some things It makes a body think but not a thegither as I like to think either It will be observed that Margaret s speech had begun to improve that is to be more like English What is the matter with it Weel ye see sir it taks a body a to bits like and never pits them together again An it seems to me that a body s min or soul or whatever it may be called but it s jist a body s ain sel can no more be ta en to pieces like than you could tak that red licht there oot o the blue or the haill sunset oot o the heavens an earth It may be a verra weel mister Sutherland but oh it s no like this And Margaret looked around her from the hill top and then up into the heavens where the stars were beginning to crack the blue with their thin steely sparkle It seems to me to tak a the poetry oot o us mister Sutherland Well well said Hugh with a smile you must just go to Wordsworth to put it in again or to set you again up after doctor Abercrombie has demolished you Na na sir he sanna demolish me nor I winna trouble mister Wordsworth to put the poetry into me again A the power on earth shanna tak that oot o me gin it be God s will for it s his ain gift mister Sutherland ye ken Of course of course replied Hugh who very likely thought this too serious a way of speaking of poetry and therefore perhaps rather an irreverent way of speaking of God for he saw neither the divine in poetry nor the human in God Could he be said to believe that God made man when he did not believe that God created poetry and yet loved it as he did It was to him only a grand invention of humanity in its loftiest development In this development then he must have considered humanity as farthest from its origin and God as the creator of savages caring nothing for poets or their work They turned as by common consent to go down the hill together Shall I take charge of the offending volume You will not care to finish it I fear said Hugh No sir if you please I never like to leave onything unfinished I ll read ilka word in t I fancy the thing at sets me against it is mostly this that readin it alang wi Euclid I canna help aye thinkin o my ain min as gin it were in some geometrical shape or ither whiles ane an whiles anither and syne I try to draw lines an separate this power frae that power the memory frae the jeedgement an the imagination frae the rizzon an syne I try to pit them a thegither again in their relations to ane anither And this aye takes the shape o some proposition or ither generally i the second beuk It near han dazes me whiles I fancy gin I understood the pairts o the sphere it would be mair to the purpose but I wat I wish I were clear o t a thegither Hugh had had some experiences of a similar kind himself though not at all to the same extent He could therefore understand her You must just try to keep the things altogether apart said he and not think of the two sciences at once But I canna help it she replied I suppose you can sir because ye re a man My father can understan things ten times better nor me an my mother But nae sooner do I begin to read and think about it than up comes ane o thae parallelograms an nothing will driv t oot o my head again but a verse or twa o Coleridge or Wordsworth Hugh immediately began to repeat the first poem of the latter that occurred to him I wandered lonely as a cloud She listened walking along with her eyes fixed on the ground and when he had finished gave a sigh of delight and relief all the comment she uttered She seemed never to find it necessary to say what she felt least of all when the feeling was a pleasant one for then it was enough for itself This was only the second time since their acquaintance that she had spoken of her feelings at all and in this case they were of a purely intellectual origin It is to be observed however that in both cases she had taken pains to explain thoroughly what she meant as far as she was able It was dark before they reached home at least as dark as it ever is at this season of the year in the north They found David looking out with some slight anxiety for his daughter s return for she was seldom out so late as this In nothing could the true relation between them have been more evident than in the entire absence from her manner of any embarrassment when she met her father She went up to him and told him all about finding mister Sutherland asleep on the hill and waiting beside him till he woke that she might walk home with him Her father seemed perfectly content with an explanation which he had not sought and turning to Hugh said smiling Weel no to be troublesome mister Sutherlan ye maun gie the auld man a turn as weel as the young lass We didna expec ye the nicht but I m sair puzzled wi a sma eneuch matter on my sklet in there Will you no come in and gie me a lift With all my heart said Sutherland So there were five lessons in that week When Hugh entered the cottage he had a fine sprig of heather in his hand which he laid on the table He had the weakness of being proud of small discoveries the tinier the better and was always sharpening his senses as well as his intellect to a fine point in order to make them I fear that by these means he shut out some great ones which could not enter during such a concentration of the faculties He would stand listening to the sound of goose feet upon the road and watch how those webs laid hold of the earth like a hand He would struggle to enter into their feelings in folding their wings properly on their backs He would calculate on chemical and arithmetical grounds whether one might not hear the nocturnal growth of plants in the tropics He was quite elated by the discovery as he considered it that Shakspeare named his two officers of the watch Dogberry and Verjuice the poisonous Dogberry and the acid liquor of green fruits affording suitable names for the stupidly innocuous constables in a play the very essence of which is Much Ado About Nothing Another of his discoveries he had during their last lesson unfolded to David who had certainly contemplated it with interest It was that the original forms of the Arabic numerals were these one point two three point four five point six seven point eight nine the number for which each figure stands being indicated by the number of straight lines employed in forming that numeral I fear the comparative anatomy of figures gives no countenance to the discovery which Hugh flattered himself he had made After he had helped David out of his difficulty he took up the heather and stripping off the bells shook them in his hand at Margaret s ear A half smile like the moonlight of laughter dawned on her face and she listened with something of the same expression with which a child listens to the message from the sea inclosed in a twisted shell He did the same at David s ear next Eh man that s a bonny wee soun It s jist like sma sheep bells fairy sheep I reckon Maggy my doo Lat me hearken as weel said Janet Hugh obeyed She laughed It s naething but a reestlin I wad raither hear the sheep baain or the kye routin Eh mister Sutherlan but ye hae a gleg ee an a sharp lug Weel the warld s fu o bonny sichts and souns doon to the verra sma est The Lord lats naething gang I wadna wonner noo but there micht be thousands sic like ower sma a thegither for human ears jist as we ken there are creatures as perfect in beowty as ony we see but far ower sma for our een wintin the glass But for my pairt I aye like to see a heap o things at ance an tak them a in thegither an see them playin into ane anither s han like I was jist thinkin as I came hame the nicht in the sinset hoo it wad hae been naewise sae complete wi a its red an gowd an green gin it hadna been for the cauld blue east ahint it wi the twa three shiverin starnies leukin through t An doubtless the warld to come ill be a the warmer to them at hadna ower muckle happin here But I m jist haverin clean haverin mister Sutherlan concluded David with a smile of apologetic humour I suppose you could easily believe with Plato David that the planets make a grand choral music as they roll about the heavens only that as some sounds are too small so that is too loud for us to hear I cud weel believe that was David s unhesitating answer Margaret looked as if she not only could believe it but would be delighted to know that it was true Neither Janet nor Hugh gave any indication of feeling on the matter CHAPTER X HARVEST So a small seed that in the earth lies hid And dies reviving bursts her cloddy side Adorned with yellow locks of new is born And doth become a mother great with corn Of grains brings hundreds with it which when old Enrich the furrows with a sea of gold SIR WILLIAM DRUMMOND Hymn of the Resurrection Hugh had watched the green corn grow and ear and turn dim then brighten to yellow and ripen at last under the declining autumn sun and the low skirting moon of the harvest which seems too full and heavy with mellow and bountiful light to rise high above the fields which it comes to bless with perfection The long threads on each of which hung an oat grain the harvest here was mostly of oats had got dry and brittle and the grains began to spread out their chaff wings as if ready to fly and rustled with sweet sounds against each other as the wind which used to billow the fields like the waves of the sea now swept gently and tenderly over it helping the sun and moon in the drying and ripening of the joy to be laid up for the dreary winter Most graceful of all hung those delicate oats next bowed the bearded barley and stately and wealthy and strong stood the few fields of wheat of a rich ruddy golden hue Above the yellow harvest rose the purple hills and above the hills the pale blue autumnal sky full of light and heat but fading somewhat from the colour with which it deepened above the vanished days of summer For the harvest here is much later than in England At length the day arrived when the sickle must be put into the barley soon to be followed by the scythe in the oats And now came the joy of labour Everything else was abandoned for the harvest field Books were thrown utterly aside for even when there was no fear of a change of weather to urge to labour prolonged beyond the natural hours there was weariness enough in the work of the day to prevent even David from reading in the hours of bodily rest anything that necessitated mental labour Janet and Margaret betook themselves to the reaping hook and the somewhat pale face of the latter needed but a single day to change it to the real harvest hue the brown livery of Ceres But when the oats were attacked then came the tug of war The laird was in the fields from morning to night and the boys would not stay behind but with their father s permission much to the tutor s contentment devoted what powers they had to the gathering of the fruits of the earth Hugh himself whose strength had grown amazingly during his stay at Turriepuffit and who though he was quite helpless at the sickle thought he could wield the scythe would not be behind Throwing off coat and waistcoat and tying his handkerchief tight round his loins he laid hold on the emblematic weapon of Time and Death determined likewise to earn the name of Reaper He took the last scythe It was desperate work for a while and he was far behind the first bout but David who was the best scyther in the whole country side and of course had the leading scythe seeing the tutor dropping behind put more power to his own arm finished his own bout and brought up Hugh s before the others had done sharpening their scythes for the next Tak care an nae rax yersel ower sair mister Sutherlan Ye ll be up wi the best o them in a day or twa but gin ye tyauve at it aboon yer strenth ye ll be clean forfochten Tak a guid sweep wi the scythe at ye may hae the weicht o t to ca through the strae an tak nae shame at bein hindmost Here Maggy my doo come an gather to mister Sutherlan Ane o the young gentlemen can tak your place at the binin The work of Janet and Margaret had been to form bands for the sheaves by folding together cunningly the heads of two small handfuls of the corn so as to make them long enough together to go round the sheaf then to lay this down for the gatherer to place enough of the mown corn upon it and last to bind the band tightly around by another skilful twist and an insertion of the ends and so form a sheaf From this work David called his daughter desirous of giving Hugh a gatherer who would not be disrespectful to his awkwardness This arrangement however was far from pleasing to some of the young men in the field and brought down upon Hugh who was too hard wrought to hear them at first many sly hits of country wit and human contempt There had been for some time great jealousy of his visits at David s cottage for Margaret though she had very little acquaintance with the young men of the neighbourhood was greatly admired amongst them and not regarded as so far above the station of many of them as to render aspiration useless Their remarks to each other got louder and louder till Hugh at last heard some of them and could not help being annoyed not by their wit or personality but by the tone of contempt in which they were uttered Tak care o yer legs sir It ll be ill cuttin upo stumps Fegs he s taen the wings aff o a pairtrick Gin he gang on that get he ll cut twa bouts at ance Ye ll hae the scythe ower the dyke man Tak tent Losh sir ye ve taen aff my leg at the hip Ye re shavin ower close ye ll draw the bluid sir Hoot man lat alane The gentleman s only mista en his trade an imaigins he s howkin a grave And so on Hugh gave no further sign of hearing their remarks than lay in increased exertion Looking round however he saw that Margaret was vexed evidently not for her own sake He smiled to her to console her for his annoyance and then ambitious to remove the cause of it made a fresh exertion recovered all his distance and was in his own place with the best of them at the end of the bout But the smile that had passed between them did not escape unobserved and he had aroused yet more the wrath of the youths by threatening soon to rival them in the excellencies to which they had an especial claim They had regarded him as an interloper who had no right to captivate one of their rank by arts beyond their reach but it was still less pardonable to dare them to a trial of skill with their own weapons To the fire of this jealousy the admiration of the laird added fuel for he was delighted with the spirit with which Hugh laid himself to the scythe But all the time nothing was further from Hugh s thoughts than the idea of rivalry with them Whatever he might have thought of Margaret in relation to himself he never thought of her though labouring in the same field with them as in the least degree belonging to their class or standing in any possible relation to them except that of a common work In ordinary the labourers would have had sufficient respect for Sutherland s superior position to prevent them from giving such decided and articulate utterance to their feelings But they were incited by the presence and example of a man of doubtful character from the neighbouring village a travelled and clever ne er do weel whose reputation for wit was equalled by his reputation for courage and skill as well as profligacy Roused by the effervescence of his genius they went on from one thing to another till Hugh saw it must be put a stop to somehow else he must abandon the field They dared not have gone so far if David had been present but he had been called away to superintend some operations in another part of the estate and they paid no heed to the expostulations of some of the other older men At the close of the day s work therefore Hugh walked up to this fellow and said I hope you will be satisfied with insulting me all to day and leave it alone to morrow The man replied with an oath and a gesture of rude contempt I dinna care the black afore my nails for ony skelp doup o the lot o ye Hugh s highland blood flew to his brain and before the rascal finished his speech he had measured his length on the stubble He sprang to his feet in a fury threw off the coat which he had just put on and darted at Hugh who had by this time recovered his coolness and was besides notwithstanding his unusual exertions the more agile of the two The other was heavier and more powerful Hugh sprang aside as he would have done from the rush of a bull and again with a quick blow felled his antagonist Beginning rather to enjoy punishing him he now went in for it and before the other would yield he had rendered his next day s labour somewhat doubtful He withdrew with no more injury to himself than a little water would remove Janet and Margaret had left the field before he addressed the man He went borne and to bed more weary than he had ever been in his life Before he went to sleep however he made up his mind to say nothing of his encounter to David but to leave him to hear of it from other sources He could not help feeling a little anxious as to his judgment upon it That the laird would approve he hardly doubted but for his opinion he cared very little Dawvid I wonner at ye said Janet to her husband the moment he came home to lat the young lad warstle himsel deid that get wi a scythe His banes is but saft yet There wasna a dry steek on him or he wan half the lenth o the first bout He s sair disjaskit I se warran Nae fear o him Janet it ll do him guid mister Sutherland s no feckless winlestrae o a creater Did he haud his ain at a wi the lave Haud his ain Gin he be fit for onything the day he maun be pitten neist yersel or he ll cut the legs aff o ony ither man i the corn A glow of pleasure mantled in Margaret s face at her mother s praise of Hugh Janet went on But I was jist clean affronted wi the way at the young chields behaved themselves till him I thocht I heard a toot moot o that kin afore I left but I thocht it better to tak nae notice o t I ll be wi ye a day the morn though an I m thinkin I ll clap a rouch han on their mou s at I hear ony mair o t frae But there was no occasion for interference on David s part Hugh made his appearance not it is true with the earliest in the hairst rig but after breakfast with the laird who was delighted with the way in which he had handled his scythe the day before and felt twice the respect for him in consequence It must be confessed he felt very stiff but the best treatment for stiffness being the homoeopathic one of more work he had soon restored the elasticity of his muscles and lubricated his aching joints His antagonist of the foregoing evening was nowhere to be seen and the rest of the young men were shame faced and respectful enough David having learned from some of the spectators the facts of the combat suddenly as they were walking home together held out his hand to Hugh shook his hard and said mister Sutherlan I m sair obleeged to ye for giein that vratch Jamie Ogg a guid doonsettin He s a coorse crater but the warst maun hae meat an sae I didna like to refeese him when he cam for wark But its a greater kin ness to clout him nor to cleed him They say ye made an awfu munsie o him But it s to be houpit he ll live to thank ye There s some fowk at can respeck no airgument but frae steekit neives an it s fell cruel to haud it frae them gin ye hae t to gie them I hae had eneuch ado to haud my ain han s aff o the ted but it comes a hantle better frae you mister Sutherlan Hugh wielded the scythe the whole of the harvest and Margaret gathered to him By the time it was over leading home and all he measured an inch less about the waist and two inches more about the shoulders and was as brown as a berry and as strong as an ox or owse as David called it when thus describing mister Sutherland s progress in corporal development for he took a fatherly pride in the youth to whom at the same time he looked up with submission as his master in learning CHAPTER XI A CHANGE AND NO CHANGE Affliction when I know it is but this A deep alloy whereby man tougher is To bear the hammer and the deeper still We still arise more image of his will Sickness an humorous cloud twist us and light And death at longest but another night Man is his own star and that soul that can Be honest is the only perfect Man JOHN FLETCHER Upon an Honest Man s Fortune Had Sutherland been in love with Margaret those would have been happy days and that a yet more happy night when under the mystery of a low moonlight and a gathering storm the crop was cast in haste into the carts and hurried home to be built up in safety when a strange low wind crept sighing across the stubble as if it came wandering out of the past and the land of dreams lying far off and withered in the green west and when Margaret and he came and went in the moonlight like creatures in a dream for the vapours of sleep were floating in Hugh s brain although he was awake and working Margaret he said as they stood waiting a moment for the cart that was coming up to be filled with sheaves what does that wind put you in mind of Ossian s Poems replied Margaret without a moment s hesitation Hugh was struck by her answer He had meant something quite different But it harmonized with his feeling about Ossian for the genuineness of whose poetry Highlander as he was he had no better argument to give than the fact that they produced in himself an altogether peculiar mental condition that the spiritual sensations he had in reading them were quite different from those produced by anything else prose or verse in fact that they created moods of their own in his mind He was unwilling to believe apart from national prejudices which have not prevented the opinions on this question from being as strong on the one side as on the other that this individuality of influence could belong to mere affectations of a style which had never sprung from the sources of real feeling Could they he thought possess the power to move us like remembered dreams of our childhood if all that they possessed of reality was a pretended imitation of what never existed and all that they inherited from the past was the halo of its strangeness But Hugh was not in love with Margaret though he could not help feeling the pleasure of her presence Any youth must have been the better for having her near him but there was nothing about her quiet self contained being free from manifestation of any sort to rouse the feelings commonly called love in the mind of an inexperienced youth like Hugh Sutherland I say commonly called because I believe that within the whole sphere of intelligence there are no two loves the same Not that he was less easily influenced than other youths A designing girl might have caught him at once if she had had no other beauty than sparkling eyes but the womanhood of the beautiful Margaret kept so still in its pearly cave that it rarely met the glance of neighbouring eyes How Margaret regarded him I do not know but I think it was with a love almost entirely one with reverence and gratitude Cause for gratitude she certainly had though less than she supposed and very little cause indeed for reverence But how could she fail to revere one to whom even her father looked up Of course David s feeling of respect for Hugh must have sprung chiefly from intellectual grounds and he could hardly help seeing if he thought at all on the subject which is doubtful that Hugh was as far behind Margaret in the higher gifts and graces as he was before her in intellectual acquirement But whether David perceived this or not certainly Margaret did not even think in that direction She was pure of self judgment conscious of no comparing of herself with others least of all with those next her At length the harvest was finished or as the phrase of the district was clyack was gotten a phrase with the derivation or even the exact meaning of which I am unacquainted knowing only that it implies something in close association with the feast of harvest home called the kirn in other parts of Scotland Thereafter the fields lay bare to the frosts of morning and evening and to the wind that grew cooler and cooler with the breath of Winter who lay behind the northern hills and waited for his hour But many lovely days remained of quiet and slow decay of yellow and red leaves of warm noons and lovely sunsets followed by skies green from the west horizon to the zenith and walked by a moon that seemed to draw up to her all the white mists from pond and river and pool to settle again in hoar frost during the colder hours that precede the dawn At length every leafless tree sparkled in the morning sun incrusted with fading gems and the ground was hard under foot and the hedges were filled with frosted spider webs and winter had laid the tips of his fingers on the land soon to cover it deep with the flickering snow flakes shaken from the folds of his outspread mantle But long ere this David and Margaret had returned with renewed diligence and powers strengthened by repose or at least by intermission to their mental labours and Hugh was as constant a visitor at the cottage as before The time however drew nigh when he must return to his studies at Aberdeen and David and Margaret were looking forward with sorrow to the loss of their friend Janet too cudna bide to think o t He ll tak the daylicht wi him I doot my lass she said as she made the porridge for breakfast one morning and looked down anxiously at her daughter seated on the creepie by the ingle neuk Na na mither replied Margaret looking up from her book he ll lea sic gifts ahin him as ll mak daylicht i the dark and then she bent her head and went on with her reading as if she had not spoken The mother looked away with a sigh and a slight sad shake of the head But matters were to turn out quite different from all anticipations Before the day arrived on which Hugh must leave for the university a letter from home informed him that his father was dangerously ill He hastened to him but only to comfort his last hours by all that a son could do and to support his mother by his presence during the first hours of her loneliness But anxious thoughts for the future which so often force themselves on the attention of those who would gladly prolong their brooding over the past compelled them to adopt an alteration of their plans for the present The half pay of Major Sutherland was gone of course and all that remained for missus Sutherland was a small annuity secured by her husband s payments to a certain fund for the use of officers widows From this she could spare but a mere trifle for the completion of Hugh s university education while the salary he had received at Turriepuffit almost the whole of which he had saved was so small as to be quite inadequate for the very moderate outlay necessary He therefore came to the resolution to write to the laird and offer if they were not yet provided with another tutor to resume his relation to the young gentlemen for the winter It was next to impossible to spend money there and he judged that before the following winter he should be quite able to meet the expenses of his residence at Aberdeen during the last session of his course He would have preferred trying to find another situation had it not been that David and Janet and Margaret had made there a home for him Whether missus Glasford was altogether pleased at the proposal I cannot tell but the laird wrote a very gentlemanlike epistle condoling with him and his mother upon their loss and urging the usual common places of consolation The letter ended with a hearty acceptance of Hugh s offer and strange to tell the unsolicited promise of an increase of salary to the amount of five pounds This is another to be added to the many proofs that verisimilitude is not in the least an essential element of verity He left his mother as soon as circumstances would permit and returned to Turriepuffit an abode for the winter very different indeed from that in which he had expected to spend it He reached the place early in the afternoon received from missus Glasford a cold I hope you re well mister Sutherland found his pupils actually reading and had from them a welcome rather boisterously evidenced told them to get their books and sat down with them at once to commence their winter labours He spent two hours thus had a hearty shake of the hand from the laird when he came home and after a substantial tea walked down to David s cottage where a welcome awaited him worth returning for Come yer wa s butt said Janet who met him as he opened the door without any prefatory knock and caught him with both hands I m blithe to see yer bonny face ance mair We re a jist at ane mair wi expeckin o ye David stood in the middle of the floor waiting for him Come awa my bonny lad was all his greeting as he held out a great fatherly hand to the youth and grasping his in the one clapped him on the shoulder with the other the water standing in his blue eyes the while Hugh thought of his own father and could not restrain his tears Margaret gave him a still look full in the face and seeing his emotion did not even approach to offer him any welcome She hastened instead to place a chair for him as she had done when first he entered the cottage and when he had taken it sat down at his feet on her creepie With true delicacy no one took any notice of him for some time David said at last An hoo s yer puir mother mister Sutherlan She s pretty well was all Hugh could answer It s a sair stroke to bide said David but it s a gran thing whan a man s won weel throw t Whan my father deit I min weel I was sae prood to see him lyin there in the cauld grandeur o deith an no man at daured say he ever did or spak the thing at didna become him at I jist gloried i the mids o my greetin He was but a puir auld shepherd mister Sutherlan wi hair as white as the sheep at followed him an I wat as they followed him he followed the great Shepherd an followed an followed till he jist followed Him hame whaur we re a boun an some o us far on the road thanks to Him And with that David rose and got down the Bible and opening it reverently read with a solemn slightly tremulous voice the fourteenth chapter of saint John s Gospel When he had finished they all rose as by one accord and knelt down and David prayed O Thou in whase sicht oor deeth is precious an no licht maitter wha through darkness leads to licht an through deith to the greater life we canna believe that thou wouldst gie us ony guid thing to tak the same again for that would be but bairns play We believe that thou taks that thou may gie again the same thing better nor afore mair o t and better nor we could ha received it itherwise jist as the Lord took himsel frae the sicht o them at lo ed him weel that instead o bein veesible afore their een he micht hide himsel in their verra herts Come thou an abide in us an tak us to bide in thee an syne gin we be a in thee we canna be that far frae ane anither though some sud be in haven an some upo earth Lord help us to do oor wark like thy men an maidens doon the stair remin in oursel s at them at we miss hae only gane up the stair as gin twar to haud things to thy han i thy ain presence chamber whaur we houp to be called or lang an to see thee an thy Son wham we lo e aboon a an in his name we say Amen Hugh rose from his knees with a sense of solemnity and reality that he had never felt before Little was said that evening supper was eaten if not in silence yet with nothing that could be called conversation And almost in silence David walked home with Hugh The spirit of his father seemed to walk beside him He felt as if he had been buried with him and had found that the sepulchre was clothed with green things and roofed with stars was in truth the heavens and the earth in which his soul walked abroad If Hugh looked a little more into his Bible and tried a little more to understand it after his father s death it is not to be wondered at It is but another instance of the fact that whether from education or from the leading of some higher instinct we are ready in every more profound trouble to feel as if a solution or a refuge lay somewhere lay in sounds of wisdom perhaps to be sought and found in the best of books the deepest of all the mysterious treasuries of words But David never sought to influence Hugh to this end He read the Bible in his family but he never urged the reading of it on others Sometimes he seemed rather to avoid the subject of religion altogether and yet it was upon those very occasions that if he once began to speak he would pour out before he ceased some of his most impassioned utterances CHAPTER XII CHARITY Knowledge bloweth up but charity buildeth up LORD BACON S rendering of one Cor viii I Things went on as usual for a few days when Hugh began to encounter a source of suffering of a very material and unromantic kind but which nevertheless had been able before now namely at the commencement of his tutorship to cause him a very sufficient degree of distress It was this that he had no room in which he could pursue his studies in private without having to endure a most undesirable degree of cold In summer this was a matter of little moment for the universe might then be his secret chamber but in a Scotch spring or autumn not to say winter a bedroom without a fire place which strange to say was the condition of his was not a study in which thought could operate to much satisfactory result Indeed pain is a far less hurtful enemy to thinking than cold And to have to fight such suffering and its benumbing influences as well as to follow out a train of reasoning difficult at any time and requiring close attention is too much for any machine whose thinking wheels are driven by nervous gear Sometimes for he must make the attempt he came down to his meals quite blue with cold as his pupils remarked to their mother but their observation never seemed to suggest to her mind the necessity of making some better provision for the poor tutor And Hugh after the way in which she had behaved to him was far too proud to ask her a favour even if he had had hopes of receiving his request He knew too that in the house the laird to interfere in the smallest degree must imperil far more than he dared The prospect therefore of the coming winter in a country where there was scarcely any afternoon and where the snow might lie feet deep for weeks was not at all agreeable He had as I have said begun to suffer already for the mornings and evenings were cold enough now although it was a bright dry October One evening Janet remarked that he had caught cold for he was hostin sair and this led Hugh to state the discomfort he was condemned to experience up at the ha house Weel said David after some silent deliberation that sattles t we maun set aboot it immedantly Of course Hugh was quite at a loss to understand what he meant and begged him to explain Ye see replied David we hae verra little hoose room i this bit cot for excep this kitchen we hae but the ben whaur Janet and me sleeps and sae last year I spak to the laird to lat me hae muckle timmer as I wad need to big a kin o a lean to to the house ahin so at we micht hae a kin o a bit parlour like or rather a roomie at ony o us micht retire till for a bit gin we wanted to be oor lanes He had nae objections honest man But somehoo or ither I never sat han till t but noo the wa s maun be up afore the wat weather sets in Sae I se be at it the morn an maybe ye ll len me a han mister Sutherlan and tak oot yer wages in house room an firin efter it s dune Thank you heartily said Hugh that would be delightful It seems too good to be possible But will not wooden walls be rather a poor protection against such winters as I suppose you have in these parts Hootoot mister Sutherlan ye micht gie me credit for raither mair rumgumption nor that comes till Timmer was the only thing I not needed to spier for the lave lies to ony body s han a few cart fu s o sods frae the hill ahint the hoose an a han fu or twa o stanes for the chimla oot o the quarry there s eneuch there for oor turn ohn blastit mair an we ll saw the wood oorsels an gin we had ance the wa s up we can carry on the inside at oor leisur That s the way at the Maker does wi oorsels he gie s us the wa s an the material an a whole lifetime maybe mair to furnish the house Capital exclaimed Hugh I ll work like a horse and we ll be at it the morn I se be at it afore daylicht an ane or twa o the lads ll len me a han efter wark hours and there s yersel mister Sutherlan worth ane an a half o ordinary workers an we ll hae truff aneuch for the wa s in a

half wark ye ken They went out directly in the moonlight to choose the spot and soon came to the resolution to build it so that a certain back door which added more to the cold in winter than to the convenience in summer should be the entrance to the new chamber The chimney was the chief difficulty but all the materials being in the immediate neighbourhood and David capable of turning his hands to anything no obstruction was feared Indeed he set about that part first as was necessary and had soon built a small chimney chiefly of stones and lime while under his directions the walls were making progress at the same time by the labour of Hugh and two or three of the young men from the farm who were most ready to oblige David with their help although they were still rather unfriendly to the colliginer as they called him But Hugh s frankness soon won them over and they all formed within a day or two a very comfortable party of labourers They worked very hard for if the rain should set in before the roof was on their labour would be almost lost from the soaking of the walls They built them of turf very thick with a slight slope on the outside towards the roof before commencing which they partially cut the windows out of the walls putting wood across to support the top I should have explained that the turf used in building was the upper and coarser part of the peat which was plentiful in the neighbourhood The thatch eaves of the cottage itself projected over the joining of the new roof so as to protect it from the drip and David soon put a thick thatch of new straw upon the little building Second hand windows were procured at the village and the holes in the walls cut to their size They next proceeded to the saw pit on the estate for almost everything necessary for keeping up the offices was done on the farm itself where they sawed thin planks of deal to floor and line the room and make it more cosie These David planed upon one side and when they were nailed against slight posts all round the walls and the joints filled in with putty the room began to look most enticingly habitable The roof had not been thatched two days before the rain set in but now they could work quite comfortably inside and as the space was small and the forenights were long they had it quite finished before the end of November David bought an old table in the village and one or two chairs mended them up made a kind of rustic sofa or settle put a few bookshelves against the wall had a peat fire lighted on the hearth every day and at length one Saturday evening they had supper in the room and the place was consecrated henceforth to friendship and learning From this time every evening as soon as lessons and the meal which immediately followed them were over Hugh betook himself to the cottage on the shelves of which all his books by degrees collected themselves and there spent the whole long evening generally till ten o clock the first part alone reading or writing the last in company with his pupils who diligent as ever now of course made more rapid progress than before inasmuch as the lessons were both longer and more frequent The only drawback to their comfort was that they seemed to have shut Janet out but she soon remedied this by contriving to get through with her house work earlier than she had ever done before and taking her place on the settle behind them knitted away diligently at her stocking which to inexperienced eyes seemed always the same and always in the same state of progress notwithstanding that she provided the hose of the whole family blue and grey ribbed and plain Her occasional withdrawings to observe the progress of the supper were only a cheerful break in the continuity of labour Little would the passer by imagine that beneath that roof which seemed worthy only of the name of a shed there sat in a snug little homely room such a youth as Hugh such a girl as Margaret such a grand peasant king as David and such a true hearted mother to them all as Janet There were no pictures and no music for Margaret kept her songs for solitary places but the sound of verse was often the living wind which set a waving the tops of the trees of knowledge fast growing in the sunlight of Truth The thatch of that shed roof was like the grizzled hair of David beneath which lay the temple not only of holy but of wise and poetic thought It was like the sylvan abode of the gods where the architecture and music are all of their own making in their kind the more beautiful the more simple and rude and if more doubtful in their intent and less precise in their finish yet therein the fuller of life and its grace and the more suggestive of deeper harmonies CHAPTER XIII HERALDRY And like his father of face and of stature And false of love it came him of nature As doth the fox Renard the fox s son Of kinde he coud his old father s wone Without lore as can a drake swim When it is caught and carried to the brim CHAUCER Legend of Phillis Of course the yet more lengthened absences of Hugh from the house were subjects of remark as at the first but Hugh had made up his mind not to trouble himself the least about that For some time missus Glasford took no notice of them to himself but one evening just as tea was finished and Hugh was rising to go her restraint gave way and she uttered one spiteful speech thinking it no doubt so witty that it ought to see the light Ye re a day labourer it seems mister Sutherlan and gang hame at night Exactly so madam rejoined Hugh There is no other relation between you and me than that of work and wages You have done your best to convince me of that by making it impossible for me to feel that this house is in any sense my home With this grand speech he left the room and from that time till the day of his final departure from Turriepuffit there was not a single allusion made to the subject He soon reached the cottage When he entered the new room which was always called mister Sutherland s study the mute welcome afforded him by the signs of expectation in the glow of the waiting fire and the outspread arms of the elbow chair which was now called his as well as the room made ample amends to him for the unfriendliness of missus Glasford Going to the shelves to find the books he wanted he saw that they had been carefully arranged on one shelf and that the others were occupied with books belonging to the house He looked at a few of them They were almost all old books and such as may be found in many Scotch cottages for instance Boston s Fourfold State in which the ways of God and man may be seen through a fourfold fog Erskine s Divine Sonnets which will repay the reader in laughter for the pain it costs his reverence producing much the same effect that a Gothic cathedral might reproduced by the pencil and from the remembrance of a Chinese artist who had seen it once Drelincourt on Death with the famous ghost hoax of De Foe to help the bookseller to the sale of the unsaleable the Scots Worthies opening of itself at the memoir of mister Alexander Peden the Pilgrim s Progress that wonderful inspiration failing never save when the theologian would sometimes snatch the pen from the hand of the poet Theron and Aspasio Village Dialogues and others of a like class To these must be added a rare edition of Blind Harry It was clear to Hugh unable as he was fully to appreciate the wisdom of David that it was not from such books as these that he had gathered it yet such books as these formed all his store He turned from them found his own and sat down to read By and by David came in I m ower sune I doubt mister Sutherlan I m disturbin ye Not at all answered Hugh Besides I am not much in a reading mood this evening missus Glasford has been annoying me again Poor body What s she been sayin noo Thinking to amuse David Hugh recounted the short passage between them recorded above David however listened with a very different expression of countenance from what Hugh had anticipated and when he had finished took up the conversation in a kind of apologetic tone Weel but ye see said he folding his palms together she hasna jist had a thegither fair play She does na come o a guid breed Man it s a fine thing to come o a guid breed They hae a hantle to answer for at come o decent forbears I thought she brought the laird a good property said Hugh not quite understanding David Ow ay she brocht him gowpenfu s o siller but hoo was t gotten An ye ken it s no riches at ill mak a guid breed cep it be o maggots The richer cheese the mair maggots ye ken Ye maunna speyk o this but the mistress s father was weel kent to hae made his siller by fardins and bawbees in creepin crafty ways He was a bit merchan in Aberdeen an aye keepit his thoom weel ahint the peint o the ellwan sae at he made an inch or twa upo ilka yard he sauld Sae he took frae his soul and pat intill his siller bag an had little to gie his dochter but a guid tocher mister Sutherlan it s a fine thing to come o dacent fowk Noo to luik at yersel I ken naething aboot yer family but ye seem at eesicht to come o a guid breed for the bodily part o ye That s a sma matter but frae what I ha e seen an I trust in God I m no mista en ye come o the richt breed for the min as weel I m no flatterin ye mister Sutherlan but jist layin it upo ye at gin ye had an honest father and gran father an especially a guid mither ye hae a heap to answer for an ye ought never to be hard upo them at s sma creepin creatures for they canna help it sae weel as the like o you and me can David was not given to boasting Hugh had never heard anything suggesting it from his lips before He turned full round and looked at him On his face lay a solemn quiet either from a feeling of his own responsibility or a sense of the excuse that must be made for others What he had said about the signs of breed in Hugh s exterior certainly applied to himself as well His carriage was full of dignity and a certain rustic refinement his voice was wonderfully gentle but deep and slowest when most impassioned He seemed to have come of some gigantic antediluvian breed there was something of the Titan slumbering about him He would have been a stern man but for an unusual amount of reverence that seemed to overflood the sternness and change it into strong love No one had ever seen him thoroughly angry his simple displeasure with any of the labourers the quality of whose work was deficient would go further than the laird s oaths Hugh sat looking at David who supported the look with that perfect calmness that comes of unconscious simplicity At length Hugh s eye sank before David s as he said I wish I had known your father then David My father was sic a ane as I tauld ye the ither day mister Sutherlan I m a richt there A puir semple God fearin shepherd at never gae his dog an ill deserved word nor took the skin o ony puir lammie wha s woo he was clippin atween the shears He was weel worthy o the grave at he wan till at last An my mither was jist sic like wi aiblins raither mair heid nor my father They re her beuks maistly upo the skelf there abune yer ain mister Sutherlan I honour them for her sake though I seldom trouble them mysel She gae me a kin o a scunner at them honest woman wi garrin me read at them o Sundays till they near scomfisht a the guid at was in me by nater There s doctrine for ye mister Sutherlan added David with a queer laugh I thought they could hardly be your books said Hugh But I hae ae odd beuk an that brings me upo my pedigree mister Sutherlan for the puirest man has as lang a pedigree as the greatest only he kens less aboot it that s a An I wat for yer lords and ladies it s no a to their credit at s tauld o their hither come an that s a against the breed ye ken A wilfu sin in the father may be a sinfu weakness i the son an that s what I ca no fair play So saying David went to his bedroom whence he returned with a very old looking book which he laid on the table before Hugh He opened it and saw that it was a volume of Jacob Boehmen in the original language He found out afterwards upon further inquiry that it was in fact a copy of the first edition of his first work The Aurora printed in sixteen twelve On the title page was written a name either in German or old English character he was not sure which but he was able to read it Martin Elginbrodde David having given him time to see all this went on That buik has been in oor family far langer nor I ken I needna say I canna read a word o t nor I never heard o ane at could But I canna help tellin ye a curious thing mister Sutherlan in connexion wi the name on that buik there s a gravestane a verra auld ane hoo auld I canna weel mak out though I gaed ends errand to Aberdeen to see t an the name upo that gravestane is Martin Elginbrod but made mention o in a strange fashion an I m no sure a thegither aboot hoo ye ll tak it for it soun s rather fearsome at first hearin o t But ye se hae t as I read it Here lie I Martin Elginbrodde Hae mercy o my soul Lord God As I wad do were I Lord God And ye were Martin Elginbrodde Certainly Hugh could not help a slight shudder at what seemed to him the irreverence of the epitaph if indeed it was not deserving of a worse epithet But he made no remark and after a moment s pause David resumed I was unco ill pleased wi t at the first as ye may suppose mister Sutherlan but after a while I begude began an gaed through twa or three bits o reasonin s aboot it in this way By the natur o t this maun be the man s ain makin this epitaph for no ither body cud ha dune t and he had left it in s will to be pitten upo the deid stane nae doot I the contemplation o deith a man wad no be lik ly to desire the perpetuation o a blasphemy upo a table o stone to stan against him for centuries i the face o God an man therefore it cudna ha borne the luik to him o the presumptuous word o a proud man evenin himsel wi the Almichty Sae what was t then at made him mak it It seems to me though I confess mister Sutherlan I may be led astray by the nateral desire at a man has to think weel o his ain forbears for at he was a forbear o my ain I canna weel doot the name bein by no means a common ane in Scotland ony way I m sayin it seems to me that it s jist a darin way maybe a childlike way o judgin as Job micht ha dune the Lord by himsel an sayin at gin he Martin Elginbrod wad hae mercy surely the Lord was not less mercifu than he was The offspring o the Most High was as it were aware o the same spirit i the father o him as muved in himsel He felt at the mercy in himsel was ane o the best things an he cudna think at there wad be less o t i the father o lichts frae whom cometh ilka guid an perfeck gift An may be he remembered at the Saviour himsel said Be ye perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect and that the perfection o God as He had jist pinted oot afore consisted in causin his bonny sun to shine on the evil an the good an his caller rain to fa upo the just an the unjust It may well be doubted whether David s interpretation of the epitaph was the correct one It will appear to most of my readers to breathe rather of doubt lighted up by hope than of that strong faith which David read in it But whether from family partiality and consequent unwillingness to believe that his ancestor had been a man who having led a wild erring and evil life turned at last towards the mercy of God as his only hope which the words might imply or simply that he saw this meaning to be the best this was the interpretation which David had adopted But interposed Hugh supposing he thought all that why should he therefore have it carved on his tombstone I hae thocht aboot that too answered David For ae thing a body has but feow ways o sayin his say to his brithermen Robbie Burns cud do t in sang efter sang but maybe this epitaph was a that auld Martin was able to mak He michtna hae had the gift o utterance But there may be mair in t nor that Gin the clergy o thae times warna a gey hantle mair enlichtened nor a fowth o the clergy hereabouts he wad hae heard a heap aboot the glory o God as the thing at God himsel was maist anxious aboot uphaudin jist like a prood creater o a king an that he wad mak men an feed them an cleed them an gie them braw wives an toddlin bairnies an syne damn them a for s ain glory Maybe ye wadna get mony o them at wad speyk sae fair oot noo a days for they gang wi the tide jist like the lave but i my auld minny s buiks I hae read jilt as muckle as that an waur too Mony ane at spak like that had nae doot a guid meanin in t but hech man it s an awesome deevilich way o sayin a holy thing Noo what better could puir auld Martin do seein he had no ae word to say i the kirk a his lifelang nor jist say his ae word as pithily as might be i the kirkyard efter he was deid an ower an ower again wi a tongue o stane let them tak it or lat it alane at likit That s a my defence o my auld luckie daddy Heaven rest his brave auld soul But are we not in danger said Hugh of thinking too lightly and familiarly of the Maker when we proceed to judge him so by ourselves mister Sutherlan replied David very solemnly I dinna thenk I can be in muckle danger o lichtlyin him whan I ken in my ain sel as weel as she at was healed o her plague at I wad be a horse i that pleuch or a pig in that stye not merely if it was his will for wha can stan against that but if it was for his glory ay an comfort mysel a the time the change was passin upo me wi the thocht that efter an a his blessed han s made the pigs too But a moment ago David you seemed to me to be making rather little of his glory O his glory as they consider glory ay efter a warldly fashion that s no better nor pride an in him would only be a greater pride But his glory consistin in his trowth an lovin kindness man that s a bonny word an grand self forgettin devotion to his creaters lord man it s unspeakable I care little for his glory either gin by that ye mean the praise o men A heap o the anxiety for the spread o his glory seems to me to be but a desire for the sempathy o ither fowk There s no fear but men ll praise him a in guid time that is whan they can But mister Sutherlan for the glory o God raither than if it were possible one jot or one tittle should fail of his entire perfection of holy beauty I call God to witness I would gladly go to hell itsel for no evil worth the full name can befall the earth or ony creater in t as long as God is what he is For the glory o God mister Sutherlan I wad die the deith For the will o God I m ready for onything he likes I canna surely be in muckle danger o lichtlyin him I glory in my God The almost passionate earnestness with which David spoke would alone have made it impossible for Hugh to reply at once After a few moments however he ventured to ask the question Would you do nothing that other people should know God then David Onything at he likes But I would tak tent o interferin He s at it himsel frae mornin to nicht frae year s en to year s en But you seem to me to make out that God is nothing but love Ay naething but love What for no Because we are told he is just Would he be lang just if he didna lo e us But does he not punish sin Would it be ony kin ness no to punish sin No to us a means to pit awa the ae ill thing frae us Whatever may be meant by the place o meesery depen upo t mister Sutherlan it s only anither form o love love shinin through the fogs o ill an sae gart leuk something verra different thereby Man raither nor see my Maggy an ye ll no doot at I lo e her raither nor see my Maggy do an ill thing I d see her lyin deid at my feet But supposin the ill thing ance dune it s no at my feet I wad lay her but upo my heart wi my auld arms aboot her to hand the further ill aff o her An shall mortal man be more just than God Shall a man be more pure than his Maker O my God my God The entrance of Margaret would have prevented the prosecution of this conversation even if it had not already drawn to a natural close Not that David would not have talked thus before his daughter but simply that minds like instruments need to be brought up to the same pitch before they can atone together and that one feels this instinctively on the entrance of another who has not gone through the same immediate process of gradual elevation of tone Their books and slates were got out and they sat down to their work but Hugh could not help observing that David in the midst of his lines and angles and algebraic computations would every now and then glance up at Margaret with a look of tenderness in his face yet deeper and more delicate in its expression than ordinary Margaret was however quite unconscious of it pursuing her work with her ordinary even diligence But Janet observed it What ails the bairn Dawvid at ye leuk at her that get said she Naething ails her woman Do ye never leuk at a body but when something ails them Ow ay but no that get Weel maybe I was thinkin hoo I wad leuk at her gin onything did ail her Hoot hoot dinna further the ill hither by makin a bien doonsittin an a bed for t All David s answer to this was one of his own smiles At supper for it happened to be Saturday Hugh said I ve been busy between whiles inventing or perhaps discovering an etymological pedigree for you David Weel lat s hear t said David First do you know that that volume with your ancestor s name on it was written by an old German shoemaker perhaps only a cobbler for anything I know I know nothing aboot it more or less answered David He was a wonderful man Some people think he was almost inspired Maybe maybe was all David s doubtful response At all events though I know nothing about it myself he must have written wonderfully for a cobbler For my pairt replied David if I see no wonder in the man I can see but little in the cobbler What for shouldna a cobbler write wonnerfully as weel as anither It s a trade at furthers meditation My grandfather was a cobbler as ye ca t an they say he was no fule in his ain way either Then it does go in the family cried Hugh triumphantly I was in doubt at first whether your name referred to the breadth of your shoulders David as transmitted from some ancient sire whose back was an Ellwand broad for the g might come from a w or v for anything I know to the contrary But it would have been braid in that case And now I am quite convinced that that Martin or his father was a German a friend of old Jacob Boehmen who gave him the book himself and was besides of the same craft and he coming to this country with a name hard to be pronounced they found a resemblance in the sound of it to his occupation and so gradually corrupted his name to them uncouth into Elsynbrod Elshinbrod thence Elginbrod with a soft g and lastly Elginbrod as you pronounce it now with a hard g This name turned from Scotch into English would then be simply Martin Awlbore The cobbler is in the family David descended from Jacob Boehmen himself by the mother s side This heraldic blazon amused them all very much and David expressed his entire concurrence with it declaring it to be incontrovertible Margaret laughed heartily Besides its own beauty two things made Margaret s laugh of some consequence one was that it was very rare and the other that it revealed her two regular rows of dainty white teeth suiting well to the whole build of the maiden She was graceful and rather tall with a head which but for its smallness might have seemed too heavy for the neck that supported it so ready it always was to droop like a snowdrop The only parts about her which Hugh disliked were her hands and feet The former certainly had been reddened and roughened by household work but they were well formed notwithstanding The latter he had never seen notwithstanding the bare foot habits of Scotch maidens for he saw Margaret rarely except in the evenings and then she was dressed to receive him Certainly however they were very far from following the shape of the clumsy country shoes by which he misjudged their proportions Had he seen them as he might have seen them some part of any day during the summer their form at least would have satisfied him CHAPTER XIV WINTER Out of whose womb came the ice and the hoary frost of heaven who hath gendered it The waters are hid as with a stone and the face of the deep is frozen He giveth snow like wool he scattereth the hoar frost like ashes JOB xxxviii twenty nine thirty PSALM cxlvii sixteen Winter was fairly come at last A black frost had bound the earth for many days and at length a peculiar sensation almost a smell of snow in the air indicated an approaching storm The snow fell at first in a few large unwilling flakes that fluttered slowly and heavily to the earth where they lay like the foundation of the superstructure that was about to follow Faster and faster they fell wonderful multitudes of delicate crystals adhering in shapes of beauty which outvied all that jeweller could invent or execute of ethereal starry forms structures of evanescent yet prodigal loveliness till the whole air was obscured by them and night came on hastened by an hour from the gathering of their white darkness In the morning all the landscape was transfigured The snow had ceased to fall but the whole earth houses fields and fences ponds and streams were changed to whiteness But most wonderful looked the trees every bough and every twig thickened and bent earthward with its own individual load of the fairy ghost birds Each retained the semblance of its own form wonderfully magically altered by its thick garment of radiant whiteness shining gloriously in the sunlight It was the shroud of dead nature but a shroud that seemed to prefigure a lovely resurrection for the very death robe was unspeakably witchingly beautiful Again at night the snow fell and again and again with intervening days of bright sunshine Every morning the first fresh footprints were a new wonder to the living creatures the young hearted amongst them at least who lived and moved in this death world this sepulchral planet buried in the shining air before the eyes of its sister stars in the blue deathless heavens Paths had to be cleared in every direction towards the out houses and again cleared every morning till at last the walls of solid rain stood higher than the head of little Johnnie as he was still called though he was twelve years old It was a great delight to him to wander through the snow avenues in every direction and great fun it was both to him and his brother when they were tired of snowballing each other and every living thing about the place except their parents and tutor to hollow out mysterious caves and vaulted passages Sometimes they would carry these passages on from one path to within an inch or two of another and there lie in wait till some passer by unweeting of harm was just opposite their lurking cave when they would dash through the solid wall of snow with a hideous yell almost endangering the wits of the maids and causing a recoil and startled ejaculation even of the strong man on whom they chanced to try their powers of alarm Hugh himself was once glad to cover the confusion of his own fright with the hearty fit of laughter into which the perturbation of the boys upon discovering whom they had startled threw him It was rare fun to them but not to the women about the house who moved from place to place in a state of chronic alarm scared by the fear of being scared till one of them going into hysterics real or pretended it was found necessary to put a stop to the practice not however before Margaret had had her share of the jest Hugh happened to be looking out of his window at the moment watching her indeed as she passed towards the kitchen with some message from her mother when an indescribable monster a chaotic mass of legs and snow burst as if out of the earth upon her She turned pale as the snow around her and Hugh had never observed before how dark her eyes were as she sprang back with the grace of a startled deer She uttered no cry however perceiving in a moment who it was gave a troubled little smile and passed on her way as if nothing had happened Hugh was not sorry when maternal orders were issued against the practical joke The boys did not respect their mother very much but they dared not disobey her when she spoke in a certain tone There was no pathway cut to David s cottage and no track trodden except what David coming to the house sometimes and Hugh going every afternoon to the cottage made between them Hugh often went to the knees in snow but was well dried and warmed by Janet s care when he arrived She had always a pair of stockings and slippers ready for him at the fire to be put on the moment of his arrival and exchanged again for his own dry and warm before he footed once more the ghostly waste When neither moon was up nor stars were out there was a strange eerie glimmer from the snow that lighted the way home and he thought there must be more light from it than could be accounted for merely by the reflection of every particle of light that might fall upon it from other sources Margaret was not kept to the house by the snow even when it was falling She went out as usual not of course wandering far for walking was difficult now But she was in little danger of losing her way for she knew the country as well as any one and although its face was greatly altered by the filling up of its features and the uniformity of the colour yet those features were discernible to her experienced eye through the sheet that covered them It was only necessary to walk on the tops of dykes and other elevated ridges to keep clear of the deep snow There were many paths between the cottages and the farms in the neighbourhood in which she could walk with comparative ease and comfort But she preferred wandering away through the fields and toward the hills Sometimes she would come home like a creature of the snow born of it and living in it so covered was she from head to foot with its flakes David used to smile at her with peculiar complacency on such occasions It was evident that it pleased him she should be the playmate of Nature Janet was not altogether indulgent to these freaks as she considered them of Marget she had quite given up calling her Meg sin she took to the beuk so eident But whatever her mother might think of it Margaret was in this way laying up a store not only of bodily and mental health but of resources for thought and feeling of secret understandings and communions with Nature and everything simple and strong and pure through Nature than which she could have accumulated nothing more precious This kind of weather continued for some time till the people declared they had never known a storm last so long ohn ever devallt that is without intermission But the frost grew harder and then the snow instead of falling in large adhesive flakes fell in small dry flakes of which the boys could make no snaw ba s All the time however there was no wind and this not being a sheep country there was little uneasiness or suffering occasioned by the severity of the weather beyond what must befall the poorer classes in every northern country during the winter One day David heard that a poor old man of his acquaintance was dying and immediately set out to visit him at a distance of two or three miles He returned in the evening only in time for his studies for there was of course little or nothing to be done at present in the way of labour As he sat down to the table he said I hae seen a wonnerfu sicht sin I saw you mister Sutherlan I gaed to see an auld Christian whase body an brain are nigh worn oot He was never onything remarkable for intellec and jist took what the minister tellt him for true an keepit the guid o t for his hert was aye richt an his faith a hantle stronger than maybe it had ony richt to be accordin to his ain opingans but hech there s something far better nor his opingans i the hert o ilka God fearin body Whan I gaed butt the hoose he was sittin in s auld arm chair by the side o the fire an his face luikit dazed like There was no licht in t but what cam noo an than frae a low i the fire The snaw was driftin a wee aboot the bit winnock an his auld een was fixed upo t an a at he said takin no notice o me was jist The birdies is flutterin the birdies is flutterin I spak till him an tried to roose him wi ae thing after anither bit I micht as weel hae spoken to the door cheek for a the notice that he took Never a word he spak but aye The birdies is flutterin At last it cam to my min at the body was aye fu o ane o the psalms in particler an sae I jist said till him at last John hae ye forgotten the twenty third psalm Forgotten the twenty third psalm quo he an his face lighted up in a moment frae the inside The Lord s my shepherd an I hae followed Him through a the smorin drift o the warl an he ll bring me to the green pastures an the still waters o His summer kingdom at the lang last I shall not want An I hae wanted for naething naething He had been a shepherd himsel in s young days And so on he gaed wi a kin o a personal commentary on the haill psalm frae beginnin to en and syne he jist fell back into the auld croonin sang The birdies is flutterin the birdies is flutterin The licht deed oot o his face an a that I could say could na bring back the licht to his face nor the sense to his tongue He ll sune be in a better warl Sae I was jist forced to leave him But I promised his dochter puir body that I would ca again an see him the morn s afternoon It s unco dowie wark for her for they hae scarce a neebor within reach o them in case o a change an there had hardly been a creatur inside o their door for a week The following afternoon David set out according to his promise Before his return the wind which had been threatening to wake all day had risen rapidly and now blew a snowstorm of its own When Hugh opened the door to take his usual walk to the cottage just as darkness was beginning to fall the sight he saw made his young strong heart dance with delight The snow that fell made but a small part of the wild confused turmoil and uproar of the ten fold storm For the wind raving over the surface of the snow which as I have already explained lay nearly as loose as dry sand swept it in thick fierce clouds along with it tearing it up and casting it down again no one could tell where for the whole air was filled with drift as they call the snow when thus driven A few hours of this would alter the face of the whole country leaving some parts bare and others buried beneath heaps on heaps of snow called here snaw wreaths For the word snow wreaths does not mean the lovely garlands hung upon every tree and bush in its feathery fall but awful mounds of drifted snow that may be the smooth soft white sepulchres of dead men smothered in the lapping folds of the almost solid wind Path or way was none before him He could see nothing but the surface of a sea of froth and foam as it appeared to him with the spray torn from it whirled in all shapes and contortions and driven in every direction but chiefly in the main direction of the wind in long sloping spires of misty whiteness swift as arrows and as keen upon the face of him who dared to oppose them Hugh plunged into it with a wild sense of life and joy In the course of his short walk however if walk it could be called which was one chain of plungings and emergings struggles with the snow and wrestles with the wind he felt that it needed not a stout heart only but sound lungs and strong limbs as well to battle with the storm even for such a distance When he reached the cottage he found Janet in considerable anxiety not only about David who had not yet returned but about Margaret as well whom she had not seen for some time and who must be out somewhere in the storm the wull hizzie Hugh suggested that she might have gone to meet her father The Lord forbid ejaculated Janet The road lies ower the tap o the Halshach as eerie and bare a place as ever was hill moss wi never a scoug or bield in t frae the tae side to the tither The win there jist gangs clean wud a thegither An there s mony a well ee forbye that gin ye fell intill t ye wud never come at the boddom o t The Lord preserve s I wis Dawvid was hame How could you let him go

wull hizzie Gin she be meetin her father an chance to miss him the Lord kens what may come o her Hugh tried to comfort her but all that could be done was to wait David s return The storm seemed to increase rather than abate its force The footprints Hugh had made had all but vanished already at the very door of the house which stood quite in the shelter of the fir wood As they looked out a dark figure appeared within a yard or two of the house The Lord grant it be my bairn prayed poor Janet But it was David and alone Janet gave a shriek Dawvid whaur s Maggie I haena seen the bairn replied David in repressed perturbation She s no theroot is she the nicht She s no at hame Dawvid that s a at I ken Whaur gaed she The Lord kens She s smoored i the snaw by this time She s i the Lord s han s Janet be she aneath a snaw vraith Dinna forget that wuman Hoo lang is t sin ye missed her An hour an mair I dinna ken hoo lang I m clean doitit wi dreid I ll awa an leuk for her Just haud the hert in

going on my own account come what may Weel weel I downa bide to differ I m gaein up the burn side baud ye ower to the farm and spier gin onybody s seen her an the lads ll be out to leuk for her in a jiffey My puir lassie The sigh that must have accompanied the last words was lost in the wind as they vanished in the darkness Janet fell on her knees in the kitchen with the door wide open and the wind drifting in the powdery snow and scattering it with the ashes from the hearth over the floor A picture of more thorough desolation can hardly be imagined She soon came to herself however and reflecting that if the lost child was found there must be a warm bed to receive her else she might be a second time lost she rose and shut the door and mended the fire It was as if the dumb attitude of her prayer was answered for though she had never spoken or even thought a word strength was restored to her distracted brain When she had made every preparation she could think of she went to the door again opened it and looked out It was a region of howling darkness tossed about by pale snow drifts out of which it seemed scarce more hopeful that welcome faces would emerge than that they should return to our eyes from the vast unknown in which they vanish at last She closed the door once more and knowing nothing else to be done sat down on a chair with her hands on her knees and her eyes fixed on the door The clock went on with its slow swing tic tac tic tac an utterly inhuman time measurer but she heard the sound of every second through the midst of the uproar in the fir trees which bent their tall heads hissing to the blast and swinging about in the agony of their strife The minutes went by till an hour was gone and there was neither sound nor hearing but of the storm and the clock Still she sat and stared her eyes fixed on the door latch Suddenly without warning it was lifted and the door opened Her heart bounded and fluttered like a startled bird but alas the first words she heard were Is she no come yet It was her husband followed by several of the farm servants He had made a circuit to the farm and finding that Hugh had never been there hoped though with trembling that Margaret had already returned home The question fell upon Janet s heart like the sound of the earth on the coffin lid and her silent stare was the only answer David received But at that very moment like a dead man burst from the tomb entered from behind the party at the open door silent and white with rigid features and fixed eyes Hugh He stumbled in leaning forward with long strides and dragging something behind him He pushed and staggered through them as if he saw nothing before him and as they parted horror stricken they saw that it was Margaret or her dead body that he dragged after him He dropped her at her mother s feet and fell himself on the floor before they were able to give him any support David who was quite calm got the whisky bottle out and tried to administer some to Margaret first but her teeth were firmly set and to all appearance she was dead One of the young men succeeded better with Hugh whom at David s direction they took into the study while he and Janet got Margaret undressed and put to bed with hot bottles all about her for in warmth lay the only hope of restoring her After she had lain thus for a while she gave a sigh and when they had succeeded in getting her to swallow some warm milk she began to breathe and soon seemed to be only fast asleep After half an hour s rest and warming Hugh was able to move and speak David would not allow him to say much however but got him to bed sending word to the house that he could not go home that night He and Janet sat by the fireside all night listening to the storm that still raved without and thanking God for both of the lives Every few minutes a tip toe excursion was made to the bedside and now and then to the other room Both the patients slept quietly Towards morning Margaret opened her eyes and faintly called her mother but soon fell asleep once more and did not awake again till nearly noon When sufficiently restored to be able to speak the account she gave was that she had set out to meet her father but the storm increasing she had thought it more prudent to turn It grew in violence however so rapidly and beat so directly in her face that she was soon exhausted with struggling and benumbed with the cold The last thing she remembered was dropping as she thought into a hole and feeling as if she were going to sleep in bed yet knowing it was death and thinking how much sweeter it was than sleep Hugh s account was very strange and defective but he was never able to add anything to it He said that when he rushed out into the dark the storm seized him like a fury beating him about the head and face with icy wings till he was almost stunned He took the road to the farm which lay through the fir wood but he soon became aware that he had lost his way and might tramp about in the fir wood till daylight if he lived as long Then thinking of Margaret he lost his presence of mind and rushed wildly along He thought he must have knocked his head against the trunk of a tree but he could not tell for he remembered nothing more but that he found himself dragging Margaret with his arms round her through the snow and nearing the light in the cottage window Where or how he had found her or what the light was that he was approaching he had not the least idea He had only a vague notion that he was rescuing Margaret from something dreadful Margaret for her part had no recollection of reaching the fir wood and as long before morning all traces were obliterated the facts remained a mystery Janet thought that David had some wonderful persuasion about it but he was never heard even to speculate on the subject Certain it was that Hugh had saved Margaret s life He seemed quite well next day for he was of a very powerful and enduring frame for his years She recovered more slowly and perhaps never altogether overcame the effects of Death s embrace that night From the moment when Margaret was brought home the storm gradually died away and by the morning all was still but many starry and moonlit nights glimmered and passed before that snow was melted away from the earth and many a night Janet awoke from her sleep with a cry thinking she heard her daughter moaning deep in the smooth ocean of snow and could not find where she lay The occurrences of this dreadful night could not lessen the interest his cottage friends felt in Hugh and a long winter passed with daily and lengthening communion both in study and in general conversation I fear some of my younger readers will think my story slow and say What are they not going to fall in love with each other yet We have been expecting it ever so long I have two answers to make to this The first is I do not pretend to know so much about love as you excuse me think you do and must confess I do not know whether they were in love with each other or not The second is That I dare not pretend to understand thoroughly such a sacred mystery as the heart of Margaret and I should feel it rather worse than presumptuous to talk as if I did Even Hugh s is known to me only by gleams of light thrown now and then and here and there upon it Perhaps the two answers are only the same answer in different shapes missus Glasford however would easily answer the question if an answer is all that is wanted for she notwithstanding the facts of the story which she could not fail to have heard correctly from the best authority and notwithstanding the nature of the night which might have seemed sufficient to overthrow her conclusions uniformly remarked as often as their escape was alluded to in her hearing Lat them tak it They had no business to be oot aboot thegither CHAPTER XV TRANSITION Tell me bright boy tell me my golden lad Whither away so frolic Why so glad What all thy wealth in council all thy state Are husks so dear troth tis a mighty rate RICHARD CRASHAW The long Scotch winter passed by without any interruption to the growing friendship But the spring brought a change and Hugh was separated from his friends sooner than he had anticipated by more than six months For his mother wrote to him in great distress in consequence of a claim made upon her for some debt which his father had contracted very probably for Hugh s own sake Hugh could not bear that any such should remain undischarged or that his father s name should not rest in peace as well as his body and soul He requested therefore from the laird the amount due to him and despatched almost the whole of it for the liquidation of this debt so that he was now as unprovided as before for the expenses of the coming winter at Aberdeen But about the same time a fellow student wrote to him with news of a situation for the summer worth three times as much as his present one and to be procured through his friend s interest Hugh having engaged himself to the laird only for the winter although he had intended to stay till the commencement of the following session felt that although he would much rather remain where he was he must not hesitate a moment to accept his friend s offer and therefore wrote at once I will not attempt to describe the parting It was very quiet but very solemn and sad Janet showed far more distress than Margaret for she wept outright The tears stood in David s eyes as he grasped the youth s hand in silence Margaret was very pale that was all As soon as Hugh disappeared with her father who was going to walk with him to the village through which the coach passed she hurried away and went to the fir wood for comfort Hugh found his new situation in Perthshire very different from the last The heads of the family being themselves a lady and a gentleman he found himself a gentleman too He had more to do but his work left him plenty of leisure notwithstanding A good portion of his spare time he devoted to verse making to which he felt a growing impulse and whatever may have been the merit of his compositions they did him intellectual good at least if it were only through the process of their construction He wrote to David after his arrival telling him all about his new situation and received in return a letter from Margaret written at her father s dictation The mechanical part of letter writing was rather laborious to David but Margaret wrote well in consequence of the number of papers of one sort and another which she had written for Hugh Three or four letters more passed between them at lengthening intervals Then they ceased on Hugh s side first until when on the point of leaving for Aberdeen feeling somewhat conscience stricken at not having written for so long he scribbled a note to inform them of his approaching departure promising to let them know his address as soon as he found himself settled Will it be believed that the session went by without the redemption of this pledge Surely he could not have felt to any approximate degree the amount of obligation he was under to his humble friends Perhaps indeed he may have thought that the obligation was principally on their side as it would have been if intellectual assistance could outweigh heart kindness and spiritual impulse and enlightenment for unconsciously in a great measure to himself he had learned from David to regard in a new and more real aspect many of those truths which he had hitherto received as true and which yet had till then produced in him no other than a feeling of the common place and uninteresting at the best Besides this and many cognate advantages a thousand seeds of truth must have surely remained in his mind dropped there from the same tongue of wisdom and only waiting the friendly aid of a hard winter breaking up the cold selfish clods of clay to share in the loveliness of a new spring and be perfected in the beauty of a new summer However this may have been it is certain that he forgot his old friends far more than he himself could have thought it possible he should for to make the best of it youth is easily attracted and filled with the present show and easily forgets that which from distance in time or space has no show to show Spending his evenings in the midst of merry faces and ready tongues fluent with the tones of jollity if not always of wit which glided sometimes into no too earnest discussion of the difficult subjects occupying their student hours surrounded by the vapours of whisky toddy and the smoke of cutty pipes till far into the short hours then hurrying home and lapsing into unrefreshing slumbers over intended study or sitting up all night to prepare the tasks which had been neglected for a ball or an evening with Wilson the great interpreter of Scottish song it is hardly to be wondered at that he should lose the finer consciousness of higher powers and deeper feelings not from any behaviour in itself wrong but from the hurry noise and tumult in the streets of life that penetrating too deep into the house of life dazed and stupefied the silent and lonely watcher in the chamber of conscience far apart He had no time to think or feel The session drew to a close He eschewed all idleness shut himself up after class hours with his books ate little studied hard slept irregularly working always best between midnight and two in the morning carried the first honours in most of his classes and at length breathed freely but with a dizzy brain and a face that revealed in pale cheeks and red weary eyes the results of an excess of mental labour an excess which is as injurious as any other kind of intemperance the moral degradation alone kept out of view Proud of his success he sat down and wrote a short note with a simple statement of it to David hoping in his secret mind that he would attribute his previous silence to an absorption in study which had not existed before the end of the session was quite at hand Now that he had more time for reflection he could not bear the idea that that noble rustic face should look disapprovingly or still worse coldly upon him and he could not help feeling as if the old ploughman had taken the place of his father as the only man of whom he must stand in awe and who had a right to reprove him He did reprove him now though unintentionally For David was delighted at having such good news from him and the uneasiness which he had felt but never quite expressed was almost swept away in the conclusion that it was unreasonable to expect the young man to give his time to them both absent and present especially when he had been occupied to such good purpose as this letter signified So he was nearly at peace about him though not quite Hugh received from him the following letter in reply to his dictated as usual to his secretary Margaret MY DEAR SIR Ye ll be a great man some day gin ye haud at it But things maunna be gotten at the outlay o mair than they re worth Ye ll ken what I mean An there s better things nor bein a great man efter a Forgie the liberty I tak in remin in ye o sic like I m only remin

Sutherland I wrote all the above at my father s dictation and just as he said it for I thought you would like his Scotch better than my English My mother and I myself are rejoiced at the good news My mother fairly grat outright I gaed out to the tree where I met you first I wonder sair sometimes if you was the angel I was to meet in the fir wood I am Your obedient servant MARGARET ELGINBROD This letter certainly touched Hugh But he could not help feeling rather offended that David should write to him in such a warning tone He had never addressed him in this fashion when he saw him every day Indeed David could not very easily have spoken to him thus But writing is a different thing and men who are not much accustomed to use a pen often assume a more solemn tone in doing so as if it were a ceremony that required state As for David having been a little uneasy about Hugh and not much afraid of offending him for he did not know his weaknesses very thoroughly and did not take into account the effect of the very falling away which he dreaded in increasing in him pride and that impatience of the gentlest reproof natural to every man he felt considerably relieved after he had discharged his duty in this memento vivere But one of the results and a very unexpected one was that a yet longer period elapsed before Hugh wrote again to David He meant to do so and meant to do so but as often as the thought occurred to him was checked both by consciousness and by pride So much contributes not the evil alone that is in us but the good also sometimes to hold us back from doing the thing we ought to do It now remained for Hugh to look about for some occupation The state of his funds rendered immediate employment absolutely necessary and as there was only one way in which he could earn money without yet further preparation he must betake himself to that way as he had done before in the hope that it would lead to something better At all events it would give him time to look about him and make up his mind for the future Many a one to whom the occupation of a tutor is far more irksome than it was to Hugh is compelled to turn his acquirements to this immediate account and once going in this groove can never get out of it again But Hugh was hopeful enough to think that his reputation at the university would stand him in some stead and however much he would have disliked the thought of being a tutor all his days occupying a kind of neutral territory between the position of a gentleman and that of a menial he had enough of strong Saxon good sense to prevent him despite his Highland pride from seeing any great hardship in labouring still for a little while as he had laboured hitherto But he hoped to find a situation more desirable than either of those he had occupied before and with this expectation looked towards the South as most Scotchmen do indulging the national impulse to spoil the Egyptians Nor did he look long sending his tentacles afloat in every direction before he heard through means of a college friend of just such a situation as he wanted in the family of a gentleman of fortune in the county of Surrey not much more than twenty miles from London This he was fortunate enough to obtain without difficulty Margaret was likewise on the eve of a change She stood like a young fledged bird on the edge of the nest ready to take its first long flight It was necessary that she should do something for herself not so much from the compulsion of immediate circumstances as in prospect of the future Her father was not an old man but at best he could leave only a trifle at his death and if Janet outlived him she would probably require all that and what labour she would then be capable of as well to support herself Margaret was anxious too though not to be independent yet not to be burdensome Both David and Janet saw that by her peculiar tastes and habits she had separated herself so far from the circle around her that she could never hope to be quite comfortable in that neighbourhood It was not that by any means she despised or refused the labours common to the young women of the country but all things considered they thought that something more suitable for her might be procured The laird s lady continued to behave to her in the most supercilious fashion The very day of Hugh s departure she had chanced to meet Margaret walking alone with a book this time unopened in her hand missus Glasford stopped Margaret stopped too expecting to be addressed The lady looked at her all over from head to foot as if critically examining the appearance of an animal she thought of purchasing then without a word but with a contemptuous toss of the head passed on leaving poor Margaret both angry and ashamed But David was much respected by the gentry of the neighbourhood with whom his position as the laird s steward brought him not unfrequently into contact and to several of them he mentioned his desire of finding some situation for Margaret Janet could not bear the idea of her lady bairn leaving them to encounter the world alone but David though he could not help sometimes feeling a similar pang was able to take to himself hearty comfort from the thought that if there was any safety for her in her father s house there could not be less in her heavenly Father s in any nook of which she was as full in His eye and as near His heart as in their own cottage He felt that anxiety in this case as in every other would just be a lack of confidence in God to suppose which justifiable would be equivalent to saying that He had not fixed the foundations of the earth that it should not be moved that He was not the Lord of Life nor the Father of His children in short that a sparrow could fall to the ground without Him and that the hairs of our head are not numbered Janet admitted all this but sighed nevertheless So did David too at times for he knew that the sparrow must fall that many a divine truth is hard to learn all blessed as it is when learned and that sorrow and suffering must come to Margaret ere she could be fashioned into the perfection of a child of the kingdom Still she was as safe abroad as at home An elderly lady of fortune was on a visit to one of the families in the neighbourhood She was in want of a lady s maid and it occurred to the housekeeper that Margaret might suit her This was not quite what her parents would have chosen but they allowed her to go and see the lady Margaret was delighted with the benevolent looking gentlewoman and she on her part was quite charmed with Margaret It was true she knew nothing of the duties of the office but the present maid who was leaving on the best of terms would soon initiate her into its mysteries And David and Janet were so much pleased with Margaret s account of the interview that David himself went to see the lady The sight of him only increased her desire to have Margaret whom she said she would treat like a daughter if only she were half as good as she looked Before David left her the matter was arranged and within a month Margaret was borne in her mistress s carriage away from father and mother and cottage home END OF THE FIRST BOOK BOOK II ARNSTEAD The earth hath bubbles as the water has MACBETH I three CHAPTER I A NEW HOME A wise man s home is whereso er he s wise JOHN MARSTON Antonio s Revenge Hugh left the North dead in the arms of grey winter and found his new abode already alive in the breath of the west wind As he walked up the avenue to the house he felt that the buds were breaking all about though the night being dark and cloudy the green shadows of the coming spring were invisible He was received at the hall door and shown to his room by an old apparently confidential and certainly important butler whose importance however was inoffensive as founded to all appearance on a sense of family and not of personal dignity Refreshment was then brought him with the message that as it was late mister Arnold would defer the pleasure of meeting him till the morning at breakfast Left to himself Hugh began to look around him Everything suggested a contrast between his present position and that which he had first occupied about the same time of the year at Turriepuffit He was in an old handsome room of dark wainscot furnished like a library with book cases about the walls One of them with glass doors had an ancient escritoire underneath which was open and evidently left empty for his use A fire was burning cheerfully in an old high grate but its light though assisted by that of two wax candles on the table failed to show the outlines of the room it was so large and dark The ceiling was rather low in proportion and a huge beam crossed it At one end an open door revealed a room beyond likewise lighted with fire and candles Entering he found this to be an equally old fashioned bedroom to which his luggage had been already conveyed As far as creature comforts go thought Hugh I have fallen on my feet He rang the bell had the tray removed and then proceeded to examine the book cases He found them to contain much of the literature with which he was most desirous of making an acquaintance A few books of the day were interspersed The sense of having good companions in the authors around him added greatly to his feeling of comfort and he retired for the night filled with pleasant anticipations of his sojourn at Arnstead All the night however his dreams were of wind and snow and Margaret out in them alone Janet was waiting in the cottage for him to bring her home He had found her but could not move her for the spirit of the storm had frozen her to ice and she was heavy as a marble statue When he awoke the shadows of boughs and budding twigs were waving in changeful network tracery across the bright sunshine on his window curtains Before he was called he was ready to go down and to amuse himself till breakfast time he proceeded to make another survey of the books He concluded that these must be a colony from the mother library and also that the room must notwithstanding be intended for his especial occupation seeing his bedroom opened out of it Next he looked from all the windows to discover into what kind of a furrow on the face of the old earth he had fallen All he could see was trees and trees But oh how different from the sombre dark changeless fir wood at Turriepuffit whose trees looked small and shrunken in his memory beside this glory of boughs breaking out into their prophecy of an infinite greenery at hand His rooms seemed to occupy the end of a small wing at the back of the house as well as he could judge His sitting room windows looked across a small space to another wing and the windows of his bedroom which were at right angles to those of the former looked full into what seemed an ordered ancient forest of gracious trees of all kinds coming almost close to the very windows They were the trees which had been throwing their shadows on these windows for two or three hours of the silent spring sunlight at once so liquid and so dazzling Then he resolved to test his faculty for discovery by seeing whether he could find his way to the breakfast room without a guide In this he would have succeeded without much difficulty for it opened from the main entrance hall to which the huge square turned oak staircase by which he had ascended led had it not been for the somewhat intricate nature of the passages leading from the wing in which his rooms were evidently an older and more retired portion of the house to the main staircase itself After opening many doors and finding no thoroughfare he became convinced that in place of finding a way on he had lost the way back At length he came to a small stair which led him down to a single door This he opened and straightway found himself in the library a long low silent looking room every foot of the walls of which was occupied with books in varied and rich bindings The lozenge paned windows with thick stone mullions were much overgrown with ivy throwing a cool green shadowiness into the room One of them however had been altered to a more modern taste and opened with folding doors upon a few steps descending into an old fashioned terraced garden To approach this window he had to pass a table lying on which he saw a paper with verses on it evidently in a woman s hand and apparently just written for the ink of the corrective scores still glittered Just as he reached the window which stood open a lady had almost gained it from the other side coming up the steps from the garden She gave a slight start when she saw him looked away and as instantly glanced towards him again Then approaching him through the window for he had retreated to allow her to enter she bowed with a kind of studied ease and a slight shade of something French in her manner Her voice was very pleasing almost bewitching yet had at the same time something assumed if not affected in the tone All this was discoverable or rather spiritually palpable in the two words she said merely mister Sutherland interrogatively Hugh bowed and said I am very glad you have found me for I had quite lost myself I doubt whether I should ever have reached the breakfast room Come this way she rejoined As they passed the table on which the verses lay she stopped and slipped them into a writing case Leading him through a succession of handsome evidently modern passages she brought him across the main hall to the breakfast room which looked in the opposite direction to the library namely to the front of the house She rang the bell the urn was brought in and she proceeded at once to make the tea which she did well rising in Hugh s estimation thereby Before he had time however to make his private remarks on her exterior or his conjectures on her position in the family mister Arnold entered the room with a slow somewhat dignified step and a dull outlook of grey eyes from a grey head well balanced on a tall rather slender frame The lady rose and addressing him as uncle bade him good morning a greeting which he returned cordially with a kiss on her forehead Then accosting Hugh with a manner which seemed the more polite and cold after the tone in which he had spoken to his niece he bade him welcome to Arnstead I trust you were properly attended to last night mister Sutherland Your pupil wanted very much to sit up till you arrived but he is altogether too delicate I am sorry to say for late hours though he has an unfortunate preference for them himself Jacob to the man in waiting is not Master Harry up yet Master Harry s entrance at that moment rendered reply unnecessary Good morning Euphra he said to the lady and kissed her on the cheek Good morning dear was the reply accompanied by a pretence of returning the kiss But she smiled with a kind of confectionary sweetness on him and dropping an additional lump of sugar into his tea at the same moment placed it for him beside herself while he went and shook hands with his father and then glancing shyly up at Hugh from a pair of large dark eyes put his hand in his and smiled revealing teeth of a pearly whiteness The lips however did not contrast them sufficiently being pale and thin with indication of suffering in their tremulous lines Taking his place at table he trifled with his breakfast and after making pretence of eating for a while asked Euphra if he might go She giving him leave he hastened away mister Arnold took advantage of his retreat to explain to Hugh what he expected of him with regard to the boy How old would you take Harry to be mister Sutherland I should say about twelve from his size replied Hugh but from his evident bad health and intelligent expression Ah you perceive the state he is in interrupted mister Arnold with some sadness in his voice You are right he is nearly fifteen He has not grown half an inch in the last twelve months Perhaps that is better than growing too fast said Hugh Perhaps perhaps we will hope so But I cannot help being uneasy about him He reads too much and I have not yet been able to help it for he seems miserable and without any object in life if I compel him to leave his books Perhaps we can manage to get over that in a little while Besides mister Arnold went on paying no attention to what Hugh said I can get him to take no exercise He does not even care for riding I bought him a second pony a month ago and he has not been twice on its back yet Hugh could not help thinking that to increase the supply was not always the best mode of increasing the demand and that one who would not ride the first pony would hardly be likely to ride the second mister Arnold concluded with the words I don t want to stop the boy s reading but I can t have him a milksop Will you let me manage him as I please mister Arnold Hugh ventured to say mister Arnold looked full at him with a very slight but quite manifest expression of surprise and Hugh was aware that the eyes of the lady called by the boy Euphra were likewise fixed upon him penetratingly As if he were then for the first time struck by the manly development of Hugh s frame mister Arnold answered I don t want you to overdo it either You cannot make a muscular Christian of him The speaker smiled at his own imagined wit The boy has talents and I want him to use them I will do my best for him both ways answered Hugh if you will trust me For my part I think the only way is to make the operation of the intellectual tendency on the one side reveal to the boy himself his deficiency on the other This once done all will be well As he said this Hugh caught sight of a cloudy inscrutable dissatisfaction slightly contracting the eyebrows of the lady mister Arnold however seemed not to be altogether displeased Well he answered I have my plans but let us see first what you can do with yours If they fail perhaps you will oblige me by trying mine This was said with the decisive politeness of one who is accustomed to have his own way and fully intends to have it every word as articulate and deliberate as organs of speech could make it But he seemed at the same time somewhat impressed by Hugh and not unwilling to yield Throughout the conversation the lady had said nothing but had sat watching or rather scrutinizing Hugh s countenance with a far keener and more frequent glance than I presume he was at all aware of Whether or not she was satisfied with her conclusions she allowed no sign to disclose but breakfast being over rose and withdrew turning however at the door and saying When you please mister Sutherland I shall be glad to show you what Harry has been doing with me for till now I have been his only tutor Thank you replied Hugh but for some time we shall be quite independent of school books Perhaps we may require none at all He can read I presume fairly well Reading is not only his forte but his fault replied mister Arnold while Euphra fixing one more piercing look upon him withdrew Yes responded Hugh but a boy may shuffle through a book very quickly and have no such accurate perceptions of even the mere words as to be able to read aloud intelligibly How little this applied to Harry Hugh was soon to learn Well you know best about these things I daresay I leave it to you With such testimonials as you have mister Sutherland I can hardly be wrong in letting you try your own plans with him Now I must bid you good morning You will in all probability find Harry in the library CHAPTER II HARRY S NEW HORSE Spielender Unterricht heisst nicht dem Kinde Anstrengungen ersparen und abnehmen sondern eine Leidenschaft in ihm erwecken welche ihm die starksten aufnothigt und erleichtert JEAN PAUL Die Unsichtbare Loge It is not the intention of sportive instruction that the child should be spared effort or delivered from it but that thereby a passion should be wakened in him which shall both necessitate and facilitate the strongest exertion Hugh made no haste to find his pupil in the library thinking it better with such a boy not to pounce upon him as if he were going to educate him directly He went to his own rooms instead got his books out and arranged them supplying thus in a very small degree the scarcity of modern ones in the book cases then arranged his small wardrobe looked about him a little and finally went to seek his pupil He found him in the library as he had been given to expect coiled up on the floor in a corner with his back against the book shelves and an old folio on his knees which he was reading in silence Well Harry said Hugh in a half indifferent tone as he threw himself on a couch what are you reading Harry had not heard him come in He started and almost shuddered then looked up hesitated rose and as if ashamed to utter the name of the book brought it to Hugh opening it at the title page as he held it out to him It was the old romance of Polexander Hugh knew nothing about it but glancing over some of the pages could not help wondering that the boy should find it interesting Do you like this very much said he Well no Yes rather I think I could find you something more interesting in the book shelves Oh please sir mayn t I read this pleaded Harry with signs of distress in his pale face Oh yes certainly if you wish But tell me why you want to read it so very much Because I have set myself to read it through Hugh saw that the child was in a diseased state of mind as well as of body You should not set yourself to read anything before you know whether it is worth reading I could not help it I was forced to say I would To whom To myself Mayn t I read it Certainly was all Hugh s answer for he saw that he must not pursue the subject at present the boy was quite hypochondriacal His face was keen with that clear definition of feature which suggests superior intellect He was though very small for his age well proportioned except that his head and face were too large His forehead indicated thought and Hugh could not doubt that however uninteresting the books which he read might be they must have afforded him subjects of mental activity But he could not help seeing as well that this activity if not altered in its direction and modified in its degree would soon destroy itself either by ruining his feeble constitution altogether or which was more to be feared by irremediably injuring the action of the brain He resolved however to let him satisfy his conscience by reading the book hoping by the introduction of other objects of thought and feeling to render it so distasteful that he would be in little danger of yielding a similar pledge again even should the temptation return which Hugh hoped to prevent But you have read enough for the present have you not said he rising and approaching the book shelves Yes I have been reading since breakfast Ah there s a capital book Have you ever read it Gulliver s Travels No The outside looked always so uninteresting So does Polexander s outside Yes But I couldn t help that one Well come along I will read to you Oh thank you That will be delightful But must we not go to our lessons I m going to make a lesson of this I have been talking to your papa and we re going to begin with a holiday instead of ending with one I must get better acquainted with you first Harry before I can teach you right We must be friends you know The boy crept close up to him laid one thin hand on his knee looked in his face for a moment and then without a word sat down on the couch close beside him Before an hour had passed Harry was laughing heartily at Gulliver s adventures amongst the Lilliputians Having arrived at this point of success Hugh ceased reading and began to talk to him Is that lady your cousin Yes Isn t she beautiful I hardly know yet I have not got used to her enough yet What is her name Oh such a pretty name Euphrasia Is she the only lady in the house Yes my mamma is dead you know She was ill for a long time they say and she died when I was born The tears came in the poor boy s eyes Hugh thought of his own father and put his hand on Harry s shoulder Harry laid his head on Hugh s shoulder But he went on Euphra is so kind to me And she is so clever too She knows everything Have you no brothers or sisters No none I wish I had Well I ll be your big brother Only you must mind what I say to you else I shall stop being him Is it a bargain Yes to be sure cried Harry in delight and springing from the couch he began hopping feebly about the room on one foot to express his pleasure Well then that s settled Now you must come and show me the horses your ponies you know and the pigs I don t like the pigs I don t know where they are Well we must find out Perhaps I shall make some discoveries for you Have you any rabbits No A dog though surely No I had a canary but the cat killed it and I have never had a pet since Well get your cap and come out with me I will wait for you here Harry walked away he seldom ran He soon returned with his cap and they sallied out together Happening to look back at the house when a few paces from it Hugh thought he saw Euphra standing at the window of a back staircase They made the round of the stables and the cow house and the poultry yard and even the pigs as proposed came in for a share of their attention As they approached the stye Harry turned away his head with a look of disgust They were eating out of the trough They make such a nasty noise he said Yes but just look don t they enjoy it said Hugh Harry looked at them The notion of their enjoyment seemed to dawn upon him as something quite new He went nearer and nearer to the stye At last a smile broke out over his countenance How tight that one curls his tail said he and burst out laughing How dreadfully this boy must have been mismanaged thought Hugh to himself But there is no fear of him now I hope By this time they had been wandering about for more than an hour and Hugh saw by Harry s increased paleness that he was getting tired Here Harry get on my back my boy and have a ride You re tired And Hugh knelt down Harry shrunk back I shall spoil your coat with my shoes Nonsense Rub them well on the grass there And then get on my back directly Harry did as he was bid and found his tutor s broad back and strong arms a very comfortable saddle So away they went wandering about for a long time in their new relation of horse and his rider At length they got into the middle of a long narrow avenue quite neglected overgrown with weeds and obstructed with rubbish But the trees were fine beeches of great growth and considerable age One end led far into a wood and the other towards the house a small portion of which could be seen at the end the avenue appearing to reach close up to it Don t go down this said Harry Well it s not a very good road for a horse certainly but I think I can go it What a beautiful avenue Why is it so neglected Don t go down there please dear horse Harry was getting wonderfully at home with Hugh already Why asked Hugh They call it the Ghost s Walk and I don t much like it It has a strange distracted look That s a long word and a descriptive one too thought Hugh but considering that there would come many a better opportunity of combating the boy s fears than now he simply said Very well Harry and proceeded to leave the avenue by the other side But Harry was not yet satisfied Please mister Sutherland don t go on that side just now Ride me back please It is not safe they say to cross her path She always follows any one who crosses her path Hugh laughed but again said Very well my boy and returning left the avenue by the side by which he had entered it Shall we go home to luncheon now said Harry Yes replied Hugh Could we not go by the front of the house I should like very much to see it Oh certainly said Harry and proceeded to direct Hugh how to go but evidently did not know quite to his own satisfaction There being however but little foliage yet Hugh could discover his way pretty well He promised himself many a delightful wander in the woody regions in the evenings They managed to get round to the front of the house not without some difficulty and then Hugh saw to his surprise that although not imposing in appearance it was in extent more like a baronial residence than that of a simple gentleman The front was very long apparently of all ages and of all possible styles of architecture the result being somewhat mysterious and eminently picturesque All kinds of windows all kinds of projections and recesses a house here joined to a hall there here a pointed gable the very bell on the top overgrown and apparently choked with ivy there a wide front with large bay windows and next a turret of old stone with not a shred of ivy upon it but crowded over with grey green lichens which looked as if the stone itself had taken to growing multitudes of roofs of all shapes and materials so that one might very easily be lost amongst the chimneys and gutters and dormer windows and pinnacles made up the appearance of the house on the outside to Hugh s first inquiring glance as he paused at a little distance with Harry on his back and scanned the wonderful pile before him But as he looked at the house of Arnstead Euphra was looking at him with the boy on his back from one of the smaller windows Was she making up her mind You are as kind to me as Euphra said Harry as Hugh set him down in the hall I ve enjoyed my ride very much thank you mister Sutherland I am sure Euphra will like you very much she likes everybody CHAPTER III EUPHRASIA then purged with Euphrasy and Rue The visual nerve for he had much to see Paradise Lost b xi Soft music came to mine ear It was like the rising breeze that whirls at first the thistle s beard then flies dark shadowy over the grass It was the maid of Fuarfed wild she raised the nightly song for she knew that my soul was a stream that flowed at pleasant sounds Ossian Oina Morul Harry led Hugh by the hand to the dining room a large oak hall with Gothic windows and an open roof supported by richly carved woodwork in the squares amidst which were painted many escutcheons parted by fanciful devices Over the high stone carving above the chimney hung an old piece of tapestry occupying the whole space between that and the roof It represented a hunting party of ladies and gentlemen just setting out The table looked very small in the centre of the room though it would have seated twelve or fourteen It was already covered for luncheon and in a minute Euphra entered and took her place without a word Hugh sat on one side and Harry on the other Euphra having helped both to soup turned to Harry and said Well Harry I hope you have enjoyed your first lesson Very much answered Harry with a smile I have learned pigs and horseback The boy is positively clever thought Hugh mister Sutherland he continued has begun to teach me to like creatures But I thought you were very fond of your wild beast book Harry Oh yes but that was only in the book you know I like the stories about them of course But to like pigs you know is quite different They are so ugly and ill bred I like them though You seem to have quite gained Harry already said Euphra glancing at Hugh and looking away as quickly We are very good friends and shall be I think replied he Harry looked at him affectionately and said to him not to Euphra Oh yes that we shall I am sure Then turning to the lady Do you know Euphra he is my big brother You must mind how you make new relations though Harry for you know that would make him my cousin Well you will be a kind cousin to him won t you I will try replied Euphra looking up at Hugh with a naive expression of shyness and the slightest possible blush Hugh began to think her pretty almost handsome His next thought was to wonder how old she was But about this he could not at once make up his mind She might be four and twenty she might be two and thirty She had black lustreless hair and eyes to match as far as colour was concerned but they could sparkle and probably flash upon occasion a low forehead but very finely developed in the faculties that dwell above the eyes slender but very dark eyebrows just black arched lines in her rather sallow complexion nose straight and nothing remarkable an excellent thing in woman a mouth indifferent when at rest but capable of a beautiful laugh She was rather tall and of a pretty enough figure hands good feet invisible Hugh came to these conclusions rapidly enough now that his attention was directed to her for though naturally unobservant his perception was very acute as soon as his attention was roused Thank you he replied to her pretty speech I shall do my best to deserve it I hope you will mister Sutherland rejoined she with another arch look Take some wine Harry She poured out a glass of sherry and gave it to the boy who drank it with some eagerness Hugh could not approve of this but thought it too early to interfere Turning to Harry he said Now Harry you have had rather a tiring morning I should like you to go and lie down a while Very well mister Sutherland replied Harry who seemed rather deficient in combativeness as well as other boyish virtues Shall I lie down in the library No have a change In my bed room No I think not Go to my room and lie on the couch till I come to you Harry went and Hugh partly for the sake of saying something and partly to justify his treatment of Harry told Euphra whose surname he did not yet know what they had been about all the morning ending with some remark on the view of the house in front She heard the account of their proceedings with apparent indifference replying only to the remark with which he closed it It is rather a large house is it not for three I beg your pardon for four persons to live in mister Sutherland It is indeed it quite bewilders me To tell the truth I don t quite know above the half of it myself Hugh thought this rather a strange assertion large as the house was but she went on I lost myself between the housekeeper s room and my own no later than last week I suppose there was a particle of truth in this and that she had taken a wrong turning in an abstracted fit Perhaps she did not mean it to be taken as absolutely true You have not lived here long then Not long for such a great place A few years I am only a poor relation She accompanied this statement with another swift uplifting of the eyelids But this time her eyes rested for a moment on Hugh s with something of a pleading expression and when they fell a slight sigh followed Hugh felt that he could not quite understand her A vague suspicion crossed his mind that she was bewitching him but vanished instantly He replied to her communication by a smile and the remark You have the more freedom then Did you know Harry s mother he added after a pause No She died when Harry was born She was very beautiful and they say very clever but always in extremely delicate health Between ourselves I doubt if there was much sympathy that is if my uncle and she quite understood each other But that is an old story A pause followed Euphra resumed As to the freedom you speak of mister Sutherland I do not quite know what to do with it I live here as if the place were my own and give what orders I please But mister Arnold shows me little attention he is so occupied with one thing and another I hardly know what and if he did perhaps I should get tired of him So except when we have visitors which is not very often the time hangs rather heavy on my hands But you are fond of reading and writing too I suspect Hugh ventured to say She gave him another of her glances in which the apparent shyness was mingled with something for which Hugh could not find a name Nor did he suspect till long after that it was in reality slyness so tempered with archness that if discovered it might easily pass for an expression playfully assumed Oh yes she said one must read a book now and then and if a verse again a glance and a slight blush should come up from nobody knows where one may as well write it down But please do not take me for a literary lady Indeed I make not the slightest pretensions I don t know what I should do without Harry and indeed indeed you must not steal him from me mister Sutherland I should be very sorry replied Hugh Let me beg you as far as I have a right to do so to join us as often and as long as you please I will go and see how he is I am sure the boy only wants thorough rousing alternated with perfect repose He went to his own room where he found Harry to his satisfaction fast asleep on the sofa He took care not to wake him but sat down beside him to read till his sleep should be over But a moment after the boy opened his eyes with a start and a shiver and gave a slight cry When he saw Hugh he jumped up and with a smile which was pitiful to see upon a scared face said Oh I am so glad you are there What is the matter dear Harry I had a dreadful dream What was it I don t know It always comes It is always the same I know that And yet I can never remember what it is Hugh soothed him as well as he could and he needed it for the cold drops were standing on his forehead When he had grown calmer he went and fetched Gulliver and to the boy s great delight read to him till dinner time Before the first bell rang he had quite recovered and indeed seemed rather interested in the approach of dinner Dinner was an affair of some state at Arnstead Almost immediately after the second bell had rung mister Arnold made his appearance in the drawing room where the others were already waiting for him This room had nothing of the distinctive character of the parts of the house which Hugh had already seen It was merely a handsome modern room of no great size mister Arnold led Euphra to dinner and Hugh followed with Harry mister Arnold s manner to Hugh was the same as in the morning studiously polite without the smallest approach to cordiality He addressed him as an equal it is true but an equal who could never be in the smallest danger of thinking he meant it Hugh who without having seen a great deal of the world yet felt much the same wherever he was took care to give him all that he seemed to look for as far at least as was consistent with his own self respect He soon discovered that he was one of those men who if you will only grant their position and acknowledge their authority will allow you to have much your own way in everything His servants had found this out long ago and almost everything about the house was managed as they pleased but as the oldest of them were respectable family servants nothing went very far wrong They all however waited on Euphra with an assiduity that showed she was or could be quite mistress when and where she pleased Perhaps they had found out that she had great influence with mister Arnold and certainly he seemed very fond of her indeed after a stately fashion She spoke to the servants with peculiar gentleness never said if you please but always thank you Harry never asked for anything but always looked to Euphra who gave the necessary order Hugh saw that the boy was quite dependent upon her seeming of himself scarcely capable of originating the simplest action mister Arnold however dull as he was could not help seeing that Harry s manner was livelier than usual and seemed pleased at the slight change already visible for the better Turning to Hugh he said Do you find Harry very much behind with his studies mister Sutherland I have not yet attempted to find out replied Hugh Not said mister Arnold with surprise No If he be behind I feel confident it will not be for long But began mister Arnold pompously and then he paused You were kind enough to say mister Arnold that I might try my own plans with him first I have been doing so Yes certainly But Here Harry broke in with some animation mister Sutherland has been my horse carrying me about on his back all the morning no not all the morning but an hour or an hour and a half or was it two hours mister Sutherland I really don t know Harry answered Hugh I don t think it matters much Harry seemed relieved and went on He has been reading Gulliver s Travels to me oh such fall And we have been to see the cows and the pigs and mister Sutherland has been teaching me to jump Do you know papa he jumped right over the pony s back without touching it mister Arnold stared at the boy with lustreless eyes and hanging checks These grew red as if he were going to choke Such behaviour was quite inconsistent with the dignity of Arnstead and its tutor who had been recommended to him as a thorough gentleman But for the present he said nothing probably because he could think of nothing to say Certainly Harry seems better already interposed Euphra I cannot help thinking mister Sutherland has made a good beginning mister Arnold did not reply but the cloud wore away from his face by degrees and at length he asked Hugh to take a glass of wine with him When Euphra rose from the table and Harry followed her example Hugh thought it better to rise as well mister Arnold seemed to hesitate whether or not to ask him to resume his seat and have a glass of claret Had he been a little wizened pedagogue no doubt he would have insisted on his company sure of acquiescence from him in every sentiment he might happen to utter But Hugh really looked so very much like a gentleman and stated his own views or adopted his own plans with so much independence that mister Arnold judged it safer to keep him at arm s length for a season at least till he should thoroughly understand his position not that of a guest but that of his son s tutor belonging to the household of Arnstead only on approval On leaving the dining room Hugh hesitated in his turn whether to betake himself to his own room or to accompany Euphra to the drawing room the door of which stood open on the opposite side of the hall revealing a brightness and warmth which the chill of the evening and the lowness of the fire in the dining room rendered quite enticing But Euphra who was half across the hall seeming to divine his thoughts turned and said Are you not going to favour us with your company mister Sutherland With pleasure replied Hugh but to cover his hesitation added I will be with you presently and ran up stairs to his own room The old gentleman sits on his dignity can hardly be said to stand on it thought he as he went The poor relation as she calls herself treats me like a guest She is mistress here however that is clear enough As he descended the stairs to the drawing room a voice rose through the house like the voice of an angel At least so thought Hugh hearing it for the first time It seemed to take his breath away as he stood for a moment on the stairs listening It was only Euphra singing The Flowers of the Forest The drawing room door was still open and her voice rang through the wide lofty hall He entered almost on tip toe that he might lose no thread of the fine tones Had she chosen the song of Scotland out of compliment to him She saw him enter but went on without hesitating even In the high notes her voice had that peculiar vibratory richness which belongs to the nightingale s but he could not help thinking that the low tones were deficient both in quality and volume The expression and execution however would have made up for a thousand defects Her very soul seemed brooding over the dead upon Flodden field as she sang this most wailful of melodies this embodiment of a nation s grief The song died away as if the last breath had gone with it failing as it failed and ceasing with its inspiration as if the voice that sang lived only for and in the song A moment of intense silence followed Then before Hugh had half recovered from the former with an almost grand dramatic recoil as if the second sprang out of the first like an eagle of might out of an ocean of weeping she burst into Scots wha hae She might have been a new Deborah heralding her nation to battle Hugh was transfixed turned icy cold with the excitement of his favourite song so sung Was that a glance of satisfied triumph with which Euphra looked at him for a single moment She sang the rest of the song as if the battle were already gained but looked no more at Hugh The excellence of her tones and the lambent fluidity of her transitions if I may be allowed the phrase were made by her art quite subservient to the expression and owed their chief value to the share they bore in producing it Possibly there was a little too much of the dramatic in her singing but it was all in good taste and in a word Hugh had never heard such singing before As soon as she had finished she rose and shut the piano Do not do not faltered Hugh seeking to arrest her hand as she closed the instrument I can sing nothing after that she said with emotion or perhaps excitement for the trembling of her voice might be attributed to either cause Do not ask me Hugh respectfully desisted but after a few minutes pause ventured to remark I cannot understand how you should be able to sing Scotch songs so well I never heard any but Scotch women sing them even endurably before your singing of them is perfect It seems to me said Euphra speaking as if she would rather have remained silent that a true musical penetration is independent of styles and nationalities It can perceive or rather feel and reproduce at the same moment If the music speaks Scotch the musical nature hears Scotch It can take any shape indeed cannot help taking any shape presented to it Hugh was yet further astonished by this criticism from one whom he had been criticising with so much carelessness that very day You think then said he modestly not as if he would bring her to book but as really seeking to learn from her that a true musical nature can pour itself into the mould of any song in entire independence of association and education Yes in independence of any but what it may provide for itself Euphrasia however had left one important element unrepresented in the construction of her theory namely the degree of capability which a mind may possess of sympathy with any given class of feelings The blossom of the mind whether it flower in poetry music or any other art must be the exponent of the nature and condition of that whose blossom it is No mind therefore incapable of sympathising with the feelings whence it springs can interpret the music of another And Euphra herself was rather a remarkable instance of this forgotten fact Further conversation on the subject was interrupted by the entrance of mister Arnold who looked rather annoyed at finding Hugh in the drawing room and ordered Harry off to bed with some little asperity of tone The boy rose at once rang the bell bade them all good night and went A servant met him at the door with a candle and accompanied him Thought Hugh Here are several things to be righted at once The boy must not have wine and he must have only one dinner a day especially if he is ordered to bed so early I must make a man of him if I can He made inquiries and with some difficulty found out where the boy slept During the night he was several times in Harry s room and once in happy time to wake him from a nightmare dream The boy was so overcome with terror that Hugh got into bed beside him and comforted him to sleep in his arms Nor did he leave him till it was time to get up when he stole back to his own quarters which happily were at no very great distance I may mention here that it was not long before Hugh succeeded in stopping the wine and reducing the dinner to a mouthful of supper Harry as far as he was concerned yielded at once and his father only held out long enough to satisfy his own sense of dignity CHAPTER IV THE CAVE IN THE STRAW All knowledge and wonder which is the seed of knowledge is an impression of pleasure in itself LORD BACON Advancement of Learning The following morning dawned in a cloud which swathed about the trees wetted them down to the roots without having time to become rain They drank it in like sorrow the only material out of which true joy can be fashioned This cloud of mist would yet glimmer in a new heaven namely in the cloud of blooms which would clothe the limes and the chestnuts and the beeches along the ghost s walk But there was gloomy weather within doors as well for poor Harry was especially sensitive to variations of the barometer without being in the least aware of the fact himself Again Hugh found him in the library seated in his usual corner with Polexander on his knees He half dropped the book when Hugh entered and murmured with a sigh It s no use I can t read it What s the matter Harry said his tutor I should like to tell you but you will laugh at me I shall never laugh at you Harry Never No never Then tell me how I can be sure that I have read this book I do not quite understand you Ah I was sure nobody could be so stupid as I am Do you know mister Sutherland I seem to have read a page from top to bottom sometimes and when I come to the bottom I know nothing about it and doubt whether I have read it at all and then I stare at it all over again till I grow so queer and sometimes nearly scream You see I must be able to say I have read the book Why Nobody will ever ask you Perhaps not but you know that is nothing I want to know that I have read the book really and truly read it Hugh thought for a moment and seemed to see that the boy not being strong enough to be a law to himself just needed a benign law from without to lift him from the chaos of feeble and conflicting notions and impulses within which generated a false law of slavery So he said Harry am I your big brother Yes mister Sutherland Then ought you to do what I wish or what you wish yourself What you wish sir Then I want you to put away that book for a month at least Oh mister Sutherland I promised To whom To myself But I am above you and I want you to do as I tell you Will you Harry Yes Put away the book then Harry sprang to his feet put the book on its shelf and going up to Hugh said You have done it not me Certainly Harry The notions of a hypochondriacal child will hardly be interesting to the greater part of my readers but Hugh learned from this a little lesson about divine law which he never forgot Now Harry added he you must not open a book till I allow you No poetry either said poor Harry and his face fell I don t mind poetry so much but of prose I will read as much to you as will be good for you Come let us have a bit of Gulliver again Oh how delightful cried Harry I am so glad you made me put away that tiresome book I wonder why it insisted so on being read Hugh read for an hour and then made Harry put on his cloak notwithstanding the rain which fell in a slow thoughtful spring shower Taking the boy again on his back he carried him into the woods There he told him how the drops of wet sank into the ground and then went running about through it in every direction looking for seeds which were all thirsty little things that wanted to grow and could not till a drop came and gave them drink And he told him how the rain drops were made up in the skies and then came down like millions of angels to do what they were told in the dark earth The good drops went into all the cellars and dungeons of the earth to let out the imprisoned flowers And he told him how the seeds when they had drunk the rain drops wanted another kind of drink next which was much thinner and much stronger but could not do them any good till they had drunk the rain first What is that said Harry I feel as if you were reading out of the Bible mister Sutherland It is the sunlight answered his tutor When a seed has drunk of the water and is not thirsty any more it wants to breathe next and then the sun sends a long small finger of fire down into the grave where the seed is lying and it touches the seed and something inside the seed begins to move instantly and to grow bigger and bigger till it sends two green blades out of it into the earth and through the earth into the air and then it can breathe And then it sends roots down into the earth and the roots keep drinking water and the leaves keep breathing the air and the sun keeps them alive and busy and so a great tree grows up and God looks at it and says it is good Then they really are living things said Harry Certainly Thank you mister Sutherland I don t think I shall dislike rain so much any more Hugh took him next into the barn where they found a great heap of straw Recalling his own boyish amusements he made him put off his cloak and help to make a tunnel into this heap Harry was delighted the straw was so nice and bright and dry and clean They drew it out by handfuls and thus excavated a round tunnel to the distance of six feet or so when Hugh proceeded to more extended operations Before it was time to go to lunch they had cleared half of a hollow sphere six feet in diameter out of the heart of the heap After lunch for which Harry had been very unwilling to relinquish the straw hut Hugh sent him to lie down for a while when he fell fast asleep as before After he had left the room Euphra said How do you get on with Harry mister Sutherland Perfectly to my satisfaction answered Hugh Do you not find him very slow Quite the contrary You surprise me But you have not given him any lessons yet I have given him a great many and he is learning them very fast I fear he will have forgotten all my poor labours before you take up the work where we left it When will you give him any book lessons Not for a while yet Euphra did not reply Her silence seemed intended to express dissatisfaction at least so Hugh interpreted it I hope you do not think it is to indulge myself that I manage Master Harry in this peculiar fashion he said The fact is he is a very peculiar child and may turn out a genius or a weakling just as he is managed At least so it appears to me at present May I ask where you left the work you were doing with him He was going through the Eton grammar for the third time answered Euphra with a defiant glance almost of dislike at Hugh But I need not enumerate his studies for I daresay you will not take them up at all after my fashion I only assure you I have been a very exact disciplinarian What he knows I think you will find he knows thoroughly So saying Euphra rose and with a flush on her cheek walked out of the room in a more stately manner than usual Hugh felt that he had somehow or other offended her But to tell the truth he did not much care for her manner had rather irritated him He retired to his own room wrote to his mother and when Harry awoke carried him again to the barn for an hour s work in the straw Before it grew dusk they had finished a little silent dark chamber as round as they could make it in the heart of the straw All the excavated material they had thrown on the top reserving only a little to close up the entrance when they pleased The next morning was still rainy and when Hugh found Harry in the library as usual he saw that the clouds had again gathered over the boy s spirit He was pacing about the room in a very odd manner The carpet was divided diamond wise in a regular pattern Harry s steps were for the most part planted upon every third diamond as he slowly crossed the floor in a variety of directions for as on previous occasions he had not perceived the entrance of his tutor But every now and then the boy would make the most sudden and irregular change in his mode of progression setting his foot on the most unexpected diamond at one time the nearest to him at another the farthest within his reach When he looked up and saw his tutor watching him he neither started nor blushed but still retaining on his countenance the perplexed anxious expression which Hugh had remarked said to him How can God know on which of those diamonds I am going to set my foot next If you could understand how God knows Harry then you would know yourself but before you have made up your mind you don t know which you will choose and even then you only know on which you intend to set your foot for you have often changed your mind after making it up Harry looked as puzzled as before Why Harry to understand how God understands you would need to be as wise as he is so it is no use trying You see you can t quite understand me though I have a real meaning in what I say Ah I see it is no use but I can t bear to be puzzled But you need not be puzzled you have no business to be puzzled You are trying to get into your little brain what is far too grand and beautiful to get into it Would you not think it very stupid to puzzle yourself how to put a hundred horses into a stable with twelve stalls Harry laughed and looked relieved It is more unreasonable a thousand times to try to understand such things For my part it would make me miserable to think that there was nothing but what I could understand I should feel as if I had no room anywhere Shall we go to our cave again Oh yes please cried Harry and in a moment he was on Hugh s back once more cantering joyously to the barn After various improvements including some enlargement of the interior Hugh and Harry sat down together in the low yellow twilight of their cave to enjoy the result of their labours They could just see by the light from the tunnel the glimmer of the golden hollow all about them The rain was falling heavily out of doors and they could hear the sound of the multitudinous drops of the broken cataract of the heavens like the murmur of the insects in a summer wood They knew that everything outside was rained upon and was again raining on everything beneath it while they were dry and warm This is nice exclaimed Harry after a few moments of silent enjoyment This is your first lesson in architecture said Hugh Am I to learn architecture asked Harry in a rueful tone It is well to know how things came to be done if you should know nothing more about them Harry Men lived in the cellars first of all and next on the ground floor but they could get no further till they joined the two and then they could build higher I don t quite understand you sir I did not mean you should Harry Then I don t mind sir But I thought architecture was building So it is and this is one way of building It is only making an outside by pulling out an inside instead of making an inside by setting up an outside Harry thought for a while and then said joyfully I see it sir I see it The inside is the chief thing not the outside Yes Harry and not in architecture only Never forget that They lay for some time in silence listening to the rain At length Harry spoke I have been thinking of what you told me yesterday mister Sutherland about the rain going to look for the seeds that were thirsty for it And now I feel just as if I were a seed lying in its little hole in the earth and hearing the rain drops pattering down all about it waiting oh so thirsty for some kind drop to find me out and give me itself to drink I wonder what kind of flower I should grow up added he laughing There is more truth than you think in your pretty fancy Harry rejoined Hugh and was silent self rebuked for the memory of David came back upon him recalled by the words of the boy of David whom he loved and honoured with the best powers of his nature and whom yet he had neglected and seemed to forget nay whom he had partially forgotten he could not deny The old man whose thoughts were just those of a wise child had said to him once We ken no more Maister Sutherlan what we re growin till than that neep seed there kens what a neep is though a neep it will be The only odds is that we ken that we dinna ken and the neep seed kens nothing at all aboot it But ae thing Maister Sutherlan we may be sure o that whatever it be it will be worth God s makin an our growin A solemn stillness fell upon Hugh s spirit as he recalled these words out of which stillness I presume grew the little parable which follows though Hugh after he had learned far more about the things therein hinted at could never understand how it was that he could have put so much more into it than he seemed to have understood at that period of his history For Harry said Wouldn t this be a nice place for a story mister Sutherland Do you ever tell stories sir I was just thinking of one Harry but it is as much yours as mine for you sowed the seed of the story in my mind Do you mean a story that never was in a book a story out of your own head Oh that will be grand Wait till we see what it will be Harry for I can t tell you how it will turn out After a little further pause Hugh began Long long ago two seeds lay beside each other in the earth waiting It was cold and rather wearisome and to beguile the time the one found means to speak to the other What are you going to be said the one I don t know answered the other For me rejoined the first I mean to be a rose There is nothing like a splendid rose Everybody will love me then It s all right whispered the second and that was all he could say for somehow when he had said that he felt as if all the words in the world were used up So they were silent again for a day or two Oh dear cried the first I have had some water I never knew till it was inside me I m growing I m growing Good bye Good bye repeated the other and lay still and waited more than ever The first grew and grew pushing itself straight up till at last it felt that it was in the open air for it could breathe And what a delicious breath that was It was rather cold but so refreshing The flower could see nothing for it was not quite a flower yet only a plant and they never see till their eyes come that is till they open their blossoms then they are flowers quite So it grew and grew and kept its head up very steadily meaning to see the sky the first thing and leave the earth quite behind as well as beneath it But somehow or other though why it could not tell it felt very much inclined to cry At length it opened its eye It was morning and the sky was over its head but alas itself was no rose only a tiny white flower It felt yet more inclined to hang down its head and to cry but it still resisted and tried hard to open its eye wide and to hold its head upright and to look full at the sky I will be a star of Bethlehem at least said the flower to itself But its head felt very heavy and a cold wind rushed over it and bowed it down towards the earth And the flower saw that the time of the singing of birds was not come that the snow covered the whole land and that there was not a single flower in sight but itself And it half closed its leaves in terror and the dismay of loneliness But that instant it remembered what the other flower used to say and it said to itself It s all right I will be what I can And thereon it yielded to the wind drooped its head to the earth and looked no more on the sky but on the snow And straightway the wind stopped and the cold died away and the snow sparkled like pearls and diamonds and the flower knew that it was the holding of its head up that had hurt it so for that its body came of the snow and that its name was Snow drop And so it said once more It s all right and waited in perfect peace All the rest it needed was to hang its head after its nature And what became of the other asked Harry I haven t done with this one yet answered Hugh I only told you it was waiting One day a pale sad looking girl with thin face large eyes and long white hands came hanging her head like the snowdrop along the snow where the flower grew She spied it smiled joyously and saying Ah my little sister are you come stooped and plucked the snowdrop It trembled and died in her hand which was a heavenly death for a snowdrop for had it not cast a gleam of summer pale as it had been itself upon the heart of a sick girl And the other repeated Harry The other had a long time to wait but it did grow one of the loveliest roses ever seen And at last it had the highest honour ever granted to a flower two lovers smelled it together and were content with it Harry was silent and so was Hugh for he could not understand himself quite He felt all the time he was speaking is if he were listening to David instead of talking himself The fact was he was only expanding in an imaginative soil the living seed which David had cast into it There seemed to himself to be more in his parable than he had any right to invent But is it not so with all stories that are rightly rooted in the human What a delightful story mister Sutherland said Harry at last Euphra tells me stories sometimes but I don t think I ever heard one I liked so much I wish we were meant to grow into something like the flower seeds So we are Harry Are we indeed How delightful it would be to think that I am only a seed mister Sutherland Do you think I might think so Yes I do Then please let me begin to learn something directly I haven t had anything disagreeable to do since you came and I don t feel as if that was right Poor Harry like so many thousands of good people had not yet learned that God is not a hard task master I don t intend that you should have anything disagreeable to do if I can help it We must do such things when they come to us but we must not make them for ourselves or for each other Then I m not to learn any more Latin am I said Harry in a doubtful kind of tone as if there were after all a little pleasure in doing what he did not like Is Latin so disagreeable Harry Yes it is rule after rule that has nothing in it I care for How can anybody care for Latin But I am quite ready to begin if I am only a seed really you know Not yet Harry Indeed we shall not begin again I won t let you till you ask me with your whole heart to let you learn Latin I am afraid that will be a long time and Euphra will not like it I will talk to her about it But perhaps it will not be so long as you think Now don t mention Latin to me again till you are ready to ask me heartily to teach you And don t give yourself any trouble about it either You never can make yourself like anything Harry was silent They returned to the house through the pouring rain Harry as usual mounted on his big brother As they crossed the hall mister Arnold came in He looked surprised and annoyed Hugh set Harry down who ran upstairs to get dressed for dinner while he himself half stopped and turned towards mister Arnold But mister Arnold did not speak and so Hugh followed Harry Hugh spent all that evening after Harry had gone to bed in correcting his impressions of some of the chief stories of early Roman history of which stories he intended commencing a little course to Harry the next day Meantime there was very little intercourse between Hugh and Euphra whose surname somehow or other Hugh had never inquired after He disliked asking questions about people to an uncommon degree and so preferred waiting for a natural revelation Her later behaviour had repelled him impressing him with the notion that she was proud and that she had made up her mind notwithstanding her apparent frankness at first to keep him at a distance That she was fitful too and incapable of showing much tenderness even to poor Harry he had already concluded in his private judgment hall Nor could he doubt that whether from wrong theories incapacity or culpable indifference she must have taken very bad measures indeed with her young pupil The next day resembled the two former with this difference that the rain fell in torrents Seated in their strawy bower they cared for no rain They were safe from the whole world and all the tempers of nature Then Hugh told Harry about the slow beginnings and the mighty birth of the great Roman people He told him tales of their battles and conquests their strifes at home and their wars abroad He told him stories of their grand men great with the individuality of their nation and their own He told him their characters their peculiar opinions and grounds of action and the results of their various schemes for their various ends He told him about their love to their country about their poetry and their religion their courage and their hardihood their architecture their clothes and their armour their customs and their laws but all in such language or mostly in such language as one boy might use in telling another of the same age for Hugh possessed the gift of a general simplicity of thought one of the most valuable a man can have It cost him a good deal of labour well repaid in itself not to speak of the evident delight of Harry to make himself perfectly competent for this but he had a good foundation of knowledge to work upon This went on for a long time after the period to which I am now more immediately confined Every time they stopped to rest from their rambles or games as often in fact as they sat down alone Harry s constant request was Now mister Sutherland mightn t we have something more about the Romans And mister Sutherland gave him something more But all this time he never uttered the word Latin CHAPTER V LARCH AND OTHER HUNTING For there is neither buske nor hay In May that it n ill shrouded bene And it with newe leaves wrene These woodes eke recoveren grene That

custom in the library He was reading What are you reading Harry asked he A poem said Harry and rising as before he brought the book to Hugh It was missus Hemans s Poems You are fond of poetry Harry Yes very Whose poems do you like best missus Hemans s of course Don t you think she is the best sir She writes very beautiful verses Harry Which poem are you reading now Oh one of my favourites The Voice of Spring Who taught you to like missus Hemans Euphra of course Will you read the poem to me Harry began and read the poem through with much taste and evident enjoyment an enjoyment which seemed however to spring more from the music of the thought and its embodiment in sound than from sympathy with the forms of nature called up thereby This was shown by his mode of reading in which the music was everything and the sense little or nothing When he came to the line And the larch has hung all his tassels forth he smiled so delightedly that Hugh said Are you fond of the larch Harry Yes very Are there any about here I don t know What is it like You said you were fond of it Oh yes it is a tree with beautiful tassels you know I think I should like to see one Isn t it a beautiful line When you have finished the poem we will go and see if we can find one anywhere in the woods We must know where we are in the world Harry what is all round about us you know Oh yes said Harry let us go and hunt the larch Perhaps we shall meet Spring if we look for her perhaps hear her voice too That would be delightful answered Harry smiling And away they went I may just mention here that missus Hemans was allowed to retire gradually till at last she was to be found only in the more inaccessible recesses of the library shelves while by that time Harry might be heard not all over the house certainly but as far off as outside the closed door of the library reading aloud to himself one or other of Macaulay s ballads with an evident enjoyment of the go in it A story with drum and trumpet accompaniment was quite enough for the present to satisfy Harry and Macaulay could give him that if little more As they went across the lawn towards the shrubbery on their way to look for larches and Spring Euphra joined them in walking dress It was a lovely morning I have taken you at your word you see mister Sutherland said she I don t want to lose my Harry quite You dear kind Euphra said Harry going round to her side and taking her hand He did not stay long with her however nor did Euphra seem particularly to want him There was one thing I ought to have mentioned to you the other night mister Sutherland and I daresay I should have mentioned it had not mister Arnold interrupted our tete a tete I feel now as if I had been guilty of claiming far more than I have a right to on the score of musical insight I have Scotch blood in me and was indeed born in Scotland though I left it before I was a year old My mother mister Arnold s sister married a gentleman who was half Sootch and I was born while they were on a visit to his relatives the Camerons of Lochnie His mother my grandmother was a Bohemian lady a countess with sixteen quarterings not a gipsy I beg to say Hugh thought she might have been to judge from present appearances But how was he to account for this torrent of genealogical information into which the ice of her late constraint had suddenly thawed It was odd that she should all at once volunteer so much about herself Perhaps she had made up one of those minds which need making up every now and then like a monthly magazine and now was prepared to publish it Hugh responded with a question Do I know your name then at last You are Miss Cameron Euphrasia Cameron at your service sir And she dropped a gay little courtesy to Hugh looking up at him with a flash of her black diamonds Then you must sing to me to night With all the pleasure in gipsy land replied she with a second courtesy lower than the first taking for granted no doubt his silent judgment on her person and complexion By this time they had reached the woods in a different quarter from that which Hugh had gone through the other day with Harry And here in very deed the Spring met them with a profusion of richness to which Hugh was quite a stranger The ground was carpeted with primroses and anemones and other spring flowers which are the loveliest of all flowers They were drinking the sunlight which fell upon them through the budded boughs By the time the light should be hidden from them by the leaves which are the clouds of the lower firmament of the woods their need of it would be gone exquisites in living they cared only for the delicate morning of the year Do look at this darling mister Sutherland exclaimed Euphrasia suddenly as she bent at the root of a great beech where grew a large bush of rough leaves with one tiny but perfectly formed primrose peeping out between Is it not a little pet all eyes all one eye staring out of its curtained bed to see what ever is going on in the world You had better lie down again it is not a nice place She spoke to it as if it had been a kitten or a baby And as she spoke she pulled the leaves yet closer over the little starer so as to hide it quite As they went on she almost obtrusively avoided stepping on the flowers saying she almost felt cruel or at least rude when she did so Yet she trailed her dress over them in quite a careless way not lifting it at all This was a peculiarity of hers which Hugh never understood till he understood herself All about in shady places the ferns were busy untucking themselves from their grave clothes unrolling their mysterious coils of life adding continually to the hidden growth as they unfolded the visible In this they were like the other revelations of God the Infinite All the wild lovely things were coming up for their month s life of joy Orchis harlequins cuckoo plants wild arums more properly lords and ladies were coming and coming slowly for had they not a long way to come from the valley of the shadow of death into the land of life At last the wanderers came upon a whole company of bluebells not what Hugh would have called bluebells for the bluebells of Scotland are the single poised harebells but wild hyacinths growing in a damp and shady spot in wonderful luxuriance They were quite three feet in height with long graceful drooping heads hanging down from them all along one side the largest and loveliest of bells one lying close above the other on the lower part while they parted thinner and thinner as they rose towards the lonely one at the top Miss Cameron went into ecstasies over these not saying much but breaking up what she did say with many prettily passionate pauses She had a very happy turn for seeing external resemblances either humorous or pathetic for she had much of one element that goes to the making of a poet namely surface impressibility Look Harry they are all sad at having to go down there again so soon They are looking at their graves so ruefully Harry looked sad and rather sentimental immediately When Hugh glanced at Miss Cameron he saw tears in her eyes You have nothing like this in your country have you mister Sutherland said she with an apparent effort No indeed answered Hugh And he said no more For a vision rose before him of the rugged pine wood and the single primrose and of the thoughtful maiden with unpolished speech and rough hands and but this he did not see a soul slowly refining itself to a crystalline clearness And he thought of the grand old grey haired David and of Janet with her quaint motherhood and of all the blessed bareness of the ancient time in sunlight and in snow and he felt again that he had forgotten and forsaken his friends How the fairies will be ringing the bells in these airy steeples in the moonlight said Miss Cameron to Harry who was surprised and delighted with it all He could not help wondering however after he went to bed that night that Euphra had never before taken him to see these beautiful things and had never before said anything half so pretty to him as the least pretty thing she had said about the flowers that morning when they were out with mister Sutherland Had mister Sutherland anything to do with it Was he giving Euphra a lesson in flowers such as he had given him in pigs Miss Cameron presently drew Hugh into conversation again and the old times were once more forgotten for a season They were worthy of distinguishing note that trio in those spring woods the boy waking up to feel that flowers and buds were lovelier in the woods than in verses Euphra finding everything about her sentimentally useful and really delighting in the prettinesses they suggested to her and Hugh regarding the whole chiefly as a material and means for reproducing in verse such impressions of delight as he had received and still received from all but the highest poetry about nature The presence of Harry and his necessities was certainly a saving influence upon Hugh but however much he sought to realize Harry s life he himself at this period of his history enjoyed everything artistically far more than humanly Margaret would have walked through all this infant summer without speaking at all but with a deep light far back in her quiet eyes Perhaps she would not have had many thoughts about the flowers Rather she would have thought the very flowers themselves would have been at home with them in a delighted oneness with their life and expression Certainly she would have walked through them with reverence and would not have petted or patronised nature by saying pretty things about her children Their life would have entered into her and she would have hardly known it from her own I daresay Miss Cameron would have called a mountain a darling or a beauty But there are other ways of showing affection than by patting and petting though Margaret for her part would have needed no art expression because she had the things themselves It is not always those who utter best who feel most and the dumb poets are sometimes dumb because it would need the large utterance of the early gods to carry their thoughts through the gates of speech But the fancy and skin sympathy of Miss Cameron began already to tell upon Hugh He knew very little of women and had never heard a woman talk as she talked He did not know how cheap this accomplishment is and took it for sensibility imaginativeness and even originality He thought she was far more en rapport with nature than he was It was much easier to make this mistake after hearing the really delightful way in which she sang Certainly she could not have sung so perhaps not even have talked so except she had been capable of more but to be capable of more and to be able for more are two very distinct conditions Many walks followed this extending themselves farther and farther from home as Harry s strength gradually improved It was quite remarkable how his interest in everything external increased in exact proportion as he learned to see into the inside or life of it With most children the interest in the external comes first and with many ceases there But it is in reality only a shallower form of the deeper sympathy and in those cases where it does lead to a desire after the hidden nature of things it is perhaps the better beginning of the two In such exceptional cases as Harry s it is of unspeakable importance that both the difference and the identity should be recognized and in doing so Hugh became to Harry his big brother indeed for he led him where he could not go alone As often as mister Arnold was from home which happened not unfrequently Miss Cameron accompanied them in their rambles She gave as her reason for doing so only on such occasions that she never liked to be out of the way when her uncle might want her Traces of an inclination to quarrel with Hugh or even to stand upon her dignity had all but vanished and as her vivacity never failed her as her intellect was always active and as by the exercise of her will she could enter sympathetically or appear to enter into everything her presence was not in the least a restraint upon them On one occasion when Harry had actually run a little way after a butterfly Hugh said to her What did you mean Miss Cameron by saying you were only a poor relation You are certainly mistress of the house On sufferance yes But I am only a poor relation I have no fortune of my own But mister Arnold does not treat you as such Oh no He likes me He is very kind to me He gave me this ring on my last birthday Is it not a beauty She pulled off her glove and showed a very fine diamond on a finger worthy of the ornament It is more like a gentleman s is it not she added drawing it off Let me see how it would look on your hand She gave the ring to Hugh who laughing got it with some difficulty just over the first joint of his little finger and held it up for Euphra to see Ah I see I cannot ask you to wear it for me said she I don t like it myself I am afraid however she added with an arch look my uncle would not like it either on your finger Put it on mine again Holding her hand towards Hugh she continued It must not be promoted just yet Besides I see you have a still better one of your own As Hugh did according to her request the words sprang to his lips There are other ways of wearing a ring than on the finger But they did not cross the threshold of speech Was it the repression of them that caused that strange flutter and slight pain at the heart which he could not quite understand CHAPTER VI FATIMA Those lips that Love s own hand did make Breathed forth the sound that said I hate To me that languished for her sake But when she saw my woeful state Straight in her heart did mercy come Chiding that tongue that ever sweet Was used in giving gentle doom And taught it thus anew to greet I hate she altered with an end That followed it as gentle day Doth follow night who like a fiend From heaven to hell is flown away I hate from hate away she threw And saved my life saying Not you SHAKSPERE mister Arnold was busy at home for a few days after this and Hugh and Harry had to go out alone One day when the wind was rather cold they took refuge in the barn for it was part of Hugh s especial care that Harry should be rendered hardy by never being exposed to more than he could bear without a sense of suffering As soon as the boy began to feel fatigue or cold or any other discomfort his tutor took measures accordingly Harry would have crept into the straw house but Hugh said pulling a book out of his pocket I have a poem here for you Harry I want to read it to you now and we can t see in there They threw themselves down on the straw and Hugh opening a volume of Robert Browning s Poems read the famous ride from Ghent to Aix He knew the poem well and read it well Harry was in raptures I wish I could read that as you do said he Try said Hugh Harry tried the first verse and threw the book down in disgust with himself Why cannot I read it said he Because you can t ride I could ride if I had such a horse as that to ride upon But you could never have such a horse as that except you could ride and ride well first After that there is no saying but you might get one You might in fact train one for yourself till from being a little foal it became your own wonderful horse Oh that would be delightful Will you teach me horses as well mister Sutherland Perhaps I will That evening at dinner Hugh said to mister Arnold Could you let me have a horse to morrow morning mister Arnold mister Arnold stared a little as he always did at anything new But Hugh went on Harry and I want to have a ride to morrow and I expect we shall like it so much that we shall want to ride very often Yes that we shall cried Harry Could not mister Sutherland have your white mare Euphra said mister Arnold reconciled at once to the proposal I would rather not if you don t mind uncle My Fatty is not used to such a burden as I fear mister Sutherland would prove She drops a little now on the hard road The fact was Euphra would want Fatima Well Harry said mister Arnold graciously pleased to be facetious don t you think your Welsh dray horse could carry mister Sutherland Ha ha ha Papa do you know mister Sutherland set him up on his hind legs yesterday and made him walk on them like a dancing dog He was going to lift him but he kicked about so when he felt himself leaving the ground that he tumbled mister Sutherland into the horse trough Even the solemn face of the butler relaxed into a smile but mister Arnold s clouded instead His boy s tutor ought to be a gentleman Wasn t it fun mister Sutherland It was to you you little rogue said Sutherland laughing And how you did run home dripping like a water cart and all the dogs after you mister Arnold s monotonous solemnity soon checked Harry s prattle I will see mister Sutherland what I can do to mount you I don t care what it is said Hugh who though by no means a thorough horseman had been from boyhood in the habit of mounting everything in the shape of a horse that he could lay hands upon from a cart horse upwards and downwards There s an old bay that would carry me very well That is my own horse mister Sutherland This stopped the conversation in that direction But next morning after breakfast an excellent chestnut horse was waiting at the door along with Harry s new pony mister Arnold would see them go off This did not exactly suit Miss Cameron but if she frowned it was when nobody saw her Hugh put Harry up himself told him to stick fast with his knees and then mounted his chestnut As they trotted slowly down the avenue Euphrasia heard mister Arnold say to himself The fellow sits well at all events She took care to make herself agreeable to Hugh by reporting this with the omission of the initiatory epithet however Harry returned from his ride rather tired but in high spirits Oh Euphra he cried mister Sutherland is such a rider He jumps hedges and ditches and everything And he has promised to teach me and my pony to jump too And if I am not too tired we are to begin to morrow out on the common Oh jolly The little fellow s heart was full of the sense of growing life and strength and Hugh was delighted with his own success He caught sight of a serpentine motion in Euphra s eyebrows as she bent her face again over the work from which she had lifted it on their entrance He addressed her You will be glad to hear that Harry has ridden like a man I am glad to hear it Harry Why did she reply to the subject of the remark and not to the speaker Hugh perplexed himself in vain to answer this question but a very small amount of experience would have made him able to understand at once as much of her behaviour as was genuine At luncheon she spoke only in reply and then so briefly as not to afford the smallest peg on which to hang a response What can be the matter thought Hugh What a peculiar creature she is But after what has passed between us I can t stand this When dinner was over that evening she rose as usual and left the room followed by Hugh and Harry but as soon as they were in the drawing room she left it and returning to the dining room resumed her seat at the table Take a glass of claret Euphra dear said mister Arnold I will if you please uncle I should like it I have seldom a minute with you alone now Evidently flattered mister Arnold poured out a glass of claret rose and carried it to his niece himself and then took a chair beside her Thank you dear uncle she said with one of her bewitching flashes of smile Harry has been getting on bravely with his riding has he not she continued So it would appear Harry had been full of the story of the day at the dinner table where he still continued to present himself for his father would not be satisfied without him It was certainly good moral training for the boy to sit there almost without eating and none the worse that he found it rather hard sometimes He talked much more freely now and asked the servants for anything he wanted without referring to Euphra Now and then he would glance at her as if afraid of offending her but the cords which bound him to her were evidently relaxing and she saw it plainly enough though she made no reference to the unpleasing fact I am only a little fearful uncle lest mister Sutherland should urge the boy to do more than his strength will admit of He is exceedingly kind to him but he has evidently never known what weakness is himself True there is danger of that But you see he has taken him so entirely into his own hands I don t seem to be allowed a word in the matter of his education any more mister Arnold spoke with the peevishness of weak importance I wish you would take care that he does not carry things too far Euphra This was just what Euphra wanted I think if you do not disapprove uncle I will have Fatima saddled to morrow morning and go with them myself Thank you my love I shall be much obliged to you The glass of claret was soon finished after this A little more conversation about nothing followed and Euphra rose the second time and returned to the drawing room She found it unoccupied She sat down to the piano and sang song after song Scotch Italian and Bohemian But Hugh did not make his appearance The fact was he was busy writing to his mother whom he had rather neglected since he came Writing to her made him think of David and he began a letter to him too but it was never finished and never sent He did not return to the drawing room that evening Indeed except for a short time while mister Arnold was drinking his claret he seldom showed himself there Had Euphra repelled him too much hurt him She would make up for it to morrow Breakfast was scarcely over when the chestnut and the pony passed the window accompanied by a lovely little Arab mare broad chested and light limbed with a wonderfully small head She was white as snow with keen dark eyes Her curb rein was red instead of white Hearing their approach and begging her uncle to excuse her Euphra rose from the table and left the room but re appeared in a wonderfully little while in a well fitted riding habit of black velvet with a belt of dark red leather clasping a waist of the roundest and smallest Her little hat likewise black had a single long white feather laid horizontally within the upturned brim and drooping over it at the back Her white mare would be just the right pedestal for the dusky figure black eyes tawny skin and all As she stood ready to mount and Hugh was approaching to put her up she called the groom seemed just to touch his hand and was in the saddle in a moment foot in stirrup and skirt falling over it Hugh thought she was carrying out the behaviour of yesterday and was determined to ask her what it meant The little Arab began to rear and plunge with pride as soon as she felt her mistress on her back but she seemed as much at home as if she had been on the music stool and patted her arching neck talking to her in the same tone almost in which she had addressed the flowers Be quiet Fatty dear you re frightening mister Sutherland But Hugh seeing the next moment that she was in no danger sprang into his saddle Away they went Fatima infusing life and frolic into the equine as Euphra into the human portion of the cavalcade Having reached the common out of sight of the house Miss Cameron instead of looking after Harry lest he should have too much exercise scampered about like a wild girl jumping everything that came in her way and so exciting Harry s pony that it was almost more than he could do to manage it till at last Hugh had to beg her to go more quietly for Harry s sake She drew up alongside of them at once and made her mare stand as still as she could while Harry made his first essay upon a little ditch After crossing it two or three times he gathered courage and setting his pony at a larger one beyond bounded across it beautifully Bravo Harry cried both Euphra and Hugh Harry galloped back and over it again then came up to them with a glow of proud confidence on his pale face You ll be a horseman yet Harry said Hugh I hope so said Harry in an aspiring tone which greatly satisfied his tutor The boy s spirit was evidently reviving Euphra must have managed him ill Yet she was not in the least effeminate herself It puzzled Hugh a good deal But he did not think about it long for Harry cantering away in front he had an opportunity of saying to Euphra Are you offended with me Miss Cameron Offended with you What do you mean A girl like me offended with a man like you She looked two and twenty as she spoke but even at that she was older than Hugh He however certainly looked considerably older than he really was What makes you think so she added turning her face towards him You would not speak to me when we came home yesterday Not speak to you I had a little headache and perhaps I was a little sullen from having been in such bad company all the morning What company had you asked Hugh gazing at her in some surprise My own answered she with a lovely laugh thrown full in his face Then after a pause Let me advise you if you want to live in peace not to embark on that ocean of discovery What ocean what discovery asked Hugh bewildered and still gazing The troubled ocean of ladies looks she replied You will never be able to live in the same house with one of our kind if it be necessary to your peace to find out what every expression that puzzles you may mean I did not intend to be inquisitive it really troubled me There it is You must never mind us We show so much sooner than men but take warning there is no making out what it is we do show Your faces are legible ours are so scratched and interlined that you had best give up at once the idea of deciphering them Hugh could not help looking once more at the smooth simple naive countenance shining upon him There you are at it again she said blushing a little and turning her head away Well to comfort you I will confess I was rather cross yesterday because because you seemed to have been quite happy with only one of your pupils As she spoke the words she gave Fatima the rein and bounded off overtaking Harry s pony in a moment Nor did she leave her cousin during all the rest of their ride Most women in whom the soul has anything like a chance of reaching the windows are more or less beautiful in their best moments Euphra s best was when she was trying to fascinate Then she was fascinating During the first morning that Hugh spent at Arnstead she had probably been making up her mind whether between her and Hugh it was to be war to the knife or fascination The latter had carried the day and was now carrying him But had she calculated that fascination may re act as well Hugh s heart bounded like her Arab steed as she uttered the words last recorded He gave his chestnut the rein in his turn to overtake her but Fatima s canter quickened into a gallop and inspirited by her companionship and the fact that their heads were turned stablewards Harry s pony one of the quickest of its race laid itself to the ground and kept up taking three strides for Fatty s two so that Hugh never got within three lengths of them till they drew rein at the hall door where the grooms were waiting them Euphra was off her mare in a moment and had almost reached her own room before Hugh and Harry had crossed the hall She came down to luncheon in a white muslin dress with the smallest possible red spot in it and taking her place at the table seemed to Hugh to have put off not only her riding habit but the self that was in it as well for she chatted away in the most unconcerned and easy manner possible as if she had not been out of her room all the morning She had ridden so hard that she had left her last speech in the middle of the common and its mood with it and there seemed now no likelihood of either finding its way home CHAPTER VII THE PICTURE GALLERY the house is crencled to and fro And hath so queint waies for to go For it is shapen as the mase is wrought CHAUCER Legend of Ariadne Luncheon over and Harry dismissed as usual to lie down Miss Cameron said to Hugh You have never been over the old house yet I believe mister Sutherland Would you not like to see it I should indeed said Hugh It is what I have long hoped for and have often been on the point of begging Come then I will be your guide if you will trust yourself with a madcap like me in the solitudes of the old hive Lead on to the family vaults if you will said Hugh That might be possible too from below We are not so very far from them Even within the house there is an old chapel and some monuments worth looking at Shall we take it last As you think best answered Hugh She rose and rang the bell When it was answered Jacob she said get me the keys of the house from missus Horton Jacob vanished and reappeared with a huge bunch of keys She took them Thank you They should not be allowed to get quite rusty Jacob Please Miss missus Horton desired me to say she would have seen to them if she had known you wanted them Oh never mind Just tell my maid to bring me an old pair of gloves Jacob went and the maid came with the required armour Now mister Sutherland Jane you will come with us No you need not take the keys I will find those I want as we go She unlocked a door in the corner of the hall which Hugh had never seen open Passing through a long low passage they came to a spiral staircase of stone up which they went arriving at another wide hall very dusty but in perfect repair Hugh asked if there was not some communication between this hall and the great oak staircase Yes answered Euphra but this is the more direct way As she said this he felt somehow as if she cast on him one of her keenest glances but the place was very dusky and he stood in a spot where the light fell upon him from an opening in a shutter while she stood in deep shadow Jane open that shutter The girl obeyed and the entering light revealed the walls covered with paintings many of them apparently of no value yet adding much to the effect of the place Seeing that Hugh was at once attracted by the pictures Euphra said Perhaps you would like to see the picture gallery first Hugh assented Euphra chose key after key and opened door after door till they came into a long gallery well lighted from each end The windows were soon opened mister Arnold is very proud of his pictures especially of his family portraits but he is content with knowing he has them and never visits them except to show them or perhaps once or twice a year when something or other keeps him at home for a day without anything particular to do In glancing over the portraits some of them by famous masters Hugh s eyes were arrested by a blonde beauty in the dress of the time of Charles II There was such a reality of self willed boldness as well as something worse in her face that though arrested by the picture Hugh felt ashamed of looking at it in the presence of Euphra and her maid The pictured woman almost put him out of countenance and yet at the same time fascinated him Dragging his eyes from it he saw that Jane had turned her back upon it while Euphra regarded it steadily Open that opposite window Jane said she there is not light enough on this portrait Jane obeyed While she did so Hugh caught a glimpse of her face and saw that the formerly rosy girl was deadly pale He said to Euphra Your maid seems ill Miss Cameron Jane what is the matter with you She did not reply but leaning against the wall seemed ready to faint The place is close said her mistress Go into the next room there she pointed to a door and open the window You will soon be well If you please Miss I would rather stay with you This place makes me feel that strange She had come but lately and had never been over the house before Nonsense said Miss Cameron looking at her sharply What do you mean Please don t be angry Miss but the first night e er I slept here I saw that very lady Saw that lady Well Miss I mean I dreamed that I saw her and I remembered her the minute I see her up there and she give me a turn like I m all right now Miss Euphra fixed her eyes on her and kept them fixed till she was very nearly all wrong again She turned as pale as before and began to draw her breath hard You silly goose said Euphra and withdrew her eyes upon which the girl began to breathe more freely Hugh was making some wise remarks in his own mind on the unsteady condition of a nature in which the imagination predominates over the powers of reflection when Euphra turned to him and began to tell him that that was the picture of her three or four times great grandmother painted by Sir Peter Lely just after she was married Isn t she fair said she She turned nun at last they say She is more fair than honest thought Hugh It would take a great deal of nun to make her into a saint But he only said She is more beautiful than lovely What was her name If you mean her maiden name it was Halkar Lady Euphrasia Halkar named after me you see She had foreign blood in her of course and to tell the truth there were strange stories told of her of more sorts than one I know nothing of her family It was never heard of in England I believe till after the Restoration All the time Euphra was speaking Hugh was being perplexed with that most annoying of perplexities the flitting phantom of a resemblance which he could not catch He was forced to dismiss it for the present utterly baffled Were you really named after her Miss Cameron No no It is a family name with us But indeed I may be said to be named after her for she was the first of us who bore it You don t seem to like the portrait I do not but I cannot help looking at it for all that I am so used to the lady s face said Euphra that it makes no impression on me of any sort But it is said she added glancing at the maid who stood at some distance looking uneasily about her and as she spoke she lowered her voice to a whisper it is said she cannot lie still Cannot lie still What do you mean I mean down there in the chapel she answered pointing The Celtic nerves of Hugh shuddered Euphra laughed and her voice echoed in silvery billows that broke on the faces of the men and women of old time that had owned the whole whose lives had flowed and ebbed in varied tides through the ancient house who had married and been given in marriage and gone down to the chapel below below the prayers and below the psalms and made a Sunday of all the week Ashamed of his feeling of passing dismay Hugh said just to say something What a strange ornament that is Is it a brooch or a pin No I declare it is a ring large enough for three cardinals and worn on her thumb It seems almost to sparkle Is it ruby or carbuncle or what I don t know some clumsy old thing answered Euphra carelessly Oh I see said Hugh it is not a red stone The glow is only a reflection from part of her dress It is as clear as a diamond But that is impossible such a size There seems to me something curious about it and the longer I look at it the more strange it appears Euphra stole another of her piercing glances at him but said nothing Surely Hugh went on a ring like that would hardly be likely to be lost out of the family Your uncle must have it somewhere Euphra laughed but this laugh was very different from the last It rattled rather than rang You are wonderfully taken with a bauble for a man of letters that is mister Sutherland The stone may have been carried down any one of the hundred streams into which a family river is always dividing It is a very remarkable ornament for a lady s finger notwithstanding said Hugh smiling in his turn But we shall never get through the pictures at this rate remarked Euphra and going on she directed Hugh s attention now to this now to that portrait saying who each was and mentioning anything remarkable in the history of their originals She manifested a thorough acquaintance with the family story and made in fact an excellent show woman Having gone nearly to the other end of the gallery This door said she stopping at one and turning over the keys leads to one of the oldest portions of the house the principal room in which is said to have belonged especially to the lady over there As she said this she fixed her eyes once more on the maid Oh don t ye now Miss interrupted Jane Hannah do say as how a whitey blue light shines in the window of a dark night sometimes that lady s window you know Miss Don t ye open the door pray Miss Jane seemed on the point of falling into the same terror as before Really Jane said her mistress I am ashamed of you and of myself for having such silly servants about me I beg your pardon Miss but So mister Sutherland and I must give up our plan of going over the house because my maid s nerves are too delicate to permit her to accompany us For shame Oh do ye now go without me cried the girl clasping her hands And you will wait here till we come back Oh don t ye leave me here Just show me the way out And once more she turned pale as death mister Sutherland I am very sorry but we must put off the rest of our ramble till another time I am like Hamlet very vilely attended as you see Come then you foolish girl she added more mildly The poor maid what with terror of Lady Euphrasia and respect for her mistress was in a pitiable condition of moral helplessness She seemed almost too frightened to walk behind them But if she had been in front it would have been no better for like other ghost fearers she seemed to feel very painfully that she had no eyes in her back They returned as they came and Jane receiving the keys to take to the housekeeper darted away When she reached missus Horton s room she sank on a chair in hysterics I must get rid of that girl I fear said Miss Cameron leading the way to the library she will infect the whole household with her foolish terrors We shall not hear the last of this for some time to come We had a fit of it the same year I came and I suppose the time has come round for another attack of the same epidemic What is there about the room to terrify the poor thing Oh they say it is haunted that is all Was there ever an old house anywhere over Europe especially an old family house but was said to be haunted Here the story centres in that room or at least in that room and the avenue in front of its windows Is that the avenue called the Ghost s Walk Yes Who told you Harry would not let me cross it Poor boy This is really too bad He cannot stand anything of that kind I am sure Those servants Oh I hope we shall soon get him too well to be frightened at anything Are these places said to be haunted by any particular ghost Yes By Lady Euphrasia Rubbish Had Hugh possessed a yet keener perception of resemblance he would have seen that the phantom likeness which haunted him in the portrait of Euphrasia Halkar was that of Euphrasia Cameron by his side all the time But the mere difference of complexion was sufficient to throw him out insignificant difference as that is beside the correspondence of features and their relations Euphra herself was perfectly aware of the likeness but had no wish that Hugh should discover it As if the likeness however had been dimly identified by the unconscious part of his being he sat in one corner of the library sofa with his eyes fixed on the face of Euphra as she sat in the other Presently he was made aware of his unintentional rudeness by seeing her turn pale as death and sink back in the sofa In a moment she started up and began pacing about the room rubbing her eyes and temples He was bewildered and alarmed Miss Cameron are you ill he exclaimed She gave a kind of half hysterical laugh and said No nothing worth speaking of I felt a little faint that was all I am better now She turned full towards him and seemed to try to look all right but there was a kind of film over the clearness of her black eyes I fear you have headache A little but it is nothing I will go and lie down Do pray else you will not be well enough to appear at dinner She retired and Hugh joined Harry Euphra had another glass of claret with her uncle that evening in order to give her report of the morning s ride Really there is not much to be afraid of uncle He takes very good care of Harry To be sure I had occasion several times to check him a little but he has this good quality in addition to a considerable aptitude for teaching that he perceives a hint and takes it at once Knowing her uncle s formality and preference for precise and judicial modes of expression Euphra modelled her phrase to his mind I am glad he has your good opinion so far Euphra for I confess there is something about the youth that pleases me I was afraid at first that I might be annoyed by his overstepping the true boundaries of his position in my family he seems to have been in good society too But your assurance that he can take a hint lessens my apprehension considerably To morrow I will ask him to resume his seat after dessert This was not exactly the object of Euphra s qualified commendation of Hugh But she could not help it now I think however if you approve uncle that it will be more prudent to keep a little watch over the riding for a while I confess too I should be glad of a little more of that exercise than I have had for some time I found my seat not very secure to day Very desirable on both considerations my love And so the conference ended CHAPTER VIII NEST BUILDING If you will have a tree bear more fruit than it hath used to do it is not anything you can do to the boughs but it is the stirring of the earth and putting new mould about the roots that must work it LORD BACON S Advancement of Learning b ii In a short time Harry s health was so much improved and consequently the strength and activity of his mind so much increased that Hugh began to give him more exact mental operations to perform But as if he had been a reader of Lord Bacon which as yet he was not and had learned from him that wonder is the seed of knowledge he came by a kind of sympathetic instinct to the same conclusion practically in the case of Harry He tried to wake a question in him by showing him something that would rouse his interest The reply to this question might be the whole rudiments of a science Things themselves should lead to the science of them If things are not interesting in themselves how can any amount of knowledge about them be To be sure there is such a thing as a purely or abstractly intellectual interest the pleasure of the mere operation of the intellect upon the signs of things but this must spring from a highly exercised intellectual condition and is not to be expected before the pleasures of intellectual motion have been experienced through the employment of its means for other ends Whether this is a higher condition or not is open to much disquisition One day Hugh was purposely engaged in taking the altitude of the highest turret of the house with an old quadrant he had found in the library when Harry came up What are you doing big brother said he for now that he was quite at home with Hugh there was a wonderful mixture of familiarity and respect in him that was quite bewitching Finding out how high your house is little brother answered Hugh How can you do it with that thing Will it measure the height of other things besides the house Yes the height of a mountain or anything you like Do show me how Hugh showed him as much of it as he could But I don t understand it Oh that is quite another thing To do that you must learn a great many things Euclid to begin with That very afternoon Harry began Euclid and soon found quite enough of interest on the road to the quadrant to prevent him from feeling any tediousness in its length Of an afternoon Hugh had taken to reading Shakspere to Harry Euphra was always a listener On one occasion Harry said I am so sorry mister Sutherland but I don t understand the half of it Sometimes when Euphra and you are laughing and sometimes when Euphra is crying added he looking at her slyly I can t understand what it is all about Am I so very stupid mister Sutherland And he almost cried himself Not a bit of it Harry my boy only you must learn a great many other things first How can I learn them I am willing to learn anything I don t find it tire me now as it used There are many things necessary to understand Shakspere that I cannot teach you and that some people never learn Most of them will come of themselves But of one thing you may be sure Harry that if you learn anything whatever it be you are so far nearer to understanding Shakspere The same afternoon when Harry had waked from his siesta upon which Hugh still insisted they went out for a walk in the fields The sun was half way down the sky but very hot and sultry I wish we had our cave of straw to creep into now said Harry I felt exactly like the little field mouse you read to me about in Burns s poems when we went in that morning and found it all torn up and half of it carried away We have no place to go to now for a peculiar own place and the consequence is you have not told me any stories about the Romans for a whole week Well Harry is there any way of making another There s no more straw lying about that I know of answered Harry and it won t do to pull the inside out of a rick I am afraid But don t you think it would be pleasant to have a change now and as we have lived underground or say in the snow like the North people try living in the air like some of the South people Delightful cried Harry A balloon No not quite that Don t you think a nest would do Up in a tree Yes Harry darted off for a run as the only means of expressing his delight When he came back he said When shall we begin mister Sutherland We will go and look for a place at once but I am not quite sure when we shall begin yet I shall find out to night though They left the fields and went into the woods in the neighbourhood of the house at the back Here the trees had grown to a great size some of them being very old indeed They soon fixed upon a grotesque old oak as a proper tree in which to build their nest and Harry who as well as Hugh had a good deal of constructiveness in his nature was so delighted that the heat seemed to have no more influence upon him and Hugh fearful of the reaction was compelled to restrain his gambols Pursuing their way through the dark warp of the wood with its golden weft of crossing sunbeams Hugh began to tell Harry the story of the killing of Caesar by Brutus and the rest filling up the account with portions from Shakspere Fortunately he was able to give the orations of Brutus and Antony in full Harry was in ecstasy over the eloquence of the two men Well what language do you think they spoke Harry said Hugh Why said Harry hesitating I suppose then as if a sudden light broke upon him Latin of course How strange Why strange That such men should talk such a dry unpleasant language I allow it is a difficult language Harry and very ponderous and mechanical but not necessarily dry or unpleasant The Romans you know were particularly fond of law in everything and so they made a great many laws for their language or rather it grew so because they were of that sort It was like their swords and armour generally not very graceful but very strong like their architecture too Harry Nobody can ever understand what a people is without knowing its language It is not only that we find all these stories about them in their language but the language itself is more like them than anything else can be Besides Harry I don t believe you know anything about Latin yet I know all the declensions and conjugations But don t you think it must have been a very different thing to hear it spoken Yes to be sure and by such men But how ever could they speak it They spoke it just as you do English It was as natural to them But you cannot say you know anything about it till you read what they wrote in it till your ears delight in the sound of their poetry Poetry Yes and beautiful letters and wise lessons and histories and plays Oh I should like you to teach me Will it be as hard to learn always as it is now Certainly not I am sure you will like it When will you begin me To morrow And if you get on pretty well we will begin our nest too in the afternoon Oh how kind you are I will try very hard I am sure you will Harry Next morning accordingly Hugh did begin him after a fashion of his own namely by giving him a short simple story to read finding out all the words with him in the dictionary and telling him what the terminations of the words signified for he found that he had already forgotten a very great deal of what according to Euphra he had been thoroughly taught No one can remember what is entirely uninteresting to him Hugh was as precise about the grammar of a language as any Scotch Professor of Humanity old Prosody not excepted but he thought it time enough to begin to that when some interest in the words themselves should have been awakened in the mind of his pupil He hated slovenliness as much as any one but the question was how best to arrive at thoroughness in the end without losing the higher objects of study and not how at all risks to commence teaching the lesson of thoroughness at once and so waste on the shape of a pin head the intellect which properly directed might arrive at the far more minute accuracies of a steam engine The fault of Euphra in teaching Harry had been that with a certain kind of tyrannical accuracy she had determined to have the thing done not merely decently and in order but prudishly and pedantically so that she deprived progress of the pleasure which ought naturally to attend it She spoiled the walk to the distant outlook by stopping at every step not merely to pick flowers but to botanise on the weeds and to calculate the distance advanced It is quite true that we ought to learn to do things irrespective of the reward but plenty of opportunities will be given in the progress of life and in much higher kinds of action to exercise our sense of duty in severe loneliness We have no right to turn intellectual exercises into pure operations of conscience these ought to involve essential duty although no doubt there is plenty of room for mingling duty with those while on the other hand the highest act of suffering self denial is not without its accompanying reward Neither is there any exercise of the higher intellectual powers in learning the mere grammar of a language necessary as it is for a means And language having been made before grammar a language must be in some measure understood before its grammar can become intelligible Harry s weak though true and keen life could not force its way into any channel His was a nature essentially dependent on sympathy It could flow into truth through another loving mind left to itself it could not find the way and sank in the dry sand of ennui and self imposed obligations Euphra was utterly incapable of understanding him and the boy had been dying for lack of sympathy though neither he nor any one about him had suspected the fact There was a strange disproportion between his knowledge and his capacity He was able when his attention was directed his gaze fixed and his whole nature supported by Hugh to see deep into many things and his remarks were often strikingly original but he was one of the most ignorant boys for his years that Hugh had ever come across A long and severe illness when he was just passing into boyhood had thrown him back far into his childhood and he was only now beginning to show that he had anything of the boy life in him Hence arose that unequal development which has been sufficiently evident in the story In the afternoon they went to the wood and found the tree they had chosen for their nest To Harry s intense admiration Hugh as he said went up the tree like a squirrel only he was too big for a bear even Just one layer of foliage above the lowest branches he came to a place where he thought there was a suitable foundation for the nest From the ground Harry could scarcely see him as with an axe which he had borrowed for the purpose for there was a carpenter s work shop on the premises he cut away several small branches from three of the principal ones and so had these three as rafters ready dressed and placed for the foundation of the nest Having made some measurements he descended and repairing with Harry to the work shop procured some boarding and some tools which Harry assisted in carrying to the tree Ascending again and drawing up his materials by the help of Harry with a piece of string Hugh in a very little while had a level floor four feet square in the heart of the oak tree quite invisible from below buried in a cloud of green leaves For greater safety he fastened ropes as handrails all around it from one branch to another And now nothing remained but to construct a bench to sit on and such a stair as Harry could easily climb The boy was quite restless with anxiety to get up and see the nest and kept calling out constantly to know if he might not come up yet At length Hugh allowed him to try but the poor boy was not half strong enough to climb the tree without help So Hugh descended and with his aid Harry was soon standing on the new built platform I feel just like an eagle he cried but here his voice faltered and he was silent What is the matter Harry said his tutor Oh nothing replied he only I didn t exactly know whereabouts we were till I got up here Whereabouts are we then Close to the end of the Ghost s Walk But you don t mind that now surely Harry No sir that is not so much as I used Shall I take all this down again and build our nest somewhere else Oh no if you don t think it matters It would be a great pity after you have taken so much trouble with it Besides I shall never be here without you and I do not think I should be afraid of the ghost herself if you were with me Yet Harry shuddered involuntarily at the thought of his own daring speech Very well Harry my boy we will finish it here Now if you stand there I will fasten a plank across here between these two stumps no that won t do exactly I must put a piece on to this one to raise it to a level with the other then we shall have a seat in a few minutes Hammer and nails were busy again and in a few minutes they sat down to enjoy the soft pipling cold which swung all the leaves about like little trap doors that opened into the Infinite Harry was highly contented He drew a deep breath of satisfaction as looking above and beneath and all about him he saw that they were folded in an almost impenetrable net of foliage through which nothing could steal into their sanctuary save the chartered libertine the air and a few stray beams of the setting sun filtering through the multitudinous leaves from which they caught a green tint as they passed Fancy yourself a fish said Hugh in the depth of a cavern of sea weed which floats about in the slow swinging motion of the heavy waters What a funny notion Not so absurd as you may think Harry for just as some fishes crawl about on the bottom of the sea so do we men at the bottom of an ocean of air which if it be a thinner one is certainly a deeper one Then the birds are the swimming fishes are they not Yes to be sure And you and I are two mermen doing what Waiting for mother mermaid to give us our dinner I am getting hungry But it will be a long time before a mermaid gets up here I am afraid That reminds me said Hugh that I must build a stair for you Master Harry for you are not merman enough to get up with a stroke of your scaly tail So here goes You can sit there till I fetch you Nailing a little rude bracket here and there on the stem of the tree just where Harry could avail himself of hand hold as well Hugh had soon finished a strangely irregular staircase which it took Harry two or three times trying to learn quite off CHAPTER IX GEOGRAPHY POINT 
2122-149350-0000	train-other-500	I will fetch you a tooth picker now from the farthest inch of Asia bring you the length of Prester John s foot fetch you a hair off the great Cham s beard do you any embassage to the Pigmies Much Ado about Nothing
2122-149350-0001	train-other-500	The next day after dinner mister Arnold said to the tutor Well mister Sutherland how does Harry get on with his geography mister Arnold be it understood had a weakness for geography
2122-149350-0002	train-other-500	We have not done anything at that yet mister Arnold Not done anything at geography And the boy getting quite robust now I am astonished mister Sutherland Why when he was a mere child he could repeat all the counties of England
2122-149350-0003	train-other-500	Perhaps that may be the reason for the decided distaste he shows for it now mister Arnold But I will begin to teach him at once if you desire it I do desire it mister Sutherland
2122-149350-0004	train-other-500	A thorough geographical knowledge is essential to the education of a gentleman Ask me any question you please mister Sutherland on the map of the world or any of its divisions Hugh asked a few questions which mister Arnold answered at once
2122-149350-0005	train-other-500	Pooh pooh said he this is mere child s play Let me ask you some mister Sutherland His very first question posed Hugh whose knowledge in this science was not by any means minute
2122-149350-0006	train-other-500	I fear I am no gentleman said he laughing but I can at least learn as well as teach We shall begin to morrow What books have you Oh no books if you please just yet If you are satisfied with Harry s progress so far
2122-149350-0007	train-other-500	let me have my own way in this too But geography does not seem your strong point No but I may be able to teach it all the better from feeling the difficulties of a learner myself Well you shall have a fair trial
2122-149350-0008	train-other-500	Next morning Hugh and Harry went out for a walk to the top of a hill in the neighbourhood When they reached it Hugh took a small compass from his pocket and set it on the ground contemplating it and the horizon alternately
2122-149350-0009	train-other-500	What are you doing mister Sutherland I am trying to find the exact line that would go through my home said he Is that funny little thing able to tell you Yes
2122-149350-0010	train-other-500	this along with other things Isn t it curious Harry to have in my pocket a little thing with a kind of spirit in it that understands the spirit that is in the big world and always points to its North Pole Explain it to me
2122-149350-0011	train-other-500	It is nearly as much a mystery to me as to you Where is the North Pole Look the little thing points to it But I will turn it away Oh it won t go It goes back and back do what I will
2122-149350-0012	train-other-500	Yes it will if you turn it away all day long Look Harry if you were to go straight on in this direction you would come to a Laplander harnessing his broad horned reindeer to his sledge He s at it now I daresay
2122-149350-0013	train-other-500	If you were to go in this line exactly you would go through the smoke and fire of a burning mountain in a land of ice If you were to go this way straight on you would find yourself in the middle of a forest with a lion glaring at your feet
2122-149350-0014	train-other-500	for it is dark night there now and so hot And over there straight on there is such a lovely sunset The top of a snowy mountain is all pink with light though the sun is down oh such colours all about like fairyland
2122-149350-0015	train-other-500	And there there is a desert of sand and a camel dying and all his companions just disappearing on the horizon And there there is an awful sea without a boat to be seen on it dark and dismal with huge rocks all about it
2122-149350-0016	train-other-500	and waste borders of sand so dreadful How do you know all this mister Sutherland You have never walked along those lines I know for you couldn t Geography has taught me No mister Sutherland said Harry incredulously
2122-149350-0017	train-other-500	Well shall we travel along this line just across that crown of trees on the hill Yes do let us Then said Hugh drawing a telescope from his pocket this hill is henceforth Geography Point
2122-149350-0018	train-other-500	and all the world lies round about it Do you know we are in the very middle of the earth Are we indeed Yes Don t you know any point you like to choose on a ball is the middle of it
2122-149350-0019	train-other-500	Oh yes of course Very well What lies at the bottom of the hill down there Arnstead to be sure And what beyond there I don t know Look through here
2122-149350-0020	train-other-500	Oh that must be the village we rode to yesterday I forget the name of it Hugh told him the name and then made him look with the telescope all along the receding line to the trees on the opposite hill Just as he caught them a voice beside them said
2122-149350-0021	train-other-500	What are you about Harry Hugh felt a glow of pleasure as the voice fell on his ear It was Euphra s Oh replied Harry mister Sutherland is teaching me geography with a telescope It s such fun
2122-149350-0022	train-other-500	He s a wonderful tutor that of yours Harry Yes isn t he just But Harry went on turning to Hugh what are we to do now We can t get farther for that hill
2122-149350-0023	train-other-500	Ah we must apply to your papa now to lend us some of his beautiful maps They will teach us what lies beyond that hill And then we can read in some of his books about the places and so go on and on till we reach the beautiful wide restless sea
2122-149350-0024	train-other-500	over which we must sail in spite of wind and tide straight on and on till we come to land again But we must make a great many such journeys before we really know what sort of a place we are living in and we shall have ever so many things to learn that will surprise us
2122-149350-0025	train-other-500	Oh it will be nice cried Harry After a little more geographical talk they put up their instruments and began to descend the hill Harry was in no need of Hugh s back now but Euphra was in need of his hand
none	none	 In fact she appealed for its support 
2122-149350-0026	train-other-500	How awkward of me I am stumbling over the heather shamefully She was in fact stumbling over her own dress which she would not hold up Hugh offered his hand and her small one seemed quite content to be swallowed up in his large one
2122-149350-0027	train-other-500	Why do you never let me put you on your horse said Hugh You always manage to prevent me somehow or other
none	none	 The last time I just turned my head and behold when I looked you were gathering your reins It is only a trick of independence Hugh 
2122-149350-0028	train-other-500	mister Sutherland I beg your pardon I can make no excuse for Euphra for she had positively never heard him called Hugh there was no one to do so But the slip had not therefore the less effect
2122-149350-0029	train-other-500	for it sounded as if she had been saying his name over and over again to herself I beg your pardon repeated Euphra hastily for as Hugh did not reply she feared her arrow had swerved from its mark
2122-149350-0030	train-other-500	For a sweet fault Euphra I beg your pardon Miss Cameron You punish me with forgiveness returned she with one of her sweetest looks Hugh could not help pressing the little hand
2122-149350-0031	train-other-500	Was the pressure returned So slight so airy was the touch that it might have been only the throb of his own pulses all consciously vital about the wonderful woman hand that rested in his
2122-149350-0032	train-other-500	If he had claimed it she might easily have denied it so ethereal and uncertain was it Yet he believed in it He never dreamed that she was exercising her skill upon him What could be her object in bewitching a poor tutor Ah what indeed
2122-149350-0033	train-other-500	Meantime this much is certain that she was drawing Hugh closer and closer to her side that a soothing dream of delight had begun to steal over his spirit soon to make it toss in feverous unrest
2122-149350-0034	train-other-500	as the first effects of some poisons are like a dawn of tenfold strength The mountain wind blew from her to him sometimes sweeping her garments about him and bathing him in their faint sweet odours
2122-149350-0035	train-other-500	odours which somehow seemed to belong to her whom they had only last visited sometimes so kindly strong did it blow compelling her or at least giving her excuse enough to leave his hand and cling closely to his arm
2122-149350-0036	train-other-500	A fresh spring began to burst from the very bosom of what had seemed before a perfect summer A spring to summer What would the following summer be Ah and what the autumn And what the winter
2122-149350-0037	train-other-500	For if the summer be tenfold summer then must the winter be tenfold winter
none	none	 But though knowledge is good for man foreknowledge is not so good 
2122-149350-0038	train-other-500	And though Love be good a tempest of it in the brain will not ripen the fruits like a soft steady wind or waft the ships home to their desired haven Perhaps what enslaved Hugh most was the feeling that the damsel stooped to him
2122-149350-0039	train-other-500	without knowing that she stooped She seemed to him in every way above him She knew so many things of which he was ignorant could say such lovely things could he did not doubt write lovely verses could sing like an angel
2122-149350-0040	train-other-500	though Scotch songs are not of essentially angelic strain nor Italian songs either in general and they were all that she could do was mistress of a great rich wonderful house with a history
2122-149350-0041	train-other-500	and more than all was or appeared to him to be a beautiful woman It was true that his family was as good as hers but he had disowned his family so his pride declared and the same pride made him
2122-149350-0042	train-other-500	despise his present position and look upon a tutor s employment as as well as other people look upon it as a rather contemptible one in fact
none	none	 especially for a young powerful six foot fellow 
2122-149350-0043	train-other-500	The influence of Euphrasia was not of the best upon him from the first for it had greatly increased this feeling about his occupation It could not affect his feelings towards Harry so the boy did not suffer as yet
2122-149350-0044	train-other-500	But it set him upon a very unprofitable kind of castle building he would be a soldier like his father he would leave Arnstead to revisit it with a sword by his side and a Sir before his name
2122-149350-0045	train-other-500	Sir Hugh Sutherland would be somebody even in the eyes of the master of Arnstead Yes a six foot fellow though he may be sensible in the main is not therefore free from small vanities
none	none	 especially if he be in love But how leave Euphra Again I outrun my story CHAPTER X ITALIAN Per me si va nella citta dolente DANTE Through me thou goest into the city of grief Of necessity with so many shafts opened into the mountain of knowledge a far greater amount of time must be devoted by Harry and his tutor to the working of the mine than they had given hitherto This made a considerable alteration in the intercourse of the youth and the lady for although Euphra was often present during school hours it must be said for Hugh that during those hours he paid almost all his attention to Harry so much of it indeed that perhaps there was not enough left to please the lady But she did not say so She sat beside them in silence occupied with her work and saving up her glances for use Now and then she would read taking an opportunity sometimes but not often when a fitting pause occurred to ask him to explain some passage about which she was in doubt It must be conceded that such passages were well chosen for the purpose for she was too wise to do her own intellect discredit by feigning a difficulty where she saw none intellect being the only gift in others for which she was conscious of any reverence By and by she began to discontinue these visits to the schoolroom Perhaps she found them dull Perhaps but we shall see One morning in the course of their study Euphra not present Hugh had occasion to go from his own room where for the most part they carried on the severer portion of their labours down to the library for a book to enlighten them upon some point on which they were in doubt As he was passing an open door Euphra s voice called him He entered and found himself in her private sitting room He had not known before where it was I beg your pardon mister Sutherland for calling you but I am at this moment in a difficulty I cannot manage this line in the Inferno Do help me She moved the book towards him as he now stood by her side she remaining seated at her table To his mortification he was compelled to confess his utter ignorance of the language Oh I am disappointed said Euphra Not so much as I am replied Hugh But could you spare me one or two of your Italian books With pleasure she answered rising and going to her bookshelves I want only a grammar a dictionary and a New Testament There they are she said taking them down one after the other and bringing them to him I daresay you will soon get up with poor stupid me I shall do my best to get within hearing of your voice at least in which Italian must be lovely No reply but a sudden droop of the head But continued Hugh upon second thoughts lest I should be compelled to remain dumb or else annoy your delicate ear with discordant sounds just give me one lesson in the pronunciation Let me hear you read a little first With all my heart Euphra began and read delightfully for she was an excellent Italian scholar It was necessary that Hugh should look over the book This was difficult while he remained standing as she did not offer to lift it from the table Gradually therefore and hardly knowing how he settled into a chair by her side Half an hour went by like a minute as he listened to the silvery tones of her voice breaking into a bell like sound upon the double consonants of that sweet lady tongue Then it was his turn to read and be corrected and read again and be again corrected Another half hour glided away and yet another But it must be confessed he made good use of the time if only it had been his own to use for at the end of it he could pronounce Italian very tolerably well enough at least to keep him from fixing errors in his pronunciation while studying the language alone Suddenly he came to himself and looked up as from a dream Had she been bewitching him He was in Euphra s room alone with her And the door was shut how or when And he looked at his watch poor little Harry had been waiting his return from the library for the last hour and a half He was conscience stricken He gathered up the books hastily thanked Euphra in the same hurried manner and left the room with considerable disquietude closing the door very gently almost guiltily behind him I am afraid Euphra had been perfectly aware that he knew nothing about Italian Did she see her own eyes shine in the mirror before her as he closed the door Was she in love with him then When Hugh returned with the Italian books instead of the encyclopaedia he had gone to seek he found Harry sitting where he had left him with his arms and head on the table fast asleep Poor boy said Hugh to himself but he could not help feeling glad he was asleep He stole out of the room again passed the fatal door with a longing pain found the volume of his quest in the library and returning with it sat down beside Harry There he sat till he awoke When he did awake at last it was almost time for luncheon The shame faced boy was exceedingly penitent for what was no fault while Hugh could not relieve him by confessing his He could only say It was my fault Harry dear I stayed away too long You were so nicely asleep I would not wake you You will not need a siesta that is all He was ashamed of himself as he uttered the false words to the true hearted child But this alas was not the end of it all Desirous of learning the language but far more desirous of commending himself to Euphra Hugh began in downright earnest That very evening he felt that he had a little hold of the language Harry was left to his own resources Nor was there any harm in this in itself Hugh had a right to part of every day for his own uses But then he had been with Harry almost every evening or a great part of it and the boy missed him much for he was not yet self dependent He would have gone to Euphrasia but somehow she happened to be engaged that evening So he took refuge in the library where in the desolation of his spirit Polexander began almost immediately to exercise its old dreary fascination upon him Although he had not opened the book since Hugh had requested him to put it away yet he had not given up the intention of finishing it some day and now he took it down and opened it listlessly with the intention of doing something towards the gradual redeeming of the pledge he had given to himself But he found it more irksome than ever Still he read on till at length he could discover no meaning at all in the sentences Then he began to doubt whether he had read the words He fixed his attention by main force on every individual word but even then he began to doubt whether he could say he had read the words for he might have missed seeing some of the letters composing each word He grew so nervous and miserable over it almost counting every letter that at last he burst into tears and threw the book down His intellect which in itself was excellent was quite of the parasitic order requiring to wind itself about a stronger intellect to keep itself in the region of fresh air and possible growth Left to itself its weak stem could not raise it above the ground it would grow and mass upon the earth till it decayed and corrupted for lack of room light and air But of course there was no danger in the meantime This was but the passing sadness of an occasional loneliness He crept to Hugh s room and received an invitation to enter in answer to his gentle knock but Hugh was so absorbed in his new study that he hardly took any notice of him and Harry found it almost as dreary here as in the study He would have gone out but a drizzling rain was falling and he shrank into himself at the thought of the Ghost s Walk The dinner bell was a welcome summons Hugh inspirited by the reaction from close attention by the presence of Euphra and by the desire to make himself generally agreeable which sprung from the consciousness of having done wrong talked almost brilliantly delighting Euphra overcoming Harry with reverent astonishment and even interesting slow mister Arnold With the latter Hugh had been gradually becoming a favourite partly because he had discovered in him what he considered high minded sentiments for however stupid and conventional mister Arnold might be he had a foundation of sterling worthiness of character Euphra instead of showing any jealousy of this growing friendliness favoured it in every way in her power and now and then alluded to it in her conversations with Hugh as affording her great satisfaction I am so glad he likes you she would say Why should she be glad thought Hugh This gentle claim of a kind of property in him added considerably to the strength of the attraction that drew him towards her as towards the centre of his spiritual gravitation if indeed that could be called spiritual which had so little of the element of moral or spiritual admiration or even approval mingled with it He never felt that Euphra was good He only felt that she drew him with a vague force of feminine sovereignty a charm which he could no more resist or explain than the iron could the attraction of the lodestone Neither could he have said had he really considered the matter that she was beautiful only that she often very often looked beautiful I suspect if she had been rather ugly it would have been all the same for Hugh He pursued his Italian studies with a singleness of aim and effort that carried him on rapidly He asked no assistance from Euphra and said nothing to her about his progress But he was so absorbed in it that it drew him still further from his pupil Of course he went out with him walking or riding every day that the weather would permit and he had regular school hours with him within doors But during the latter while Harry was doing something on his slate or writing or learning some lesson which kind of work happened oftener now than he could have approved of he would take up his Italian and notwithstanding Harry s quiet hints that he had finished what had been set him remain buried in it for a long time When he woke at last to the necessity of taking some notice of the boy he would only appoint him something else to occupy him again so as to leave himself free to follow his new bent Now and then he would become aware of his blameable neglect and make a feeble struggle to rectify what seemed to be growing into a habit and one of the worst for a tutor but he gradually sank back into the mire for mire it was comforting himself with the resolution that as soon as he was able to read Italian without absolutely spelling his way he would let Euphra see what progress he had made and then return with renewed energy to Harry s education keeping up his own new accomplishment by more moderate exercise therein It must not be supposed however that a long course of time passed in this way At the end of a fortnight he thought he might venture to request Euphra to show him the passage which had perplexed her This time he knew where she was in her own room for his mind had begun to haunt her whereabouts He knocked at her door heard the silvery thrilling happy sound Come in and entered trembling Would you show me the passage in Dante that perplexed you the other day Euphra looked a little surprised but got the book and pointed it out at once Hugh glanced at it His superior acquaintance with the general forms of language enabled him after finding two words in Euphra s larger dictionary to explain it to her immediate satisfaction You astonish me said Euphra Latin gives me an advantage you see said Hugh modestly It seems to be very wonderful nevertheless These were sweet sounds to Hugh s ear He had gained his end And she hers Well she said I have just come upon another passage that perplexes me not a little Will you try your powers upon that for me So saying she proceeded to find it It is school time said Hugh I fear I must not wait now Pooh pooh Don t make a pedagogue of yourself You know you are here more as a guardian big brother you know to the dear child By the way I am rather afraid you are working him a little more than his constitution will stand Do you think so returned Hugh quite willing to be convinced I should be very sorry This is the passage said Euphra Hugh sat down once more at the table beside her He found this morsel considerably tougher than the last But at length he succeeded in pulling it to pieces and reconstructing it in a simpler form for the lady She was full of thanks and admiration Naturally enough they went on to the next line and the next stanza and the next and the next till shall I be believed they had read a whole canto of the poem Euphra knew more words by a great many than Hugh so that what with her knowledge of the words and his insight into the construction they made rare progress What a beautiful passage it is said Euphra It is indeed responded Hugh I never read anything more beautiful I wonder if it would be possible to turn that into English I should like to try You mean verse of course To be sure Let us try then I will bring you mine when I have finished it I fear it will take some time though to do it well Shall it be in blank verse or what Oh don t you think we had better keep the Terza Rima of the original As you please It will add much to the difficulty Recreant knight will you shrink from following where your lady leads Never so help me my good pen answered Hugh and took his departure with burning cheeks and a trembling at the heart Alas the morning was gone Harry was not in his study he sought and found him in the library apparently buried in Polexander I am so glad you are come said Harry I am so tired Why do you read that stupid book then Oh you know I told you Tut tut nonsense Put it away said Hugh his dissatisfaction with himself making him cross with Harry who felt in consequence ten times more desolate than before He could not understand the change If it went ill before with the hours devoted to common labour it went worse now Hugh seized every gap of time and widened its margins shamefully in order to work at his translation He found it very difficult to render the Italian in classical and poetic English The three rhyming words and the mode in which the stanzas are looped together added greatly to the difficulty Blank verse he would have found quite easy compared to this But he would not blench The thought of her praise and of the yet better favour he might gain spurred him on and Harry was the sacrifice But he would make it all up to him when this was once over Indeed he would Thus he baked cakes of clay to choke the barking of Cerberian conscience But it would growl notwithstanding The boy s spirit was sinking but Hugh did not or would not see it His step grew less elastic He became more listless more like his former self sauntering about with his hands in his pockets And Hugh of course found himself caring less about him for the thought of him rousing as it did the sense of his own neglect had become troublesome Sometimes he even passed poor Harry without speaking to him Gradually however he grew still further into the favour of mister Arnold until he seemed to have even acquired some influence with him mister Arnold would go out riding with them himself sometimes and express great satisfaction not only with the way Harry sat his pony for which he accorded Hugh the credit due to him but with the way in which Hugh managed his own horse as well mister Arnold was a good horseman and his praise was especially grateful to Hugh because Euphra was always near and always heard it I fear however that his progress in the good graces of mister Arnold was in a considerable degree the result of the greater anxiety to please which sprung from the consciousness of not deserving approbation Pleasing was an easy substitute for well doing Not acceptable to himself he had the greater desire to be acceptable to others and so reflect the side beams of a false approbation on himself who needed true light and would be ill provided for with any substitute For a man who is received as a millionaire can hardly help feeling like one at times even if he knows he has overdrawn his banker s account The necessity to Hugh s nature of feeling right drove him to this false mode of producing the false impression If one only wants to feel virtuous there are several royal roads to that end But fortunately the end itself would be unsatisfactory if gained while not one of these roads does more than pretend to lead even to that land of delusion The reaction in Hugh s mind was sometimes torturing enough But he had not strength to resist Euphra and so reform Well or ill done at length his translation was finished So was Euphra s They exchanged papers for a private reading first and arranged to meet afterwards in order to compare criticisms CHAPTER XI THE FIRST MIDNIGHT Well if anything be damned It will be twelve o clock at night that twelve Will never scape CYRIL TOURNEUR The Revenger s Tragedy Letters arrived at Arnstead generally while the family was seated at breakfast One morning the post bag having been brought in mister Arnold opened it himself according to his unvarying custom and found amongst other letters one in an old fashioned female hand which after reading it he passed to Euphra You remember missus Elton Euphra Quite well uncle a dear old lady But the expression which passed across her face rather belied her words and seemed to Hugh to mean I hope she is not going to bore us again She took care however to show no sign with regard to the contents of the letter but laying it beside her on the table waited to hear her uncle s mind first Poor dear girl said he at last You must try to make her as comfortable as you can There is consumption in the family you see he added with a meditative sigh Of course I will uncle Poor girl I hope there is not much amiss though after all But as she spoke an irrepressible flash of dislike or displeasure of some sort broke from her eyes and vanished No one but himself seemed to Hugh to have observed it but he was learned in the lady s eyes and their weather signs mister Arnold rose from the table and left the room apparently to write an answer to the letter As soon as he was gone Euphra gave the letter to Hugh He read as follows MY DEAR mister ARNOLD Will you extend the hospitality of your beautiful house to me and my young friend who has the honour of being your relative Lady Emily Lake For some time her health has seemed to be failing and she is ordered to spend the winter abroad at Pau or somewhere in the south of France It is considered highly desirable that in the meantime she should have as much change as possible and it occurred to me remembering the charming month I passed at your seat and recalling the fact that Lady Emily is cousin only once removed to your late most lovely wife that there would be no impropriety in writing to ask you whether you could without inconvenience receive us as your guests for a short time I say us for the dear girl has taken such a fancy to unworthy old me that she almost refuses to set out without me Not to be cumbersome either to our friends or ourselves we shall bring only our two maids and a steady old man servant who has been in my family for many years I trust you will not hesitate to refuse my request should I happen to have made it at an unsuitable season assured as you must be that we cannot attribute the refusal to any lack of hospitality or friendliness on your part At all events I trust you will excuse what seems now I have committed it to paper a great liberty I hope not presumption on mine I am my dear mister Arnold Yours most sincerely HANNAH ELTON Hugh refolded the letter and laid it down without remark Harry had left the room Isn t it a bore said Euphra Hugh answered only by a look A pause followed Who is missus Elton he said at last Oh a good hearted creature enough Frightfully prosy But that is a well written letter Oh yes She is famed for her letter writing and I believe practises every morning on a slate It is the only thing that redeems her from absolute stupidity Euphra with her taper fore finger tapped the table cloth impatiently and shifted back in her chair as if struggling with an inward annoyance And what sort of person is Lady Emily asked Hugh I have never seen her Some blue eyed milk maid with a title I suppose And in a consumption too I presume the dear girl is as religious as the old one Good heavens what shall we do she burst out at length and rising from her chair she paced about the room hurriedly but all the time with a gliding kind of footfall that would have shaken none but the craziest floor Dear Euphra Hugh ventured to say never mind Let us try to make the best of it She stopped in her walk turned towards him smiled as if ashamed and delighted at the same moment and slid out of the room Had Euphra been the same all through she could hardly have smiled so without being in love with Hugh That morning he sought her again in her room They talked over their versions of Dante Hugh s was certainly the best for he was more practised in such things than Euphra He showed her many faults which she at once perceived to be faults and so rose in his estimation But at the same time there were individual lines and passages of hers which he considered not merely better than the corresponding lines and passages but better than any part of his version This he was delighted to say and she seemed as delighted that he should think so A great part of the morning was spent thus I cannot stay longer said Hugh Let us read for an hour then after we come up stairs to night With more pleasure than I dare to say But you mean what you do say You can doubt it no more than myself Yet he did not like Euphra s making the proposal No more did he like the flippant almost cruel way in which she referred to Lady Emily s illness But he put it down to annoyance and haste got over it somehow anyhow and began to feel that if she were a devil he could not help loving her and would not help it if he could The hope of meeting her alone that night gave him spirit and energy with Harry and the poor boy was more cheery and active than he had been for some time He thought his big brother was going to love him again as at the first Hugh s treatment of his pupil might still have seemed kind from another but Harry felt it a great change in him In the course of the day Euphra took an opportunity of whispering to him Not in my room in the library I presume she thought it would be more prudent in the case of any interruption After dinner that evening Hugh did not go to the drawingroom with mister Arnold but out into the woods about the house It was early in the twilight for now the sun set late The month was June and the even a rich dreamful rosy even the sleep of a gorgeous day It is like the soul of a gracious woman thought Hugh charmed into a lucid interval of passion by the loveliness of the nature around him Strange to tell at that moment instead of the hushed gloom of the library towards which he was hoping and leaning in his soul there arose before him the bare stern leafless pine wood for who can call its foliage leaves with the chilly wind of a northern spring morning blowing through it with a wailing noise of waters and beneath a weird fir tree lofty gaunt and huge with bare goblin arms contorted sweepily in a strange mingling of the sublime and the grotesque beneath this fir tree Margaret sitting on one of its twisted roots the very image of peace with a face that seemed stilled by the expected approach of a sacred and unknown gladness a face that would blossom the more gloriously because its joy delayed its coming And above it the tree shone a still almost awful red in the level light of the morning The vision came and passed for he did not invite its stay it rebuked him to the deepest soul He strayed in troubled pleasure restless and dissatisfied Woods of the richest growth were around him heaps on heaps of leaves floating above him like clouds a trackless wilderness of airy green wherein one might wish to dwell for ever looking down into the vaults and aisles of the long ranging boles beneath But no peace could rest on his face only at best a false mask put on to hide the trouble of the unresting heart Had he been doing his duty to Harry his love for Euphra however unworthy she might be would not have troubled him thus He came upon an avenue At the further end the boughs of the old trees bare of leaves beneath met in a perfect pointed arch across which were barred the lingering colours of the sunset transforming the whole into a rich window full of stained glass and complex tracery closing up a Gothic aisle in a temple of everlasting worship A kind of holy calm fell upon him as he regarded the dim dying colours and the spirit of the night a something that is neither silence nor sound and yet is like both sank into his soul and made a moment of summer twilight there He walked along the avenue for some distance and then leaving it passed on through the woods Suddenly it flashed upon him that he had crossed the Ghost s Walk A slight but cold shudder passed through the region of his heart Then he laughed at himself and as it were in despite of his own tremor turned and crossed yet again the path of the ghost A spiritual epicure in his pleasures he would not spoil the effect of the coming meeting by seeing Euphra in the drawingroom first he went to his own study where he remained till the hour had nearly arrived He tried to write some verses But he found that although the lovely form of its own Naiad lay on the brink of the Well of Song its waters would not flow during the sirocco of passion its springs withdrew into the cool caves of the Life beneath At length he rose too much preoccupied to mind his want of success and going down the back stair reached the library There he seated himself and tried to read by the light of his chamber candle But it was scarcely even an attempt for every moment he was looking up to the door by which he expected her to enter Suddenly an increase of light warned him that she was in the room How she had entered he could not tell One hand carried her candle the light of which fell on her pale face with its halo of blackness her hair which looked like a well of darkness that threatened to break from its bonds and overflood the room with a second night dark enough to blot out that which was now looking in treeful and deep at the uncurtained windows The other hand was busy trying to incarcerate a stray tress which had escaped from its net and made her olive shoulders look white beside it Let it alone said Hugh let it be beautiful But she gently repelled the hand he raised to hers and though she was forced to put down her candle first persisted in confining the refractory tress then seated herself at the table and taking from her pocket the manuscript which Hugh had been criticising in the morning unfolded it and showed him all the passages he had objected to neatly corrected or altered It was wonderfully done for the time she had had He went over it all with her again seated close to her their faces almost meeting as they followed the lines They had just finished it and were about to commence reading from the original when Hugh who missed a sheet of Euphra s translation stooped under the table to look for it A few moments were spent in the search before he discovered that Euphra s foot was upon it He begged her to move a little but received no reply either by word or act Looking up in some alarm he saw that she was either asleep or in a faint By an impulse inexplicable to himself at the time he went at once to the windows and drew down the green blinds When he turned towards her again she was reviving or awaking he could not tell which How stupid of me to go to sleep she said Let us go on with our reading They had read for about half an hour when three taps upon one of the windows slight but peculiar and as if given with the point of a finger suddenly startled them Hugh turned at once towards the windows but of course he could see nothing having just lowered the blinds He turned again towards Euphra She had a strange wild look her lips were slightly parted and her nostrils wide her face was rigid and glimmering pale as death from the cloud of her black hair What was it said Hugh affected by her fear with the horror of the unknown But she made no answer and continued staring towards one of the windows He rose and was about to advance to it when she caught him by the hand with a grasp of which hers would have been incapable except under the influence of terror At that moment a clock in the room began to strike It was a slow clock and went on deliberately striking one two three till it had struck twelve Every stroke was a blow from the hammer of fear and his heart was the bell He could not breathe for dread so long as the awful clock was striking When it had ended they looked at each other again and Hugh breathed once Euphra he sighed But she made no answer she turned her eyes again to one of the windows They were both standing He sought to draw her to him but she yielded no more than a marble statue I crossed the Ghost s Walk to night said he in a hard whisper scarcely knowing that he uttered it till he heard his own words They seemed to fall upon his ear as if spoken by some one outside the room She looked at him once more and kept looking with a fixed stare Gradually her face became less rigid and her eyes less wild She could move at last Come come she said in a hurried whisper Let us go no no not that way as Hugh would have led her towards the private stair let us go the front way by the oak staircase They went up together When they reached the door of her room she said Good night without even looking at him and passed in Hugh went on in a state of utter bewilderment to his own apartment shut the door and locked it a thing he had never done before lighted both the candles on his table and then walked up and down the room trying like one aware that he is dreaming to come to his real self Pshaw he said at last It was only a little bird or a large moth How odd it is that darkness can make a fool of one I am ashamed of myself I wish I had gone out at the window if only to show Euphra I was not afraid though of course there was nothing to be seen As he said this in his mind he could not have spoken it aloud for fear of hearing his own voice in the solitude he went to one of the windows of his sitting room which was nearly over the library and looked into the wood Could it be Yes He did see something white gliding through the wood away in the direction of the Ghost s Walk It vanished and he saw it no more The morning was far advanced before he could go to bed When the first light of the aurora broke the sky he looked out again and the first glimmerings of the morning in the wood were more dreadful than the deepest darkness of the past night Possessed by a new horror he thought how awful it would be to see a belated ghost hurrying away in helpless haste The spectre would be yet more terrible in the grey light of the coming day and the azure breezes of the morning which to it would be like a new and more fearful death than amidst its own homely sepulchral darkness while the silence all around silence in light could befit only that dread season of loneliness when men are lost in sleep and ghosts if they walk at all walk in dismay But at length fear yielded to sleep though still he troubled her short reign When he awoke he found it so late that it was all he could do to get down in time for breakfast But so anxious was he not to be later than usual that he was in the room before mister Arnold made his appearance Euphra however was there before him She greeted him in the usual way quite circumspectly But she looked troubled Her face was very pale and her eyes were red as if from sleeplessness or weeping When her uncle entered she addressed him with more gaiety than usual and he did not perceive that anything was amiss with her But the whole of that day she walked as in a reverie avoiding Hugh two or three times that they chanced to meet without a third person in the neighbourhood Once in the forenoon when she was generally to be found in her room he could not refrain from trying to see her The change and the mystery were insupportable to him But when he tapped at her door no answer came and he walked back to Harry feeling as if by an unknown door in his own soul he had been shut out of the half of his being Or rather a wall seemed to have been built right before his eyes which still was there wherever he went As to the gliding phantom of the previous night the day denied it all telling him it was but the coinage of his own over wrought brain weakened by prolonged tension of the intellect and excited by the presence of Euphra at an hour claimed by phantoms when not yielded to sleep This was the easiest and most natural way of disposing of the difficulty The cloud around Euphra hid the ghost in its skirts Although fear in some measure returned with the returning shadows he yet resolved to try to get Euphra to meet him again in the library that night But she never gave him a chance of even dropping a hint to that purpose She had not gone out with them in the morning and when he followed her into the drawing room she was already at the piano He thought he might convey his wish without interrupting the music but as often as he approached her she broke or rather glided out into song as if she had been singing in an undertone all the while He could not help seeing she did not intend to let him speak to her But all the time whatever she sang was something she knew he liked and as often as she spoke to him in the hearing of her uncle or cousin it was in a manner peculiarly graceful and simple He could not understand her and was more bewitched more fascinated than ever by seeing her through the folds of the incomprehensible in which element she had wrapped herself from his nearer vision She had always seemed above him now she seemed miles away as well a region of Paradise into which he was forbidden to enter Everything about her to her handkerchief and her gloves was haunted by a vague mystery of worshipfulness and drew him towards it with wonder and trembling When they parted for the night she shook hands with him with a cool frankness that put him nearly beside himself with despair and when he found himself in his own room it was some time before he could collect his thoughts Having succeeded however he resolved in spite of growing fears to go to the library and see whether it were not possible she might be there He took up a candle and went down the back stair But when he opened the library door a gust of wind blew his candle out all was darkness within a sudden horror seized him and afraid of yielding to the inclination to bound up the stair lest he should go wild with the terror of pursuit he crept slowly back feeling his way to his own room with a determined deliberateness Could the library window have been left open Else whence the gust of wind Next day and the next and the next he fared no better her behaviour continued the same and she allowed him no opportunity of requesting an explanation CHAPTER XII A SUNDAY A man may be a heretic in the truth and if he believe things only because his pastor says so or the assembly so determines without knowing other reason though his belief be true yet the very truth he holds becomes his heresy MILTON Areopagitica At length the expected visitors arrived Hugh saw nothing of them till they assembled for dinner missus Elton was a benevolent old lady not old enough to give in to being old rather tall and rather stout in rich widow costume whose depth had been moderated by time Her kindly grey eyes looked out from a calm face which seemed to have taken comfort from loving everybody in a mild and moderate fashion Lady Emily was a slender girl rather shy with fair hair and a pale innocent face She wore a violet dress which put out her blue eyes She showed to no advantage beside the suppressed glow of life which made Euphra look like a tropical twilight I am aware there is no such thing but if there were it would be just like her missus Elton seemed to have concentrated the motherhood of her nature which was her most prominent characteristic notwithstanding or perhaps in virtue of her childlessness upon Lady Emily To her missus Elton was solicitously attentive and she on her part received it all sweetly and gratefully taking no umbrage at being treated as more of an invalid than she was Lady Emily ate nothing but chicken and custard pudding or rice all the time she was at Arnstead The richer and more seasoned any dish the more grateful it was to Euphra mister Arnold was a saddle of mutton man Hugh preferred roast beef but ate anything What sort of a clergyman have you now mister Arnold asked missus Elton at the dinner table Oh a very respectable young gentleman brother to Sir Richard who has the gift you know A very moderate excellent clergyman he makes too Ah but you know Lady Emily and I here she looked at Lady Emily who smiled and blushed faintly are very dependent on our Sundays and We all go to church regularly I assure you missus Elton and of course my carriage shall be always at your disposal I was in no doubt about either of those things indeed mister Arnold But what sort of a preacher is he Ah well let me see What was the subject of his sermon last Sunday Euphra my dear The devil and all his angels answered Euphra with a wicked flash in her eyes Yes yes so it was Oh I assure you missus Elton he is quite a respectable preacher as well as clergyman He is an honour to the cloth Hugh could not help thinking that the tailor should have his due and that mister Arnold gave it him He is no Puseyite either added mister Arnold seeing but not understanding missus Elton s baffled expression though he does preach once a month in his surplice I am afraid you will not find him very original though said Hugh wishing to help the old lady Original interposed mister Arnold Really I am bound to say I don t know how the remark applies How is a man to be original on a subject that is all laid down in plain print to use a vulgar expression and has been commented upon for eighteen hundred years and more Very true mister Arnold responded missus Elton We don t want originality do we It is only the gospel we want Does he preach the gospel How can he preach anything else His text is always out of some part of the Bible I am glad to see you hold by the Inspiration of the Scriptures mister Arnold said missus Elton chaotically bewildered Good heavens Madam what do you mean Could you for a moment suppose me to be an atheist Surely you have not become a student of German Neology And mister Arnold smiled a grim smile Not I indeed protested poor missus Elton moving uneasily in her seat I quite agree with you mister Arnold Then you may take my word for it that you will hear nothing but what is highly orthodox and perfectly worthy of a gentleman and a clergyman from the pulpit of mister Penfold He dined with us only last week This last assertion was made in an injured tone just sufficient to curl the tail of the sentence After which what was to be said Several vain attempts followed before a new subject was started sufficiently uninteresting to cause neither from warmth nor stupidity any danger of dissension and quite worthy of being here omitted Dinner over and the ceremony of tea in Lady Emily s case milk and water having been observed the visitors withdrew The next day was Sunday Lady Emily came down stairs in black which suited her better She was a pretty gentle creature interesting from her illness and good because she knew no evil except what she heard of from the pulpit They walked to church which was at no great distance along a meadow path paved with flags some of them worn through by the heavy shoes of country generations The church was one of those which are in some measure typical of the Church itself for it was very old and would have been very beautiful had it not been all plastered over and whitened to a smooth uniformity of ugliness the attempt having been more successful in the case of the type The open roof had had a French heaven added to it I mean a ceiling and the pillars which even if they were not carved though it was impossible to come to a conclusion on that point must yet have been worn into the beauty of age had been filled up and stained with yellow ochre Even the remnants of stained glass in some of the windows were half concealed by modern appliances for the partial exclusion of the light The church had fared as Chaucer in the hands of Dryden So had the truth that flickered through the sermon fared in the hands of the clergyman or of the sermon wright whose manuscript he had bought for eighteen pence I am told that sermons are to be procured at that price on his last visit to London Having although a Scotchman had an episcopalian education Hugh could not help rejoicing that not merely the Bible but the Church service as well had been fixed beyond the reach of such degenerating influences as those which had operated on the more material embodiments of religion for otherwise such would certainly have been the first to operate and would have found the greatest scope in any alteration We may hope that nothing but a true growth in such religion as needs and seeks new expression for new depth and breadth of feeling will ever be permitted to lay the hand of change upon it a hand otherwise of desecration and ruin The sermon was chiefly occupied with proving that God is no respecter of persons a mark of indubitable condescension in the clergyman the rank in society which he could claim for himself duly considered But unfortunately the church was so constructed that its area contained three platforms of position actually of differing level the loftiest in the chancel on the right hand of the pulpit occupied by the gentry the middle opposite the pulpit occupied by the tulip beds of their servants and the third on the left of the pulpit occupied by the common parishioners Unfortunately too by the perpetuation of some old custom whose significance was not worn out all on the left of the pulpit were expected as often as they stood up to sing which was three times to turn their backs to the pulpit and so face away from the chancel where the gentry stood But there was not much inconsistency after all the sermon founding its argument chiefly on the antithetical facts that death lowering the rich to the level of the poor was a dead leveller and that on the other hand the life to come would raise the poor to the level of the rich It was a pity that there was no phrase in the language to justify him in carrying out the antithesis and so balancing his sentence like a rope walker by saying that life was a live leveller The sermon ended with a solemn warning Those who neglect the gospel scheme and never think of death and judgment be they rich or poor be they wise or ignorant whether they dwell in the palace or the hut shall be damned Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Ghost c Lady Emily was forced to confess that she had not been much interested in the sermon missus Elton thought he spoke plainly but there was not much of the gospel in it mister Arnold opined that people should not go to church to hear sermons but to make the responses whoever read prayers it made no difference for the prayers were the Church s not the parson s and for the sermon as long as it showed the uneducated how to be saved and taught them to do their duty in the station of life to which God had called them and so long as the parson preached neither Puseyism nor Radicalism he frowned solemnly and disgustedly as he repeated the word nor Radicalism it was of comparatively little moment whether he was a man of intellect or not for he could not go wrong Little was said in reply to this except something not very audible or definite by missus Elton about the necessity of faith The conversation which took place at luncheon flagged and the visitors withdrew to their respective rooms to comfort themselves with their Daily Portions At dinner mister Arnold evidently believing he had made an impression by his harangue of the morning resumed the subject Hugh was a little surprised to find that he had even of a negative sort strong opinions on the subject of religion What do you think then missus Elton my dear madam that a clergyman ought to preach I think mister Arnold that he ought to preach salvation by faith in the merits of the Saviour Oh of course of course We shall not differ about that Everybody believes that I doubt it very much He ought in order that men may believe to explain the divine plan by which the demands of divine justice are satisfied and the punishment due to sin averted from the guilty and laid upon the innocent that by bearing our sins he might make atonement to the wrath of a justly offended God and so Now my dear madam permit me to ask what right we the subjects of a Supreme Authority have to inquire into the reasons of his doings It seems to me I should be sorry to offend any one but it seems to me quite as presumptuous as the present arrogance of the lower classes in interfering with government and demanding a right to give their opinion forsooth as to the laws by which they shall be governed as if they were capable of understanding the principles by which kings rule and governors decree justice I believe I quote Scripture Are we then to remain in utter ignorance of the divine character What business have we with the divine character Or how could we understand it It seems to me we have enough to do with our own Do I inquire into the character of my sovereign All we have to do is to listen to what we are told by those who are educated for such studies whom the Church approves and who are appointed to take care of the souls committed to their charge to teach them to respect their superiors and to lead honest hard working lives Much more of the same sort flowed from the oracular lips of mister Arnold When he ceased he found that the conversation had ceased also As soon as the ladies withdrew he said without looking at Hugh as he filled his glass mister Sutherland I hate cant And so he canted against it But the next day and during the whole week he seemed to lay himself out to make amends for the sharpness of his remarks on the Sunday He was afraid he had made his guests uncomfortable and so sinned against his own character as a host Everything that he could devise was brought to bear for their entertainment daily rides in the open carriage in which he always accompanied them to show his estate and the improvements he was making upon it visits sometimes to the more deserving as he called them of the poor upon his property the more deserving being the most submissive and obedient to the wishes of their lord inspections of the schools c c in all of which matters he took a stupid benevolent interest For if people would be content to occupy the corner in which he chose to place them he would throw them morsel after morsel as long as ever they chose to pick it up But woe to them if they left this corner a single pace Euphra made one of the party always and it was dreary indeed for Hugh to be left in the desolate house without her though but for a few hours And when she was at home she never yet permitted him to speak to her alone There might have been some hope for Harry in Hugh s separation from Euphra but the result was that although he spent school hours more regularly with him Hugh was yet more dull and uninterested in the work than he had been before Instead of caring that his pupil should understand this or that particular he would be speculating on Euphra s behaviour trying to account for this or that individual look or tone or seeking perhaps a special symbolic meaning in some general remark that she had happened to let fall Meanwhile poor Harry would be stupifying himself with work which he could not understand for lack of some explanation or other that ought to have been given him weeks ago Still however he clung to Hugh with a far off worshipping love never suspecting that he could be to blame but thinking at one time that he must be ill at another that he himself was really too stupid and that his big brother could not help getting tired of him When Hugh would be wandering about the place seeking to catch a glimpse of the skirt of Euphra s dress as she went about with her guests or devising how he could procure an interview with her alone Harry would be following him at a distance like a little terrier that had lost its master and did not know whether this man would be friendly or not never spying on his actions but merely longing to be near him for had not Hugh set him going in the way of life even if he had now left him to walk in it alone If Hugh could have once seen into that warm true pining little heart he would not have neglected it as he did He had no eyes however but for Euphra Still it may be that even now Harry was able to gather though with tears some advantage from Hugh s neglect He used to wander about alone and it may be that the hints which his tutor had already given him enabled him now to find for himself the interest belonging to many objects never before remarked Perhaps even now he began to take a few steps alone the waking independence of which was of more value for the future growth of his nature than a thousand miles accomplished by the aid of the strong arm of his tutor One certain advantage was that the constitutional trouble of the boy s nature had now assumed a definite form by gathering around a definite object and blending its own shadowy being with the sorrow he experienced from the loss of his tutor s sympathy Should that sorrow ever be cleared away much besides might be cleared away along with it Meantime nature found some channels worn by his grief through which her comforts that like waters press on all sides and enter at every cranny and fissure in the house of life might gently flow into him with their sympathetic soothing Often he would creep away to the nest which Hugh had built and then forsaken and seated there in the solitude of the wide bourgeoned oak he would sometimes feel for a moment as if lifted up above the world and its sorrows to be visited by an all healing wind from God that came to him through the wilderness of leaves around him gently like all powerful things But I am putting the boy s feelings into forms and words for him He had none of either for them CHAPTER XIII A STORM When the mind s free The body s delicate the tempest in my mind Doth from my senses take all feeling else Save what beats there King Lear While Harry took to wandering abroad in the afternoon sun Hugh on the contrary found the bright weather so distasteful to him that he generally trifled away his afternoons with some old romance in the dark library or lay on the couch in his study listless and suffering He could neither read nor write What he felt he must do he did but nothing more One day about noon the weather began to change In the afternoon it grew dark and Hugh going to the window perceived with delight the first he had experienced for many days that a great thunder storm was at hand Harry was rather frightened but under his fear there evidently lay a deep delight The storm came nearer and nearer till at length a vivid flash broke from the mass of darkness over the woods lasted for one brilliant moment and vanished The thunder followed like a pursuing wild beast close on the traces of the vanishing light as if the darkness were hunting the light from the earth and bellowing with rage that it could not overtake and annihilate it Without the usual prelude of a few great drops the rain poured at once in continuous streams from the dense canopy overhead and in a few moments there were six inches of water all round the house which the force of the falling streams made to foam and fume and flash like a seething torrent Harry had crept close to Hugh who stood looking out of the window and as if the convulsion of the elements had begun to clear the spiritual and moral as well as the physical atmosphere Hugh looked down on the boy kindly and put his arm round his shoulders Harry nestled closer and wished it would thunder for ever But longing to hear his tutor s voice he ventured to speak looking up to his face Euphra says it is only electricity mister Sutherland What is that A common tutor would have seized the opportunity of explaining what he knew of the laws and operations of electricity But Hugh had been long enough a pupil of David to feel that to talk at such a time of anything in nature but God would be to do the boy a serious wrong One capable of so doing would in the presence of the Saviour himself speculate on the nature of his own faith or upon the death of his child seize the opportunity of lecturing on anatomy But before Hugh could make any reply a flash almost invisible from excess of light was accompanied rather than followed by a roar that made the house shake and in a moment more the room was filled with the terrified household which by an unreasoning impulse rushed to the neighbourhood of him who was considered the strongest mister Arnold was not at home Come from the window instantly mister Sutherland How can you be so imprudent cried missus Elton her usually calm voice elevated in command but tremulous with fear Why missus Elton answered Hugh on whose temper as well as conduct recent events had had their operation do you think the devil makes the thunder Lady Emily gave a faint shriek whether out of reverence for the devil or fear of God I hesitate to decide and flitting out of the room dived into her bed and drew the clothes over her head at least so she was found at a later period of the day Euphra walked up to the window beside Hugh as if to show her approval of his rudeness and stood looking out with eyes that filled their own night with home born flashes though her lip was pale and quivered a little missus Elton confounded at Hugh s reply and perhaps fearing the house might in consequence share the fate of Sodom notwithstanding the presence of a goodly proportion of the righteous fled accompanied by the housekeeper to the wine cellar The rest of the household crept into corners except the coachman who retaining his composure in virtue of a greater degree of insensibility from his nearer approximation to the inanimate creation emptied the jug of ale intended for the dinner of the company and went out to look after his horses But there was one in the house who left alone threw the window wide open and with gently clasped hands and calm countenance looked up into the heavens and the clearness of whose eye seemed the prophetic symbol of the clearness that rose all untroubled above the turmoil of the earthly storm Truly God was in the storm but there was more of God in the clear heaven beyond and yet more of Him in the eye that regarded the whole with a still joy in which was mingled no dismay Euphra Hugh and Harry were left together looking out upon the storm Hugh could not speak in Harry s presence At length the boy sat down in a dark corner on the floor concealed from the others by a window curtain Hugh thought he had left the room Euphra he began Euphra looked round for Harry and not seeing him thought likewise that he had left the room she glided away without making any answer to Hugh s invocation He stood for a few moments in motionless despair then glancing round the room and taking in all its desertedness caught up his hat and rushed out into the storm It was the best relief his feelings could have had for the sullen gloom alternated with bursts of flame invasions of horrid uproar and long wailing blasts of tyrannous wind gave him his own mood to walk in met his spirit with its own element widened as it were his microcosm to the expanse of the macrocosm around him All the walls of separation were thrown down and he lived not in his own frame but in the universal frame of nature The world was for the time to the reality of his feeling what Schleiermacher in his Monologen describes it as being to man an extension of the body in which he dwells His spirit flashed in the lightning raved in the thunder moaned in the wind and wept in the rain But this could not last long either without or within him He came to himself in the woods How far he had wandered or whereabout he was he did not know The storm had died away and all that remained was the wind and the rain The tree tops swayed wildly in the irregular blasts and shook new fitful distracted and momentary showers upon him It was evening but what hour of the evening he could not tell He was wet to the skin but that to a young Scotchman is a matter of little moment Although he had no intention of returning home for some time and meant especially to avoid the dinner table for in the mood he was in it seemed more than he could endure he yet felt the weakness to which we are subject as embodied beings in a common enough form that namely of the necessity of knowing the precise portion of space which at the moment we fill a conviction of our identity not being sufficient to make us comfortable without a knowledge of our locality So looking all about him and finding where the wood seemed thinnest he went in that direction and soon by forcing his way through obstacles of all salvage kinds found himself in the high road within a quarter of a mile of the country town next to Arnstead removed from it about three miles This little town he knew pretty well and beginning to feel exhausted resolved to go to an inn there dry his clothes and then walk back in the moonlight for he felt sure the storm would be quite over in an hour or so The fatigue he now felt was proof enough in itself that the inward storm had for the time raved itself off and now must it be confessed he wished very much for something to eat and drink He was soon seated by a blazing fire with a chop and a jug of ale before him CHAPTER XIV AN EVENING LECTURE The Nightmare Shall call thee when it walks MIDDLETON The Witch The inn to which Hugh had betaken himself though not the first in the town was yet what is called a respectable house and was possessed of a room of considerable size in which the farmers of the neighbourhood were accustomed to hold their gatherings While eating his dinner Hugh learned from the conversation around him for he sat in the kitchen for the sake of the fire that this room was being got ready for a lecture on Bilology as the landlady called it Bills in red and blue had been posted all over the town and before he had finished his dinner the audience had begun to arrive Partly from curiosity about a subject of which he knew nothing and partly because it still rained and having got nearly dry he did not care about a second wetting if he could help it Hugh resolved to make one of them So he stood by the fire till he was informed that the lecturer had made his appearance when he went up stairs paid his shilling and was admitted to one of the front seats The room was tolerably lighted with gas and a platform had been constructed for the lecturer and his subjects When the place was about half filled he came from another room alone a little thick set bull necked man with vulgar face and rusty black clothes and mounting the platform commenced his lecture if lecture it could be called in which there seemed to be no order and scarcely any sequence No attempt even at a theory showed itself in the mass of what he called facts and scientific truths and he perpeturated the most awful blunders in his English It will not be desired that I should give any further account of such a lecture The lecturer himself seemed to depend chiefly for his success upon the manifestations of his art which he proceeded to bring forward He called his familiar by the name of Willi am and a stunted pale faced dull looking youth started up from somewhere and scrambled upon the platform beside his master Upon this tutored slave a number of experiments was performed He was first cast into whatever abnormal condition is necessary for the operations of biology and then compelled to make a fool of himself by exhibiting actions the most inconsistent with his real circumstances and necessities But aware that all this was open to the most palpable objection of collusion the operator next invited any of the company that pleased to submit themselves to his influences After a pause of a few moments a stout country fellow florid and healthy got up and slouched to the platform Certainly whatever might be the nature of the influence that was brought to bear its operative power could not with the least probability be attributed to an over activity of imagination in either of the subjects submitted to its exercise In the latter as well as in the former case the operator was eminently successful and the clown returned to his seat looking remarkably foolish and conscious of disgrace a sufficient voucher to most present that in this case at least there had been no collusion Several others volunteered their negative services but with no one of them did he succeed so well and in one case the failure was evident The lecturer pretended to account for this in making some confused and unintelligible remarks about the state of the weather the thunder storm electricity c of which things he evidently did not understand the best known laws The blundering idiot growled close to Hugh s ear a voice with a foreign accent He looked round sharply A tall powerful eminently handsome man with a face as foreign as his tone and accent sat beside him I beg your pardon he said to Hugh I thought aloud I should like to know if you wouldn t mind telling me what you detect of the blunderer in him I am quite ignorant of these matters I have had many opportunities of observing them and I see at once that this man though he has the natural power is excessively ignorant of the whole subject This was all the answer he vouchsafed to Hugh s modest inquiry Hugh had not yet learned that one will always fare better by concealing than by acknowledging ignorance The man whatever his capacity who honestly confesses even a partial ignorance will instantly be treated as more or less incapable by the ordinary man who has already gained a partial knowledge or is capable of assuming a knowledge which he does not possess But for God s sake let the honest and modest man stick to his honesty and modesty cost what they may Hugh was silent and fixed his attention once more on what was going on But presently he became aware that the foreigner was scrutinizing him with the closest attention He knew this somehow without having looked round and the knowledge was accompanied with a feeling of discomfort that caused him to make a restless movement on his seat Presently he felt that the annoyance had ceased but not many minutes had passed before it again commenced In order to relieve himself from a feeling which he could only compare to that which might be produced by the presence of the dead he turned towards his neighbour so suddenly that it seemed for a moment to embarrass him his eyes being caught in the very act of devouring the stolen indulgence But the stranger recovered himself instantly with the question Will you permit me to ask of what country you are Hugh thought he made the request only for the sake of covering his rudeness and so merely answered Why an Englishman of course Ah yes it is not necessary to be told that But it seems to me from your accent that you are a Scotchman So I am A Highlander I was born in the Highlands But if you are very anxious to know my pedigree I have no reason for concealing the fact that I am by birth half a Scotchman and half a Welchman The foreigner riveted his gaze though but for the briefest moment sufficient to justify its being called a gaze once more upon Hugh and then with a slight bow as of acquiescence turned towards the lecturer When the lecture was over and Hugh was walking away in the midst of the withdrawing audience the stranger touched him on the shoulder You said that you would like to know more of this science will you come to my lodging said he With pleasure Hugh answered though the look with which he accompanied the words must have been one rather of surprise You are astonished that a stranger should invite you so Ah you English always demand an introduction There is mine He handed Hugh a card Herr von Funkelstein Hugh happened to be provided with one in exchange The two walked out of the inn along the old High Street full of gables and all the delightful irregularities of an old country town till they came to a court down which Herr von Funkelstein led the way He let himself in with a pass key at a low door and then conducted Hugh by a stair whose narrowness was equalled by its steepness to a room which though not many yards above the level of the court was yet next to the roof of the low house Hugh could see nothing till his conductor lighted a candle Then he found himself in a rather large room with a shaky floor and a low roof A chintz curtained bed in one corner had the skin of a tiger thrown over it and a table in another had a pair of foils lying upon it The German for such he seemed to Hugh offered him a chair in the politest manner and Hugh sat down I am only in lodgings here said the host so you will forgive the poverty of my establishment There is no occasion for forgiveness I assure you answered Hugh You wished to know something of the subject with which that lecturer was befooling himself and the audience at the same time I shall be grateful for any enlightenment Ah it is a subject for the study of a benevolent scholar not for such a clown as that He jumps at no conclusions yet he shares the fate of one who does he flounders in the mire between No man will make anything of it who has not the benefit of the human race at heart Humanity is the only safe guide in matters such as these This is a dangerous study indeed in unskilful hands Here a frightful caterwauling interrupted Herr von Funkelstein The room had a storm window of which the lattice stood open In front of it on the roof seen against a white house opposite stood a demon of a cat arched to half its length with a tail expanded to double its natural thickness Its antagonist was invisible from where Hugh sat Von Funkelstein started up without making the slightest noise trod as softly as a cat to the table took up one of the foils removed the button and creeping close to the window made one rapid pass at the enemy which vanished with a shriek of hatred and fear He then replacing the button laid the foil down and resumed his seat and his discourse This after dealing with generalities and commonplaces for some time gave no sign of coming either to an end or to the point All the time he was watching Hugh at least so Hugh thought as if speculating on him in general Then appearing to have come to some conclusion he gave his mind more to his talk and encouraged Hugh to speak as well The conversation lasted for nearly half an hour At its close Hugh felt that the stranger had touched upon a variety of interesting subjects as one possessed of a minute knowledge of them But he did not feel that he had gained any insight from his conversation It seemed rather as if he had been giving him a number of psychological social literary and scientific receipts During the course of the talk his eye had appeared to rest on Hugh by a kind of compulsion as if by its own will it would have retired from the scrutiny but the will of its owner was too strong for it It seemed in relation to him to be only a kind of tool which he used for a particular purpose At length Funkelstein rose and marching across the room to a cupboard brought out a bottle and glasses saying in the most by the bye way as he went Have you the second sight mister Sutherland Certainly not as far as I am aware Ah the Welch do have it do they not Oh yes of course answered Hugh laughing I should like to know though he added whether they inherit the gift as Celts or as mountaineers Will you take a glass of Of nothing thank you answered and interrupted Hugh It is time for me to be going Indeed I fear I have stayed too long already Good night Herr von Funkelstein You will allow me the honour of returning your visit Hugh felt he could do no less although he had not the smallest desire to keep up the acquaintance He wrote Arnstead on his card As he left the house he stumbled over something in the court Looking down he saw it was a cat apparently dead Can it be the cat Herr Funkelstein made the pass at thought he But presently he forgot all about it in the visions of Euphra which filled his mind during his moonlight walk home It just occurred to him however before those visions had blotted everything else from his view that he had learned simply nothing whatever about biology from his late host When he reached home he was admitted by the butler and retired to bed at once where he slept soundly for the first time for many nights But as he drew near his own room he might have seen though he saw not a little white figure gliding away in the far distance of the long passage It was only Harry who could not lie still in his bed till he knew that his big brother was safe at home CHAPTER XV ANOTHER EVENING LECTURE This Eneas is come to Paradise Out of the swolowe of Hell CHAUCER Legend of Dido The next day Hugh was determined to find or make an opportunity of speaking to Euphra and fortune seemed to favour him Or was it Euphra herself in one or other of her inexplicable moods At all events she had that morning allowed the ladies and her uncle to go without her and Hugh met her as he went to his study May I speak to you for one moment said he hurriedly and with trembling lips Yes certainly she replied with a smile and a glance in his face as of wonder as to what could trouble him so much Then turning and leading the way she said Come into my room He followed her She turned and shut the door which he had left open behind him He almost knelt to her but something held him back from that Euphra he said what have I done to offend you Offend me Nothing This was uttered in a perfect tone of surprise How is it that you avoid me as you do and will not allow me one moment s speech with you You are driving me to distraction Why you foolish man she answered half playfully pressing the palms of her little hands together and looking up in his face how can I Don t you see how those two dear old ladies swallow me up in their faddles Oh dear Oh dear I wish they would go Then it would be all right again wouldn t it But Hugh was not to be so easily satisfied Before they came ever since that night Hush sh she interrupted putting her finger on his lips and looking hurriedly round her with an air of fright of which he could hardly judge whether it was real or assumed hush Comforted wondrously by the hushing finger Hugh would yet understand more I am no baby dear Euphra he said taking hold of the hand to which the finger belonged and laying it on his mouth do not make one of me There is some mystery in all this at least something I do not understand I will tell you all about it one day But seriously you must be careful how you behave to me for if my uncle should but for one moment entertain a suspicion good bye to you perhaps good bye to Arnstead All my influence with him comes from his thinking that I like him better than anybody else So you must not make the poor old man jealous By the bye she went on rapidly as if she would turn the current of the conversation aside what a favourite you have grown with him You should have heard him talk of you to the old ladies I might well be jealous of you There never was a tutor like his Hugh s heart smote him that the praise of even this common man proud of his own vanity should be undeserved by him He was troubled too at the flippancy with which Euphra spoke yet not the less did he feel that he loved her passionately I daresay he replied he praised me as he would anything else that happened to be his Isn t that old bay horse of his the best hack in the county You naughty man Are you going to be satirical You claim that as your privilege do you Worse and worse I will not talk to you But seriously for I must go bring your Italian to to She hesitated To the library why not suggested Hugh No o she answered shaking her head and looking quite solemn Well will you come to my study Will that please you better Yes I will she answered with a definitive tone Good bye now She opened the door and having looked out to see that no one was passing told him to go As he went he felt as if the oaken floor were elastic beneath his tread It was sometime after the household had retired however before Euphra made her appearance at the door of his study She seemed rather shy of entering and hesitated as if she felt she was doing something she ought not to do But as soon as she had entered and the door was shut she appeared to recover herself quite and they sat down at the table with their books They could not get on very well with their reading however Hugh often forgot what he was about in looking at her and she seemed nowise inclined to avert his gazes or check the growth of his admiration Rather abruptly but apparently starting from some suggestion in the book she said to him By the bye has mister Arnold ever said anything to you about the family jewels No said Hugh Are there many Yes a great many mister Arnold is very proud of them as well as of the portraits so he treats them in the same way keeps them locked up Indeed he seldom allows them to see daylight except it be as a mark of especial favour to some one I should like much to see them I have always been curious about stones They are wonderful mysterious things to me Euphra gave him a very peculiar searching glance as he spoke Shall I he continued give him a hint that I should like to see them By no means answered Euphra emphatically except he should refer to them himself He is very jealous of his possessions his family possessions I mean Poor old man he has not much else to plume himself upon has he He is kind to you Euphra She looked at him as if she did not understand him Yes What then You ought not to be unkind to him You odd creature I am not unkind to him I like him But we are not getting on with our reading What could have led me to talk about family jewels Oh I see What a strange thing the association of ideas is There is not a very obvious connexion here is there No One cannot account for such things The links in the chain of ideas are sometimes slender enough Yet the slenderest is sufficient to enable the electric flash of thought to pass along the line She seemed pondering for a moment That strikes me as a fine simile she said You ought to be a poet yourself Hugh made no reply I daresay you have hundreds of poems in that old desk now I think they might be counted by tens Do let me see them You would not care for them Wouldn t I Hugh I will on one condition two conditions I mean What are they One is that you show me yours Mine Yes Who told you I wrote verses That silly boy No I saw your verses before I saw you You remember It was very dishonourable in you to read them I only saw they were verses I did not read a word I forgive you then You must show me yours first till I see whether I could venture to let you see mine If yours were very bad indeed then I might risk showing mine And much more of this sort with which I will not weary my readers It ended in Hugh s taking from the old escritoire a bundle of papers and handing them to Euphra But the reader need not fear that I am going to print any of these verses I have more respect for my honest prose page than to break it up so Indeed the whole of this interview might have been omitted but for two circumstances One of them was that in getting these papers Hugh had to open a concealed portion of the escritoire which his mathematical knowledge had enabled him to discover It had evidently not been opened for many years before he found it He had made use of it to hold the only treasures he had poor enough treasures certainly Not a loving note not a lock of hair even had he nothing but the few cobwebs spun from his own brain It is true we are rich or poor according to what we are not what we have But what a man has produced is not what he is He may even impoverish his true self by production When Euphra saw him open this place she uttered a suppressed cry of astonishment Ah said Hugh you did not know of this hidie hole did you Indeed I did not I had used the desk myself for this was a favourite room of mine before you came but I never found that Dear me Let me look She put her hand on his shoulder and leaned over him as he pointed out the way of opening it Did you find nothing in it she said with a slight tremour in her voice Nothing whatever There may be more places No I have accounted for the whole bulk I believe How strange But now you must give me my guerdon said Hugh timidly The fact was the poor youth had bargained in a playful manner and yet with an earnest covetous heart for one the first kiss in return for the poems she begged to see She turned her face towards him The second circumstance which makes the interview worth recording is that at this moment three distinct knocks were heard on the window They sprang asunder and saw each other s face pale as death In Euphra s the expression of fright was mingled with one of annoyance Hugh though his heart trembled like a bird leaped to the window Nothing was to be seen but the trees that stretched their dark arms within a few feet of the oriel Turning again towards Euphra he found to his mortification that she had vanished and had left the packet of poems behind her He replaced them in their old quarters in the escritoire and his vague dismay at the unaccountable noises was drowned in the bitter waters of miserable humiliation He slept at last from the exhaustion of disappointment When he awoke however he tried to persuade himself that he had made far too much of the trifling circumstance of her leaving the verses behind For was she not terrified Why then did she leave him and go alone to her own room She must have felt that she ought not to be in his at that hour and therefore dared not stay Why dared not Did she think the house was haunted by a ghost of propriety What rational theory could he invent to account for the strange and repeated sounds He puzzled himself over it to the verge of absolute intellectual prostration He was generally the first in the breakfast room that is after Euphra who was always the first She went up to him as he entered and said almost in a whisper Have you got the poems for me Quick Hugh hesitated She looked at him No he said at last You never wanted them That is very unkind when you know I was frightened out of my wits Do give me them They are not worth giving you Besides I have not got them I don t carry them in my pocket They are in the escritoire I couldn t leave them lying about Never mind them I have a right to them she said looking up at him slyly and shyly Well I gave you them and you did not think them worth keeping I kept my part of the bargain She looked annoyed Never mind dear Euphra you shall have them or anything else I have the brain that made them if you like Was it only the brain that had to do with the making of them Perhaps the heart too but you have that already Her face flushed like a damask rose At that moment missus Elton entered and looked a little surprised Euphra instantly said I think it is rather too bad of you mister Sutherland to keep the poor boy so hard to his work when you know he is not strong missus Elton I have been begging a holiday for poor Harry to let him go with us to Wotton House but he has such a hard task master He will not hear of it The flush which she could not get rid of all at once was thus made to do duty as one of displeasure missus Elton was thoroughly deceived and united her entreaties to those of Miss Cameron Hugh was compelled to join in the deception and pretend to yield a slow consent Thus a holiday was extemporised for Harry subject to the approbation of his father This was readily granted and mister Arnold turning to Hugh said You will have nothing to do mister Sutherland had you not better join us With pleasure replied he but the carriage will be full You can take your horse Thank you very much I will The day was delightful one of those grey summer days that are far better for an excursion than bright ones In the best of spirits mounted on a good horse riding alongside of the carriage in which was the lady who was all womankind to him and who without taking much notice of him yet contrived to throw him a glance now and then Hugh would have been overflowingly happy but for an unquiet distressed feeling which all the time made him aware of the presence of a sick conscience somewhere within mister Arnold was exceedingly pleasant for he was much taken with the sweetness and modesty of Lady Emily who having no strong opinions upon anything received those of mister Arnold with attentive submission He saw or fancied he saw in her a great resemblance to his deceased wife to whom he had been as sincerely attached as his nature would allow In fact Lady Emily advanced so rapidly in his good graces that either Euphra was or thought fit to appear rather jealous of her She paid her every attention however and seemed to gratify mister Arnold by her care of the invalid She even joined in the entreaties which on their way home he made with evident earnestness for an extension of their visit to a month Lady Emily was already so much better for the change that missus Elton made no objection to the proposal Euphra gave Hugh one look of misery and turning again insisted with increased warmth on their immediate consent It was gained without much difficulty before they reached home Harry too was captivated by the gentle kindness of Lady Emily and hardly took his eyes off her all the way while on the other hand his delicate little attentions had already gained the heart of good missus Elton who from the first had remarked and pitied the sad looks of the boy CHAPTER XVI A NEW VISITOR AND AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE He s enough To bring a woman to confusion More than a wiser man or a far greater MIDDLETON The Witch When they reached the lodge Lady Emily expressed a wish to walk up the avenue to the house To this mister Arnold gladly consented The carriage was sent round the back way and Hugh dismounting gave his horse to the footman in attendance As they drew near the house the rest of the party having stopped to look at an old tree which was a favourite with its owner Hugh and Harry were some yards in advance when the former spied approaching them from the house the distinguished figure of Herr von Funkelstein Saluting as they met the visitor informed Hugh that he had just been leaving his card for him and would call some other morning soon for as he was rusticating he had little to occupy him Hugh turned with him towards the rest of the party who were now close at hand when Funkelstein exclaimed in a tone of surprise What Miss Cameron here and advanced with a profound obeisance holding his hat in his hand Hugh thought he saw her look annoyed but she held out her hand to him and in a voice indicating still as it appeared to Hugh some reluctance introduced him to her uncle with the words We met at Sir Edward Laston s when I was visiting missus Elkingham two years ago uncle mister Arnold lifted his hat and bowed politely to the stranger Had Euphra informed him that although a person of considerable influence in Sir Edward s household Herr von Funkelstein had his standing there only as Sir Edward s private secretary mister Arnold s aversion to foreigners generally would not have been so scrupulously banished into the background of his behaviour Ordinary civilities passed between them marked by an air of flattering deference on Funkelstein s part which might have been disagreeable to a man less uninterruptedly conscious of his own importance than mister Arnold and the new visitor turned once more as if forgetful of his previous direction and accompanied them towards the house Before they reached it he had even in that short space ingratiated himself so far with mister Arnold that he asked him to stay and dine with them an invitation which was accepted with manifest pleasure mister Sutherland said mister Arnold will you show your friend anything worth note about the place He has kindly consented to dine with us and in the meantime I have some letters to write With pleasure answered Hugh But all this time he had been inwardly commenting on the appearance of his friend as mister Arnold called him with the jealousy of a youth in love for was not Funkelstein an old acquaintance of Miss Cameron What might not have passed between them in that old hidden time for love is jealous of the past as well as of the future Love as well as metaphysics has a lasting quarrel with time and space the lower love fears them while the higher defies them And he could not help seeing that Funkelstein was one to win favour in ladies eyes Very regular features and a dark complexion were lighted up by eyes as black as Euphra s and capable of a wonderful play of light while his form was remarkable for strength and symmetry Hugh felt that in any company he would attract immediate attention His long dark beard of which just the centre was removed to expose a finely turned chin blew over each shoulder as often as they met the wind in going round the house From what I have heard of him from other deponents besides Hugh I should judge that he did well to conceal the lines of his mouth in a long moustache which flowed into his bifurcated beard He had just enough of the foreign in his dress to add to the appearance of fashion which it bore As they walked Hugh could not help observing an odd peculiarity in the carriage of his companion It was that every few steps he gave a backward and downward glance to the right with a sweeping bend of his body as if he were trying to get a view of the calf of his leg or as if he fancied he felt something trailing at his foot So probable from his motion did the latter supposition seem that Hugh changed sides to satisfy himself whether or not there was some dragging briar or straw annoying him but no follower was to be discovered You are a happy man mister Sutherland said the guest to live under the same roof with that beautiful Miss Cameron Am I thought Hugh but he only said affecting some surprise Do you think her so beautiful Funkelstein s eyes were fixed upon him as if to see the effect of his remark Hugh felt them and could not conform his face to the indifference of his words But his companion only answered indifferently Well I should say so but beauty is not that is not beauty for us Whether or not there was poison in the fork of this remark Hugh could only conjecture He made no reply As they walked about the precincts of the house Funkelstein asked many questions of Hugh which his entire ignorance of domestic architecture made it impossible for him to answer This seemed only to excite the questioner s desire for information to a higher pitch and as if the very stones could reply to his demands he examined the whole range of the various buildings constituting the house of Arnstead as he would draw it Certainly said he there is at least variety enough in the style of this mass of material There is enough for one pyramid That would be rather at the expense of the variety would it not said Hugh in spiteful response to the inconsequence of the second member of Funkelstein s remark But the latter was apparently too much absorbed in his continued inspection of the house from every attainable point of near view to heed the comment This they call the Ghost s Walk said Hugh Ah about these old houses there are always such tales What sort of tales do you mean I mean of particular spots and their ghosts You must have heard many such No not I I think Germany is more prolific of such stories I could tell you plenty But you don t mean you believe such things To me it is equal I look at them entirely as objects of art That is a new view of a ghost to me An object of art I should have thought them considerably more suitable objects previous to their disembodiment Ah you do not understand You call art painting don t you or sculpture at most I give up sculpture certainly and painting too But don t you think a ghost a very effective object in literature now Confess do you not like a ghost story very much Yes if it is a very good one Hamlet now Ah we don t speak of Shakspere s plays as stories His characters are so real to us that in thinking of their development we go back even to their fathers and mothers and sometimes even speculate about their future You islanders are always in earnest somehow So are we Germans We are all one I hope you can be in earnest about dinner then for I hear the bell We must render ourselves in the drawing room then Yes When they entered the drawing room they found Miss Cameron alone Funkelstein advanced and addressed a few words to her in German which Hugh s limited acquaintance with the language prevented him from catching At the same moment mister Arnold entered and Funkelstein turning to him immediately proceeded as if by way of apology for speaking in an unknown tongue to interpret for mister Arnold s benefit I have just been telling Miss Cameron in the language of my country how much better she looks than when I saw her at Sir Edward Lastons I know I was quite a scare crow then said Euphra attempting to laugh And now you are quite a decoy duck eh Euphra said mister Arnold laughing in reality at his own joke which put him in great good humour for the whole time of dinner and dessert Thank you uncle said Euphra with a prettily pretended affectation of humility Then she added gaily When did you rise on our Sussex horizon Herr von Funkelstein Oh I have been in the neighbourhood for a few days but I owe my meeting with you to one of those coincidences which were they not so pleasant to me in this case at least one would think could only result from the blundering of old Dame Nature over her knitting If I had not had the good fortune to meet mister Sutherland the other evening I should have remained in utter ignorance of your neighbourhood and my own felicity Miss Cameron Indeed I called now to see him not you Hugh saw mister Arnold looking rather doubtful of the foreigner s fine speeches Dinner was announced Funkelstein took Miss Cameron Hugh missus Elton and mister Arnold followed with Lady Emily who would never precede her older friend Hugh tried to talk to missus Elton but with meagre success He was suddenly a nobody and felt more than he had felt for a long time what in his present deteriorated moral state he considered the degradation of his position A gulf seemed to have suddenly yawned between himself and Euphra and the loudest voice of his despairing agony could not reach across that gulf An awful conviction awoke within him that the woman he worshipped would scarcely receive his worship at the worth of incense now and yet in spirit he fell down grovelling before his idol The words euphrasy and rue kept ringing in his brain coming over and over with an awful mingling of chime and toll When he thought about it afterwards he seemed to have been a year in crossing the hall with missus Elton on his arm But as if divining his thoughts just as they passed through the dining room door Euphra looked round at him almost over Funkelstein s shoulder and without putting into her face the least expression discernible by either of the others following contrived to banish for the time all Hugh s despair and to convince him that he had nothing to fear from Funkelstein How it was done Hugh himself could not tell He could not even recall the look He only knew that he had been as miserable as one waking in his coffin and that now he was out in the sunny air During dinner Funkelstein paid no very particular attention to Euphrasia but was remarkably polite to Lady Emily She seemed hardly to know how to receive his attentions but to regard him as a strange animal which she did not know how to treat and of which she was a little afraid missus Elton on the contrary appeared to be delighted with his behaviour and conversation for without showing the least originality he yet had seen so much and knew so well how to bring out what he had seen that he was a most interesting companion Hugh took little share in the conversation beyond listening as well as he could to prevent himself from gazing too much at Euphra Had mister Sutherland and you been old acquaintances then Herr von Funkelstein asked mister Arnold reverting to the conversation which had been interrupted by the announcement of dinner Not at all We met quite accidentally and introduced ourselves I believe a thunderstorm and a lecture on biology were the mediating parties between us Was it not so mister Sutherland I beg your pardon stammered Hugh But mister Arnold interposed A lecture on what did you say On biology mister Arnold looked posed He did not like to say he did not know what the word meant for like many more ignorant men he thought such a confession humiliating Von Funkelstein hastened to his relief It would be rather surprising if you were acquainted with the subject mister Arnold I fear to explain it to you lest both mister Sutherland and myself should sink irrecoverably in your estimation But young men want to know all that is going on Herr Funkelstein was not exactly what one would call a young man but as he chose to do so himself there was no one to dispute the classification Oh of course replied mister Arnold quite right What then pray is biology A science falsely so called said Hugh who waking up a little wanted to join in the conversation What does the word mean said mister Arnold Von Funkelstein answered at once The science of life But I must say the name as now applied is no indication of the thing signified How then is a gentleman to know what it is said mister Arnold half pettishly and forgetting that his knowledge had not extended even to the interpretation of the name It is one of the sciences true or false connected with animal magnetism Bah exclaimed mister Arnold rather rudely You would have said so if you had heard the lecture said Funkelstein The conversation had not taken this turn till quite late in the dining ceremony Euphra rose to go and Hugh remarked that her face was dreadfully pale But she walked steadily out of the room This interrupted the course of the talk and the subject was not resumed Immediately after tea which was served very soon Funkelstein took his leave of the ladies We shall be glad to see you often while in this neighbourhood said mister Arnold as he bade him good night I shall without fail do myself the honour of calling again soon replied he and bowed himself out Lady Emily evidently relieved by his departure rose and approaching Euphra said in a sweet coaxing tone which even she could hardly have resisted Dear Miss Cameron you promised to sing for me in particular some evening May I claim the fulfilment of your promise Euphra had recovered her complexion and she too seemed to Hugh to be relieved by the departure of Funkelstein Certainly she answered rising at once What shall I sing Hugh was all ear now Something sacred if you please Euphra hesitated but not long Shall I sing Mozart s Agnus Dei then Lady Emily hesitated in her turn I should prefer something else I don t approve of singing popish music however beautiful it may be Well what shall it be Something of Handel or Mendelssohn please Do you sing I know that my Redeemer liveth I daresay I can sing it replied Euphra with some petulance and went to the piano This was a favourite air with Hugh and he placed himself so as to see the singer without being seen himself and to lose no slightest modulation of her voice But what was his disappointment to find that oratorio music was just what Euphra was incapable of No doubt she sang it quite correctly but there was no religion in it Not a single tone worshipped or rejoiced The quality of sound necessary to express the feeling and thought of the composer was lacking the palace of sound was all right constructed but of wrong material Euphra however was quite unconscious of failure She did not care for the music but she attributed her lack of interest in it to the music itself never dreaming that in fact she had never really heard it having no inner ear for its deeper harmonies As soon as she had finished Lady Emily thanked her but did not praise her more than by saying I wish I had a voice like yours Miss Cameron I daresay you have a better of your own said Euphra falsely Lady Emily laughed It is the poorest little voice you ever heard yet I confess I am glad for my own sake that I have even that What should I do if I never heard Handel Every simple mind has a little well of beauty somewhere in its precincts which flows and warbles even when the owner is unheedful The religion of Lady Emily had led her into a region far beyond the reach of her intellect in which there sprang a constant fountain of sacred song To it she owed her highest moods Then Handel is your musician said Euphra You should not have put me to such a test It was very unfair of you Lady Emily Lady Emily laughed as if quite amused at the idea of having done Euphra any wrong Euphra added You must sing now Lady Emily You cannot refuse after the admission you have just made I confess it is only fair but I warn you to expect nothing She took her place at the piano and sang He shall feed his flock Her health had improved so much during her sojourn at Arnstead that when she began to sing the quantity of her voice surprised herself but after all it was a poor voice and the execution if clear of any great faults made no other pretence to merit Yet she effected the end of the music the very result which every musician would most desire wherein Euphra had failed utterly This was worthy of note and Hugh was not even yet too blind to perceive it Lady Emily with very ordinary intellect and paltry religious opinions yet because she was good herself and religious could in the reproduction of the highest kind of music greatly surpass the spirited intellectual musician whose voice was as superior to hers as a nightingale s to a sparrow s and whose knowledge of music and musical power generally surpassed hers beyond all comparison It must be allowed for Euphra that she seemed to have gained some perception of the fact Perhaps she had seen signs of emotion in Hugh s face which he had shaded with his hand as Lady Emily sang or perhaps the singing produced in her a feeling which she had not had when singing herself All I know is that the same night while Hugh was walking up and down his room meditating on this defect of Euphra s and yet feeling that if she could sing only devil s music he must love her a tap came to the door which made him start with the suggestion of the former mysterious noises of a similar kind that he sprang to the door and that instead of looking out on a vacant corridor as he all but anticipated he saw Euphra standing there in the dark who said in a whisper Ah you do not love me any longer because Lady Emily can sing psalms better than I can There was both pathos and spite in the speech Come in Euphra No I am afraid I have been very naughty in coming here at all Do come in I want you to tell me something about Funkelstein What do you want to know about him I suppose you are jealous of him Ah you men can both be jealous and make jealous at the same moment A little broken sigh followed Hugh answered I only want to know what he is Oh some twentieth cousin of mine mister Arnold does not know that Oh dear no It is so far off I can t count it In fact I doubt it altogether It must date centuries back His intimacy then is not to be accounted for by his relationship Ah ah I thought so Jealous of the poor count Count Oh dear what does it matter He doesn t like to be called Count because all foreigners are counts or barons or something equally distinguished I oughtn t to have let it out Never mind Tell me something about him He is a Bohemian I met him first some years ago on the continent Then that was not your first meeting at Sir Edward Laston s No How candid she is thought Hugh He calls me his cousin but if he be mine he is yet more mister Arnold s But he does not want it mentioned yet I am sure I don t know why Is he in love with you How can I tell she answered archly By his being very jealous Is that the way to know whether a man is in love with one But if he is in love with me it does not follow that I am in love with him does it Confess Am I not very good to answer all your impertinent downright questions They are as point blank as the church catechism mind I don t say as rude How can I be in love with two at a She seemed to cheek herself But Hugh had heard enough as she had intended he should She turned instantly and sped surrounded by the low melodious thunder of her silken garments to her own door where she vanished noiselessly What care I for oratorios said Hugh to himself as he put the light out towards morning Where was all this to end What goal had Hugh set himself Could he not go away and achieve renown in one of many ways and return fit in the eyes of the world to claim the hand of Miss Cameron But would he marry her if he could He would not answer the question He closed the ears of his heart to it and tried to go to sleep He slept and dreamed of Margaret in the storm A few days passed without anything occurring sufficiently marked for relation Euphra and he seemed satisfied without meeting in private Perhaps both were afraid of carrying it too far at least too far to keep clear of the risk of discovery seeing that danger was at present greater than usual mister Arnold continued to be thoroughly attentive to his guests and became more and more devoted to Lady Emily There was no saying where it might end for he was not an old man yet and Lady Emily appeared to have no special admirers Arnstead was such an abode and surrounded with such an estate as few even of the nobility could call their own And a reminiscence of his first wife seemed to haunt all mister Arnold s contemplations of Lady Emily and all his attentions to her These were delicate in the extreme evidently bringing out the best life that yet remained in a heart that was almost a fossil Hugh made some fresh efforts to do his duty by Harry and so far succeeded that at least the boy made some progress evident enough to the moderate expectations of his father But what helped Harry as much as anything was the motherly kindness even tenderness of good missus Elton who often had him to sit with her in her own room To her he generally fled for refuge when he felt deserted and lonely CHAPTER XVII MATERIALISM alias GHOST HUNTING Wie der Mond sich leuchtend dranget Durch den dunkeln Wolkenflor Also taucht aus dunkeln Zeiten Mir ein lichtes Bild hervor HEINRICH HEINE As the moon her face advances Through the darkened cloudy veil So from darkened times arising Dawns on me a vision pale In consequence of what Euphra had caused him to believe without saying it Hugh felt more friendly towards his new acquaintance and happening on his side at least it did happen to meet him a few days after walking in the neighbourhood he joined him in a stroll mister Arnold met them on horseback and invited Von Funkelstein to dine with them that evening to which he willingly consented It was noticeable that no sooner was the count within the doors of Arnstead House than he behaved with cordiality to every one of the company except Hugh With him he made no approach to familiarity of any kind treating him on the contrary with studious politeness In the course of the dinner mister Arnold said It is curious Herr von Funkelstein how often if you meet with something new to you you fall in with it again almost immediately I found an article on Biology in the newspaper the very day after our conversation on the subject But absurd as the whole thing is it is quite surpassed by a letter in to day s Times about spirit rapping and mediums and what not This observation of the host at once opened the whole question of those physico psychological phenomena to which the name of spiritualism has been so absurdly applied mister Arnold was profound in his contempt of the whole system if not very profound in his arguments against it Every one had something to remark in opposition to the notions which were so rapidly gaining ground in the country except Funkelstein who maintained a rigid silence This silence could not continue long without attracting the attention of the rest of the party upon which mister Arnold said You have not given us your opinion on the subject Herr von Funkelstein I have not mister Arnold I should not like to encounter the opposition of so many fair adversaries as well as of my host We are in England sir and every man is at liberty to say what he thinks For my part I think it all absurd if not improper I would not willingly differ from you mister Arnold And I confess that a great deal that finds its way into the public prints does seem very ridiculous indeed but I am bound for truth s sake to say that I have seen more than I can account for in that kind of thing There are strange stories connected with my own family which perhaps incline me to believe in the supernatural and indeed without making the smallest pretence to the dignity of what they call a medium I have myself had some curious experiences I fear I have some natural proclivity towards what you despise But I beg that my statement of my own feelings on the subject may not interfere in the least with the prosecution of the present conversation for I am quite capable of drawing pleasure from listening to what I am unable to agree with But let us hear your arguments strengthened by your facts in opposition to ours for it will be impossible to talk with a silent judge amongst us Hugh ventured to say I set up for no judge mister Sutherland I assure you and perhaps I shall do my opinions more justice by remaining silent seeing I am conscious of utter inability to answer the a priori arguments which you in particular have brought against them All I would venture to say is that an a priori argument may owe its force to a mistaken hypothesis with regard to the matter in question and that the true Baconian method which is the glory of your English philosophy would be to inquire first what the thing is by recording observations and experiments made in its supposed direction At least Herr von Funkelstein has the best of the argument now I am compelled to confess said Hugh Funkelstein bowed stiffly and was silent You rouse our curiosity said mister Arnold but I fear after the free utterance which we have already given to our own judgments in ignorance of course of your greater experience you will not be inclined to make us wiser by communicating any of the said experience however much we may desire to hear it Had he been speaking to one of less evident social standing than Funkelstein mister Arnold if dying with curiosity would not have expressed the least wish to be made acquainted with his experiences He would have sat in apparent indifference but in real anxiety that some one else would draw him out and thus gratify his curiosity without endangering his dignity I do not think replied Funkelstein that it is of any use to bring testimony to bear on such a matter I have seen to use the words of some one else I forget whom on a similar subject I have seen with my own eyes what I certainly should never have believed on the testimony of another Consequently I have no right to expect that my testimony should be received Besides I do not wish it to be received although I confess I shrink from presenting it with a certainty of its being rejected I have no wish to make converts to my opinions Really Herr von Funkelstein at the risk of your considering me importunate I would beg Excuse me mister Arnold The recital of some of the matters to which you refer would not only be painful to myself but would be agitating to the ladies present In that case I have only to beg your pardon for pressing the matter I hope no further than to the verge of incivility In no degree approaching it I assure you mister Arnold In proof that I do not think so I am ready if you wish it although I rather dread the possible effects on the nerves of the ladies especially as this is an old house to repeat with the aid of those present certain experiments which I have sometimes found perhaps only too successful Oh I don t said Euphra faintly An expression of the opposite desire followed however from the other ladies Their curiosity seemed to strive with their fears and to overcome them I hope we shall have nothing to do with it in any other way than merely as spectators said missus Elton Nothing more than you please It is doubtful if you can even be spectators That remains to be seen Good gracious exclaimed missus Elton Lady Emily looked at her with surprise almost reproof I beg your pardon my dear but it sounds so dreadful What can it be Let me entreat you ladies not to imagine that I am urging you to anything said Funkelstein Not in the least replied missus Elton I was very foolish And the old lady looked ashamed and was silent Then if you will allow me I will make one small preparation Have you a tool chest anywhere mister Arnold There must be tools enough about the place I know I will ring for Atkins I know where the tool chest is said Hugh and if you will allow me a suggestion would it not be better the servants should know nothing about this There are some foolish stories afloat amongst them already A very proper suggestion mister Sutherland said mister Arnold graciously Will you find all that is wanted then What tools do you want asked Hugh Only a small drill Could you get me an earthenware plate not china too I will manage that said Euphra Hugh soon returned with the drill and Euphra with the plate The Bohemian with some difficulty and the remark that the English ware was very hard drilled a small hole in the rim of the plate a dinner plate then begging an H B drawing pencil from Miss Cameron cut off a small piece and fitted it into the hole making it just long enough to touch the table with its point when the plate lay in its ordinary position Now I am ready said he But he added raising his head and looking all round the room as if a sudden thought had struck him I do not think this room will be quite satisfactory They were now in the drawing room Choose the room in the house that will suit you said mister Arnold The dining room Certainly not answered Funkelstein as he took from his watch chain a small compass and laid it on the table Not the dining room nor the breakfast room I think Let me see how is it situated He went to the hall as if to refresh his memory and then looked again at the compass No not the breakfast room Hugh could not help thinking there was more or less of the charlatan about the man The library suggested Lady Emily They adjourned to the library to see The library would do After some further difficulty they succeeded in procuring a large sheet of paper and fastening it down to the table by drawing pins Only two candles were in the great room and it was scarcely lighted at all by them yet Funkelstein requested that one of these should be extinguished and the other removed to a table near the door He then said solemnly Let me request silence absolute silence and quiescence of thought even After stillness had settled down with outspread wings of intensity he resumed Will any one or better two of you touch the plate as lightly as possible with your fingers All hung back for a moment Then mister Arnold came forward I will said he and laid his fingers on the plate As lightly as possible if you please If the plate moves follow it with your fingers but be sure not to push it in any direction I understand said mister Arnold and silence fell again The Bohemian after a pause spoke once more but in a foreign tongue The words sounded first like entreaty then like command and at last almost like imprecation The ladies shuddered Any movement of the vehicle said he to mister Arnold If by the vehicle you mean the plate certainly not said mister Arnold solemnly But the ladies were very glad of the pretext for attempting a laugh in order to get rid of the oppression which they had felt for some time Hush said Funkelstein solemnly Will no one else touch the plate as well It will seldom move with one It does with me But I fear I might be suspected of treachery if I offered to join mister Arnold Do not hint at such a thing You are beyond suspicion What ground mister Arnold had for making such an assertion was no better known to himself than to any one else present Von Funkelstein without another word put the fingers of one hand lightly on the plate beside mister Arnold s The plate instantly began to move upon the paper The motion was a succession of small jerks at first but soon it tilted up a little and moved upon a changing point of support Now it careered rapidly in wavy lines sweeping back towards the other side as often as it approached the extremity of the sheet the men keeping their fingers in contact with it but not appearing to influence its motion Gradually the motion ceased Von Funkelstein withdrew his hand and requested that the other candle should be lighted The paper was taken up and examined Nothing could be discovered upon it but a labyrinth of wavy and sweepy lines Funkelstein pored over it for some minutes and then confessed his inability to make a single letter out of it still less words and sentences as he had expected But said he we are at least so far successful it moves Let us try again Who will try next I will said Hugh who had refrained at first partly from dislike to the whole affair partly because he shrank from putting himself forward A new sheet of paper was fixed The candle was extinguished Hugh put his fingers on the plate In a second or two it began to move A medium murmured Funkelstein He then spoke aloud some words unintelligible to the rest Whether from the peculiarity of his position and the consequent excitement of his imagination or from some other cause Hugh grew quite cold and began to tremble The plate which had been careering violently for a few moments now went more slowly making regular short motions and returns at right angles to its chief direction as if letters were being formed by the pencil Hugh shuddered thinking he recognised the letters as they grew The writing ceased The candles were brought Yes there it was not plain but easily decipherable David Elginbrod Hugh felt sick Euphra looking on beside him whispered What an odd name Who can it mean He made no reply Neither of the other ladies saw it for missus Elton had discovered the moment the second candle was lighted that Lady Emily was either asleep or in a faint She was soon all but satisfied that she was asleep Hugh s opinion gathered from what followed was that the Bohemian had not been so intent on the operations with the plate as he had appeared to be and that he had been employing part of his energy in mesmerising Lady Emily missus Elton remembering that she had had quite a long walk that morning was not much alarmed Unwilling to make a disturbance she rang the bell very quietly and going to the door asked the servant who answered it to send her maid with some eau de cologne Meantime the gentlemen had been too much absorbed to take any notice of her proceedings and after removing the one and extinguishing the other candle had reverted to the plate Hugh was still the operator Von Funkelstein spoke again in an unknown tongue The plate began to move as before After only a second or two of preparatory gyration Hugh felt that it was writing Turriepuffit and shook from head to foot Suddenly in the middle of the word the plate ceased its motion and lay perfectly still Hugh felt a kind of surprise come upon him as if he waked from an unpleasant dream and saw the sun shining The morbid excitement of his nervous system had suddenly ceased and a healthful sense of strength and every day life took its place Simultaneously with the stopping of the plate and this new feeling which I have tried to describe Hugh involuntarily raised his eyes towards the door of the room In the all but darkness between him and the door he saw a pale beautiful face a face only It was the face of Margaret Elginbrod not however such as he had used to see it but glorified That was the only word by which he could describe its new aspect A mist of darkness fell upon his brain and the room swam round with him But he was saved from falling or attracting attention to a weakness for which he could have made no excuse by a sudden cry from Lady Emily See see she cried wildly pointing towards one of the windows These looked across to another part of the house one of the oldest at some distance One of its windows apparently on the first floor shone with a faint bluish light All the company had hurried to the window at Lady Emily s exclamation Who can be in that part of the house said mister Arnold angrily It is Lady Euphrasia s window said Euphra in a low voice the tone of which suggested somehow that the speaker was very cold What do you mean by speaking like that said mister Arnold forgetting his dignity Surely you are above being superstitious Is it possible the servants could be about any mischief I will discharge any one at once that dares go there without permission The light disappeared fading slowly out Indeed the servants are all too much alarmed after what took place last year to go near that wing much less that room said Euphra Besides missus Horton has all the keys in her own charge Go yourself and get me them Euphra I will see at once what this means Don t say why you want them Certainly not uncle Hugh had recovered almost instantaneously Though full of amazement he had yet his perceptive faculties sufficiently unimpaired to recognise the real source of the light in the window It seemed to him more like moonlight than anything else and he thought the others would have seen it to be such but for the effect of Lady Emily s sudden exclamation Perhaps she was under the influence of the Bohemian at the moment Certainly they were all in a tolerable condition for seeing whatever might be required of them True there was no moon to be seen and if it was the moon why did the light go out But he found afterwards that he had been right The house stood upon a rising ground and every recurring cycle the moon would shine through a certain vista of trees and branches upon Lady Euphrasia s window provided there had been no growth of twigs to stop up the channel of the light which was so narrow that in a few moments the moon had crossed it A gap in a hedge made by a bull that morning had removed the last screen Lady Euphrasia s window was so neglected and dusty that it could reflect nothing more than a dim bluish shimmer Will you all accompany me ladies and gentlemen that you may see with your own eyes that there is nothing dangerous in the house said mister Arnold Of course Funkelstein was quite ready and Hugh as well although he felt at this moment ill fitted for ghost hunting The ladies hesitated but at last more afraid of being left behind alone than of going with the gentlemen they consented Euphra brought the keys and they commenced their march of investigation Up the grand staircase they went mister Arnold first with the keys Hugh next with missus Elton and Lady Emily and the Bohemian considerably to Hugh s dissatisfaction bringing up the rear with Euphra This misarrangement did more than anything else could have done to deaden for the time the distraction of feeling produced in Hugh s mind by the events of the last few minutes Yet even now he seemed to be wandering through the old house in a dream instead of following mister Arnold whose presence might well have been sufficient to destroy any illusion except such as a Chinese screen might superinduce for possessed of far less imagination than a horse he was incapable of any terrors but such as had to do with robbers or fire or chartists which latter fear included both the former He strode on securely carrying a candle in one hand and the keys in the other Each of the other gentlemen likewise bore a light They had to go through doors some locked some open following a different route from that taken by Euphra on a former occasion But mister Arnold found the keys troublesome He could not easily distinguish those he wanted and was compelled to apply to Euphra She left Funkelstein in consequence and walked in front with her uncle Her former companion got beside Lady Emily and as they could not well walk four abreast she fell behind with him So Hugh got next to Euphra behind her and was comforted At length by tortuous ways across old rooms and up and down abrupt little stairs they reached the door of Lady Euphrasia s room The key was found and the door opened with some perturbation manifest on the part of the ladies and concealed on the part of the men The place was quite dark They entered and Hugh was greatly struck with its strange antiquity Lady Euphrasia s ghost had driven the last occupant out of it nearly a hundred years ago but most of the furniture was much older than that having probably belonged to Lady Euphrasia herself The room remained just as the said last occupant had left it Even the bed clothes remained folded down as if expecting their occupant for the last hundred years The fine linen had grown yellow and the rich counterpane lay like a churchyard after the resurrection full of the open graves of the liberated moths On the wall hung the portrait of a nun in convent attire Some have taken that for a second portrait of Lady Euphrasia said mister Arnold but it cannot be Euphra we will go back through the picture gallery I suspect it of originating the tradition that Lady Euphrasia became a nun at last I do not believe it myself The picture is certainly old enough to stand for her but it does not seem to me in the least like the other It was a great room with large recesses and therefore irregular in form Old chairs with remnants of enamel and gilding and seats of faded damask stood all about But the beauty of the chamber was its tapestry The walls were entirely covered with it and the rich colours had not yet receded into the dull grey of the past though their gorgeousness had become sombre with age The subject was the story of Samson Come and see this strange piece of furniture said Euphra to Hugh who had kept by her side since they entered this room She led him into one of the recesses almost concealed by the bed hangings In it stood a cabinet of ebony reaching nearly to the ceiling curiously carved in high relief I wish I could show you the inside of it she went on but I cannot now This was said almost in a whisper Hugh replied with only a look of thanks He gazed at the carving on whose black surface his candle made little light and threw no shadows You have looked at this before Euphra said he Explain it to me I have often tried to find out what it is she answered but I never could quite satisfy myself about it She proceeded however to tell him what she fancied it might mean speaking still in the low tone which seemed suitable to the awe of the place She got interested in showing him the relations of the different figures and he made several suggestions as to the possible intention of the artist More than one well known subject was proposed and rejected Suddenly becoming aware of the sensation of silence they looked up and saw that theirs was the only light in the room They were left alone in the haunted chamber They looked at each other for one moment then said with half stifled voices Euphra Hugh Euphra seemed half amused and half perplexed Hugh looked half perplexed and wholly pleased Come come said Euphra recovering herself and leading the way to the door When they reached it they found it closed and locked Euphra raised her hand to beat on it Hugh caught it You will drive Lady Emily into fits Did you not see how awfully pale she was Euphra instantly lifted her hand again as if she would just like to try that result But Hugh who was in no haste for any result held her back She struggled for a moment or two but not very strenuously and desisting all at once let her arms drop by her sides I fear it is too late This is a double door and mister Arnold will have locked all the doors between this and the picture gallery They are there now What shall we do She said this with an expression of comical despair which would have made Hugh burst into laughter had he not been too much pleased to laugh Never mind he said we will go on with our study of the cabinet They will soon find out that we are left behind and come back to look for us Yes but only fancy being found here She laughed but the laugh did not succeed It could not hide a real embarrassment She pondered and seemed irresolute Then with the words They will say we stayed behind on purpose she moved her hand to the door but again withdrew it and stood irresolute Let us put out the light said Hugh laughing and make no answer Can you starve well With you She murmured something to herself then said aloud and hastily as if she had made up her mind by the compulsion of circumstances But this won t do They are still looking at the portrait I daresay Come So saying she went into another recess and lifting a curtain of tapestry opened a door Come quick she said Hugh followed her down a short stair into a narrow passage nowhere lighted from the outside The door went to behind them as if some one had banged it in anger at their intrusion The passage smelt very musty and was as quiet as death Not a word of this Hugh as you love me It may be useful yet Not a word They came through a sliding panel into an empty room Euphra closed it behind them Now shade your light He did so She took him by the hand A few more turns brought them in sight of the lights of the rest of the party As Euphra had conjectured they were looking at the picture of Lady Euphrasia mister Arnold prosing away to them in proof that the nun could not be she They entered the gallery without being heard and parting a little way one pretending to look at one picture the other at another crept gradually round till they joined the group It was a piece of most successful generalship Euphra was doubtless quite prepared with her story in case it should fail Dear Lady Emily said she how tired you look Do let us go uncle By all means Take my arm Lady Emily Euphra will you take the keys again and lock the doors missus Elton had already taken Hugh s arm and was leading him away after mister Arnold and Lady Emily I will not leave you behind with the spectres Miss Cameron said Funkelstein Thank you they will not detain me long They don t mind being locked up It was some little time however before they presented themselves in the drawing room to which and not to the library the party had gone they had had enough of horrors for that night Lest my readers should think they have had too many wonders at least I will explain one of them It was really Margaret Elginbrod whom Hugh had seen missus Elton was the lady in whose service she had left her home It was nothing strange that they had not met for Margaret knew he was in the same house and had several times seen him but had avoided meeting him Neither was it a wonderful coincidence that they should be in such close proximity for the college friend from whom Hugh had first heard of mister Arnold was the son of the gentleman whom missus Elton was visiting when she first saw Margaret Margaret had obeyed her mistress s summons to the drawing room and had entered while Hugh was stooping over the plate As the room was nearly dark and she was dressed in black her pale face alone caught the light and his eye as he looked up and the giddiness which followed had prevented him from seeing more She left the room the next moment while they were all looking out of the window Nor was it any exercise of his excited imagination that had presented her face as glorified She was now a woman and there being no divine law against saying so I say that she had grown a lady as well as indeed any one might have foreseen who was capable of foreseeing it Her whole nature had blossomed into a still stately lily like beauty and the face that Hugh saw was indeed the realised idea of the former face of Margaret But how did the plate move and whence came the writing of old David s name I must for the present leave the whole matter to the speculative power of each of my readers But Margaret was in mourning was David indeed dead He was dead Yet his name will stand as the name of my story for pages to come because if he had not been in it the story would never have been worth writing because the influence of that ploughman is the salt of the whole because a man s life in the earth is not to be measured by the time he is visible upon it and because when the story is wound up it will be in the presence of his spirit Do I then believe that David himself did write that name of his Heaven forbid that any friend of mine should be able to believe it Long before she saw him Margaret had known from what she heard among the servants that Master Harry s tutor could be no other than her own tutor of the old time By and by she learned a great deal about him from Harry s talk with missus Elton and Lady Emily But she did not give the least hint that she knew him or betray the least desire to see him missus Elton was amusingly bewildered by the occurrences of the evening Her theories were something astounding and followed one another with such alarming rapidity that had they been in themselves such as to imply the smallest exercise of the thinking faculty she might well have been considered in danger of an attack of brain fever As it was none such supervened Lady Emily said nothing but seemed unhappy As for Hugh he simply could not tell what to make of the writing But he did not for a moment doubt that the vision he had seen was only a vision a home made ghost sent out from his own creative brain Still he felt that Margaret s face come whence it might was a living reproof to him for he was losing his life in passion sinking deeper in it day by day His powers were deserting him Poetry usually supposed to be the attendant of love had deserted him Only by fits could he see anything beautiful and then it was but in closest association of thought with the one image which was burning itself deeper and deeper into his mental sensorium Come what might he could not tear it away It had become a part of himself of his inner life even while it seemed to be working the death of life Deeper and deeper it would burn till it reached the innermost chamber of life Let it burn Yet he felt that he could not trust her Vague hopes he had that by trusting she might be made trustworthy but he feared they were vain as well as vague And yet he would not cast them away for he could not cast her away CHAPTER XVIII MORE MATERIALISM AND SOME SPIRITUALISM God wisheth none should wreck on a strange shelf To Him man s dearer than to himself BEN Jonson The Forest To Sir Robert Wroth At breakfast the following morning the influences of the past day on the family were evident There was a good deal of excitement alternated with listlessness The moral atmosphere seemed unhealthy and Harry although he had fortunately for him had nothing to do with the manifestations of the previous evening was affected by the condition of those around him Hugh was still careful enough of him to try to divert the conversation entirely from what he knew would have a very injurious effect upon him and mister Arnold seeing the anxious way in which he glanced now and then at his pupil and divining the reason by the instinct of his affection with far more than his usual acuteness tried likewise to turn it aside as often as it inclined that way Still a few words were let fall by the visitors which made Harry stare Hugh took him away as soon as breakfast was over In the afternoon Funkelstein called to inquire after the ladies and hoped he had no injury to their health to lay on his conscience mister Arnold who had a full allowance of curiosity its amount being frequently in an inverse ratio to that of higher intellectual gifts begged him to spend the rest of the day with them but not to say a word of what had passed the day before till after Harry had retired for the night Renewed conversation led to renewed experiments in the library Hugh however refused to have anything more to do with the plate writing for he dreaded its influence on his physical nature attributing as I have said the vision of Margaret to a cerebral affection And the plate did not seem to work satisfactorily with any one else except Funkelstein who for his part had no great wish to operate Recourse was had to a more vulgar method that of expectant solicitation of those noises whereby the prisoners in the aerial vaults are supposed capable of communicating with those in this earthly cell Certainly raps were heard from some quarter or another and when the lights were extinguished and the crescent moon only allowed to shine in the room some commotion was discernible amongst the furniture Several light articles flew about A pen wiper alighted on Euphra s lap and a sofa pillow gently disarranged missus Elton s cap Most of the artillery however was directed against Lady Emily and she it was who saw in a faint stream of moonlight a female arm uplifted towards her from under a table with a threatening motion It was bare to the elbow and draped above It showed first a clenched fist and next an open hand palm outwards making a repellent gesture Then the back of the hand was turned and it motioned her away as if she had been an importunate beggar But at this moment one of the doors opened and a dark figure passed through the room towards the opposite door Everything that could be called ghostly ceased instantaneously The arm vanished The company breathed more freely Lady Emily who had been on the point of going into hysterics recovered herself and overcame the still lingering impulse she felt as if she had awaked from a momentary aberration of the intellect mister Arnold proceeded to light the candles saying in a righteous tone I think we have had enough of this nonsense When the candles were lighted there was no one to be seen in the room besides themselves Several Hugh amongst them had observed the figure but all had taken it for part of the illusive phantasmagoria Hugh would have concluded it a variety of his vision of the former night but others had seen it as well as he There was no renewal of the experiments that night But all were in a very unhealthy state of excitement Vague fear vague wonder and a certain indescribable oppression had dimmed for the time all the clearer vision and benumbed all the nobler faculties of the soul Lady Emily was affected the most Her eyes looked scared there was a bright spot on one cheek amidst deathly paleness and she seemed very unhappy missus Elton became alarmed and this brought her back to a more rational condition She persuaded Lady Emily to go to bed But the contagion spread and indistinct terrors were no longer confined to the upper portions of the family The bruit revived which had broken out a year before that the house was haunted It was whispered that the very night after these occurrences the Ghost s Walk had been in use as the name signified a figure in death garments had been seen gliding along the deserted avenue by one of the maid servants the truth of whose story was corroborated by the fact that to support it she did not hesitate to confess that she had escaped from the house nearly at midnight to meet one of the grooms in a part of the wood contiguous to the avenue in question mister Arnold instantly dismissed her not on the ground of the intrigue he took care to let her know although that was bad enough but because she was a fool and spread absurd and annoying reports about the house mister Arnold s usual hatred of what he called superstition was rendered yet more spiteful by the fact that the occurrences of the week had had such an effect on his own mind that he was mortally afraid lest he should himself sink into the same limbo of vanity The girl however was or pretended to be quite satisfied with her discharge protesting she would not have staid for the world and as the groom whose wages happened to have been paid the day before took himself off the same evening it may be hoped her satisfaction was not altogether counterfeit If all tales be true said missus Elton Lady Euphrasia is where she can t get out But if she repented before she died said Euphra with a muffled scorn in her tone My dear Miss Cameron do you call becoming a nun repentance We Protestants know very well what that means Besides your uncle does not believe it Haven t you found out yet dear missus Elton what my uncle s favourite phrase is No What is it I don t believe it You naughty girl I m not naughty answered Euphra affecting to imitate the simplicity of a chidden child My uncle is so fond of casting doubt upon everything If salvation goes by quantity his faith won t save him Euphra knew well enough that missus Elton was no tell tale The good lady had hopes of her from this moment because she all but quoted Scripture to condemn her uncle the verdict corresponding with her own judgment of mister Arnold founded on the clearest assertions of Scripture strengthened somewhat it must be confessed by the fact that the spirits on the preceding evening but one had rapped out the sentence Without faith it is impossible to please him Lady Emily was still in bed but apparently more sick in mind than in body She said she had tossed about all the previous night without once falling asleep and her maid who had slept in the dressing room without waking once corroborated the assertion In the morning missus Elton wishing to relieve the maid sent Margaret to Lady Emily Margaret arranged the bedclothes and pillows which were in a very uncomfortable condition sat down behind the curtain and knowing that it would please Lady Emily began to sing in what the French call a veiled voice The Land o the Leal Now the air of this lovely song is the same as that of Scots wha hae but it is the pibroch of onset changed into the coronach of repose singing of the land beyond the battle of the entering in of those who have fought the good fight and fallen in the field It is the silence after the thunder Before she had finished Lady Emily was fast asleep A sweet peaceful half smile lighted her troubled face graciously like the sunshine that creeps out when it can amidst the rain of an autumn day saying I am with you still though we are all troubled Finding her thus at rest Margaret left the room for a minute to fetch some work When she returned she found her tossing and moaning and apparently on the point of waking As soon as she sat down by her her trouble diminished by degrees till she lay in the same peaceful sleep as before In this state she continued for two or three hours and awoke much refreshed She held out her little hand to Margaret and said Thank you Thank you What a sweet creature you are And Lady Emily lay and gazed in loving admiration at the face of the lady s maid Shall I send Sarah to you now my lady said Margaret or would you like me to stay with you Oh you you please if missus Elton can spare you She will only think of your comfort I know my lady That recalls me to my duty and makes me think of her But your comfort will be more to her than anything else In that case you must stay Margaret With pleasure my lady missus Elton entered and quite confirmed what Margaret had said But she added it is time Lady Emily had something to eat Go to the cook Margaret and see if the beef tea Miss Cameron ordered is ready Margaret went What a comfort it is said missus Elton wishing to interest Lady Emily that now a days when infidelity is so rampant such corroborations of Sacred Writ are springing up on all sides There are the discoveries at Nineveh and now these Spiritual Manifestations which bear witness so clearly to another world But Lady Emily made no reply She began to toss about as before and show signs of inexplicable discomfort Margaret had hardly been gone two minutes when the invalid moaned out What a time Margaret is gone when will she be back I am here my love said missus Elton Yes yes thank you But I want Margaret She will be here presently Have patience my dear Please don t let Miss Cameron come near me I am afraid I am very wicked but I can t bear her to come near me No no dear we will keep you to ourselves Is mister the foreign gentleman I mean below No He is gone Are you sure I can hardly believe it What do you mean dear I am sure he is gone Lady Emily did not answer Margaret returned She took the beef tea and grew quiet again You must not leave her ladyship Margaret whispered her mistress She has taken it into her head to like no one but you and you must just stay with her Very well ma am I shall be most happy missus Elton left the room Lady Emily said Read something to me Margaret What shall I read Anything you like Margaret got a Bible and read to her one of her father s favourite chapters the fortieth of Isaiah I have no right to trust in God Margaret Why my lady Because I do not feel any faith in him and you know we cannot be accepted without faith That is to make God as changeable as we are my lady But the Bible says so I don t think it does but if an angel from heaven said so I would not believe it Margaret My lady I love God with all my heart and I cannot bear you should think so of him You might as well say that a mother would go away from her little child lying moaning in the dark because it could not see her and was afraid to put its hand out into the dark to feel for her Then you think he does care for us even when we are very wicked But he cannot bear wicked people Who dares to say that cried Margaret Has he not been making the world go on and on with all the wickedness that is in it yes making new babies to be born of thieves and murderers and sad women and all for hundreds of years God help us Lady Emily If he cannot bear wicked people then this world is hell itself and the Bible is all a lie and the Saviour did never die for sinners It is only the holy Pharisees that can t bear wicked people Oh how happy I should be if that were true I should not be afraid now You are not wicked dear Lady Emily but if you were God would bend over you trying to get you back like a father over his sick child Will people never believe about the lost sheep Oh yes I believe that But then You can t trust it quite Trust in God then the very father of you and never mind the words You have been taught to turn the very words of God against himself Lady Emily was weeping Lady Emily Margaret went on if I felt my heart as hard as a stone if I did not love God or man or woman or little child I would yet say to God in my heart O God see how I trust thee because thou art perfect and not changeable like me I do not love thee I love nobody I am not even sorry for it Thou seest how much I need thee to come close to me to put thy arm round me to say to me my child for the worse my state the greater my need of my father who loves me Come to me and my day will dawn My beauty and my love will come back and oh how I shall love thee my God and know that my love is thy love my blessedness thy being As Margaret spoke she seemed to have forgotten Lady Emily s presence and to be actually praying Those who cannot receive such words from the lips of a lady s maid must be reminded what her father was and that she had lost him She had had advantages at least equal to those which David the Shepherd had and he wrote the Psalms She ended with I do not even desire thee to come yet come thou She seemed to pray entirely as Lady Emily not as Margaret When she had ceased Lady Emily said sobbing You will not leave me Margaret I will tell you why another time I will not leave you my dear lady Margaret stooped and kissed her forehead Lady Emily threw her arms round her neck and offered her mouth to be kissed by the maid In another minute she was fast asleep with Margaret seated by her side every now and then glancing up at her from her work with a calm face over which brooded the mist of tears That night as Hugh paced up and down the floor of his study about midnight he was awfully startled by the sudden opening of the door and the apparition of Harry in his nightshirt pale as death and scarcely able to articulate the words The ghost the ghost He took the poor boy in his arms held him fast and comforted him When he was a little soothed Oh Harry he said lightly you ve been dreaming Where s the ghost In the Ghost s Walk cried Harry almost shrieking anew with terror How do you know it is there I saw it from my window I couldn t sleep I got up and looked out I don t know why and I saw it I saw it The words were followed by a long cry of terror Come and show it to me said Hugh wanting to make light of it No no mister Sutherland please not I couldn t go back into that room Very well dear Harry you shan t go back You shall sleep with me to night Oh thank you thank you dear mister Sutherland You will love me again won t you This touched Hugh s heart He could hardly refrain from tears His old love buried before it was dead revived He clasped the boy to his heart and carried him to his own bed then to comfort him undressed and lay down beside him without even going to look if he too might not see the ghost She had brought about one good thing at least that night though I fear she had no merit in it Lady Emily s room likewise looked out upon the Ghost s Walk Margaret heard the cry as she sat by the sleeping Emily and not knowing whence it came went naturally enough in her perplexity to the window From it she could see distinctly for it was clear moonlight a white figure went gliding away along the deserted avenue She immediately guessed what the cry had meant but as she had heard a door bang directly after as Harry shut his behind him with a terrified instinct to keep the awful window in she was not very uneasy about him She felt besides that she must remain where she was according to her promise to Lady Emily But she resolved to be prepared for the possible recurrence of the same event and accordingly revolved it in her mind She was sure that any report of it coming to Lady Emily s ears would greatly impede her recovery for she instinctively felt that her illness had something to do with the questionable occupations in the library She watched by her bedside all the night slumbering at times but roused in a moment by any restlessness of the patient when she found that simply by laying her hand on hers or kissing her forehead she could restore her at once to quiet sleep CHAPTER XIX THE GHOST S WALK Thierry Tis full of fearful shadows Ordella So is sleep sir Or anything that s merely ours and mortal We were begotten gods else But those fears Feeling but once the fires of nobler thoughts Fly like the shapes of clouds we form to nothing BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER Thierry and Theodoret Margaret sat watching the waking of Lady Emily Knowing how much the first thought colours the feeling of the whole day she wished that Lady Emily should at once be aware that she was by her side She opened her eyes and a smile broke over her face when she perceived her nurse But Margaret did not yet speak to her Every nurse should remember that waking ought always to be a gradual operation and except in the most triumphant health is never complete on the opening of the eyes Margaret I am better said Lady Emily at last I am very glad my lady I have been lying awake for some time and I am sure I am better I don t see strange coloured figures floating about the room as I did yesterday Were you not out of the room a few minutes ago Just for one moment my lady I knew it But I did not mind it Yesterday when you left me those figures grew ten times as many the moment you were gone But you will stay with me to day too Margaret she added with some anxiety I will if you find you need me But I may be forced to leave you a little while this evening you must try to allow me this dear Lady Emily Of course I will I will be quite patient I promise you whatever comes to me When Harry woke after a very troubled sleep from which he had often started with sudden cries of terror Hugh made him promise not to increase the confusion of the household by speaking of what he had seen Harry promised at once but begged in his turn that Hugh would not leave him all day It did not need the pale scared face of his pupil to enforce the request for Hugh was already anxious lest the fright the boy had had should exercise a permanently deleterious effect on his constitution Therefore he hardly let him out of his sight But although Harry kept his word the cloud of perturbation gathered thicker in the kitchen and the servants hall Nothing came to the ears of their master and mistress but gloomy looks sudden starts and sidelong glances of fear indicated the prevailing character of the feelings of the household And although Lady Emily was not so ill she had not yet taken a decided turn for the better but appeared to suffer from some kind of low fever The medical man who was called in confessed to missus Elton that as yet he could say nothing very decided about her condition but recommended great quiet and careful nursing Margaret scarcely left her room and the invalid showed far more than the ordinary degree of dependence upon her nurse In her relation to her she was more like a child than an invalid About noon she was better She called Margaret and said to her Margaret dear I should like to tell you one thing that annoys me very much What is it dear Lady Emily That man haunts me I cannot bear the thought of him and yet I cannot get rid of him I am sure he is a bad man Are you certain he is not here Yes indeed my lady He has not been here since the day before yesterday And yet when you leave me for an instant I always feel as if he were sitting in the very seat where you were the moment before or just coming to the door and about to open it That is why I cannot bear you to leave me Margaret might have confessed to some slighter sensations of the same kind but they did not oppress her as they did Lady Emily God is nearer to you than any thought or feeling of yours Lady Emily Do not be afraid If all the evil things in the universe were around us they could not come inside the ring that he makes about us He always keeps a place for himself and his child into which no other being can enter Oh how you must love God Margaret Indeed I do love him my lady If ever anything looks beautiful or lovely to me then I know at once that God is that But then what right have we to take the good of that however true it is when we are not beautiful ourselves That only makes God the more beautiful in that he will pour out the more of his beauty upon us to make us beautiful If we care for his glory we shall be glad to believe all this about him But we are too anxious about feeling good ourselves to rejoice in his perfect goodness I think we should find that enough my lady For if he be good are not we his children and sure of having it not merely feeling it some day Here Margaret repeated a little poem of George Herbert s She had found his poems amongst missus Elton s books who coming upon her absorbed in it one day had made her a present of the volume Then indeed Margaret had found a friend The poem is called Dialogue Sweetest Saviour if my soul Were but worth the having Oh what a comfort you are to me Margaret Lady Emily said after a short silence Where did you learn such things From my father and from Jesus Christ and from God himself showing them to me in my heart Ah that is why as often as you come into my room even if I am very troubled I feel as if the sun shone and the wind blew and the birds sang and the tree tops went waving in the wind as they used to do before I was taken ill I mean before they thought I must go abroad You seem to make everything clear and right and plain I wish I were you Margaret If I were you my lady I would rather be what God chose to make me than the most glorious creature that I could think of For to have been thought about born in God s thoughts and then made by God is the dearest grandest most precious thing in all thinking Is it not my lady It is said Lady Emily and was silent The shadows of evening came on As soon as it was dark Margaret took her place at one of the windows hidden from Lady Emily by a bed curtain She raised the blind and pulled aside one curtain to let her have a view of the trees outside She had placed the one candle so as not to shine either on the window or on her own eyes Lady Emily was asleep One hour and another passed and still she sat there motionless watching Margaret did not know that at another window the one indeed next to her own stood a second watcher It was Hugh in Harry s room Harry was asleep in Hugh s He had no light He stood with his face close against the windowpane on which the moon shone brightly All below him the woods were half dissolved away in the moonlight The Ghost s Walk lay full before him like a tunnel through the trees He could see a great way down by the light that fell into it at various intervals from between the boughs overhead He stood thus for a long time gazing somewhat listlessly Suddenly he became all eyes as he caught the white glimmer of something passing up the avenue He stole out of the room down to the library by the back stair and so through the library window into the wood He reached the avenue sideways at some distance from the house and peeped from behind a tree up and down At first he saw nothing But a moment after while he was looking down the avenue that is away from the house a veiled figure in white passed him noiselessly from the other direction From the way in which he was looking at the moment it had passed him before he saw it It made no sound Only some early fallen leaves rustled as they hurried away in uncertain eddies startled by the sweep of its trailing garments which yet were held up by hands hidden within them On it went Hugh s eyes were fixed on its course He could not move and his heart laboured so frightfully that he could hardly breathe The figure had not advanced far however before he heard a repressed cry of agony and it sank to the earth and vanished while from where it disappeared down the path came silently too turning neither to the right nor the left a second figure veiled in black from head to foot It is the nun in Lady Euphrasia s room said Hugh to himself This passed him too and walking slowly towards the house disappeared somewhere near the end of the avenue Turning once more with reviving courage for his blood had begun to flow more equably Hugh ventured to approach the spot where the white figure had vanished He found nothing there but the shadow of a huge tree He walked through the avenue to the end and then back to the house but saw nothing though he often started at fancied appearances Sorely bewildered he returned to his own room After speculating till thought was weary he lay down beside Harry whom he was thankful to find in a still repose and fell fast asleep Margaret lay on a couch in Lady Emily s room and slept likewise but she started wide awake at every moan of the invalid who often moaned in her sleep CHAPTER XX THE BAD MAN She kent he was nae gentle knight That she had letten in For neither when he gaed nor cam Kissed he her cheek or chin He neither kissed her when he cam Nor clappit her when he gaed And in and out at her bower window The moon shone like the gleed Glenkindie Old Scotch Ballad When Euphra recovered from the swoon into which she had fallen for I need hardly explain to my readers that it was she who walked the Ghost s Walk in white on seeing Margaret whom under the irresistible influences of the moonlight and a bad conscience she took for the very being whom Euphra herself was personating when she recovered I say she found herself lying in the wood with Funkelstein whom she had gone to meet standing beside her Her first words were of anger as she tried to rise and found she could not How long Count Halkar am I to be your slave Till you have learned to submit Have I not done all I can You have not found it You are free from the moment you place that ring belonging to me in right of my family into my hands I do not believe that the man really was Count Halkar although he had evidently persuaded Euphra that such was his name and title I think it much more probable that in the course of picking up a mass of trifling information about various families of distinction for which his position of secretary in several of their houses had afforded him special facilities he had learned something about the Halkar family and this particular ring of which for some reason or other he wanted to possess himself What more can I do moaned Euphra succeeding at length in raising herself to a sitting posture and leaning thus against a tree I shall be found out some day I have been already seen wandering through the house at midnight with the heart of a thief I hate you Count Halkar A low laugh was the count s only reply And now Lady Euphrasia herself dogs my steps to keep me from the ring She gave a low cry of agony at the remembrance Miss Cameron Euphra are you going to give way to such folly Folly Is it not worse folly to torture a poor girl as you do me all for a worthless ring What can you want with the ring I do not know that he has it even You lie You know he has You need not think to take me in You base man You dare not give the lie to any but a woman Why Because you are a coward You are afraid of Lady Euphrasia yourself See there Von Funkelstein glanced round him uneasily It was only the moonlight on the bark of a silver birch Conscious of having betrayed weakness he grew spiteful If you do not behave to me better I will compel you Rise up After a moment s hesitation she rose Put your arms round me She seemed to grow to the earth and to drag herself from it one foot after another But she came close up to the Bohemian and put one arm half round him looking to the earth all the time Kiss me Count Halkar her voice sounded hollow and harsh as if from a dead throat I will do what you please Only release me Go then but mind you resist me no more I do not care for your kisses You were ready enough once But that idiot of a tutor has taken my place I see Would to God I had never seen you never yielded to your influence over me Swear that I shall be free if I find you the ring You find the ring first Why should I swear I can compel you You know you laid yourself out to entrap me first with your arts and I only turned upon you with mine And you are in my power But you shall be free notwithstanding and I will torture you till you free yourself Find the ring Cruel cruel You are doing all you can to ruin me On the contrary I am doing all I can to save myself If you had loved me as you allowed me to think once I should never have made you my tool You would all the same Take care I am irritable to night For a few moments Euphra made no reply To what will you drive me she said at last I will not go too far I should lose my power over you if I did I prefer to keep it Inexorable man Yes Another despairing pause What am I to do Nothing But keep yourself ready to carry out any plan that I may propose Something will turn up now that I have got into the house myself Leave me to find out the means I can expect no invention from your brains You can go home Euphra turned without another word and went murmuring as if in excuse to herself It is for my freedom It is for my freedom Of course this account must have come originally from Euphra herself for there was no one else to tell it She at least believed herself compelled to do what the man pleased Some of my readers will put her down as insane She may have been but for my part I believe there is such a power of one being over another though perhaps only in a rare contact of psychologically peculiar natures I have testimony enough for that She had yielded to his will once Had she not done so he could not have compelled her but having once yielded she had not strength sufficient to free herself again Whether even he could free her further than by merely abstaining from the exercise of the power he had gained I doubt much It is evident that he had come to the neighbourhood of Arnstead for the sake of finding her and exercising his power over her for his own ends that he had made her come to him once if not oftener before he met Hugh and by means of his acquaintance obtained admission into Arnstead Once admitted he had easily succeeded by his efforts to please in so far ingratiating himself with mister Arnold that now the house door stood open to him and he had even his recognised seat at the dinner table CHAPTER XXI SPIRIT VERSUS MATERIALISM Next this marble venomed seat Smeared with gums of glutinous heat I touch with chaste palms moist and cold Now the spell hath lost his hold MILTON Comas Next morning Lady Emily felt better and wanted to get up but her eyes were still too bright and her hands too hot and Margaret would not hear of it Fond as Lady Emily was in general of missus Elton s society she did not care to have her with her now and got tired of her when Margaret was absent They had taken care not to allow Miss Cameron to enter the room but to day there was not much likelihood of her making the attempt for she did not appear at breakfast sending a message to her uncle that she had a bad headache but hoped to take her place at the dinner table During the day Lady Emily was better but restless by fits Were you not out of the room for a little while last night Margaret she said rather suddenly Yes my lady I told you I should have to go perhaps I remember I thought you had gone but I was not in the least afraid and that dreadful man never came near me I do not know when you returned Perhaps I had fallen asleep but when I thought about you next there you were by my bedside I shall not have to leave you to night was all Margaret s answer As for Hugh when first he woke the extraordinary experiences of the previous night appeared to him to belong only to the night and to have no real relation to the daylight world But a little reflection soon convinced him of the contrary and then he went through the duties of the day like one who had nothing to do with them The phantoms he had seen even occupied some of the thinking space formerly appropriated by the image of Euphra though he knew to his concern that she was ill and confined to her room He had heard the message sent to mister Arnold however and so kept hoping for the dinner hour With it came Euphra very pale Her eyes had an unsettled look and there were dark hollows under them She would start and look sideways without any visible cause and was thus very different from her usual self ordinarily remarkable for self possession almost to coolness of manner and speech Hugh saw it and became both distressed and speculative in consequence It did not diminish his discomfort that about the middle of dinner Funkelstein was announced Was it then that Euphra had been tremulously expectant of him This is an unforeseen pleasure Herr von Funkelstein said mister Arnold It is very good of you to call it a pleasure mister Arnold said he Miss Cameron but good heavens how ill you look Don t be alarmed I have only caught the plague Only was all Funkelstein said in reply yet Hugh thought he had no right to be so solicitous about Euphra s health As the gentlemen sat at their wine mister Arnold said I am anxious to have one more trial of those strange things you have brought to our knowledge I have been thinking about them ever since Of course I am at your service mister Arnold but don t you think for the ladies sakes we have had enough of it You are very considerate Herr von Funkelstein but they need not be present if they do not like it Very well mister Arnold They adjourned once more to the library instead of the drawing room Hugh went and told Euphra who was alone in the drawing room what they were about She declined going but insisted on his leaving her and joining the other gentlemen Hugh left her with much reluctance Margaret said Lady Emily I am certain that man is in the house He is my lady answered Margaret They are about some more of those horrid experiments as they call them I do not know missus Elton entering the room at the moment Margaret said Do you know ma am whether the gentlemen are in the library again I don t know Margaret I hope not We have had enough of that I will go and find out though Will you take my place for a few minutes first please ma am Margaret had felt a growing oppression for some time She had scarcely left the sick room that day Don t leave me dear Margaret said Lady Emily imploringly Only for a little while my lady I shall be back in less than a quarter of an hour Very well Margaret she answered dolefully Margaret went out into the moonlight and walked for ten minutes She sought the more open parts where the winds were She then returned to the sick chamber refreshed and strong Now I will go and see what the gentlemen are about said missus Elton The good lady did not like these proceedings but she was irresistibly attracted by them notwithstanding Having gone to see for Lady Emily she remained to see for herself After she had left Lady Emily grew more uneasy Not even Margaret s presence could make her comfortable missus Elton did not return Many minutes elapsed Lady Emily said at last Margaret I am terrified at the idea of being left alone I confess but not so terrified as at the idea of what is going on in that library missus Elton will not come back Would you mind just running down to ask her to come to me I would go with pleasure said Margaret but I don t want to be seen Margaret did not want to be seen by Hugh Lady Emily with her dislike to Funkelstein thought Margaret did not want to be seen by him You will find a black veil of mine she said in that wardrobe just throw it over your head and hold a handkerchief to your face They will be so busy that they will never see you Margaret yielded to the request of Lady Emily who herself arranged her head dress for her Now I must go back a little When missus Elton reached the room she found it darkened and the gentlemen seated at the table A running fire of knocks was going on all around She sat down in a corner In a minute or two she fancied she saw strange figures moving about generally near the floor and very imperfectly developed Sometimes only a hand sometimes only a foot shadowed itself out of the dim obscurity She tried to persuade herself that it was all done somehow or other by Funkelstein yet she could not help watching with a curious dread She was not a very excitable woman and her nerves were safe enough In a minute or two more the table at which they were seated began to move up and down with a kind of vertical oscillation and several things in the room began to slide about by short apparently purposeless jerks Everything threatened to assume motion and turn the library into a domestic chaos missus Elton declared afterwards that several books were thrown about the room But suddenly everything was as still as the moonlight Every chair and table was at rest looking perfectly incapable of motion missus Elton felt that she dared not say they had moved at all so utterly ordinary was their appearance Not a sound was to be heard from corner or ceiling After a moment s silence missus Elton was quite restored to her sound mind as she said and left the room Some adverse influence is at work said Funkelstein with some vexation What is in that closet So saying he approached the door of the private staircase and opened it They saw him start aside and a veiled dark figure pass him cross the library and go out by another door I have my suspicions said Funkelstein with a rather tremulous voice And your fears too I think Grant it now said mister Arnold Granted mister Arnold Let us go to the drawing room Just as Margaret had reached the library door at the bottom of the private stair either a puff of wind from an open loophole window or some other cause destroyed the arrangement of the veil and made it fall quite over her face She stopped for a moment to readjust it She had not quite succeeded when Funkelstein opened the door Without an instant s hesitation she let the veil fall and walked forward missus Elton had gone to her own room on her way to Lady Emily s When she reached the latter she found Margaret seated as she had left her by the bedside Lady Emily said I did not miss you Margaret half so much as I expected But indeed you were not many moments gone I do not care for that man now He can t hurt me can he Certainty not I hope he will give you no more trouble either dear Lady Emily But if I might presume to advise you I would say Get well as soon as you can and leave this place Why should I You frighten me mister Arnold is very kind to me The place quite suits Lady Emily I am sure Margaret But Lady Emily is not so well as when she came No but that is not the fault of the place said Lady Emily I am sure it is all that horrid man s doing How else will you get rid of him then What if he wants to get rid of you What harm can I be doing him a poor girl like me I don t know But I fear there is something not right going on We will tell mister Arnold at once said missus Elton But what could you tell him ma am mister Arnold is hardly one to listen to your maid s suspicions Dear Lady Emily you must get well and go I will try said Lady Emily submissive as a child I think you will be able to get up for a little while tomorrow A tap came to the door It was Euphrasia inquiring after Lady Emily Ask Miss Cameron to come in said the invalid She entered Her manner was much changed was subdued and suffering Dear Miss Cameron you and I ought to change places I am sorry to see you looking so ill said Lady Emily I have had a headache all day I shall be quite well to morrow thank you I intend to be so too said Lady Emily cheerfully After some little talk Euphra went holding her hand to her forehead Margaret did not look up all the time she was in the room but went on busily with her needle That night was a peaceful one CHAPTER XXII THE RING shining crystal which Out of her womb a thousand rayons threw BELLAY translated by Spenser The next day Lady Emily was very nearly as well as she had proposed being She did not however make her appearance below mister Arnold hearing at luncheon that she was out of bed immediately sent up his compliments with the request that he might be permitted to see her on his return from the neighbouring village where he had some business To this Lady Emily gladly consented He sat with her a long time talking about various things for the presence of the girl reminding him of his young wife brought out the best of the man lying yet alive under the incrustation of self importance and its inevitable stupidity At length subject of further conversation failing I wonder what we can do to amuse you Lady Emily said he Thank you mister Arnold I am not at all dull With my kind friend missus Elton and She would have said Margaret but became instinctively aware that the mention of her would make mister Arnold open his eyes for he did not even know her name and that he would stare yet wider when he learned that the valued companion referred to was missus Elton s maid mister Arnold left the room and presently returned with his arms filled with all the drawing room books he could find with grand bindings outside and equally grand plates inside These he heaped on the table beside Lady Emily who tried to look interested but scarcely succeeded to mister Arnold s satisfaction for he presently said You don t seem to care much about these dear Lady Emily I daresay you have looked at them all already in this dull house of ours This was a wonderful admission from mister Arnold He pondered then exclaimed as if he had just made a grand discovery I have it I know something that will interest you Do not trouble yourself pray mister Arnold said Lady Emily But he was already half way to the door He went to his own room and his own strong closet therein Returning towards the invalid s quarters with an ebony box of considerable size he found it rather heavy and meeting Euphra by the way requested her to take one of the silver handles and help him to carry it to Lady Emily s room She started when she saw it but merely said With pleasure uncle Now Lady Emily said he as setting down the box he took out a curious antique enamelled key we shall be able to amuse you for a little while He opened the box and displayed such a glitter and show as would have delighted the eyes of any lady All kinds of strange ornaments ancient watches one of them a death s head in gold cameo necklaces pearls abundant diamonds rubies and all the colours of precious stones every one of them having some history whether known to the owner or not gems that had flashed on many a fair finger and many a shining neck lay before Lady Emily s delighted eyes But Euphrasia s eyes shone as she gazed on them with a very different expression from that which sparkled in Lady Emily s They seemed to search them with fingers of lightning mister Arnold chose two or three and gave Lady Emily her choice of them I could not think of depriving you They are of no use to me said mister Arnold making light of the handsome offer You are too kind I should like this ring Take it then dear Lady Emily Euphrasia s eyes were not on the speakers nor was any envy to be seen in her face She still gazed at the jewels in the box The chosen gem was put aside and then one after another the various articles were taken out and examined At length a large gold chain set with emeralds was lifted from where it lay coiled up in a corner A low cry like a muffled moan escaped from Euphrasia s lips and she turned her head away from the box What is the matter Euphra said mister Arnold A sudden shoot of pain I beg your pardon dear uncle I fear I am not quite so well yet as I thought I was How stupid of me Do sit down I fear the weight of the box was too much for you Not in the least I want to see the pretty things But you have seen them before No uncle You promised to show them to me but you never did You see what I get by being ill said Lady Emily The chain was examined admired and laid aside Where it had lain they now observed in the corner a huge stone like a diamond What is this said Lady Emily taking it up Oh I see It is a ring But such a ring for size I never saw Do look Miss Cameron For Miss Cameron was not looking She was leaning her head on her hand and her face was ashy pale Lady Emily tried the ring on Any two of her fingers would go into the broad gold circlet beyond which the stone projected far in every direction Indeed the ring was attached to the stone rather than the stone set in the ring That is a curious thing is it not said mister Arnold It is of no value in itself I believe it is nothing but a crystal But it seems to have been always thought something of in the family I presume from its being evidently the very ring painted by Sir Peter Lely in that portrait of Lady Euphrasia which I showed you the other day It is a clumsy affair is it not It might have occurred to mister Arnold that such a thing must have been thought something of before its owner would have chosen to wear it when sitting for her portrait Lady Emily was just going to lay it down when she spied something that made her look at it more closely What curious engraving is this upon the gold she asked I do not know indeed answered mister Arnold I have never observed it Look at it then all over the gold What at first looks only like chasing is I do believe words The character looks to me like German I wish I could read it I am but a poor German scholar Do look at it please dear Miss Cameron Euphra glanced slightly at it without touching it and said I am sure I could make nothing of it But she added as if struck by a sudden thought as Lady Emily seems interested in it suppose we send for mister Sutherland I have no doubt he will be able to decipher it She rose as if she would go for him herself but apparently on second thoughts went to the bell and rang it Oh do not trouble yourself interposed Lady Emily in a tone that showed she would like it notwithstanding No trouble at all answered Euphra and her uncle in a breath Jacob said mister Arnold take my compliments to mister Sutherland and ask him to step this way The man went and Hugh came There s a puzzle for you mister Sutherland said mister Arnold as he entered Decipher that inscription and gain the favour of Lady Emily for ever As he spoke he put the ring in Hugh s hand Hugh recognized it at once Ah this is Lady Euphrasia s wonderful ring said he Euphra cast on him one of her sudden glances What do you know about it said mister Arnold hastily Euphra flashed at him once more covertly I only know that this is the ring in her portrait Any one may see that it is a very wonderful ring indeed by only looking at it answered Hugh smiling I hope it is not too wonderful for you to get at the mystery of it though mister Sutherland said Lady Emily Lady Emily is dying to understand the inscription said Euphrasia By this time Hugh was turning it round and round trying to get a beginning to the legend But in this he met with a difficulty The fact was that the initial letter of the inscription could only be found by looking into the crystal held close to the eye The words seemed not altogether unknown to him though the characters were a little strange and the words themselves were undivided The dinner bell rang Dear me how the time goes in your room Lady Emily said mister Arnold who was never known to keep dinner waiting a moment Will you venture to go down with us to day I fear I must not to day To morrow I hope But do put up these beauties before you go I dare not touch them without you and it is so much more pleasure seeing them when I have you to tell me about them Well throw them in said mister Arnold pretending an indifference he did not feel The reality of dinner must not be postponed to the fancy of jewels All this time Hugh had stood poring over the ring at the window whither he had taken it for better light as the shadows were falling Euphra busied herself replacing everything in the box When all were in she hastily shut the lid Well mister Sutherland said mister Arnold I seem on the point of making it out mister Arnold but I certainly have not succeeded yet Confess yourself vanquished then and come to dinner I am very unwilling to give in for I feel convinced that if I had leisure to copy the inscription as far as I can read it I should with the help of my dictionary soon supply the rest I am very unwilling as well to lose a chance of the favour of Lady Emily Yes do read it if you can I too am dying to hear it said Euphra Will you trust me with it mister Arnold I will take the greatest care of it Oh certainly replied mister Arnold with a little hesitation in his tone however of which Hugh was too eager to take any notice He carried it to his room immediately and laid it beside his manuscript verses in the hiding place of the old escritoire He was in the drawing room a moment after There he found Euphra and the Bohemian alone Von Funkelstein had in an incredibly short space of time established himself as Hausfreund and came and went as he pleased They looked as if they had been interrupted in a hurried and earnest conversation their faces were so impassive Yet Euphra s wore a considerably heightened colour a more articulate indication She could school her features but not her complexion CHAPTER XXIII THE WAGER He stakes this ring And would so had it been a carbuncle Of Phoebus wheel and might so safely had it Been all the worth of his car Cymbeline Hugh of course had an immediate attack of jealousy Wishing to show it in one quarter and hide it in every other he carefully abstained from looking once in the direction of Euphra while throughout the dinner he spoke to every one else as often as there was the smallest pretext for doing so To enable himself to keep this up he drank wine freely As he was in general very moderate by the time the ladies rose it had begun to affect his brain It was not half so potent however in its influences as the parting glance which Euphra succeeded at last as she left the room in sending through his eyes to his heart Hugh sat down to the table again with a quieter tongue but a busier brain He drank still without thinking of the consequences A strong will kept him from showing any signs of intoxication but he was certainly nearer to that state than he had ever been in his life before The Bohemian started the new subject which generally follows the ladies departure How long is it since Arnstead was first said to be haunted mister Arnold Haunted Herr von Funkelstein I am at a loss to understand you replied mister Arnold who resented any such allusion being subversive of the honour of his house almost as much as if it had been depreciative of his own I beg your pardon mister Arnold I thought it was an open subject of remark So it is said Hugh every one knows that mister Arnold was struck dumb with indignation Before he had recovered himself sufficiently to know what to say the conversation between the other two had assumed a form to which his late experiences inclined him to listen with some degree of interest But his pride sternly forbidding him to join in it he sat sipping his wine in careless sublimity You have seen it yourself then said the Bohemian I did not say that answered Hugh But I heard one of the maids say once when He paused This hesitation of his witnessed against him afterwards in mister Arnold s judgment But he took no notice now Hugh ended tamely enough Why it is commonly reported amongst the servants With a blue light Such as we saw that night from the library window I suppose I did not say that answered Hugh Besides it was nothing of the sort you saw from the library It was only the moon But He paused again Von Funkelstein saw the condition he was in and pressed him You know something more mister Sutherland Hugh hesitated again but only for a moment Well then he said I have seen the spectre myself walking in her white grave clothes in the Ghost s Avenue ha ha Funkelstein looked anxious Were you frightened said he Frightened repeated Hugh in a tone of the greatest contempt I am of Don Juan s opinion with regard to such gentry What is that That soul and body on the whole Are odds against a disembodied soul Bravo cried the count You despise all these tales about Lady Euphrasia wandering about the house with a death candle in her hand looking everywhere about as if she had lost something and couldn t find it Pooh pooh I wish I could meet her Then you don t believe a word of it I don t say that There would be less of courage than boasting in talking so if I did not believe a word of it Then you do believe it But Hugh was too much of a Scotchman to give a hasty opinion or rather a direct answer even when half tipsy especially when such was evidently desired He only shook and nodded his head at the same moment Do you really mean you would meet her if you could I do Then if all tales are true you may without much difficulty For the coachman told me only to day that you may see her light in the window of that room almost any night towards midnight He told me too for I made quite a friend of him to day on purpose to hear his tales that one of the maids who left the other day told the groom and he told the coachman that she had once heard talking and peeping through the key hole of a door that led into that part of the old house saw a figure dressed exactly like the picture of Lady Euphrasia wandering up and down wringing her hands and beating her breast as if she were in terrible trouble She had a light in her hand which burned awfully blue and her face was the face of a corpse with pale green spots You think to frighten me Funkelstein and make me tremble at what I said a minute ago Instead of repeating that I say now I will sleep in Lady Euphrasia s room this night if you like I lay you a hundred guineas you won t cried the Bohemian Done said Hugh offering him his hand Funkelstein took it and so the bet was committed to the decision of courage Well gentlemen interposed mister Arnold at last you might have left a corner for me somewhere Without my permission you will hardly settle your wager I beg your pardon mister Arnold said Funkelstein We got rather excited over it and forgot our manners But I am quite willing to give it up if mister Sutherland will Not I said Hugh that is of course if mister Arnold has no objection Of course not My house ghost and all is at your service gentlemen responded mister Arnold rising They went to the drawing room mister Arnold strange to say was in a good humour He walked up to missus Elton and said These wicked men have been betting missus Elton I am surprised they should be so silly said she with a smile taking it as a joke What have they been betting about said Euphra coming up to her uncle Herr von Funkelstein has laid a hundred guineas that mister Sutherland will not sleep in Lady Euphrasia s room to night Euphra turned pale By sleep I suppose you mean spend the night said Hugh to Funkelstein I cannot be certain of sleeping you know Of course I mean that answered the other and turning to Euphrasia continued I must say I consider it rather courageous of him to dare the spectre as he does for he cannot say he disbelieves in her But come and sing me one of the old songs he added in an under tone Euphra allowed him to lead her to the piano but instead of singing a song to him she played some noisy music through which he and she contrived to talk for some time without being overheard after which he left the room Euphra then looked round to Hugh and begged him with her eyes to come to her He could not resist burning with jealousy as he was Are you sure you have nerve enough for this Hugh she said still playing I have had nerve enough to sit still and look at you for the last half hour answered Hugh rudely She turned pale and glanced up at him with a troubled look Then without responding to his answer said I daresay the count is not over anxious to hold you to your bet Pray intercede for me with the count madam answered Hugh sarcastically He would not wish the young fool to be frightened I daresay But perhaps he wishes to have an interview with the ghost himself and grudges me the privilege She turned deadly pale this time and gave him one terrified glance but made no other reply to his words Still she played on You will arm yourself Against a ghost Yes with a stout heart But don t forget the secret door through which we came that night Hugh I distrust the count The last words were spoken in a whisper emphasized into almost a hiss Tell him I shall be armed I tell you I shall meet him bare handed Betray me if you like Hugh had taken his revenge and now came the reaction He gazed at Euphra but instead of the injured look which was the best he could hope to see an expression of pity and ruth grew slowly in her face making it more lovely than ever in his eyes At last she seemed on the point of bursting into tears and suddenly changing the music she began playing a dead march She kept her eyes on the keys Once more only she glanced round to see whether Hugh was still by her side and he saw that her face was pale as death and wet with silent tears He had never seen her weep before He would have fallen at her feet had he been alone with her To hide his feelings he left the room and then the house He wandered into the Ghost s Walk and finding himself there walked up and down in it This was certainly throwing the lady a bold challenge seeing he was going to spend the night in her room The excitement into which jealousy had thrown him had been suddenly checked by the sight of Euphra s tears The reaction too after his partial intoxication had already begun to set in to be accounted for partly by the fact that its source had been chiefly champagne and partly by the other fact that he had bound himself in honour to dare a spectre in her own favourite haunt On the other hand the sight of Euphra s emotion had given him a far better courage than jealousy or wine could afford Yet after ten minutes passed in the shadows of the Ghost s Walk he would not have taken the bet at ten times its amount But to lose it now would have been a serious affair for him the disgrace of failure unconsidered If he could have lost a hundred guineas it would have been comparatively a slight matter but to lose a bet and be utterly unable to pay it would be disgraceful no better than positive cheating He had not thought of this at the time Nor even now was it more than a passing thought for he had not the smallest desire to recede The ambition of proving his courage to Euphra and far more the strength just afforded him by the sight of her tears were quite sufficient to carry him on to the ordeal Whether they would carry him through it with dignity he did not ask himself And after all would the ghost appear At the best she might not come at the very worst she would be but a ghost and he could say with Hamlet for my soul what can it do to that Being a thing as immortal as itself But then his jealousy having for the moment intermitted Hugh was not able to say with Hamlet I do not set my life at a pin s fee and that had much to do with Hamlet s courage in the affair of the ghost He walked up and down the avenue till beginning to feel the night chilly he began to feel the avenue eerie for cold is very antagonistic to physical courage But what refuge would he find in the ghost s room He returned to the drawing room Von Funkelstein and Euphra were there alone but in no proximity mister Arnold soon entered Shall I have the bed prepared for you mister Sutherland said Euphra Which of your maids will you persuade to that office said mister Arnold with a facetious expression I must do it myself answered Euphra if mister Sutherland persists Hugh saw or thought he saw the Bohemian dart an angry glance at Euphra who shrank under it But before he could speak mister Arnold rejoined You can make a bed then That is the housemaid s phrase is it not I can do anything another can uncle Bravo Can you see the ghost Yes she answered with a low lingering on the sibilant looking round at the same time with an expression that implied a hope that Hugh had heard it as indeed he had What Euphra too said mister Arnold in a tone of gentle contempt Do not disturb the ghost s bed for me said Hugh It would be a pity to disarrange it after it has lain so for an age Besides I need not rouse the wrath of the poor spectre more than can t be helped If I must sleep in her room I need not sleep in her bed I will lie on the old couch Herr von Funkelstein what proof shall I give you Your word mister Sutherland replied Funkelstein with a bow Thank you At what hour must I be there Oh I don t know By eleven I should think Oh any time before midnight That s the ghost s own is it not It is now let me see almost ten Then I will go at once said Hugh thinking it better to meet the gradual approach of the phantom hour in the room itself than to walk there through the desolate house and enter the room just as the fear would be gathering thickest within it Besides he was afraid that his courage might have broken down a little by that time and that he would not be able to conceal entirely the anticipative dread whose inroad he had reason to apprehend I have one good cup of tea yet mister Sutherland said Euphra Will you not strengthen your nerves with that before we lead you to the tomb Then she will go with me thought Hugh I will thank you Miss Cameron He approached the table at which she stood pouring out the cup of tea She said low and hurriedly without raising her head Don t go dear Hugh You don t know what may happen I will go Euphra Not even you shall prevent me I will pay the wager for you lend you the money Euphra The tone implied many things mister Arnold approached Other conversation followed As half past ten chimed from the clock on the chimney piece Hugh rose to go I will just get a book from my room he said and then perhaps Herr von Funkelstein will be kind enough to see me make a beginning at least Certainly I will And I advise you to let the book be Edgar Poe s Tales No I shall need all the courage I have I assure you I shall find you here Yes Hugh went to his room and washed his face and hands Before doing so he pulled off his finger a ring of considerable value which had belonged to his father As he was leaving the room to return to the company he remembered that he had left the ring on the washhand stand He generally left it there at night but now he bethought himself that as he was not going to sleep in the room it might be as well to place it in the escritoire He opened the secret place and laid the diamond beside his poems and the crystal ring belonging to mister Arnold This done he took up his book again and returning to the drawing room found the whole party prepared to accompany him mister Arnold had the keys Von Funkelstein and he went first and Hugh followed with Euphra We will not contribute to your discomfiture by locking the doors on the way mister Sutherland said mister Arnold That is you will not compel me to win the wager in spite of my fears said Hugh But you will let the ghost loose on the household said the Bohemian laughing I will be responsible for that replied mister Arnold Euphra dropped a little behind with Hugh Remember the secret passage said she You can get out when you will whether they lock the door or not Don t carry it too far Hugh The ghost you mean Euphra I don t think I shall said Hugh laughing But as he laughed an involuntary shudder passed through him Have I stepped over my own grave thought he They reached the room and entered Hugh would have begged them to lock him in had he not felt that his knowledge of the secret door would although he intended no use of it render such a proposal dishonourable They gave him the key of the door to lock it on the inside and bade him good night They were just leaving him when Hugh on whom a new light had broken at last in the gradual restoration of his faculties said to the Bohemian One word with you Herr von Funkelstein if you please Funkelstein followed him into the room when Hugh half closing the door said I trust to your sympathy as gentleman not to misunderstand me I wagered a hundred guineas with you in the heat of after dinner talk I am not at present worth a hundred shillings Oh began Funkelstein with a sneer if you wish to get off on that ground Herr von Funkelstein interrupted Hugh in a very decided tone I pointed to your sympathy as a gentleman as the ground on which I had hoped to meet you now If you have difficulty in finding that ground another may be found to morrow without much seeking Hugh paused for a moment after making this grand speech but Funkelstein did not seem to understand him he stood in a waiting attitude Hugh therefore went on Meantime what I wanted to say is this I have just left a ring in my room which though in value considerably below the sum mentioned between us may yet be a pledge of my good faith in as far as it is of infinitely more value to me than can be reckoned in money It was the property of one who by birth and perhaps by social position as well was Herr von Funkelstein s equal The ring is a diamond and belonged to my father Von Funkelstein merely replied I beg your pardon mister Sutherland for misunderstanding you The ring is quite an equivalent And making him a respectful bow he turned and left him CHAPTER XXIV THE LADY EUPHRASIA The black jades of swart night trot foggy rings Bout heaven s brow Tis now stark dead night JOHN MARSTON Second Part of Antonio and Mellida As soon as Hugh was alone his first action was to lock the door by which he had entered his next to take the key from the lock and put it in his pocket He then looked if there were any other fastenings and finding an old tarnished brass bolt as well succeeded in making it do its duty for the first time that century which required some persuasion as may be supposed He then turned towards the other door As he crossed the room he found four candles a decanter of port and some biscuits on a table placed there no doubt by the kind hands of Euphra He vowed to himself that he would not touch the wine I have had enough of that for one night said he But he lighted the candles and then saw that the couch was provided with plenty of wraps for the night One of them he recognised to his delight was a Cameron tartan often worn by Euphra He buried his face in it for a moment and drew from it fresh courage He then went into the furthest recess lifted the tapestry and proceeded to fasten the concealed door But to his discomfiture he could find no fastening upon it No doubt thought he it does fasten in some secret way or other But he could discover none There was no mark of bolt or socket to show whence one had been removed nor sign of friction to indicate that the door had ever been made secure in such fashion It closed with a spring Then said Hugh apostrophising the door I must watch you As however it was not yet near the time when ghosts are to be expected and as he felt very tired he drank one glass of the wine and throwing himself on the couch drew Euphra s shawl over him opened his book and began to read But the words soon vanished in a bewildering dance and he slept He started awake in that agony of fear in which I suppose most people have awaked in the night once or twice in their lives He felt that he was not alone But the feeling seemed when he recalled it to have been altogether different from that with which we recognise the presence of the most unwelcome bodily visitor The whole of his nervous skeleton seemed to shudder and contract Every sense was intensified to the acme of its acuteness while the powers of volition were inoperative He could not move a finger The moment in which he first saw the object I am about to describe he could not recall The impression made seemed to have been too strong for the object receiving it destroying thus its own traces as an overheated brand iron would in dry timber Or it may be that after such a pre sensation the cause of it could not surprise him He saw a few paces off bending as if looking down upon him a face which if described as he described it would be pronounced as far past the most liberal boundary line of art as itself had passed beyond that degree of change at which a human countenance is fit for the upper world no longer and must be hidden away out of sight The lips were dark and drawn back from the closed teeth which were white as those of a skull There were spots in fact the face corresponded exactly to the description given by Funkelstein of the reported ghost of Lady Euphrasia The dress was point for point correspondent to that in the picture Had the portrait of Lady Euphrasia been hanging on the wall above instead of the portrait of the unknown nun Hugh would have thought as far as dress was concerned that it had come alive and stepped from its frame except for one thing there was no ring on the thumb It was wonderful to himself afterwards that he should have observed all these particulars but the fact was that they rather burnt themselves in upon his brain than were taken notice of by him They returned upon him afterwards by degrees as one becomes sensible of the pain of a wound But there was one sign of life Though the eyes were closed tears flowed from them and seemed to have worn channels for their constant flow down this face of death which ought to have been lying still in the grave returning to its dust and was weeping above ground instead The figure stood for a moment as one who would gaze could she but open her heavy death rusted eyelids Then as if in hopeless defeat she turned away And then to crown the horror literally as well as figuratively Hugh saw that her hair sparkled and gleamed goldenly as the hair of a saint might if the aureole were combed down into it She moved towards the door with a fettered pace such as one might attribute to the dead if they walked to the dead body I say not to the living ghost to that which has lain in the prison hold till the joints are decayed with the grave damps and the muscles are stiff with more than deathly cold She dragged one limb after the other slowly and to appearance painfully as she moved towards the door which Hugh had locked When she had gone half way to the door Hugh lying as he was on a couch could see her feet for her dress did not reach the ground They were bare as the feet of the dead ought to be which are about to tread softly in the realm of Hades But how stained and mouldy and iron spotted as if the rain had been soaking through the spongy coffin did the dress show beside the pure whiteness of those exquisite feet Not a sign of the tomb was upon them Small living delicately formed Hugh could he have forgot the face they bore above might have envied the floor which in their nakedness they seemed to caress so lingeringly did they move from it in their noiseless progress She reached the door put out her hand and touched it Hugh saw it open outwards and let her through Nor did this strike him as in the smallest degree marvellous It closed again behind her noiseless as her footfalls The moment she vanished the power of motion returned to him and Hugh sprang to his feet He leaped to the door With trembling hand he inserted the key and the lock creaked as he turned it In proof of his being in tolerable possession of his faculties at the moment and that what he was relating to me actually occurred he told me that he remembered at once that he had heard that peculiar creak a few moments before Euphra and he discovered that they were left alone in this very chamber He had never thought of it before Still the door would not open it was bolted as well and the bolt was very stiff to withdraw But at length he succeeded When he reached the passage outside he thought he saw the glimmer of a light perhaps in the picture gallery beyond Towards this he groped his way He could never account for the fact that he left the candles burning in the room behind him and went forward into the darkness except by supposing that his wits had gone astray in consequence of the shock the apparition had occasioned them When he reached the gallery there was no light there but somewhere in the distance he saw or fancied a faint shimmer The impulse to go towards it was too strong to be disputed with He advanced with outstretched arms groping After a few steps he had lost all idea of where he was or how he ought to proceed in order to reach any known quarter The light had vanished He stood Was that a stealthy step he heard beside him in the dark He had no time to speculate for the next moment he fell senseless CHAPTER XXV NEXT MORNING Darkness is fled look infant morn hath drawn Bright silver curtains bout the couch of night And now Aurora s horse trots azure rings Breathing fair light about the firmament Stand what s that JOHN MARSTON Second Part of Antonio and Mellida When he came to himself it was with a slow flowing of the tide of consciousness His head ached Had he fallen down stairs or had he struck his head against some projection and so stunned himself The last he remembered was standing quite still in the dark and hearing something Had he been knocked down He could not tell Where was he Could the ghost have been all a dream and this headache be nature s revenge upon last night s wine For he lay on the couch in the haunted chamber and on his bosom lay the book over which he had dropped asleep Mingled with all this doubt there was another For he remembered that when consciousness first returned he felt as if he had seen Euphra s face bending down close over his Could it be possible Had Euphra herself come to see how he had fared The room lay in the grey light of the dawn but Euphra was nowhere visible Could she have vanished ashamed through the secret door Or had she been only a phantasy a projection outwards of the form that dwelt in his brain a phenomenon often occurring when the last of sleeping and the first of waking are indistinguishably blended in a vague consciousness But if it was so then the ghost what of it Had not his brain by the events of the preceding evening been similarly prepared with regard to it Was it not more likely after all that she too was the offspring of his own imagination the power that makes images especially when considered that she exactly corresponded to the description given by the Bohemian But had he not observed many points at which the Count had not even hinted Still it was as natural to expect that an excited imagination should supply the details of a wholly imaginary spectacle as that given the idea of Euphra s presence it should present the detail of her countenance for the creation of that which is not belongs as much to the realm of the imagination as the reproduction of that which is It seemed very strange to Hugh himself that he should be able thus to theorize before even he had raised himself from the couch on which perhaps after all he had lain without moving throughout that terrible night swarming with the horrors of the dead that would not sleep But the long unconsciousness in which he had himself visited the regions of death seemed to have restored him in spite of his aching head to perfect mental equilibrium Or at least his brain was quiet enough to let his mind work Still he felt very ghastly within He raised himself on his elbow and looked into the room Everything was the same as it had been the night before only with an altered aspect in the dawn light The dawn has a peculiar terror of its own sometimes perhaps even more real in character but very different from the terrors of the night and of candle light The room looked as if no ghost could have passed through its still old musty atmosphere so perfectly reposeful did it appear and yet it seemed as if some umbra some temporary and now cast off body of the ghost must be lying or lingering somewhere about it He rose and peeped into the recess where the cabinet stood Nothing was there but the well remembered carving and blackness Having once yielded to the impulse he could not keep from peering every moment now into one and now into another of the many hidden corners The next suggesting itself for examination was always one he could not see from where he stood after all even in the daylight there might be some dead thing there who could tell But he remained manfully at his post till the sun rose till bell after bell rang from the turret till in short Funkelstein came to fetch him Good morning mister Sutherland said he How have you slept Like a somnambulist answered Hugh choosing the word for its intensity I slept so sound that I woke quite early I am glad to hear it But it is nearly time for breakfast for which ceremony I am myself hardly in trim yet So saying Funkelstein turned and walked away with some precipitation What occasioned Hugh a little surprise was that he did not ask him one question more as to how he had passed the night He had of course slept in the house seeing he presented himself in deshabille Hugh hastened to his own room where under the anti ghostial influences of the bath he made up his mind not to say a word about the apparition to any one Well mister Sutherland how have you spent the night said mister Arnold greeting him I slept with profound stupidity answered Hugh a stupidity in fact quite worthy of the folly of the preceding wager This was true as relating to the time during which he had slept but was of course false in the impression it gave Bravo exclaimed mister Arnold with an unwonted impulsiveness The best mood I consider in which to meet such creations of other people s brains And you positively passed a pleasant night in the awful chamber That is something to tell Euphra But she is not down yet You have restored the character of my house mister Sutherland and next to his own character a man ought to care for that of his house I am greatly in your debt sir At this moment Euphra s maid brought the message that her mistress was sorry she was unable to appear at breakfast missus Elton took her place The day is so warm and still mister Arnold that I think Lady Emily might have a drive to day Perhaps Miss Cameron may be able to join us by that time I cannot think what is the matter with Euphra said mister Arnold She never used to be affected in this way Should you not seek some medical opinion said missus Elton These constant headaches must indicate something wrong The constant headache had occurred just once before since missus Elton had formed one of the family After a pause mister Arnold reverted to the former subject You are most welcome to the carriage missus Elton I am sorry I cannot accompany you myself but I must go to town to day You can take mister Sutherland with you if you like He will take care of you I shall be most happy said Hugh So shall we all responded missus Elton kindly Thank you mister Arnold though I am sorry you can t go with us What hour shall I order the carriage About one I think Will Herr von Funkelstein favour us with his company I am sorry replied Funkelstein but I too must leave for London to day Shall I have the pleasure of accompanying you mister Arnold With all my heart if you can leave so early I must go at once to catch the express train I shall be ready in ten minutes Very well Pray missus Elton make my adieus to Miss Cameron I am concerned to hear of her indisposition With pleasure I am going to her now Good bye As soon as missus Elton left the breakfast room mister Arnold rose saying I will walk round to the stable and order the carriage myself I shall then be able through your means mister Sutherland to put a stop to these absurd rumours in person Not that I mean to say anything direct as if I placed any importance upon it but the coachman being an old servant I shall be able through him to send the report of your courage and its result all over the house This was a very gracious explanation of his measures As he concluded it he left the room without allowing time for a reply Hugh had not expected such an immediate consequence of his policy and felt rather uncomfortable but he soon consoled himself by thinking At least it will do no harm While mister Arnold was speaking Funkelstein had been writing at a side table He now handed Hugh a cheque on a London banking house for a hundred guineas Hugh in his innocence could not help feeling ashamed of gaining such a sum by such means for betting like tobacco smoking needs a special training before it can be carried out quite comfortably especially by the winner if he be at all of a generous nature But he felt that to show the least reluctance would place him at great disadvantage with a man of the world like the count He therefore thanked him slightly and thrust the cheque into his trowsers pocket as if a greater sum of money than he had ever handled before were nothing more for him to win than the count would choose it to be considered for him to lose He thought with himself Ah well I need not make use of it and repaired to the school room Here he found Harry waiting for him looking tolerably well and tolerably happy This was a great relief to Hugh for he had not seen him at the breakfast table Harry having risen early and breakfasted before and he had felt very uneasy lest the boy should have missed him in the night for they were still bed fellows and should in consequence have had one of his dreadful attacks of fear It was evident that this had not taken place CHAPTER XXVI AN ACCIDENT There s a special providence in the fall of a sparrow Hamlet When missus Elton left the breakfast table she went straight to Miss Cameron s room to inquire after her expecting to find her maid with her But when she knocked at the door there was no reply She went therefore to her own room and sent her maid to find Euphra s maid She came Is your mistress going to get up to day Jane asked missus Elton I don t know ma am She has not rung yet Have you not been to see how she is No ma am How was it you brought that message at breakfast then Jane looked confused and did not reply Jane said missus Elton in a tone of objurgation Well ma am she told me to say so answered Jane How did she tell you Jane paused again Through the door ma am she answered at length and then muttered that they would make her tell lies by asking her questions she couldn t answer and she wished she was out of the house that she did missus Elton heard this and of course felt considerably puzzled Will you go now please and inquire after your mistress with my compliments I daren t ma am Daren t What do you mean Well ma am there is something about my mistress Here she stopped abruptly but as missus Elton stood expectant she tried to go on All she could add however was No ma am I daren t But there is no harm in going to her room Oh no ma am I go to her room summer and winter at seven o clock every morning answered Jane apparently glad to be able to say something Why won t you go now then Why why because she told me Here the girl stammered and turned pale At length she forced out the words She won t let me tell you why and burst into tears Won t let you tell me repeated missus Elton beginning to think the girl must be out of her mind Jane looked hurriedly over her shoulder as if she expected to see her mistress standing behind her and then said almost defiantly No she won t and I can t With these words she hurried out of the room while missus Elton turned with baffled bewilderment to seek counsel from the face of Margaret As to what all this meant I am in doubt I have recorded it as Margaret told it to Hugh afterwards because it seems to indicate something It shows evidently enough that if Euphra had more than a usual influence over servants in general she had a great deal more over this maid in particular Was this in virtue of a power similar to that of Count Halkar over herself And was this or something very different or both combined the art which he had accused her of first exercising upon him Might the fact that her defeat had resulted in such absolute subjection be connected with her possession of a power similar to his which she had matched with his in vain Of course I only suggest these questions I cannot answer them At one o clock the carriage came round to the door and Hugh in the hope of seeing Euphra alone was the first in the hall missus Elton and Lady Emily presently came and proceeded to take their places without seeming to expect Miss Cameron Hugh helped them into the carriage but instead of getting in lingered hoping that Euphra was yet going to make her appearance I fear Miss Cameron is unable to join us said missus Elton divining his delay Shall I run up stairs and knock at her door said Hugh Do said missus Elton who after the unsatisfactory conversation she had held with her maid had felt both uneasy and curious all the morning Hugh bounded up stairs but just as he was going to knock the door opened and Euphra appeared Dear Euphra how ill you look exclaimed Hugh She was pale as death and dark under the eyes and had evidently been weeping Hush hush she answered Never mind It is only a bad headache Don t take any notice of it The carriage is at the door Will you not come with us With whom Lady Emily and missus Elton I am sick of them I am going Euphra Stay with me I must go I promised to take care of them Oh nonsense What should happen to them Stay with me No I am very sorry I wish I could Then I must go with you I suppose Yet her tone expressed annoyance Oh thank you cried Hugh in delight Make haste I will run down and tell them to wait He bounded away and told the ladies that Euphra would join them in a few minutes But Euphra was cool enough to inflict on them quite twenty minutes of waiting by which time she was able to behave with tolerable propriety When she did appear at last she was closely veiled and stepped into the carriage without once showing her face But she made a very pretty apology for the delay she had occasioned which was certainly due seeing it had been perfectly intentional She made room for Hugh he took his place beside her and away they drove Euphra scarcely spoke but begged indulgence on the ground of her headache Lady Emily enjoyed the drive very much and said a great many pleasant little nothings Would you like a glass of milk said missus Elton to her as they passed a farm house on the estate I should very much answered Lady Emily The carriage was stopped and the servant sent to beg a glass of milk Euphra who from riding backward with a headache had been feeling very uncomfortable for some time wished to get out while the carriage was waiting Hugh jumped out and assisted her She walked a little way leaning on his arm up to the house where she had a glass of water after which she said she felt better and returned with him to the carriage In getting in again either from the carelessness or the weakness occasioned by suffering her foot slipped from the step and she fell with a cry of alarm Hugh caught her as she fell and she would not have been much injured had not the horses started and sprung forward at the moment so that the hind wheel of the carriage passed over her ankle Hugh raising her in his arms found she was insensible He laid her down upon the grass by the roadside Water was procured but she showed no sign of recovering What was to be done missus Elton thought she had better be carried to the farm house Hugh judged it better to take her home at once To this after a little argument missus Elton agreed They lifted her into the carriage and made what arrangements they best could to allow her to recline Blood was flowing from her foot and it was so much swollen that it was impossible to guess at the amount of the injury The foot was already twice the size of the other in which Hugh for the first time recognised such a delicacy of form as to his fastidious eye and already ensnared heart would have been perfectly enchanting but for the agony he suffered from the injury to the other Yet he could not help the thought crossing his mind that her habit of never lifting her dress was a very strange one and that it must have had something to do with the present accident I cannot account for this habit but on one of two suppositions that of an affected delicacy or that of the desire that the beauty of her feet should have its full power from being rarely seen But it was dreadful to think how far the effects of this accident might permanently injure the beauty of one of them Hugh would have walked home that she might have more room but he knew he could be useful when they arrived He seated himself so as to support the injured foot and prevent in some measure the torturing effects of the motion of the carriage When they had gone about half way she opened her eyes feebly glanced at him and closed them again with a moan of pain He carried her in his arms up to her own room and laid her on a couch She thanked him by a pitiful attempt at a smile He mounted his horse and galloped for a surgeon The injury was a serious one but until the swelling could be a little reduced it was impossible to tell how serious The surgeon however feared that some of the bones of the ankle might be crushed The ankle seemed to be dislocated and the suffering was frightful She endured it well however so far as absolute silence constitutes endurance Hugh s misery was extreme The surgeon had required his assistance but a suitable nurse soon arrived and there was no pretext for his further presence in the sick chamber He wandered about the grounds Harry haunted his steps like a spaniel The poor boy felt it much and the suffering abstraction of Hugh sealed up his chief well of comfort At length he went to missus Elton who did her best to console him By the surgeon s express orders every one but the nurse was excluded from Euphra s room CHAPTER XXVII MORE TROUBLES Come on and do your best To fright me with your sprites you re powerful at it You smell this business with a sense as cold As is a dead man s nose A Winter s Tale When mister Arnold came home to dinner and heard of the accident his first feeling as is the case with weak men was one of mingled annoyance and anger Hugh was the chief object of it for had he not committed the ladies to his care And the economy of his house being partially disarranged by it had he not a good right to be angry His second feeling was one of concern for his niece which was greatly increased when he found that she was not in a state to see him Still nothing must interfere with the order of things and when Hugh went into the drawing room at the usual hour he found mister Arnold standing there in tail coat and white neck cloth looking as if he had just arrived at a friend s house to make one of a stupid party And the party which sat down to dinner was certainly dreary enough consisting only besides the host himself of missus Elton Hugh and Harry Lady Emily had had exertion enough for the day and had besides shared in the shock of Euphra s misfortune mister Arnold was considerably out of humour and ready to pounce upon any object of complaint He would have attacked Hugh with a pompous speech on the subject of his carelessness but he was rather afraid of his tutor now so certainly will the stronger get the upper hand in time He did not even refer to the subject of the accident Therefore although it filled the minds of all at table it was scarcely more than alluded to But having nothing at hand to find fault with more suitable he laid hold of the first wise remark volunteered by good missus Elton whereupon an amusing pas de deux immediately followed for it could not be called a duel inasmuch as each antagonist kept skipping harmlessly about the other exploding theological crackers firmly believed by the discharger to be no less than bomb shells At length missus Elton withdrew By the way mister Sutherland said mister Arnold have you succeeded in deciphering that curious inscription yet I don t like the ring to remain long out of my own keeping It is quite an heirloom I assure you Hugh was forced to confess that he had never thought of it again Shall I fetch it at once added he Oh no replied mister Arnold I should really like to understand the inscription To morrow will do perfectly well They went to the drawing room Everything was wretched However many ghosts might be in the house it seemed to Hugh that there was no soul in it except in one room The wind sighed fitfully and the rain fell in slow soundless showers mister Arnold felt the vacant oppression as well as Hugh missus Elton having gone to Lady Emily s room he proposed back gammon and on that surpassing game the gentlemen expended the best part of two dreary hours When Hugh reached his room he was too tired and spiritless for any intellectual effort and instead of trying to decipher the ring went to bed and slept as if there were never a ghost or a woman in the universe His first proceeding after breakfast next day was to get together his German books and his next to take out the ring which was to be subjected to their analytical influences He went to his desk and opened the secret place There he stood fixed The ring was gone His packet of papers was there rather crumpled the ring was nowhere What had become of it It was not long before a conclusion suggested itself It flashed upon him all at once The ghost has got it he said half aloud It is shining now on her dead finger It was Lady Euphrasia She was going for it then It wasn t on her thumb when she went She came back with it shining through the dark stepped over me perhaps as I lay on the floor in her way He shivered like one in an ague fit Again and again with that frenzied mechanical motion which like the eyes of a ghost has no speculation in it he searched the receptacle although it freely confessed its emptiness to any asking eye Then he stood gazing and his heart seemed to stand still likewise But a new thought stung him turning him almost sick with a sense of loss Suddenly and frantically he dived his hand into the place yet again useless as he knew the search to be He took up his papers and scattered them loose It was all unavailing his father s ring was gone as well He sank on a chair for a moment but instantly recovering found himself before he was quite aware of his own resolution halfway down stairs on his way to mister Arnold s room It was empty He rang for his servant mister Arnold had gone away on horseback and would not be home till dinner time Counsel from missus Elton was hopeless Help from Euphra he could not ask He returned to his own room There he found Harry waiting for him His neglected pupil was now his only comforter Such are the revenges of divine goodness Harry he said I have been robbed Robbed cried Harry starting up Never mind mister Sutherland my papa s a justice of the peace He ll catch the thief for you But it s your papa s ring that they ve stolen He lent it to me and what if he should not believe me Not believe you mister Sutherland But he must believe you I will tell him all about it and he knows I never told him a lie in my life But you don t know anything about it Harry But you will tell me won t you Hugh could not help smiling with pleasure at the confidence his pupil placed in him He had not much fear about being believed but at the best it was an unpleasant occurrence The loss of his own ring not only added to his vexation but to his perplexity as well What could she want with his ring Could she have carried with her such a passion for jewels as to come from the grave to appropriate those of others as well as to reclaim her own Was this her comfort in Hades poor ghost Would it be better to tell mister Arnold of the loss of both rings or should he mention the crystal only He came to the conclusion that it would only exasperate him the more and perhaps turn suspicion upon himself if he communicated the fact that he too was a loser and to such an extent for Hugh s ring was worth twenty of the other and was certainly as sacred as mister Arnold s if not so ancient He would bear it in silence If the one could not be found there could certainly be no hope of the other Punctual as the clock mister Arnold returned It did not prejudice him in favour of the reporter of bad tidings that he begged a word with him before dinner when that was on the point of being served It was indeed exceeding impolitic but Hugh would have felt like an impostor had he sat down to the table before making his confession mister Arnold I am sorry to say I have been robbed and in your house too In my house Of what pray mister Sutherland mister Arnold had taken the information as some weak men take any kind of information referring to themselves or their belongings namely as an insult He drew himself up and lowered portentously Of your ring mister Arnold Of my ring And he looked at his ring finger as if he could not understand the import of Hugh s words Of the ring you lent me to decipher explained Hugh Do you suppose I do not understand you mister Sutherland A ring which has been in the family for two hundred years at least Robbed of it In my house You must have been disgracefully careless mister Sutherland You have lost it mister Arnold said Hugh with dignity I am above using such a subterfuge even if it were not certain to throw suspicion where it was undeserved mister Arnold was a gentleman as far as his self importance allowed He did not apologize for what he had said but he changed his manner at once I am quite bewildered mister Sutherland It is a very annoying piece of news for many reasons I can show you where I laid it in the safest corner in my room I assure you Of course of course It is enough you say so We must not keep the dinner waiting now But after dinner I shall have all the servants up and investigate the matter thoroughly So thought Hugh with himself some one will be made a felon of because the cursed dead go stalking about this infernal house at midnight gathering their own old baubles No that will not do I must at least tell mister Arnold what I know of the doings of the night So mister Arnold must still wait for his dinner or rather which was really of more consequence in the eyes of mister Arnold the dinner must be kept waiting for him For order and custom were two of mister Arnold s divinities and the economy of his whole nature was apt to be disturbed by any interruption of their laws such as the postponement of dinner for ten minutes He was walking towards the door and turned with some additional annoyance when Hugh addressed him again One moment mister Arnold if you please mister Arnold merely turned and waited I fear I shall in some degree forfeit your good opinion by what I am about to say but I must run the risk mister Arnold still waited There is more about the disappearance of the ring than I can understand Or I either mister Sutherland But I must tell you what happened to myself the night that I kept watch in Lady Euphrasia s room You said you slept soundly So I did part of the time Then you kept back part of the truth I did Was that worthy of you I thought it best I doubted myself What has caused you to change your mind now This event about the ring What has that to do with it How do you even know that it was taken on that night I do not know for till this morning I had not opened the place where it lay I only suspect I am a magistrate mister Sutherland I would rather not be prejudiced by suspicions The person to whom my suspicions refer is beyond your jurisdiction mister Arnold I do not understand you I will explain myself Hugh gave mister Arnold a hurried yet circumstantial sketch of the apparition he believed he had seen What am I to judge from all this asked he coldly almost contemptuously I have told you the facts of course I must leave the conclusions to yourself mister Arnold but I confess for my part that any disbelief I had in apparitions is almost entirely removed since Since you dreamed you saw one Since the disappearance of the ring said Hugh Bah exclaimed mister Arnold with indignation Can a ghost fetch and carry like a spaniel mister Sutherland I am ashamed to have such a reasoner for tutor to my son Come to dinner and do not let me hear another word of this folly I beg you will not mention it to any one I have been silent hitherto mister Arnold but circumstances such as the commitment of any one on the charge of stealing the ring might compel me to mention the matter It would be for the jury to determine whether it was relevant or not It was evident that mister Arnold was more annoyed at the imputation against the nocturnal habits of his house than at the loss of the ring or even its possible theft by one of his servants He looked at Hugh for a moment as if he would break into a furious rage then his look gradually changed into one of suspicion and turning without another word he led the way to the dining room followed by Hugh To have a ghost held in his face in this fashion one bred in his own house too when he had positively declared his absolute contempt for every legend of the sort was more than man could bear He sat down to dinner in gloomy silence breaking it only as often as he was compelled to do the duties of a host which he performed with a greater loftiness of ceremony than usual There was no summoning of the servants after dinner however Hugh s warning had been effectual Nor was the subject once more alluded to in Hugh s hearing No doubt mister Arnold felt that something ought to be done but I presume he could never make up his mind what that something ought to be Whether any reasons for not prosecuting the inquiry had occurred to him upon further reflection I am unable to tell One thing is certain that from this time he ceased to behave to Hugh with that growing cordiality which he had shown him for weeks past It was no great loss to Hugh but he felt it and all the more because he could not help associating it with that look of suspicion the remains of which were still discernible on mister Arnold s face Although he could not determine the exact direction of mister Arnold s suspicions he felt that they bore upon something associated with the crystal ring and the story of the phantom lady Consequently there was little more of comfort for him at Arnstead mister Arnold however did not reveal his change of feeling so much by neglect as by ceremony which sooner than anything else builds a wall of separation between those who meet every day For the oftener they meet the thicker and the faster are the bricks and mortar of cold politeness evidently avoided insults and subjected manifestations of dislike laid together CHAPTER XXVIII A BIRD S EYE VIEW O cocks are crowing a merry midnight I wot the wild fowls are boding day Give me my faith and troth again And let me fare me on my way Sae painfully she clam the wa She clam the wa up after him Hosen nor shoon upon her feet She hadna time to put them on Scotch Ballad Clerk Saunders Dreary days passed The reports of Euphra were as favourable as the nature of the injury had left room to expect Still they were but reports Hugh could not see her and the days passed drearily He heard that the swelling was reduced and that the ankle was found not to be dislocated but that the bones were considerably injured and that the final effect upon the use of the parts was doubtful The pretty foot lay aching in Hugh s heart When Harry went to bed he used to walk out and loiter about the grounds full of anxious fears and no less anxious hopes If the night was at all obscure he would pass as often as he dared under Euphra s window for all he could have of her now was a few rays from the same light that lighted her chamber Then he would steal away down the main avenue and thence watch the same light whose beams in that strange play which the intellect will keep up in spite of yet in association with the heart made a photo materialist of him For he would now no longer believe in the pulsations of an ethereal medium but that the very material rays which enlightened Euphra s face whether she waked or slept stole and filtered through the blind and the gathered shadows and entered in bodily essence into the mysterious convolutions of his brain where his soul and heart sought and found them When a week had passed she was so far recovered as to be able to see mister Arnold from whom Hugh heard in a somewhat reproachful tone that she was but the wreck of her former self It was all that Hugh could do to restrain the natural outbreak of his feelings A fortnight passed and she saw missus Elton and Lady Emily for a few moments They would have left before but had yielded to mister Arnold s entreaty and were staying till Euphra should be at least able to be carried from her room One day when the visitors were out with mister Arnold Jane brought a message to Hugh requesting him to walk into Miss Cameron s room for she wanted to see him Hugh felt his heart flutter as if doubting whether to stop at once or to dash through its confining bars He rose and followed the maid He stood over Euphra pale and speechless She lay before him wasted and wan her eyes twice their former size but with half their former light her fingers long and transparent and her voice low and feeble She had just raised herself with difficulty to a sitting posture and the effort had left her more weary Hugh she said kindly Dear Euphra he answered kissing the little hand he held in his She looked at him for a little while and the tears rose in her eyes Hugh I am a cripple for life God forbid Euphra was all he could reply She shook her head mournfully Then a strange wild look came in her eyes and grew till it seemed from them to overflow and cover her whole face with a troubled expression which increased to a look of dull agony What is the matter dear Euphra said Hugh in alarm Is your foot very painful She made no answer She was looking fixedly at his hand Shall I call Jane She shook her head Can I do nothing for you No she answered almost angrily Shall I go Euphra Yes yes Go He left the room instantly But a sharp though stifled cry of despair drew him back at a bound Euphra had fainted He rang the bell for Jane and lingered till he saw signs of returning consciousness What could this mean He was more perplexed with her than ever he had been Cunning love however soon found a way of explaining it A way Twenty ways not one of them the way Next day Lady Emily brought him a message from Euphra not to distress himself about her it was not his fault This message the bearer of it understood to refer to the original accident as the sender of it intended she should the receiver interpreted it of the occurrence of the day before as the sender likewise intended It comforted him It had become almost a habit with Hugh to ascend the oak tree in the evening and sit alone sometimes for hours in the nest he had built for Harry One time he took a book with him another he went without and now and then Harry accompanied him But I have already said that often after tea when the house became oppressive to him from the longing to see Euphra he would wander out alone when even in the shadows of the coming night he would sometimes climb the nest and there sit hearing all that the leaves whispered about the sleeping birds without listening to a word of it or trying to interpret it by the kindred sounds of his own inner world and the tree talk that went on there in secret For the divinity of that inner world had abandoned it for the present in pursuit of an earthly maiden So its birds were silent and its trees trembled not An aging moon was feeling her path somewhere through the heavens but a thin veil of cloud was spread like a tent under the hyaline dome where she walked so that instead of a white moon there was a great white cloud to enlighten the earth a cloud soaked full of her pale rays Hugh sat in the oak nest He knew not how long he had been there Light after light was extinguished in the house and still he sat there brooding dreaming in that state of mind in which to the good good things come of themselves and to the evil evil things The nearness of the Ghost s Walk did not trouble him for he was too much concerned about Euphra to fear ghost or demon His mind heeded them not and so was beyond their influence But while he sat he became aware of human voices He looked out from his leafy screen and saw once more at the end of the Ghost s Walk a form clothed in white But there were voices of two He sent his soul into his ears to listen A horrible incredible impossible idea forced itself upon him that the tones were those of Euphra and Funkelstein The one voice was weak and complaining the other firm and strong It must be some horrible ghost that imitates her he said to himself for he was nearly crazy at the very suggestion He would see nearer if only to get rid of that frightful insinuation of the tempter He descended the tree noiselessly He lost sight of the figure as he did so He drew near the place where he had seen it But there was no sound of voices now to guide him As he came within sight of the spot he saw the white figure in the arms of another a man Her head was lying on his shoulder A moment after she was lifted in those arms and borne towards the house down the Ghost s Avenue A burning agony to be satisfied of his doubts seized on Hugh He fled like a deer to the house by another path tried in his suspicion the library window found it open and was at Euphra s door in a moment Here he hesitated She must be inside How dare he knock or enter If she was there she would be asleep He would not wake her There was no time to lose He would risk anything to be rid of this horrible doubt He gently opened the door The night light was burning He thought at first that Euphra was in the bed He felt like a thief but he stole nearer She was not there She was not on the couch She was not in the room Jane was fast asleep in the dressing room It was enough He withdrew He would watch at his door to see her return for she must pass his door to reach her own He waited a time that seemed hours At length horrible far more horrible to him than the vision of the ghost Euphra crept past him appearing in the darkness to crawl along the wall against which she supported herself and scarcely suppressing her groans of pain She reached her own room and entering closed the door Hugh was nearly mad He rushed down the stair to the library and out into the wood Why or whither he knew not Suddenly he received a blow on the head It did not stun him but he staggered under it Had he run against a tree No There was the dim bulk of a man disappearing through the boles He darted after him The man heard his footsteps stopped and waited in silence As Hugh came up to him he made a thrust at him with some weapon He missed his aim The weapon passed through his coat and under his arm The next moment Hugh had wrenched the sword stick from him thrown it away and grappled with Funkelstein But strong as Hugh was the Bohemian was as strong and the contest was doubtful Strange as it may seem in the midst of it while each held the other unable to move the conviction flashed upon Hugh s mind that whoever might have taken Lady Euphrasia s ring he was grappling with the thief of his father s Give me my ring gasped he An imprecation of a sufficiently emphatic character was the only reply The Bohemian got one hand loose and Hugh heard a sound like the breaking of glass Before he could gain any advantage for his antagonist seemed for the moment to have concentrated all his force in the other hand a wet handkerchief was held firmly to his face His fierceness died away he was lapt in the vapour of dreams and his senses departed CHAPTER XXIX HUGH S AWAKING But ah believe me there is more than so That works such wonders in the minds of men I that have often proved too well it know And whoso list the like assays to ken Shall find by trial and confess it then That beauty is not as fond men misdeem An outward show of things that only seem But ye fair dames the world s dear ornaments And lively images of heaven s light Let not your beams with such disparagements Be dimmed and your bright glory darkened quite But mindful still of your first country s sight Do still preserve your first informed grace Whose shadow yet shines in your beauteous face SPENSER Hymn in Honour of Beauty When Hugh came to himself he was lying in the first grey of the dawn amidst the dews and vapours of the morning woods He rose and looked around him The Ghost s Walk lay in long silence before him Here and there a little bird moved and peeped The glory of a new day was climbing up the eastern coast of heaven It would be a day of late summer crowned with flame and throbbing with ripening life But for him the spirit was gone out of the world and it was nought but a mass of blind heartless forces Possibly had he overheard the conversation the motions only of which he had overseen the preceding night he would although equally perplexed have thought more gently of Euphra but in the mood into which even then he must have been thrown his deeper feelings towards her could hardly have been different from what they were now Although he had often felt that Euphra was not very good not a suspicion had crossed his mind as to what he would have called the purity of her nature Like many youths even of character inferior to his own he had the loftiest notions of feminine grace and unspottedness in thought and feeling not to say action and aim Now he found that he had loved a woman who would creep from her chamber at the cost of great suffering and almost at the risk of her life to meet in the night and the woods a man no better than an assassin probably a thief Had he been more versed in the ways of women or in the probabilities of things he would have judged that the very extravagance of the action demanded a deeper explanation than what seemed to lie on the surface Yet although he judged Euphra very hardly upon those grounds would he have judged her differently had he actually known all About this I am left to conjecture alone But the effect on Hugh was different from what the ordinary reader of human nature might anticipate Instead of being torn in pieces by storms of jealousy all the summer growths of his love were chilled by an absolute frost of death A kind of annihilation sank upon the image of Euphra There had been no such Euphra She had been but a creation of his own brain It was not so much that he ceased to love as that the being beloved not died but ceased to exist There were moments in which he seemed to love her still with a wild outcry of passion but the frenzy soon vanished in the selfish feeling of his own loss His love was not a high one not such as thine my Falconer Thine was love indeed though its tale is too good to tell simply because it is too good to be believed and we do men a wrong sometimes when we tell them more than they can receive Thought Speculation Suggestion crowded upon each other till at length his mind sank passive and served only as the lists in which the antagonist thoughts fought a confused battle without herald or umpire But it is amazing to think how soon he began to look back upon his former fascination with a kind of wondering unbelief This bespoke the strength of Hugh s ideal sense as well as the weakness of his actual love He could hardly even recall the feelings with which on some well remembered occasion he had regarded her and which then it had seemed impossible he should ever forget Had he discovered the cloven foot of a demon under those trailing garments he could hardly have ceased to love her more suddenly or entirely But there is an aching that is worse to bear than pain I trust my reader will not judge very hardly of Hugh because of the change which had thus suddenly passed upon his feelings He felt now just as he had felt on waking in the morning and finding that he had been in love with a dream lady all the night it had been very delightful and it was sad that it was all gone and could come back no more But the wonder to me is not that some loves will not stand the test of absence but that their nature being what it is they should outlast one week of familiar intercourse He mourned bitterly over the loss of those feelings for they had been precious to him But could he help it Indeed he could not for his love had been fascination and the fascination having ceased the love was gone I believe some of my readers will not need this apology for Hugh but will rather admire the facility with which he rose above a misplaced passion and dismissed its object So do not I It came of his having never loved Had he really loved Euphra herself her own self the living woman who looked at him out of those eyes out of that face such pity would have blended with the love as would have made it greater and permitted no indignation to overwhelm it As it was he was utterly passive and helpless in the matter The fault lay in the original weakness that submitted to be so fascinated that gave in to it notwithstanding the vague expostulations of his better nature and the consciousness that he was neglecting his duty to Harry in order to please Euphra and enjoy her society Had he persisted in doing his duty it would at least have kept his mind more healthy lessened the absorption of his passion and given him opportunities of reflection and moments of true perception as to what he was about But now the spell was broken at once and the poor girl had lost a worshipper The golden image with the feet of clay might arise in a prophet s dream but it could never abide in such a lover s Her glance was powerless now Alas for the withering of such a dream Perhaps she deserved nothing else but our deserts when we get them are sad enough sometimes All that day he walked as in a dream of loss As for the person whom he had used to call Euphra she was removed to a vast distance from him An absolutely impassable gulf lay between them She sent for him He went to her filled with a sense of insensibility She was much worse and suffering great pain Hugh saw at once that she knew that all was over between them and that he had seen her pass his door or had been in her room for he had left her door a little open and she had left it shut One pathetic most pitiful glance of deprecating entreaty she fixed upon him as after a few moments of speechless waiting he turned to leave the room which would have remained deathless in his heart but that he interpreted it to mean Don t tell so he got rid of it at once by the grant of its supposed request She made no effort to detain him She turned her face away and hard hearted he heard her sob not as if her heart would break that is little but like an immortal woman in immortal agony and he did not turn to comfort her Perhaps it was better how could he comfort her Some kinds of comfort the only kinds which poor mortals sometimes have to give are like the food on which the patient and the disease live together and some griefs are soonest got rid of by letting them burn out All the fire engines in creation can only prolong the time and increase the sense of burning There is but one cure the fellow feeling of the human God which converts the agony itself into the creative fire of a higher life As for Von Funkelstein Hugh comforted himself with the conviction that they were destined to meet again The day went on as days will go unstayed unhastened by the human souls through which they glide silent and awful After such lessons as he was able to get through with Harry who feeling that his tutor did not want him left the room as soon as they were over he threw himself on the couch and tried to think But think he could not Thoughts passed through him but he did not think them He was powerless in regard to them They came and went of their own will he could neither say come nor go Tired at length of the couch he got up and paced about the room for hours When he came to himself a little he found that the sun was nearly setting Through the top of a beech tree taller than the rest it sent a golden light full of the floating shadows of leaves and branches upon the wall of his room But there was no beauty for him in the going down of the sun no glory in the golden light no message from dream land in the flitting and blending and parting the constantly dissolving yet ever remaining play of the lovely and wonderful shadow leaves The sun sank below the beech top and was hidden behind a cloud of green leaves thick as the wood was deep A grey light instead of a golden filled the room The change had no interest for him The pain of a lost passion tormented him the aching that came of the falling together of the ethereal walls of his soul about the space where there had been and where there was no longer a world A young bird flew against the window and fluttered its wings two or three times vainly seeking to overcome the unseen obstacle which the glass presented to its flight Hugh started and shuddered Then first he knew in the influence of the signs of the approaching darkness how much his nerves had suffered from the change that had passed He took refuge with Harry His pupil was now to be his consoler who in his turn would fare henceforth the better for the decay of Hugh s pleasures The poor boy was filled with delight at having his big brother all to himself again and worked harder than ever to make the best of his privileges For Hugh it was wonderful how soon his peace of mind began to return after he gave himself to his duty and how soon the clouds of disappointment descended below the far horizon leaving the air clear above and around Painful thoughts about Euphra would still present themselves but instead of becoming more gentle and sorrowful as the days went on they grew more and more severe and unjust and angry He even entertained doubts whether she did not know all about the theft of both rings for to her only had he discovered the secret place in the old desk If she was capable of what he believed why should she not be capable of anything else It seemed to him most simple and credible An impure woman might just as well be a thief too I am only describing Hugh s feelings But along with these feelings and thoughts of mingled good and bad came one feeling which he needed more than any repentance Seated alone upon a fallen tree one day the face of poor Harry came back to him as he saw it first poring over Polexander in the library and full of the joy of life himself notwithstanding his past troubles strong as a sunrise and hopeful as a Prometheus the quivering perplexity of that sickly little face smote him with a pang What might I not have done for the boy He too was in the hands of the enchantress and instead of freeing him I became her slave to enchain him further Yet even in this he did Euphra injustice for he had come to the conclusion that she had laid her plans with the intention of keeping the boy a dwarf by giving him only food for babes and not good food either withholding from him every stimulus to mental digestion and consequent hunger and that she had objects of her own in doing so one perhaps to keep herself necessary to the boy as she was to the father and so secure the future But poor Euphra s own nature and true education had been sadly neglected A fine knowledge of music and Italian and the development of a sensuous sympathy with nature could hardly be called education It was not certainly such a development of her own nature as would enable her to sympathise with the necessities of a boy s nature Perhaps the worst that could justly be said of her behaviour to Harry was that with a strong inclination to despotism and some feeling of loneliness she had exercised the one upon him in order to alleviate the other in herself Upon him therefore she expended a certain or rather an uncertain kind of affection which if it might have been more fittingly spent upon a lapdog and was worth but little might yet have become worth everything had she been moderately good Hugh did not see Euphra again for more than a fortnight CHAPTER XXX CHANGES Hey and the rue grows bonny wi thyme And the thyme it is withered and rue is in prime Refrain of an old Scotch song altered by BURNS He hath wronged me indeed he hath at a word he hath believe me Robert Shallow Esquire saith he is wronged Merry Wives of Windsor At length one evening entering the drawing room before dinner Hugh found Euphra there alone He bowed with embarrassment and uttered some commonplace congratulation on her recovery She answered him gently and coldly Her whole air and appearance were signs of acute suffering She did not make the slightest approach to their former familiarity but she spoke without any embarrassment like one who had given herself up and was therefore indifferent Hugh could not help feeling as if she knew every thought that was passing in his mind and having withdrawn herself from him was watching him with a cold ghostly interest She took his arm to go into the dining room and actually leaned upon it as indeed she was compelled to do Her uncle was delighted to see her once more missus Elton addressed her with kindness and Lady Emily with sweet cordiality She herself seemed to care for nobody and nothing As soon as dinner was over she sent for her maid and withdrew to her own room It was a great relief to Hugh to feel that he was no longer in danger of encountering her eyes Gradually she recovered strength though it was again some days before she appeared at the dinner table The distance between Hugh and her seemed to increase instead of diminish till at length he scarcely dared to offer her the smallest civility lest she should despise him as a hypocrite The further she removed herself from him the more he felt inclined to respect her By common consent they avoided as much as before any behaviour that might attract attention though the effort was of a very different nature now It was wretched enough no doubt for both of them The time drew near for Lady Emily s departure What are your plans for the winter missus Elton said mister Arnold one day I intend spending the winter in London she answered Then you are not going with Lady Emily to Madeira No Her father and one of her sisters are going with her I have a great mind to spend the winter abroad myself but the difficulty is what to do with Harry Could you not leave him with mister Sutherland No I do not choose to do that Then let him come to me I shall have all my little establishment up and there will be plenty of room for Harry A very kind offer I may possibly avail myself of it I fear we could hardly accommodate his tutor though But that will be very easily arranged He could sleep out of the house could he not Give yourself no trouble about that I wish Harry to have masters for the various branches he will study It will teach him more of men and the world generally and prevent his being too much influenced by one style of thinking But mister Sutherland is a very good tutor Yes Very To this there could be no reply but a question and mister Arnold s manner not inviting one the conversation was dropped Euphra gradually resumed her duties in the house as far as great lameness would permit She continued to show a quiet and dignified reserve towards Hugh She made no attempts to fascinate him and never avoided his look when it chanced to meet hers But although there was no reproach any more than fascination in her eyes Hugh s always fell before hers She walked softly like Ahab as if now that Hugh knew she too was ever conscious Her behaviour to missus Elton and Lady Emily was likewise improved but apparently only from an increase of indifference When the time came and they departed she did not even appear to be much relieved Once she asked Hugh to help her with a passage of Dante but betrayed no memory of the past His pleased haste to assist her showed that he at least if fancy free was not memory clear She thanked him very gently and truly took up her book like a school girl and limped away Hugh was smitten to the heart If I could but do something for her thought he but there was nothing to be done Although she had deserved it somehow her behaviour made him feel as if he had wronged her in ceasing to love her One day in the end of September mister Arnold and Hugh were alone after breakfast mister Arnold spoke mister Sutherland I have altered my plans with regard to Harry I wish him to spend the winter in London Hugh listened and waited mister Arnold went on after a slight pause There I wish him to reap such advantages as are to be gained in the metropolis He has improved wonderfully under your instruction and is now I think to be benefited principally by a variety of teachers I therefore intend that he shall have masters for the different branches which it is desirable he should study Consequently I shall be compelled to deny him your services valuable as they have hitherto been Very well mister Arnold said mister Sutherland with the indifference of one who feels himself ill used When shall I take my leave of him Not before the middle of the next month at the earliest But I will write you a cheque for your salary at once So saying mister Arnold left the room for a moment and returning handed Hugh a cheque for a year s salary Hugh glanced at it and offering it again to mister Arnold said No mister Arnold I can claim scarcely more than half a year s salary mister Sutherland your engagement was at so much a year and if I prevent you from fulfilling your part of it I am bound to fulfil mine Indeed you might claim further provision You are very kind mister Arnold Only just rejoined mister Arnold with conscious dignity I am under great obligation to you for the way in which you have devoted yourself to Harry Hugh s conscience gave him a pang Is anything more painful than undeserved praise I have hardly done my duty by him said he I can only say that the boy is wonderfully altered for the better and I thank you I am obliged to you oblige me by putting the cheque in your pocket Hugh persisted no longer in his refusal and indeed it had been far more a feeling of pride than of justice that made him decline accepting it at first Nor was there any generosity in mister Arnold s cheque for Hugh as he admitted might have claimed board and lodging as well But mister Arnold was one of the ordinarily honourable who with perfect characters for uprightness always contrive to err on the safe side of the purse and the doubtful side of a severely interpreted obligation Such people in so doing not unfrequently secure for themselves at the same time the reputation of generosity Hugh could not doubt that his dismissal was somehow or other connected with the loss of the ring but he would not stoop to inquire into the matter He hoped that time would set all right and in fact felt considerable indifference to the opinion of mister Arnold or of any one in the house except Harry The boy burst into tears when informed of his father s decision with regard to his winter studies and could only be consoled by the hope which Hugh held out to him certainly upon a very slight foundation that they might meet sometimes in London For the little time that remained Hugh devoted himself unceasingly to his pupil not merely studying with him but walking riding reading stories and going through all sorts of exercises for the strengthening of his person and constitution The best results followed both for Harry and his tutor CHAPTER XXXI EXPLANATIONS I have done nothing good to win belief My life hath been so faithless all the creatures Made for heaven s honours have their ends and good ones All but false women When they die like tales Ill told and unbelieved they pass away I will redeem one minute of my age Or like another Niobe I ll weep Till I am water BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER The Maid s Tragedy The days passed quickly by and the last evening that Hugh was to spend at Arnstead arrived He wandered out alone He had been with Harry all day and now he wished for a few moments of solitude It was a lovely autumn evening He went into the woods behind the house The leaves were still thick upon the trees but most of them had changed to gold and brown and red and the sweet faint odours of those that had fallen and lay thick underfoot ascended like a voice from the grave saying Here dwelleth some sadness but no despair As he strolled about among them the whole history of his past life arose before him This often happens before any change in our history and is surest to take place at the approach of the greatest change of all when we are about to pass into the unknown whence we came In this mood it was natural that his sins should rise before him They came as the shadows of his best pleasures For now in looking back he could fix on no period of his history around which the aureole which glorifies the sacred things of the past had gathered in so golden a hue as around the memory of the holy cottage the temple in which abode David and Janet and Margaret All the story glided past as the necromantic Will called up the sleeping dead in the mausoleum of the brain And that solemn kingly gracious old man who had been to him a father he had forgotten the homely tenderness which from fear of its own force concealed itself behind a humorous roughness of manner he had no not despised but forgotten too and if the dim pearly loveliness of the trustful grateful maiden had not been quite forgotten yet she too had been neglected had died as it were and been buried in the churchyard of the past where the grass grows long over the graves and the moss soon begins to fill up the chiselled records He was ungrateful He dared not allow to himself that he was unloving but he must confess himself ungrateful Musing sorrowfully and self reproachfully he came to the Ghost s Avenue Up and down its aisle he walked a fit place for remembering the past and the sins of the present Yielding himself to what thoughts might arise the strange sight he had seen here on that moonlit night of two silent wandering figures or could it be that they were one and the same suddenly changed in hue returned upon him This vision had been so speedily followed by the second and more alarming apparition of Lady Euphrasia that he had hardly had time to speculate on what the former could have been He was meditating upon all these strange events and remarking to himself that since his midnight encounter with Lady Euphrasia the house had been as quiet as a church yard at noon when all suddenly he saw before him at some little distance a dark figure approaching him His heart seemed to bound into his throat and choke him as he said to himself It is the nun again But the next moment he saw that it was Euphra I do not know which he would have preferred not meeting alone and in the deepening twilight Euphra too had become like a ghost to him His first impulse was to turn aside into the wood but she had seen him and was evidently going to address him He therefore advanced to meet her She spoke first approaching him with painful steps I have been looking for you mister Sutherland I wanted very much to have a little conversation with you before you go Will you allow me Hugh felt like a culprit directly Euphra s manner was quite collected and kind yet through it all a consciousness showed itself that the relation which had once existed between them had passed away for ever In her voice there was something like the tone of wind blowing through a ruin I shall be most happy said he She smiled sadly A great change had passed upon her I am going to be quite open with you she said I am perfectly aware as well as you are that the boyish fancy you had for me is gone Do not be offended You are manly enough but your love for me was boyish Most first loves are childish quite irrespective of age I do not blame you in the least This seemed to Hugh rather a strange style to assume if all was true that his own eyes had reported She went on Nor must you think it has cost me much to lose it Hugh felt hurt at which no one who understands will be surprised But I cannot afford to lose you the only friend I have she added Hugh turned towards her with a face full of manhood and truth You shall not lose me Euphra if you will be honest to yourself and to me Thank you I can trust you I will be honest At that moment without the revival of a trace of his former feelings Hugh felt nearer to her than he had ever felt before Now there seemed to be truth between them the only medium through which beings can unite I fear I have wronged you much she went on I do not mean some time ago Here she hesitated I fear I am the cause of your leaving Arnstead You Euphra No You must be mistaken I think not But I am compelled to make an unwilling disclosure of a secret a sad secret about myself Do not hate me quite I am a somnambulist She hid her face in her hands as if the night which had now closed around them did not hide her enough Hugh did not reply Absorbed in the interest which both herself and her confession aroused in him he could only listen eagerly She went on after a moment s pause I did not think at first that I had taken the ring I thought another had But last night and not till then I discovered that I was the culprit How That requires explanation I have no recollection of the events of the previous night when I have been walking in my sleep Indeed the utter absence of a sense of dreaming always makes me suspect that I have been wandering But sometimes I have a vivid dream which I know though I can give no proof of it to be a reproduction of some previous somnambulic experience Do not ask me to recall the horrors I dreamed last night I am sure I took the ring Then you dreamed what you did with it Yes I gave it to Here her voice sank and ceased Hugh would not urge her Have you mentioned this to mister Arnold No I do not think it would do any good But I will if you wish it she added submissively Not at all Just as you think best I could not tell him everything I cannot tell you everything If I did mister Arnold would turn me out of the house I am a very unhappy girl mister Sutherland From the tone of these words Hugh could not for a moment suppose that Euphra had any remaining design of fascination in them Perhaps he might want to keep you if I told him all but I do not think after the way he has behaved to you that you could stay with him for he would never apologize It is very selfish of me but indeed I have not the courage to confess to him I assure you nothing could make me remain now But what can I do for you Only let me depend upon you in case I should need your help or Here Euphra stopped suddenly and caught hold of Hugh s left hand which he had lifted to brush an insect from his face Where is your ring she said in a tone of suppressed anxiety Gone Euphra My father s ring It was lying beside Lady Euphrasia s Euphra s face was again hidden in her hands She sobbed and moaned like one in despair When she grew a little calmer she said I am sure I did not take your ring dear Hugh I am not a thief I had a kind of right to the other and he said it ought to have been his for his real name was Count von Halkar the same name as Lady Euphrasia s before she was married He took it I am sure It was he that knocked me down in the dark that night then Euphra Did he Oh I shall have to tell you all That wretch has a terrible power over me I loved him once But I refused to take the ring from your desk because I knew it would get you into trouble He threw me into a somnambulic sleep and sent me for the ring But I should have remembered if I had taken yours Even in my sleep I don t think he could have made me do that You may know I speak the truth when I am telling my own disgrace He promised to set me free if I would get the ring but he has not done it and he will not Sobs again interrupted her I was afraid your ring was gone I don t know why I thought so except that you hadn t it on when you came to see me Or perhaps it was because I am sometimes forced to think what that wretch is thinking He made me go to him that night you saw me Hugh But I was so ill I don t think I should have been able but that I could not rest till I had asked him about your ring He said he knew nothing about it I am sure be has it said Hugh And he related to Euphra the struggle he had had with Funkelstein and its result She shuddered I have been a devil to you Hugh I have betrayed you to him You will never see your ring again Here take mine It is not so good as yours but for the sake of the old way you thought of me take it No no Euphra mister Arnold would miss it Besides you know it would not be my father s ring and it was not for the value of the diamond I cared most about it And I am not sure that I shall not find it again I am going up to London where I shall fall in with him I hope But do take care of yourself He has no conscience God knows I have had little but he has none I know he has none but a conscience is not a bad auxiliary and there I shall have some advantage of him But what could he want that ring of Lady Euphrasia s for I don t know He never told me It was not worth much Next to nothing I shall be surer to find that than my own And I will find it if I can that mister Arnold may believe I was not to blame Do But be careful Don t fear I will be careful She held out her hand as if to take leave of him but withdrew it again with the sudden cry What shall I do I thought he had left me to myself till that night in the library She held down her head in silence Then she said slowly in a tone of agony I am a slave body and soul Hugh she added passionately and looking up in his face do you think there is a God Her eyes glimmered with the faint reflex from gathered tears that silently overflowed And now Hugh s own poverty struck him with grief and humiliation Here was a soul seeking God and he had no right to say that there was a God for he knew nothing about him He had been told so but what could that far off witness do for the need of a desolate heart She had been told so a million of times He could not say that he knew it That was what she wanted and needed He was honest and so replied I do not know I hope so He felt that she was already beyond him for she had begun to cry into the vague seemingly heartless void and say Is there a God somewhere to hear me when I cry And with all the teaching he had had he had no word of comfort to give Yes he had he had known David Elginbrod Before he had shaped his thought she said I think if there were a God he would help me for I am nothing but a poor slave now I have hardly a will of my own The sigh she heaved told of a hopeless oppression The best man and the wisest and the noblest I ever knew said Hugh believed in God with his whole heart and soul and strength and mind In fact he cared for nothing but God or rather he cared for everything because it belonged to God He was never afraid of anything never vexed at anything never troubled about anything He was a good man Hugh was surprised at the light which broke upon the character of David as he held it before his mind s eye in order to describe it to Euphra He seemed never to have understood him before Ah I wish I knew him I would go to that man and ask him to save me Where does he live Alas I do not know whether he is alive or dead the more to my shame But he lives if he lives far away in the north of Scotland She paused No I could not go there I will write to him Hugh could not discourage her though he doubted whether a real communication could be established between them I will write down his address for you when I go in said he But what can he save you from From no God she answered solemnly If there is no God then I am sure that there is a devil and that he has got me in his power Hugh felt her shudder for she was leaning on his arm she was still so lame She continued Oh if I had a God he would right me I know Hugh could not reply A pause followed Good bye I feel pretty sure we shall meet again My presentiments are generally true said Euphra at length Hugh kissed her hand with far more real devotion than he had ever kissed it with before She left him and hastened to the house with feeble speed He was sorry she was gone He walked up and down for some time meditating on the strange girl and her strange words till hearing the dinner bell he too must hasten in to dress Euphra met him at the dinner table without any change of her late manner mister Arnold wished him good night more kindly than usual When he went up to his room he found that Harry had already cried himself to sleep CHAPTER XXXII DEPARTURE I fancy deemed fit guide to lead my way And as I deemed I did pursue her track Wit lost his aim and will was fancy s prey The rebel won the ruler went to wrack But now sith fancy did with folly end Wit bought with loss will taught by wit will mend SOUTHWELL David s Peccavi After dinner Hugh wandered over the well known places to bid them good bye Then he went up to his room and with the vanity of a young author took his poems out of the fatal old desk wrote Take them please such as they are Let me be your friend inclosed them with the writing and addressed them to Euphra By the time he saw them again they were so much waste paper in his eyes But what were his plans for the future First of all he would go to London There he would do many things He would try to find Funkelstein He would write He would make acquaintance with London life for had he not plenty of money in his pocket And who could live more thriftily than he During his last session at Aberdeen he had given some private lessons and so contrived to eke out his small means These were wretchedly paid for namely not quite at the rate of sevenpence halfpenny a lesson but still that was something where more could not be had Now he would try to do the same in London where he would be much better paid Or perhaps he might get a situation in a school for a short time if he were driven to ultimate necessity At all events he would see London and look about him for a little while before he settled to anything definite With this hopeful prospect before him he next morning bade adieu to Arnstead I will not describe the parting with poor Harry The boy seemed ready to break his heart and Hugh himself had enough to do to refrain from tears One of the grooms drove him to the railway in the dog cart As they came near the station Hugh gave him half a crown Enlivened by the gift the man began to talk He s a rum customer that ere gemman with the foring name The colour of his puss I couldn t swear to now Never saw sixpence o his n My opinion is master had better look arter his spoons And for missus well it s a pity He s a rum un as I say anyhow The man here nodded several times half compassionately half importantly Hugh did not choose to inquire what he meant They reached the station and in a few minutes he was shooting along towards London that social vortex which draws everything towards its central tumult But there is a central repose beyond the motions of the world and through the turmoil of London Hugh was journeying towards that wide stillness that silence of the soul which is not desolate but rich with unutterable harmonies END OF THE SECOND BOOK BOOK III LONDON Art thou poor yet hast thou golden slumbers Oh sweet content Art thou rich yet is thy mind

THOMAS DEKKER Comedy of Patient Grissell CHAPTER I LODGINGS Heigh ho sing heigh ho unto the green holly Most friendship is feigning most loving mere folly Then heigh ho the holly This life is most jolly Song in As You Like It Hugh felt rather dreary as through Bermondsey he drew nigh to the London Bridge Station Fog and drizzle and smoke and stench composed the atmosphere He got out in a drift of human atoms Leaving his luggage at the office he set out on foot to explore in fact to go and look for his future which even when he met it he would not be able to recognise with any certainty The first form in which he was interested to find it embodied was that of lodgings but where even to look he did not know He had been in London for a few days in the spring on his way to Arnstead so he was not utterly ignorant of the anatomy of the monster city but his little knowledge could not be of much service to him now And how different it was from the London of spring which had lingered in his memory and imagination when transformed by the heavenly alchemy of the piercing sunbeams that slanted across the streets from chimney tops to opposite basements the dust and smoke showed great inclined planes of light up whose steep slopes one longed to climb to the fountain glory whence they flowed Now the streets from garret to cellar seemed like huge kennels of muddy moist filthy air down through which settled the heavier particles of smoke and rain upon the miserable human beings who crawled below in the deposit like shrimps in the tide or whitebait at the bottom of the muddy Thames He had to wade through deep thin mud even on the pavements Everybody looked depressed and hurried by with a cowed look as if conscious that the rain and general misery were a plague drawn down on the city by his own individual crime Nobody seemed to care for anybody or anything Good heavens thought Hugh what a place this must be for one without money It looked like a chaos of human nomads And yet in reality the whole mass was so bound together interwoven and matted by the crossing and inter twisting threads of interest mutual help and relationship of every kind that Hugh soon found how hard it was to get within the mass at all so as to be in any degree partaker of the benefits it shared within itself He did not wish to get lodgings in the outskirts for he thought that would remove him from every centre of action or employment But he saw no lodgings anywhere Growing tired and hungry he went at length into an eating house which he thought looked cheap and proceeded to dine upon a cinder which had been a steak He tried to delude himself into the idea that it was a steak still by withdrawing his attention from it and fixing it upon a newspaper two days old Finding nothing of interest he dallied with the advertisements He soon came upon a column from which single gentlemen appeared to be in request as lodgers Looking over these advertisements which had more interest for him at the moment than all home and foreign news battles and murders included he drew a map from his pocket and began to try to find out some of the localities indicated Most of them were in or towards the suburbs At last he spied one in a certain square which after long and diligent search and with the assistance of the girl who waited on him he found on his map It was in the neighbourhood of Holborn and from the place it occupied in the map seemed central enough for his vague purposes Above all the terms were said to be moderate But no description of the character of the lodgings was given else Hugh would not have ventured to look at them What he wanted was something of the same sort as he had had in Aberdeen a single room or a room and bed room for which he should have to pay only a few shillings a week Refreshed by his dinner wretched as it was he set out again To his great joy the rain was over and an afternoon sun was trying with some slight measure of success to pierce the clouds of the London atmosphere it had already succeeded with the clouds of the terrene He soon found his way into Holborn and thence into the square in question It looked to him very attractive for it was quietness itself and had no thoroughfare except across one of its corners True it was invaded by the universal roar for what place in London is not but it contributed little or nothing of its own manufacture to the general production of sound in the metropolis The centre was occupied by grass and trees inclosed within an iron railing All the leaves were withered and many had dropped already on the pavement below In the middle stood the statue of a queen of days gone by The tide of fashion had rolled away far to the west and yielded a free passage to the inroads of commerce and of the general struggle for ignoble existence upon this once favoured island in its fluctuating waters Old windows flush with the external walls whence had glanced fair eyes to which fashion was even dearer than beauty now displayed Lodgings to Let between knitted curtains from which all idea of drapery had been expelled by severe starching Amongst these he soon found the house he sought and shrunk from its important size and bright equipments but summoning courage thought it better to ring the bell A withered old lady in just the same stage of decay as the square and adorned after the same fashion as the house came to the door cast a doubtful look at Hugh and when he had stated his object asked him in a hard keen unmodulated voice to walk in He followed her and found himself in a dining room which to him judging by his purse and not by what he had been used to of late seemed sumptuous He said at once It is needless for me to trouble you further I see your rooms will not suit me The old lady looked annoyed Will you see the drawing room apartments then she said crustily No thank you It would be giving you quite unnecessary trouble My apartments have always given satisfaction I assure you sir Indeed I have no reason to doubt it I wish I could afford to take them said Hugh thinking it better to be open than to hurt her feelings I am sure I should be very comfortable But a poor He did not know what to call himself O oh said the landlady Then after a pause Well interrogatively Well I was a tutor last but I don t know what I may be next She kept looking at him Once or twice she looked at him from head to foot You are respectable I hope so said Hugh laughing Well this time not interrogatively How many rooms would you like The fewer the better Half a one if there were nobody in the other half Well and you wouldn t give much trouble I daresay Only for coals and water to wash and drink And you wouldn t dine at home No nor anywhere else said Hugh but the second and larger clause was sotto voce And you wouldn t smoke in doors No And you would wipe your boots clean before you went up stairs Yes certainly Hugh was beginning to be exceedingly amused but he kept his gravity wonderfully Have you any money Yes plenty for the meantime But when I shall get more I don t know you see Well I ve a room at the top of the house which I ll make comfortable for you and you may stay as long as you like to behave yourself But what is the rent Four shillings a week to you Would you like to see it Yes if you please She conducted him up to the third floor and showed him a good sized room rather bare but clean This will do delightfully said Hugh I will make it a little more comfortable for you you know Thank you very much Shall I pay you a month in advance No no she answered with a grim smile I might want to get rid of you you know It must be a week s warning no more Very well I have no objection I will go and fetch my luggage I suppose I may come in at once The sooner the better young man in a place like London The sooner you come home the better pleased I shall be There now So saying she walked solemnly down stairs before him and let him out Hugh hurried away to fetch his luggage delighted that he had so soon succeeded in finding just what he wanted As he went he speculated on the nature of his landlady trying to account for her odd rough manner and the real kindness of her rude words He came to the conclusion that she was naturally kind to profusion and that this kindness had some time or other perhaps repeatedly been taken shameful advantage of that at last she had come to the resolution to defend herself by means of a general misanthropy and supposed that she had succeeded when she had got no further than to have so often imitated the tone of her own behaviour when at its crossest as to have made it habitual by repetition In all probability some unknown sympathy had drawn her to Hugh She might have had a son about his age who had run away thirty years ago Or rather for she seemed an old maid she had been jilted some time by a youth about the same size as Hugh and therefore she loved him the moment she saw him Or in short a thousand things Certainly seldom have lodgings been let so oddly or so cheaply But some impulse or other of the whimsical old human heart which will have its way was satisfied therein When he returned in a couple of hours with his boxes on the top of a cab the door was opened before he knocked by a tidy maid who without being the least like her mistress yet resembled her excessively She helped him to carry his boxes up stairs and when he reached his room he found a fire burning cheerily a muffin down before it a tea kettle singing on the hob and the tea tray set upon a nice white cloth on a table right in front of the fire with an old fashioned high backed easy chair by its side the very chair to go to sleep in over a novel The old lady soon made her appearance with the teapot in one hand and a plate of butter in the other Oh thank you said Hugh This is comfortable She answered only by compressing her lips till her mouth vanished altogether and nodding her head as much as to say I know it is I intended it should be She then poured water into the teapot set it down by the fire and vanished Hugh sat down in the easy chair and resolved to be comfortable at least till he had had his tea after which he would think what he was to do next A knock at the door and his landlady entered laid a penny newspaper on the table and went away This was just what he wanted to complete his comfort He took it up and read while he consumed his bread and butter When he had had enough of tea and newspaper he said to himself Now what am I to do next It is a happy thing for us that this is really all we have to concern ourselves about what to do next No man can do the second thing He can do the first If he omits it the wheels of the social Juggernaut roll over him and leave him more or less crushed behind If he does it he keeps in front and finds room to do the next again and so he is sure to arrive at something for the onward march will carry him with it There is no saying to what perfection of success a man may come who begins with what he can do and uses the means at his hand He makes a vortex of action however slight towards which all the means instantly begin to gravitate Let a man but lay hold of something anything and he is in the high road to success though it may be very long before he can walk comfortably in it It is true the success may be measured out according to a standard very different from his But in Hugh s case the difficulty was to grasp anything to make a beginning anywhere He knew nobody and the globe of society seemed like a mass of adamant on which he could not gain the slightest hold or make the slightest impression Who would introduce him to pupils Nobody He had the testimonials of his professors but who would ask to see them His eye fell on the paper He would advertise CHAPTER II LETTERS FOR THE POST Nothing but drought and dearth but bush and brake Which way soe er I look I see Some may dream merrily but when they wake They dress themselves and come to thee GEORGE HERBERT Home He got his writing materials and wrote to the effect that a graduate of a Scotch university was prepared to give private lessons in the classics and mathematics or even in any of the inferior branches of education c c This he would take to the Times next day As soon as he had done this Duty lifted up her head and called him He obeyed and wrote to his mother Duty called again and he wrote though with much trepidation and humiliation to David Elginbrod It was a good beginning He had commenced his London life in doing what he knew he ought to do His trepidation in writing to David arose in part it must be confessed from the strange result of one of the experiments at Arnstead This was his letter But he sat and meditated a long time before he began it MY DEAR FRIEND If I did not think you would forgive me I should feel now that I have once allowed my mind to rest upon my conduct to you as if I could never hold up my head again After much occupation of thought and feeling with other things a season of silence has come and my sins look me in the face First of them all is my neglect of you to whom I owe more than to any man else except perhaps my father Forgive me for forgiveness sake You know it takes a long time for a child to know its mother It takes everything as a matter of course till suddenly one day it lifts up its eyes and knows that a face is looking at it I have been like the child towards you but I am beginning to feel what you have been to me I want to be good I am very lonely now in great noisy London Write to me if you please and comfort me I wish I were as good as you Then everything would go right with me Do not suppose that I am in great trouble of any kind As yet I am very comfortable as far as external circumstances go But I have a kind of aching inside me Something is not right and I want your help You will know what I mean What am I to do Please to remember me in the kindest most grateful manner to missus Elginbrod and Margaret It is more than I deserve but I hope they have not forgotten me as I have seemed to forget them I am my dear mister Elginbrod Your old friend HUGH SUTHERLAND I may as well insert here another letter which arrived at Turriepuffit likewise addressed to David some six weeks after the foregoing They were both taken to Janet of course SIR I have heard from one who knows you that you believe really believe in God That is why I write to you It may seem very strange in me to do so but how can I help it I am a very unhappy woman for I am in the power of a bad man I cannot explain it all to you and I will not attempt it for sometimes I almost think I am out of my mind and that it is all a delusion But alas delusion or not it is a dreadful reality to me in all its consequences It is of such a nature that no one can help me but God if there be a God and if you can make me believe that there is a God I shall not need to be persuaded that he will help me for I will besiege him with prayers night and day to set me free And even if I am out of my mind who can help me but him Ah is it not when we are driven to despair when there is no more help anywhere that we look around for some power of good that can put right all that is wrong Tell me dear sir what to do Tell me that there certainly is a God else I shall die raving He said you knew about him better than anybody else I am honoured Sir Your obedient servant EUPHRASIA CAMERON Arnstead Surrey c c David s answer to this letter would have been something worth having But I think it would have been all summed up in one word Try and see call and listen But what could Janet do with such letters She did the only thing she could she sent them to Margaret Hugh found it no great hardship to go to bed in the same room in which he sat The bed looked peculiarly inviting for strange to tell it was actually hung with the same pattern of old fashioned chintz as the bed which had been his from his earliest recollection till he left his father s house How could he mistake the trees growing with tufts to the ground or the great birds which he used to think were crows notwithstanding their red and yellow plumage It was all over red brown and yellow He could remember and reconstruct the very faces distorted and awful which in the delirium of childish sicknesses he used to discover in the foliage and stems of the trees It made the whole place seem to him homely and kind When he got tired he knelt by his bedside which he had not done for a long time and then went to bed Hardship No It was very pleasant to see the dying fire and his books about and his papers and to dream half asleep and half awake that the house fairies were stealing out to gambol for a little in the fire lighted silence of the room as he slept and to vanish as the embers turned black He had not been so happy for a long time as now The writing of that letter had removed a load from his heart True we can never be at peace till we have performed the highest duty of all till we have arisen and gone to our Father but the performance of smaller duties yes even of the smallest will do more to give us temporary repose will act more as healthful anodynes than the greatest joys that can come to us from any other quarter He soon fell asleep and dreamed that he was a little child lost in a snow storm and that just as the snow had reached above his head and he was beginning to be smothered a great hand caught hold of him by the arm and lifted him out and lo the storm had ceased and the stars were sparkling overhead like diamonds that had been drinking the light of the sun all day and he saw that it was David as strong as ever who had rescued him the little child and was leading him home to Janet But he got sleepy and faint upon the way which was long and cold and then David lifted him up and carried him in his bosom and he fell asleep When he woke and opening his eyes looked up to him who bore him it was David no longer The face was that which was marred more than any man s because the soul within had loved more it was the face of the Son of Man and he was carrying him like a lamb in his bosom He gazed more and more as they travelled through the cold night and the joy of lying in the embrace of that man grew and grew till it became too strong for the bonds of sleep and he awoke in the fog of a London morning CHAPTER III ENDEAVOURS And even should misfortunes come I here wha sit hae met wi some An s thankfu for them yet They gie the wit of age to youth They let us ken oursel They mak us see the naked truth The real guid and ill Tho losses and crosses Be lessons right severe There s wit there ye ll get there Ye ll find nae other where BURNS Hugh took his advertisement to the Times office and paid what seemed to him an awful amount for its insertion Then he wandered about London till the middle of the day when he went into a baker s shop and bought two penny loaves which he put in his pocket Having found his way to the British Museum he devoured them at his leisure as he walked through the Grecian and Roman saloons What is the use of good health he said to himself if a man cannot live upon bread Porridge and oatmeal cakes would have pleased him as well but that food for horses is not so easily procured in London and costs more than the other A cousin of his had lived in Edinburgh for six months upon eighteen pence a week in that way and had slept the greater part of the time upon the floor training himself for the hardships of a soldier s life And he could not forget the college youth whom his comrades had considered mean till they learned that out of his poor bursary of fourteen pounds a session and what he could make besides by private teaching at the rate previously mentioned or even less he helped his parents to educate a younger brother and in order to do so lived himself upon oatmeal and potatoes But they did not find this out till after he was dead poor fellow He could not stand it I ought at the same time to mention that Hugh rarely made use of a crossing on a muddy day without finding a half penny somewhere about him for the sweeper He would rather walk through oceans of mud than cross at the natural place when he had no coppers especially if he had patent leather boots on After he had eaten his bread he went home to get some water Then as he had nothing else to do he sat down in his room and began to manufacture a story thinking it just possible it might be accepted by one or other of the pseudo literary publications with which London is inundated in hebdomadal floods He found spinning almost as easy as if he had been a spider for he had a ready invention and a natural gift of speech so that in a few days he had finished a story quite as good as most of those that appear in the better sort of weekly publications This in his modesty he sent to one of the inferior sort and heard nothing more of it than if he had flung it into the sea Possibly he flew too low He tried again but with no better success His ambition grew with his disappointments or perhaps rather with the exercise of his faculties Before many days had passed he made up his mind to try a novel For three months he worked at this six hours a day regularly When material failed him from the exhaustion consequent upon uninterrupted production he would recreate himself by lying fallow for an hour or two or walking out in a mood for merely passive observation But this anticipates His advertisement did not produce a single inquiry and he shrunk from spending more money in such an apparently unprofitable appliance Day after day went by and no voice reached him from the unknown world of labour He went at last to several stationers shops in the neighbourhood bought some necessary articles and took these opportunities of asking if they knew of any one in want of such assistance as he could give But unpleasant as he felt it to make such inquiries he soon found that to most people it was equally unpleasant to reply to them There seemed to be something disreputable in having to answer such questions to judge from the constrained indifferent and sometimes though not often surly answers which he received Can it be thought Hugh as disgraceful to ask for work as to ask for bread If he had had a thousand a year and had wanted a situation of another thousand it would have been quite commendable but to try to elude cold and hunger by inquiring after paltry shillings worths of hard labour was despicable So he placed the more hope upon his novel and worked at that diligently But he did not find it quite so easy as he had at first expected No one finds anything either so easy or so difficult as in opposite moods he had expected to find it Everything is possible but without labour and failure nothing is achievable The labour however comes naturally and experience grows without agonizing transitions while the failure generally points in its detected cause to the way of future success He worked on He did not however forget the ring Frequent were his meditations in the pauses of his story and when walking in the streets as to the best means of recovering it I should rather say any means than best for it was not yet a question of choice and degrees The count could not but have known that the ring was of no money value therefore it was not likely that he had stolen it in order to part with it again Consequently it would be of no use to advertise it or to search for it in the pawnbrokers or second hand jewellers shops To find the crystal it was clear as itself that he must first find the count But how He could think of no plan Any alarm would place the count on the defensive and the jewel at once beyond reach Besides he wished to keep the whole matter quiet and gain his object without his or any other name coming before the public Therefore he would not venture to apply to the police though doubtless they would be able to discover the man if he were anywhere in London He surmised that in all probability they knew him already But he could not come to any conclusion as to the object he must have had in view in securing such a trifle Hugh had all but forgotten the count s cheque for a hundred guineas for in the first place he had never intended presenting it the repugnance which some minds feel to using money which they have neither received by gift nor acquired by honest earning being at least equal to the pleasure other minds feel in gaining it without the expense of either labour or obligation and in the second place since he knew more about the drawer he had felt sure that it would be of no use to present it To make this latter conviction a certainty he did present it and found that there were no effects CHAPTER IV A LETTER FROM THE POST Hipolito Is your wife then departed Orlando She s an old dweller in those high countries yet not from me here she s here a good couple are seldom parted DEKKER What wonderful things letters are In trembling and hope the fingers unclasp and the folded sheet drops into no not the post office letter box but into space I have read a story somewhere of a poor child that dropped a letter into the post office addressed to Jesus Christ in Heaven And it reached him and the child had her answer For was it not Christ present in the good man or woman I forget the particulars of the story who sent the child the help she needed There was no necessity for him to answer in person as in the case of Abgarus king of Edessa Out of space from somewhere comes the answer Such letters as those given in a previous chapter are each a spirit cry sent out like a Noah s dove into the abyss and the spirit turns its ear where its mouth had been turned before and leans listening for the spirit echo the echo with a soul in it the answering voice which out of the abyss will enter by the gate now turned to receive it Whose will be the voice What will be the sense What chords on the harp of life have been struck afar off by the arrow words of the letter What tones will they send back to the longing hungering ear The mouth hath spoken that the fainting ear may be filled by the return of its words through the alembic of another soul One cause of great uneasiness to Hugh was that for some time after a reply might have been expected he received no answer from David Elginbrod At length however a letter arrived upon the hand writing of which he speculated in vain perplexed with a resemblance in it to some writing that he knew and when he opened it he found the following answer to his own DEAR mister SUTHERLAND Your letter to my father has been sent to me by my mother for what you will feel to be the sad reason that he is no more in this world But I cannot say it is so very sad to me to think that he is gone home where my mother and I will soon join him True love can wait well Nor indeed dear mister Sutherland must you be too much troubled that your letter never reached him My father was like God in this that he always forgave anything the moment there was anything to forgive for when else could there be such a good time although of course the person forgiven could not know it till he asked for forgiveness But dear mister Sutherland if you could see me smiling as I write and could yet see how earnest my heart is in writing it I would venture to say that in virtue of my knowing my father as I do for I am sure I know his very soul as near as human love could know it I forgive you in his name for anything and everything with which you reproach yourself in regard to him Ah how much I owe you And how much he used to say he owed you We shall thank you one day when we all meet I am dear mister Sutherland Your grateful scholar MARGARET ELGINBROD Hugh burst into tears on reading this letter with no overpowering sense of his own sin for he felt that he was forgiven but with a sudden insight into the beauty and grandeur of the man whom he had neglected and the wondrous loveliness which he had transmitted from the feminine part of his nature to the wholly feminine and therefore delicately powerful nature of Margaret The vision he had beheld in the library at Arnstead about which as well as about many other things that had happened to him there he could form no theory capable of embracing all the facts this vision returned to his mind s eye and he felt that the glorified face he had beheld must surely have been Margaret s whether he had seen it in the body or out of the body such a face alone seemed to him worthy of the writer of this letter Purposely or not there was no address given in it and to his surprise when he examined the envelope with the utmost care he could discover no postmark but the London one The date stamp likewise showed that it must have been posted in London So said he to himself in my quest of a devil I may cross the track of an angel who knows But how can she be here To this of course he had no answer at hand CHAPTER V BEGINNINGS Since a man is bound no farther to himself than to do wisely chance is only to trouble them that stand upon chance SIR PHILIP SIDNEY The Arcadia Meantime a feeble star but sparkling some rays of comfort began to shine upon Hugh s wintry prospects The star arose in a grocer s shop For one day his landlady whose grim attentions had been increasing rather than diminishing addressed him suddenly as she was removing his breakfast apparatus This was a very extraordinary event for she seldom addressed him it all and replied when he addressed her only in the briefest manner possible Have you got any pupils yet mister Sutherland No I am sorry to say But how did you come to know I wanted any Miss Talbot You shouldn t have secrets at home mister Sutherland I like to know what concerns my own family and I generally find out You saw my advertisement perhaps To this suggestion Miss Talbot made no other answer than the usual compression of her lips You wouldn t be above teaching a tradesman s son to begin with Certainly not I should be very happy Do you know of such a pupil Well I can t exactly say I do know or I don t know but I happened to mention to my grocer round the corner that you wanted pupils Don t suppose mister Sutherland that I m in the way of talking about any young men of mine but it Not for a moment interrupted Hugh and Miss Talbot resumed evidently gratified Well if you wouldn t mind stepping round the corner I shouldn t wonder if you might make an arrangement with mister Appleditch He said you might call upon him if you liked Hugh jumped up and got his hat at once received the few necessary directions from Miss Talbot and soon found the shop There were a good many poor people in it buying sugar and soap c and one lady apparently giving a large order A young man came to Hugh and bent over the counter in a recipient position like a live point of interrogation Hugh answered mister Appleditch mister Appleditch will be disengaged in a few minutes Will you take a seat The grocer was occupied with the lady and her order but as soon as she departed he approached Hugh behind the rampart and stood towards him in the usual retail attitude My name is Sutherland Sutherland said mister Appleditch I think I ve eard the name somewheres but I don t know the face Miss Talbot mentioned me to you I understand mister Appleditch Oh ah I remember I beg your pardon Will you step this way mister Sutherland Hugh followed him through a sort of draw bridge which he lifted in the counter into a little appendix at the back of the shop mister Appleditch was a meek looking man with large eyes plump pasty cheeks and a thin little person Ow de do mister Sutherland said he holding out his hand as soon as they had reached this retreat Thank you quite well answered Sutherland shaking hands with him as well as he could the contact not being altogether pleasant So you want pupils do you sir Yes Ah well you see sir pupils is scarce at this season They ain t to be bought in every shop ha ha The laugh was very mild But I think missus Appleditch could find you one if you could agree with her about the charge you know and all that How old is he A boy I suppose Well you re right sir It is a boy Not very old though My Samuel is just ten but a wonderful forward boy for his years bless him And what would you wish him to learn Oh Latin and Greek and all that We intend bringing him up for the ministry I hope your opinions are decided sir On some points they are But I do not know to what you refer exactly I mean theological opinions sir But I shall not have to teach your little boy theology Certainly not sir That department belongs to his mother and I Unworthy vessels sir mere earthen vessels but filled with the grace of God I hope sir The grocer parted his hands which he had been rubbing together during this conversation and lifted them upwards from the wrists like the fins of a seal then dropping them fell to rubbing them again I hope so Well you know the best way will be for me not knowing your opinions to avoid everything of a religious kind Ah but it should be line upon line you know here a little and there a little sir As the bow is bent you know the hoop is made you know sir Here mister Appleditch stepped to the door suddenly and peeped out as if he feared he was wanted but presently returning he continued But time s a precious gift sir and we must not waste it So if you ll do us the honour sir to dine with us next Lord s day we may call it a work of necessity you know you will see the little Samuel and and missus Appleditch I shall be very happy What is your address mister Appleditch You had better come to Salem Chapel Dervish town and we can go home together Service commences at eleven missus Appleditch will be glad to see you Ask for mister Appleditch s pew Goo ood morning sir Hugh took his leave half inclined to send an excuse before the day arrived and decline the connection But his principle was to take whatever offered and thus make way for the next thing Besides he thus avoided the responsibility of choice from which he always shrunk He returned to his novel but alas the inventive faculty point blank refused to work under the weight of such a Sunday in prospect He wandered out quite dispirited but before long to take his revenge upon circumstances resolved at least to have a dinner out of them So he went to a chop house had a chop and a glass of ale and was astonished to find how much he enjoyed them In fact abstinence gave his very plain dinner more than all the charms of a feast a fact of which Hugh has not been the only discoverer He studied Punch all the time he ate and rose with his spirits perfectly restored Now I am in for it said he I will be extravagant for once So he went and bought a cigar which he spun out into three miles of smoke as he wandered through Shoreditch and Houndsditch and Petticoat lane gazing at the faces of his brothers and sisters which faces having been so many years wrapt in a fog both moral and physical now looked out of it as if they were only the condensed nuclei of the same fog and filth As he was returning through Whitechapel he passed a man on the pavement whose appearance was so remarkable that he could not help looking back after him When he reflected about it he thought that it must have been a certain indescribable resemblance to David Elginbrod that had so attracted him The man was very tall Six foot Hugh felt dwarfed beside him for he had to look right up as he passed to see his face He was dressed in loose shabby black He had high and otherwise very marked features and a dark complexion A general carelessness of demeanour was strangely combined with an expression of reposeful strength and quiet concentration of will At how much of this conclusion Hugh arrived after knowing more of him I cannot tell but such was the description he gave of him as he saw him first and it was thoroughly correct His countenance always seemed to me for I knew him well to represent a nature ever bent in one direction but never in haste because never in doubt To carry his extravagance and dissipation still further Hugh now betook himself to the pit of the Olympic Theatre and no one could have laughed more heartily or cried more helplessly that night than he for he gave himself wholly up to the influences of the ruler of the hour the admirable Robson But what was his surprise when standing up at the close of the first act and looking around and above him he saw unmistakeably the same remarkable countenance looking down upon him from the front row of the gallery He continued his circuit of observation trying to discover the face of Funkelstein in the boxes or circles but involuntarily he turned his gaze back to the strange countenance which still seemed bent towards his The curtain rose and during the second act he forgot all about everything else At its close he glanced up to the gallery again and there was the face still and still looking at him At the close of the third act it had vanished and he saw nothing more of it that evening When the after piece was over for he sat it out he walked quietly home much refreshed He had needed some relaxation after many days of close and continuous labour But awfully solemn was the face of good Miss Talbot as she opened the door for him at midnight Hugh took especial pains with his boots and the door mat but it was of no use the austerity of her countenance would not relax in the least So he took his candle and walked up stairs to his room saying only as he went being unable to think of anything else Good night Miss Talbot But no response proceeded from the offended divinity of the place He went to bed somewhat distressed at the behaviour of Miss Talbot for he had a weakness for being on good terms with everybody But he resolved to have it out with her next morning and so fell asleep and dreamed of the strange man who had watched him at the theatre He rose next morning at the usual time But his breakfast was delayed half an hour and when it came the maid waited upon him and not her mistress as usual When he had finished and she returned to take away the ruins he asked her to say to her mistress that he wanted to speak to her She brought back a message which she delivered with some difficulty and evidently under compulsion that if mister Sutherland wanted to speak to her he would find her in the back parlour Hugh went down instantly and found Miss Talbot in a doubly frozen condition her face absolutely blue with physical and mental cold combined She waited for him to speak Hugh began Miss Talbot it seems something is wrong between you and me Yes mister Sutherland Is it because I was rather late last night Rather late mister Sutherland Miss Talbot showed no excitement With her the thermometer in place of rising under the influence of irritation steadily sank I cannot make myself a prisoner on parole you know Miss Talbot You must leave me my liberty Oh yes mister Sutherland Take your liberty You ll go the way of all the rest It s no use trying to save any of you But I m not aware that I am in any particular want of saving Miss Talbot There it is Well till a sinner is called and awakened of course it s no use So I ll just do the best I can for you Who can tell when the Spirit may be poured from on high But it s very sad to me mister Sutherland to see an amiable young man like you going the way of transgressors which is hard I am sorry for you mister Sutherland Though the ice was not gone yet it had begun to melt under the influences of Hugh s good temper and Miss Talbot s sympathy with his threatening fate Conscience too had something to do with the change for much as one of her temperament must have disliked making such a confession she ended by adding after a pause And very sorry mister Sutherland that I showed you any bad temper last night Poor Miss Talbot Hugh saw that she was genuinely troubled about him and resolved to offend but seldom while he was under her roof Perhaps when you know me longer you will find I am steadier than you think Well it may be But steadiness won t make a Christian of you It may make a tolerable lodger of me though answered Hugh and you wouldn t turn me into the street because I am steady and nothing more would you I said I was sorry mister Sutherland Do you wish me to say more Bless your kind heart said Hugh I was only joking He held out his hand to Miss Talbot and her eyes glistened as she took it She pressed it kindly and abandoned it instantly So all was right between them once more Who knows murmured Miss Talbot but the Lord may save him He s surely not far from the kingdom of heaven I ll do all I can to make him comfortable CHAPTER VI A SUNDAY S DINNER Some books are lies frae end to end And some great lies were never penned Even ministers they hae been kenned In holy rapture Great lies and nonsense baith to vend And nail t wi Scripture BURNS To the great discomposure of Hugh Sunday was inevitable and he had to set out for Salem Chapel He found it a neat little Noah s Ark of a place built in the shape of a cathedral and consequently sharing in the general disadvantages to which dwarfs of all kinds are subjected absurdity included He was shown to mister Appleditch s pew That worthy man received him in sleek black clothes with white neck cloth and Sunday face composed of an absurd mixture of stupidity and sanctity He stood up and missus Appleditch stood up and Master Appleditch stood up and Hugh saw that the ceremony of the place required that he should force his way between the front of the pew and the person of each of the human beings occupying it till he reached the top where there was room for him to sit down No other recognition was taken till after service Meantime the minister ascended the pulpit stair with all the solemnity of one of the self elect and a priest besides He was just old enough for the intermittent attacks of self importance to which all youth is exposed to have in his case become chronic He stood up and worshipped his creator aloud after a manner which seemed to say in every tone Behold I am he that worshippeth Thee How mighty art Thou Then he read the Bible in a quarrelsome sort of way as if he were a bantam and every verse were a crow of defiance to the sinner Then they sang a hymn in a fashion which brought dear old Scotland to Hugh s mind which has the sweetest songs in its cottages and the worst singing in its churches of any country in the world But it was almost equalled here the chief cause of its badness being the absence of a modest self restraint and consequent tempering of the tones on the part of the singers so that the result was what Hugh could describe only as scraichin one I was once present at the worship of some being who is supposed by negroes to love drums and cymbals and all clangorous noises The resemblance according to Hugh s description could not have been a very distant one And yet I doubt not that some thoughts of worshipping love mingled with the noise and perhaps the harmony of these with the spheric melodies sounded the sweeter to the angels from the earthly discord in which they were lapped Then came the sermon The text was the story of the good Samaritan Some idea if not of the sermon yet of the value of it may be formed from the fact that the first thing to be considered or in other words the first head was The culpable imprudence of the man in going from Jerusalem to Jericho without an escort It was in truth a strange grotesque and somewhat awful medley not unlike a dance of death in which the painter has given here a lovely face and there a beautiful arm or an exquisite foot to the wild prancing and exultant skeletons But the parts of the sermon corresponding to the beautiful face or arm or foot were but the fragments of Scripture shining like gold amidst the worthless ore of the man s own production worthless save as gravel or chaff or husks have worth in a world where dilution and not always concentration is necessary for healthfulness But there are Indians who eat clay and thrive on it more or less I suppose The power of assimilation which a growing nature must possess is astonishing It will find its food its real Sunday dinner in the midst of a whole cartload of refuse and it will do the whole week s work on it On no other supposition would it be possible to account for the earnest face of Miss Talbot which Hugh espied turned up to the preacher as if his face were the very star in the east shining to guide the chosen kings It was well for Hugh s power of endurance that he had heard much the same thing in Scotland and the same thing better dressed and less grotesque but more lifeless and at heart as ill mannered in the church of Arnstead Just before concluding the service the pastor made an announcement in the following terms After the close of the present service I shall be found in the adjoining vestry by all persons desirous of communicating with me on the state of their souls or of being admitted to the privileges of church fellowship Brethren we have this treasure in earthen vessels and so long as this vessel lasts here he struck his chest so that it resounded it shall be faithfully and liberally dispensed Let us pray After the prayer he spread abroad his arms and hands as if he would clasp the world in his embrace and pronounced the benediction in a style of arrogance that the pope himself would have been ashamed of The service being thus concluded the organ absolutely blasted the congregation out of the chapel so did it storm and rave with a fervour anything but divine My readers must not suppose that I give this chapel as the type of orthodox dissenting chapels I give it only as an approximate specimen of a large class of them The religious life which these communities once possessed still lingers in those of many country districts and small towns but is I fear all but gone from those of the cities and larger towns What of it remains in these has its chief manifestation in the fungous growth of such chapels as the one I have described the congregations themselves taking this for a sure indication of the prosperity of the body How much even of the kind of prosperity which they ought to indicate is in reality at the foundation of these appearances I would recommend those to judge who are versed in the mysteries of chapel building societies As to Hugh whether it was that the whole was suggestive of Egyptian bondage or that his own mood was at the time of the least comfortable sort I will not pretend to determine but he assured me that he felt all the time as if instead of being in a chapel built of bricks harmoniously arranged as by the lyre of Amphion he were wandering in the waste wretched field whence these bricks had been dug of all places on the earth s surface the most miserable assailed by the nauseous odours which have not character enough to be described and only remind one of the colours on a snake s back When they reached the open air mister Appleditch introduced Hugh to missus Appleditch on the steps in front of the chapel This is mister Sutherland missus Appleditch Hugh lifted his hat and missus Appleditch made a courtesy She was a very tall woman a head beyond her husband extremely thin with sharp nose hollow cheeks and good eyes In fact she was partly pretty and might have been pleasant looking but for a large thin lipped vampire like mouth and a general expression of greed and contempt She was meant for a lady and had made herself a money maggot She was richly and plainly dressed and until she began to be at her ease might have passed for an unpleasant lady Master Appleditch the future pastor was a fat boy dressed like a dwarf in a frock coat and man s hat with a face in which the meanness and keenness strove for mastery and between them kept down the appearance of stupidity consequent on fatness They walked home in silence mister and missus Appleditch apparently pondering either upon the spiritual food they had just received or the corporeal food for which they were about to be thankful Their house was one of many in a crescent Not content with his sign in town the grocer had a large brass plate on his door with Appleditch engraved upon it in capitals it saved them always looking at the numbers The boy ran on before and assailed this door with a succession of explosive knocks As soon as it was opened in he rushed bawling Peter Peter here s the new apprentice Papa s brought him home to dinner because he was at chapel this morning Then in a lower tone I mean to have a ride on his back this afternoon The father and mother laughed A solemn priggish little voice answered Oh no Johnny Don t you know what day this is This is the Sabbath day The dear boy sighed his mother That boy is too good to live responded the father Hugh was shown into the dining room where the table was already laid for dinner It was evident that the Appleditches were well to do people The room was full of what is called handsome furniture in a high state of polish Over the chimney piece hung the portrait of a preacher in gown and bands the most prominent of whose features were his cheeks In a few minutes the host and hostess entered followed by a pale faced little boy the owner of the voice of reproof Come here Peetie said his mother and tell mister Sutherland what you have got She referred to some toy no not toy for it was the Sabbath to some book probably Peetie answered in a solemn voice mouthing every vowel I ve got five bags of gold in the Bank of England Poor child said his mother with a scornful giggle You wouldn t have much to reckon on if that were all Two or three gaily dressed riflemen passed the window The poor fellows unable to bear the look of their Sunday clothes if they had any after being used to their uniform had come out in all its magnificence Ah said mister Appleditch that s all very well in a state of nature but when a man is once born into a state of grace mister Sutherland ah Really responded missus Appleditch the worldliness of the lower classes is quite awful But they are spared for a day of wrath poor things I am sure that accident on the railway last Sabbath might have been a warning to them all After that they can t say there is not a God that ruleth in the earth and taketh vengeance for his broken Sabbaths mister I don t know your name said Peter whose age Hugh had just been trying in vain to conjecture mister Sutherland said the mother mister Slubberman are you a converted character resumed Peter Why do you ask me that Master Peter said Hugh trying to smile I think you look good but mamma says she don t think you are because you say Sunday instead of Sabbath and she always finds people who do are worldly missus Appleditch turned red not blushed and said quickly Peter shouldn t repeat everything he hears No more I do ma I haven t told what you said about Here his mother caught him up and carried him out of the room saying You naughty boy You shall go to bed Oh no I shan t Yes you shall Here Jane take this naughty boy to bed I ll scream Will you Yes I will And such a yell was there Of sudden and portentous birth As if ten cats were being cooked alive Well well well my Peetie He shan t go to bed if he ll be a good boy Will he be good May I stay up to supper then May I Yes yes anything to stop such dreadful screaming You are very naughty very naughty indeed No I m not naughty I ll scream again No no Go and get your pinafore on and come down to dinner Anything rather than a scream I am sick of all this and doubt if it is worth printing but it amused me very much one night as Hugh related it over a bottle of Chablis and a pipe He certainly did not represent missus Appleditch in a very favourable light on the whole but he took care to say that there was a certain liberality about the table and a kind of heartiness in her way of pressing him to have more than he could possibly eat which contrasted strangely with her behaviour afterwards in money matters There are many people who can be liberal in almost anything but money They seem to say Take anything but my purse Miss Talbot told him afterwards that this same lady was quite active amongst the poor of her district She made it a rule never to give money or at least never more than sixpence but she turned scraps of victuals and cast off clothes to the best account and if she did not make friends with the mammon of unrighteousness she yet kept an eye on the eternal habitations in the distribution of the crumbs that fell from her table Poor mister Appleditch on the other hand often embezzled a shilling or a half crown from the till for the use of a poor member of the same church meaning by church the individual community to which he belonged but of this missus Appleditch was carefully kept ignorant After dinner was over and the children had been sent away which was effected without a greater amount of difficulty than from the anticipative precautions adopted appeared to be lawful and ordinary mister Appleditch proceeded to business Now mister Sutherland what do you think of Johnnie sir It is impossible for me to say yet but I am quite willing to teach him if you like He s a forward boy said his mother Not a doubt of it responded Hugh for he remembered the boy asking him across the table Isn t our mister Lixom the pastor a oner And very eager and retentive said his father Hugh had seen the little glutton paint both cheeks to the eyes with damson tart and render more than a quantity proportionate to the colouring invisible Yes he is eager and retentive too I daresay he said but much will depend on whether he has a turn for study Well you will find that out to morrow I think you will be surprised sir At what hour would you like me to come Stop mister Appleditch interposed his wife You have said nothing yet about terms and that is of some importance considering the rent and taxes we pay Well my love what do you feel inclined to give How much do you charge a lesson mister Sutherland Only let me remind you sir that he is a very little boy although stout and that you cannot expect to put much Greek and Latin into him for some time yet Besides we want you to come every day which ought to be considered in the rate of charge Of course it ought said Hugh How much do you say then sir I should be content with half a crown a lesson I daresay you would replied the lady with indignation Half a crown That s six half crowns is fifteen shillings Fifteen shillings a week for that mite of a boy mister Sutherland you ought to be ashamed of yourself sir You forget missus Appleditch that it is as much trouble to me to teach one little boy yes a great deal more than to teach twenty grown men You ought to be ashamed of yourself sir You a Christian man and talk of trouble in teaching such a little cherub as that But do pray remember the distance I have to come and that it will take nearly four hours of my time every day Then you can get lodgings nearer But I could not get any so cheap Then you can the better afford to do it And she threw herself back in her chair as if she had struck the decisive blow mister Appleditch remarked gently It is good for your health to walk the distance sir missus Appleditch resumed I won t give a farthing more than one shilling a lesson There now Very well said Hugh rising then I must wish you good day We need not waste more time in talking about it Surely you are not going to make any use of your time on a Sunday said the grocer mildly Don t be in a hurry mister Sutherland We tradespeople like to make the best bargain we can mister Appleditch I am ashamed of you You always will be vulgar You always smell of the shop Well my dear how can I help it The sugar and soft soap will smell you know mister Appleditch you disgust me Dear dear I am sorry for that Suppose we say to mister Sutherland Now you leave that to me I ll tell you what mister Sutherland I ll give you eighteenpence a lesson and your dinner on the Sabbath that is if you sit under mister Lixom in our pew and walk home with us That I must decline said Hugh I must have my Sundays for myself missus Appleditch was disappointed She had coveted the additional importance which the visible possession of a live tutor would secure her at Salem Ah mister Sutherland she said And I must trust my child with an immortal soul in his inside to one who wants the Lord s only day for himself for himself mister Sutherland Hugh made no answer because he had none to make Again missus Appleditch resumed Shall it be a bargain mister Sutherland Eighteen pence a lesson that s nine shillings a week and begin to morrow Hugh s heart sunk within him not so much with disappointment as with disgust But to a man who is making nothing the prospect of earning ever so little is irresistibly attractive Even on a shilling a day he could keep hunger at arm s length And a beginning is half the battle He resolved Let it be a bargain then missus Appleditch The lady immediately brightened up and at once put on her company manners again behaving to him with great politeness and a sneer that would not be hid away under it From this Hugh suspected that she had made a better bargain than she had hoped but the discovery was now too late even if he could have brought himself to take advantage of it He hated bargain making as heartily as the grocer s wife loved it He very soon rose to take his leave Oh said missus Appleditch to her husband but mister Sutherland has not seen the drawing room Hugh wondered what there could be remarkable about the drawing room but he soon found that it was the pride of missus Appleditch s heart She abstained from all use of it except upon great occasions when parties of her friends came to drink tea with her She made a point however of showing it to everybody who entered the house for the first time So Hugh was led up stairs to undergo the operation of being shown the drawing room and being expected to be astonished at it I asked him what it was like He answered It was just what it ought to be rich and ugly mister Appleditch in his deacon s uniform hung over the fire and missus Appleditch in her wedding dress over the piano for there was a piano and she could play psalm tunes on it with one finger The round table in the middle of the room had books in gilded red and blue covers symmetrically arranged all round it This is all I can recollect Having feasted his eyes on the magnificence thus discovered to him he walked home more depressed at the prospect of his new employment than he could have believed possible On his way he turned aside into the Regent s Park where the sight of the people enjoying themselves for it was a fine day for the season partially dispelled the sense of living corruption and premature burial which he had experienced all day long He kept as far off from the rank of open air preachers as possible and really was able to thank God that all the world did not keep Scotch Sabbath a day neither Mosaic nor Jewish nor Christian not Mosaic inasmuch as it kills the very essence of the fourth commandment which is Rest transmuting it into what the chemists would call a mechanical mixture of service and inertia not Jewish inasmuch as it is ten times more severe and formal and full of negations than that of the Sabbatarian Jews reproved by the Saviour for their idolatry of the day and unchristian inasmuch as it insists beyond appeal on the observance of times and seasons abolished as far as law is concerned by the word of the chief of the apostles and elevates into an especial test of piety a custom not even mentioned by the founders of christianity at all that namely of accounting this day more holy than all the rest These last are but outside reasons for calling it unchristian There are far deeper and more important ones which cannot well be produced here It is not Hugh however who is to be considered accountable for all this but the historian of his fortunes between whom and the vision of a Lord s Day indeed there arises too often the nightmare memory of a Scotch Saabbath between which and its cousin the English Sunday there is too much of a family likeness The grand men and women whom I have known in Scotland seem to me as I look back to move about in the mists of a Scotch Sabbath like a company of way worn angels in the Limbo of Vanity in which there is no air whereupon to smite their sounding wings that they may rise into the sunlight of God s presence CHAPTER VII SUNDAY EVENING Now resteth in my memory but this point which indeed is the chief to you of all others which is the choice of what men you are to direct yourself to for it is certain no vessel can leave a worse taste in the liquor it contains than a wrong teacher infects an unskilful hearer with that which hardly will ever out But you may say How shall I get excellent men to take pains to speak with me Truly in few words either by much expense or much humbleness Letter of Sir Philip Sidney to his brother Robert How many things which at the first moment strike us as curious coincidences afterwards become so operative on our lives and so interwoven with the whole web of their histories that instead of appearing any more as strange accidents they assume the shape of unavoidable necessities of homely ordinary lawful occurrences as much in their own place as any shaft or pinion of a great machine It was dusk before Hugh turned his steps homeward He wandered along thinking of Euphra and the Count and the stolen rings He greatly desired to clear himself to mister Arnold He saw that the nature of the ring tended to justify mister Arnold s suspicions for a man who would not steal for money s worth might yet steal for value of another sort addressing itself to some peculiar weakness and mister Arnold might have met with instances of this nature in his position as magistrate He greatly desired likewise for Euphra s sake to have Funkelstein in his power His own ring was beyond recovery but if by its means he could hold such a lash over him as would terrify him from again exercising his villanous influences on her he would be satisfied While plunged in this contemplation he came upon two policemen talking together He recognized one of them as a Scotchman from his speech It occurred to him at once to ask his advice in a modified manner and a moment s reflection convinced him that it would at least do no harm He would do it It was one of those resolutions at which one arrives by an arrow flight of the intellect You are a countryman of mine I think said he as soon as the two had parted If ye re a Scotchman sir may be ay may be no Whaur come ye frae man Ou Aberdeen awa It s mine ain calf country An what do they ca ye They ca me John MacPherson My name s Sutherland Eh man It s my ain mither s name Gie s a grup o yer han Maister Sutherlan Eh man he repeated shaking Hugh s hand with vehemence I have no doubt said Hugh relapsing into English that we are some cousins or other It s very lucky for me to find a relative for I wanted some advice He took care to say advice which a Scotchman is generally prepared to bestow of his best Had it been sixpence the cousinship would have required elaborate proof before the treaty could have made further progress I m fully at your service sir When will you be off duty At nine o clock preceesely Come to No thirteen Square and ask for me It s not far Wi pleesir sir gin twar twise as far Hugh would not have ventured to ask him to his house on Sunday night when no refreshments could be procured had he not remembered a small pig Anglice stone bottle of real mountain dew which he had carried with him when he went to Arnstead and which had lain unopened in one of his boxes Miss Talbot received her lodger with more show of pleasure than usual for he came lapped in the odour of the deacon s sanctity But she was considerably alarmed and beyond measure shocked when the policeman called and requested to see him Sally had rushed in to her mistress in dismay Please m there s a pleaceman wants mister Sutherland Oh lor m Well go and let mister Sutherland know you stupid girl answered her mistress trembling Oh lor m was all Sally s reply as she vanished to bear the awful tidings to Hugh He can t have been housebreaking already said Miss Talbot to herself as she confessed afterwards But it may be forgery or embezzlement I told the poor deluded young man that the way of transgressors was hard Please sir you re wanted sir said Sally out of breath and pale as her Sunday apron Who wants me asked Hugh Please sir the pleaceman sir answered Sally and burst into tears Hugh was perfectly bewildered by the girl s behaviour and said in a tone of surprise Well show him up then Ooh sir said Sally with a Plutonic sigh and began to undo the hooks of her dress if you wouldn t mind sir just put on my frock and apron and take a jug in your hand an the pleaceman ll never look at you I ll take care of everything till you come back sir And again she burst into tears Sally was a great reader of the Family Herald and knew that this was an orthodox plan of rescuing a prisoner The kindness of her anxiety moderated the expression of Hugh s amusement and having convinced her that he was in no danger he easily prevailed upon her to bring the policeman upstairs Over a tumbler of toddy the weaker ingredients of which were procured by Sally s glad connivance with a lingering idea of propitiation and a gentle hint that Missus mustn t know the two Scotchmen seated at opposite corners of the fire had a long chat They began about the old country and the places and people they both knew and both didn t know If they had met on the shores of the central lake of Africa they could scarcely have been more couthy together At length Hugh referred to the object of his application to MacPherson What plan would you have me pursue John to get hold of a man in London I could manage that for ye sir I ken maist the haill mengie o the detaictives But you see unfortunately I don t wish for particular reasons that the police should have anything to do with it Ay ay Hm Hm I see brawly Ye ll be efter a stray sheep nae doot Hugh did not reply so leaving him to form any conclusion he pleased Ye see MacPherson continued it s no that easy to a body that s no up to the trade Hae ye ony clue like to set ye spierin upo Not the least The man pondered a while I hae t he exclaimed at last What a fule I was no to think o that afore Gin t be a puir bit yow lammie like at ye re efter I ll tell ye what there s ae man a countryman o our ain an a gentleman forbye that ll do mair for ye in that way nor a the detaictives thegither an that s Robert Falconer Esquire I ken him weel But I don t said Hugh But I ll introduce ye till im He bides close at han here roun twa corners jist An I m thinkin he ll be at hame the noo for I saw him gaein that get afore ye cam up to me An the suner we gang the better for he s no aye to be gotten hand o Fegs he may be in Shoreditch or this But will he not consider it an intrusion Na na there s no fear o that He s ony man s an ilka woman s freen so be he can do them a guid turn but he s no for drinkin and daffin an that Come awa Maister Sutherlan he s yer verra man Thus urged Hugh rose and accompanied the policeman He took him round rather more than two corners but within five minutes they stood at mister Falconer s door John rang The door opened without visible service and they ascended to the first floor which was enclosed something after the Scotch fashion Here a respectable looking woman awaited their ascent Is mister Falconer at hom mem said Hugh s guide He is but I think he s just going out again Will ye tell him mem at hoo John MacPherson the policeman would like sair to see him I will she answered and went in leaving them at the door She returned in a moment and inviting them to enter ushered them into a large bare room in which there was just light enough for Hugh to recognize to his astonishment the unmistakeable figure of the man whom he had met in Whitechapel and whom he had afterwards seen apparently watching him from the gallery of the Olympic Theatre How are you MacPherson said a deep powerful voice out of the gloom Verra weel I thank ye mister Falconer Hoo are ye yersel sir Very well too thank you Who is with you It s a gentleman sir by the name o mister Sutherlan wha wants your help sir aboot somebody or ither at he s enteresstit in wha s disappeared Falconer advanced and bowing to Hugh said very graciously I shall be most happy to serve mister Sutherland if in my power Our friend MacPherson has rather too exalted an idea of my capabilities however Weel Maister Falconer I only jist spier at yersel whether or no ye was ever dung wi onything ye took in han Falconer made no reply to this There was the story of a whole life in his silence past and to come He merely said You can leave the gentleman with me then John I ll take care of him No fear o that sir Deil a bit though a the policemen i Lonnon war efter im I m much obliged to you for bringing him The obligation s mine sir an the gentleman s Good nicht sir Good nicht mister Sutherlan Ye ll ken whaur to fin me gin ye want me Yon s my beat for anither fortnicht And you know my quarters said Hugh shaking him by the hand I am greatly obliged to you Not a bit sir Or gin ye war ye sud be hertily welcome Bring candles missus Ashton Falconer called from the door Then turning to Hugh Sit down mister Sutherland he said if you can find a chair that is not illegally occupied already Perhaps we had better wait for the candles What a pleasant day we have had Then you have been more pleasantly occupied than I have thought Hugh to whose mind returned the images of the Appleditch family and its drawing room followed by the anticipation of the distasteful duties of the morrow But he only said It has been a most pleasant day I spent it strangely said Falconer Here the candles were brought in The two men looked at each other full in the face Hugh saw that he had not been in error The same remarkable countenance was before him Falconer smiled We have met before said he We have said Hugh I had a conviction we should be better acquainted but I did not expect it so soon Are you a clairvoyant then Not in the least Or perhaps being a Scotchman you have the second sight I am hardly Celt enough for that But I am a sort of a seer after all from an instinct of the spiritual relations of things I hope not in the least from the nervo material side I think I understand you Are you at leisure Entirely Had we not better walk then I have to go as far as Somers Town no great way and we can talk as well walking as sitting With pleasure answered Hugh rising Will you take anything before you go A glass of port It is the only wine I happen to have Not a drop thank you I seldom taste anything stronger than water I like that But I like a glass of port too Come then And Falconer rose and a great rising it was for as I have said he was two or three inches taller than Hugh and much broader across the shoulders and Hugh was no stripling now He could not help thinking again of his old friend David Elginbrod to whom he had to look up to find the living eyes of him just as now he looked up to find Falconer s But there was a great difference between those organs in the two men David s had been of an ordinary size pure keen blue sparkling out of cerulean depths of peace and hope full of lambent gleams when he was loving any one and ever ready to be dimmed with the mists of rising emotion All that Hugh could yet discover of Falconer s eyes was that they were large and black as night and set so far back in his head that each gleamed out of its caverned arch like the reversed torch of the Greek Genius of Death just before going out in night Either the frontal sinus was very large or his observant faculties were peculiarly developed They went out and walked for some distance in silence Hugh ventured to say at length You said you had spent the day strangely May I ask how In a condemned cell in Newgate answered Falconer I am not in the habit of going to such places but the man wanted to see me and I went As Falconer said no more and as Hugh was afraid of showing anything like vulgar curiosity this thread of conversation broke Nothing worth recording passed until they entered a narrow court in Somers Town Are you afraid of infection Falconer said Not in the least if there be any reason for exposing myself to it That is right And I need not ask if you are in good health I am in perfect health Then I need not mind asking you to wait for me till I come out of this house There is typhus in it I will wait with pleasure I will go with you if I can be of any use There is no occasion It is not your business this time So saying Falconer opened the door and walked in Said Hugh to himself I must tell this man the whole story and with it all my own In a few minutes Falconer rejoined him looking solemn but with a kind of relieved expression on his face The poor fellow is gone said he Ah What a thing it must be mister Sutherland for a man to break out of the choke damp of a typhus fever into the clear air of the life beyond Yes said Hugh adding after a slight hesitation if he be at all prepared for the change Where a change belongs to the natural order of things said Falconer and arrives inevitably at some hour there must always be more or less preparedness for it Besides I think a man is generally prepared for a breath of fresh air Hugh did not reply for he felt that he did not fully comprehend his new acquaintance But he had a strong suspicion that it was because he moved in a higher region than himself If you will still accompany me resumed Falconer who had not yet adverted to Hugh s object in seeking his acquaintance you will I think be soon compelled to believe that at whatever time death may arrive or in whatever condition the man may be at the time it comes as the best and only good that can at that moment reach him We are perhaps too much in the habit of thinking of death as the culmination of disease which regarded only in itself is an evil and a terrible evil But I think rather of death as the first pulse of the new strength shaking itself free from the old mouldy remnants of earth garments that it may begin in freedom the new life that grows out of the old The caterpillar dies into the butterfly Who knows but disease may be the coming the keener life breaking into this and beginning to destroy like fire the inferior modes or garments of the present And then disease would be but the sign of the salvation of fire of the agony of the greater life to lift us to itself out of that wherein we are failing and sinning And so we praise the consuming fire of life But surely all cannot fare alike in the new life Far from it According to the condition But what would be hell to one will be quietness and hope and progress to another because he has left worse behind him and in this the life asserts itself and is But perhaps you are not interested in such subjects mister Sutherland and I weary you If I have not been interested in them hitherto I am ready to become so now Let me go with you With pleasure As I have attempted to tell a great deal about Robert Falconer and his pursuits elsewhere I will not here relate the particulars of their walk through some of the most wretched parts of London Suffice it to say that if Hugh as he walked home was not yet prepared to receive and understand the half of what Falconer had said about death and had not yet that faith in God that gives as perfect a peace for the future of our brothers and sisters who alas have as yet been fed with husks as for that of ourselves who have eaten bread of the finest of the wheat and have been but a little thankful he yet felt at least that it was a blessed thing that these men and women would all die must all die That spectre from which men shrink as if it would take from them the last shivering remnant of existence he turned to for some consolation even for them He was prepared to believe that they could not be going to worse in the end though some of the rich and respectable and educated might have to receive their evil things first in the other world and he was ready to understand that great saying of Schiller full of a faith evident enough to him who can look far enough into the saying Death cannot be an evil for it is universal CHAPTER VIII EUPHRA Samson O that torment should not be confined To the body s wounds and sores But must secret passage find To the inmost mind Dire inflammation which no cooling herb Or medicinal liquor can asswage Nor breath of vernal air from snowy Alp Sleep hath forsook and given me o er To death s benumming opium as my only cure Thence faintings swoonings of despair And sense of heaven s desertion MILTON Samson Agonistes Hitherto I have chiefly followed the history of my hero if hero in any sense he can yet be called Now I must leave him for a while and take up the story of the rest of the few persons concerned in my tale Lady Emily had gone to Madeira and mister Arnold had followed missus Elton and Harry and Margaret of course had gone to London Euphra was left alone at Arnstead A great alteration had taken place in this strange girl The servants were positively afraid of her now from the butler down to the kitchen maid She used to go into violent fits of passion in which the mere flash of her eyes was overpowering These outbreaks would be followed almost instantaneously by seasons of the deepest dejection in which she would confine herself to her room for hours or lame as she was wander about the house and the Ghost s Walk herself pale as a ghost and looking meagre and wretched Also she became subject to frequent fainting fits the first of which took place the night before Hugh s departure after she had returned to the house from her interview with him in the Ghost s Walk She was evidently miserable For this misery we know that there were very sufficient reasons without taking into account the fact that she had no one to fascinate now Her continued lameness which her restlessness aggravated likewise gave her great cause for anxiety But I presume that even during the early part of her confinement her mind had been thrown back upon itself in that consciousness which often arises in loneliness and suffering and that even then she had begun to feel that her own self was a worse tyrant than the count and made her a more wretched slave than any exercise of his unlawful power could make her Some natures will endure an immense amount of misery before they feel compelled to look there for help whence all help and healing comes They cannot believe that there is verily an unseen mysterious power till the world and all that is in it has vanished in the smoke of despair till cause and effect is nothing to the intellect and possible glories have faded from the imagination then deprived of all that made life pleasant or hopeful the immortal essence lonely and wretched and unable to cease looks up with its now unfettered and wakened instinct to the source of its own life to the possible God who notwithstanding all the improbabilities of his existence may yet perhaps be and may yet perhaps hear his wretched creature that calls In this loneliness of despair life must find The Life for joy is gone and life is all that is left it is compelled to seek its source its root its eternal life This alone remains as a possible thing Strange condition of despair into which the Spirit of God drives a man a condition in which the Best alone is the Possible Other simpler natures look up at once Even before the first pang has passed away as by a holy instinct of celestial childhood they lift their eyes to the heavens whence cometh their aid Of this class Euphra was not She belonged to the former And yet even she had begun to look upward for the waters had closed above her head She betook herself to the one man of whom she had heard as knowing about God She wrote but no answer came Days and days passed away and there was no reply Ah just so she said in bitterness And if I cried to God for ever I should hear no word of reply If he be he sits apart and leaves the weak to be the prey of the bad What cares he Yet as she spoke she rose and by a sudden impulse threw herself on the floor and cried for the first time O God help me Was there voice or hearing She rose at least with a little hope and with the feeling that if she could cry to him it might be that he could listen to her It seemed natural to pray it seemed to come of itself that could not be except it was first natural for God to hear The foundation of her own action must be in him who made her for her call could be only a response after all The time passed wearily by Dim slow November days came on with the fall of the last brown shred of those clouds of living green that had floated betwixt earth and heaven Through the bare boughs of the overarching avenue of the Ghost s Walk themselves living skeletons she could now look straight up to the blue sky which had been there all the time And she had begun to look up to a higher heaven through the bare skeleton shapes of life for the foliage of joy had wholly vanished shall we say in order that the children of the spring might come certainly in order first that the blue sky of a deeper peace might reflect itself in the hitherto darkened waters of her soul Perhaps some of my readers may think that she had enough to repent of to keep her from weariness She had plenty to repent of no doubt but repentance between the paroxysms of its bitterness is a very dreary and November like state of the spiritual weather For its foggy mornings and cheerless noons cannot believe in the sun of spring soon to ripen into the sun of summer and its best time is the night that shuts out the world and weeps its fill of slow tears But she was not altogether so blameworthy as she may have appeared Her affectations had not been altogether false She valued and in a measure possessed the feelings for which she sought credit She had a genuine enjoyment of nature though after a sensuous Keats like fashion not a Wordsworthian It was the body rather than the soul of nature that she loved its beauty rather than its truth Had her love of nature been of the deepest she would have turned aside to conceal her emotions rather than have held them up as allurements in the eyes of her companion But as no body and no beauty can exist without soul and truth she who loves the former must at least be capable of loving the deeper essence to which they owe their very existence This view of her character is borne out by her love of music and her liking for Hugh Both were genuine Had the latter been either more or less genuine than it was the task of fascination would have been more difficult and its success less complete Whether her own feelings became further involved than she had calculated upon I cannot tell but surely it says something for her in any case that she desired to retain Hugh as her friend instead of hating him because he had been her lover How glad she would have been of Harry now The days crawled one after the other like weary snakes She tried to read the New Testament It was to her like a mouldy chamber of worm eaten parchments whose windows had not been opened to the sun or the wind for centuries and in which the dust of the decaying leaves choked the few beams that found their way through the age blinded panes This state of things could not have lasted long for Euphra would have died It lasted however until she felt that she had been leading a false worthless life that she had been casting from her every day the few remaining fragments of truth and reality that yet kept her nature from falling in a heap of helpless ruin that she had never been a true friend to any one that she was of no value fit for no one s admiration no one s love She must leave her former self like a dead body behind her and rise into a purer air of life and reality else she would perish with that everlasting death which is the disease and corruption of the soul itself To those who know anything of such experiences it will not be surprising that such feelings as these should be alternated with fierce bursts of passion The old self then started up with feverish energy and writhed for life Never any one tried to be better without for a time seeming to himself perhaps to others to be worse For the suffering of the spirit weakens the brain itself and the whole physical nature groans under it while the energy spent in the effort to awake and arise from the dust leaves the regions previously guarded by prudence naked to the wild inroads of the sudden destroying impulses born of suffering self sickness and hatred As in the delirious patient they would dash to the earth whatever comes first within reach as if the thing first perceived and so by perception alone brought into contact with the suffering were the cause of all the distress One day a letter arrived for her She had had no letter from any one for weeks Yet when she saw the direction she flung it from her It was from missus Elton whom she disliked because she found her utterly uninteresting and very stupid Poor missus Elton laid no claim to the contraries of these epithets But in proportion as she abjured thought she claimed speech both by word of mouth and by letter Why not There was nothing in it She considered reason as an awful enemy to the soul and obnoxious to God especially when applied to find out what he means when he addresses us as reasonable creatures But speech There was no harm in that Perhaps it was some latent conviction that this power of speech was the chief distinction between herself and the lower animals that made her use it so freely and at the same time open her purse so liberally to the Hospital for Orphan Dogs and Cats Had it not been for her own dire necessity the fact that missus Elton was religious would have been enough to convince Euphra that there could not possibly be anything in religion The letter lay unopened till next day a fact easy to account for improbable as it may seem for besides writing as largely as she talked and less amusingly because more correctly missus Elton wrote such an indistinct though punctiliously neat hand that the reading of a letter of hers involved no small amount of labour But the sun shining out next morning Euphra took courage to read it while drinking her coffee although she could not expect to make that ceremony more pleasant thereby It contained an invitation to visit missus Elton at her house in Street Hyde Park with the assurance that now that everything was arranged they had plenty of room for her missus Elton was sure she must be lonely at Arnstead and missus Horton could no doubt be trusted and so on Had this letter arrived a few weeks earlier Euphra would have infused into her answer a skilful concoction of delicate contempt not for the amusement of knowing that missus Elton would never discover a trace of it but simply for a relief to her own dislike Now she would have written a plain letter containing as brief and as true an excuse as she could find had it not been that inclosed in missus Elton s note she found another which ran thus DEAR EUPHRA Do come and see us I do not like London at all without you There are no happy days here like those we had at Arnstead with mister Sutherland missus Elton and Margaret are very kind to me But I wish you would come Do do do Please do Your affectionate cousin HARRY ARNOLD The dear boy said Euphra with a gush of pure and grateful affection I will go and see him Harry had begun to work with his masters and was doing his best which was very good If his heart was not so much in it as when he was studying with his big brother he gained a great benefit from the increase of exercise to his will in the doing of what was less pleasant Ever since Hugh had given his faculties a right direction and aided him by healthful manly sympathy he had been making up for the period during which childhood had been protracted into boyhood and now he was making rapid progress When Euphra arrived Harry rushed to the hall to meet her She took him in her arms and burst into tears Her tears drew forth his He stroked her pale face and said Dear Euphra how ill you look I shall soon be better now Harry I was afraid you did not love me Euphra but now I am sure you do Indeed I do I am very sorry for everything that made you think I did not love you No no It was all my fancy Now we shall be very happy And so Harry was And Euphra through means of Harry began to gain a little of what is better than most kinds of happiness because it is nearest to the best happiness I mean peace This foretaste of rest came to her from the devotedness with which she now applied herself to aid the intellect which she had unconsciously repressed and stunted before She took Harry s books when he had gone to bed and read over all his lessons that she might be able to assist him in preparing them venturing thus into some regions of labour into which ladies are too seldom conducted by those who instruct them This produced in her quite new experiences One of these was that in proportion as she laboured for Harry hope grew for herself It was likewise of the greatest immediate benefit that the intervals of thought instead of lying vacant to melancholy or the vapours that sprung from the foregoing strife of the spiritual elements should be occupied by healthy mental exercise Still however she was subject to great vicissitudes of feeling A kind of peevishness to which she had formerly been a stranger was but too ready to appear even when she was most anxious in her converse with Harry to behave well to him But the pure forgiveness of the boy was wonderful Instead of plaguing himself to find out the cause of her behaviour or resenting it in the least he only laboured by increased attention and submission to remove it and seemed perfectly satisfied when it was followed by a kind word which to him was repentance apology amends and betterment all in one When he had thus driven away the evil spirit there was Euphra her own self So perfectly did she see and so thoroughly appreciate this kindness and love of Harry that he began to look to her like an angel of forgiveness come to live a boy s life that he might do an angel s work Her health continued very poor She suffered constantly from more or less headache and at times from faintings But she had not for some time discovered any signs of somnambulism Of this peculiarity her friends were entirely ignorant The occasions indeed on which it had manifested itself to an excessive degree had been but few CHAPTER IX THE NEW PUPILS Think you a little din can daunt mine ears Have I not in my time heard lions roar And do you tell me of a woman s tongue That gives not half so great a blow to hear As will a chestnut in a farmer s fire Tush tush fear boys with bugs Taming of the Shrew During the whole of his first interview with Falconer which lasted so long that he had been glad to make a bed of Falconer s sofa Hugh never once referred to the object for which he had accepted MacPherson s proffered introduction nor did Falconer ask him any questions Hugh was too much interested and saddened by the scenes through which Falconer led him not to shrink from speaking of anything less important and with Falconer it was a rule a principle almost never to expedite utterance of any sort In the morning feeling a little good natured anxiety as to his landlady s reception of him Hugh made some allusion to it as he sat at his new friend s breakfast table Falconer said What is your landlady s name Miss Talbot Oh little Miss Talbot You are in good quarters too good to lose I can tell you Just say to Miss Talbot that you were with me You know her then Oh yes You seem to know everybody If I have spoken to a person once I never forget him That seems to me very strange It is simple enough The secret of it is that as far as I can help it I never have any merely business relations with any one I try always not to forget that there is a deeper relation between us I commonly succeed worst in a drawing room yet even there for the time we are together I try to recognise the present humanity however much distorted or concealed The consequence is I never forget anybody and I generally find that others remember me at least those with whom I have had any real relations springing from my need or from theirs The man who mends a broken chair for you or a rent in your coat renders you a human service and in virtue of that comes nearer to your inner self than nine tenths of the ladies and gentlemen whom you meet only in what is called society are likely to do But do you not find it awkward sometimes Not in the least I am never ashamed of knowing any one and as I never assume a familiarity that does not exist I never find it assumed towards me Hugh found the advantage of Falconer s sociology when he mentioned to Miss Talbot that he had been his guest that night You should have sent us word mister Sutherland was all Miss Talbot s reply I could not do so before you must have been all in bed I was sorry but I could hardly help it Miss Talbot turned away into the kitchen The only other indication of her feeling in the matter was that she sent him up a cup of delicious chocolate for his lunch before he set out for mister Appleditch s where she had heard at the shop that he was going My reader must not be left to fear that I am about to give a detailed account of Hugh s plans with these unpleasant little immortals whose earthly nature sprang from a pair whose religion consisted chiefly in negations and whose main duty seemed to be to make money in small sums and spend it in smaller When he arrived at Buccleuch Crescent he was shown into the dining room into which the boys were separately dragged to receive the first instalment of the mental legacy left them by their ancestors But the legacy duty was so heavy that they would gladly have declined paying it even with the loss of the legacy itself and Hugh was dismayed at the impossibility of interesting them in anything He tried telling them stories even without success They stared at him it is true but whether there was more speculation in the open mouths or in the fishy overfed eyes he found it impossible to determine He could not help feeling the riddle of Providence in regard to the birth of these much harder to read than that involved in the case of some of the little thieves whose acquaintance he had made when with Falconer the evening before But he did his best and before the time had expired two hours namely he had found out to his satisfaction that the elder had a turn for sums and the younger for drawing So he made use of these predilections to bribe them to the exercise of their intellect upon less favoured branches of human accomplishment He found the plan operate as well as it could have been expected to operate upon such material But one or two little incidents relating to his intercourse with missus Appleditch I must not omit Though a mother s love is more ready to purify itself than most other loves yet there is a class of mothers whose love is only an extended scarcely an expanded selfishness missus Appleditch did not in the least love her children because they were children and children committed to her care by the Father of all children but she loved them dearly because they were her children One day Hugh gave Master Appleditch a smart slap across the fingers as the ultimate resource The child screamed as he well knew how His mother burst into the room Johnny hold your tongue Teacher s been and hurt me Hold your tongue I say My head s like to split Get out of the room you little ruffian She seized him by the shoulders and turned him out administering a box on his ear that made the room ring Then turning to Hugh mister Sutherland how dare you strike my child she demanded He required it missus Appleditch I did him no harm He will mind what I say another time I will not have him touched It s disgraceful To strike a child She belonged to that class of humane parents who consider it cruel to inflict any corporal suffering upon children except they do it themselves and in a passion Johnnie behaved better after this however and the only revenge missus Appleditch took for this interference with the dignity of her eldest born and consequently with her own as his mother was that with the view probably of impressing upon Hugh a due sense of the menial position he occupied in her family she always paid him his fee of one shilling and sixpence every day before he left the house Once or twice she contrived accidentally that the sixpence should be in coppers Hugh was too much of a philosopher however to mind this from such a woman I am afraid he rather enjoyed her spite for he felt it did not touch him seeing it could not be less honourable to be paid by the day than by the quarter or by the year Certainly the coppers were an annoyance but if the coppers could be carried the annoyance could be borne The real disgust in the affair was that he had to meet and speak with a woman every day for whom he could feel nothing but contempt and aversion Hugh was not yet able to mingle with these feelings any of the leaven of that charity which they need most of all who are contemptible in the eye of their fellows Contempt is murder committed by the intellect as hatred is murder committed by the heart Charity having life in itself is the opposite and destroyer of contempt as well as of hatred After this nothing went amiss for some time But it was very dreary work to teach such boys for the younger came in for the odd sixpence Slow stupid resistance appeared to be the only principle of their behaviour towards him They scorned the man whom their mother despised and valued for the self same reason namely that he was cheap They would have defied him had they dared but he managed to establish an authority over them and to increase it Still he could not rouse them to any real interest in their studies Indeed they were as near being little beasts as it was possible for children to be Their eyes grew dull at a story book but greedily bright at the sight of bull s eyes or toffee It was the same day after day till he was sick of it No doubt they made some progress but it was scarcely perceptible to him Through fog and fair through frost and snow through wind and rain he trudged to that wretched house No one minds the weather no young Scotchman at least where any pleasure waits the close of the struggle to fight his way to misery was more than he could well endure But his deliverance was nearer than he expected It was not to come just yet however All went on with frightful sameness till sundry doubtful symptoms of an alteration in the personal appearance of Hugh having accumulated at last into a mass of evidence forced the conviction upon the mind of the grocer s wife that her tutor was actually growing a beard Could she believe her eyes She said she could not But she acted on their testimony notwithstanding and one day suddenly addressing Hugh said in her usual cold thin cutting fashion of speech mister Sutherland I am astonished and grieved that you a teacher of babes who should set an example to them should disguise yourself in such an outlandish figure What do you mean missus Appleditch asked Hugh who though he had made up his mind to follow the example of Falconer yet felt uncomfortable enough during the transition period to know quite well what she meant What do I mean sir It is a shame for a man to let his beard grow like a monkey But a monkey hasn t a beard retorted Hugh laughing Man is the only animal who has one This assertion if not quite correct was approximately so and went much nearer the truth than missus Appleditch s argument It s no joking matter mister Sutherland with my two darlings growing up to be ministers of the gospel What both of them thought Hugh Good heavens But he said Well but you know missus Appleditch the Apostles themselves wore beards Yes when they were Jews But who would have believed them if they had preached the gospel like old clothesmen No no mister Sutherland I see through all that My own uncle was a preacher of the word As soon as the Apostles became Christians they shaved It was the sign of Christianity The Apostle Paul himself says that cleanliness is next to godliness Hugh restrained his laughter and shifted his ground But there is nothing dirty about them he said Not dirty Now really mister Sutherland you provoke me Nothing dirty in long hair all round your mouth and going into it every spoonful you take But it can be kept properly trimmed you know But who s to trust you to do that No no mister Sutherland you must not make a guy of yourself Hugh laughed and said nothing Of course his beard would go on growing for he could not help it So did missus Appleditch s wrath CHAPTER X CONSULTATIONS Wo keine Gotter sind walten Gespenster NOVALIS Christenheit Where gods are not spectres rule Ein Charakter ist ein vollkommen gebildeter Wille NOVALIS Moralische Ansichten A character is a perfectly formed will It was not long before Hugh repeated his visit to Falconer He was not at home He went again and again but still failed in finding him The day after the third failure however he received a note from Falconer mentioning an hour at which he would be at home on the following evening Hugh went Falconer was waiting for him I am very sorry I am out so much said Falconer I ought to have taken the opportunity when I had it replied Hugh I want to ask your help May I begin at the beginning and tell you all the story or must I epitomize and curtail it Be as diffuse as you please I shall understand the thing the better So Hugh began and told the whole of his history in as far as it bore upon the story of the crystal He ended with the words I trust mister Falconer you will not think that it is from a love of talking that I have said so much about this affair Certainly not It is a remarkable story I will think what can be done Meantime I will keep my eyes and ears open I may find the fellow Tell me what he is like Hugh gave as minute a description of the count as he could I think I see the man said Falconer I am pretty sure I shall recognise him Have you any idea what he could want with the ring It is one of the curious coincidences which are always happening answered Falconer that a newspaper of this very day would have enabled me without any previous knowledge of similar facts to give a probably correct suggestion as to his object But you can judge for yourself So saying Falconer went to a side table heaped up with books and papers maps and instruments of various kinds apparently in triumphant confusion Without a moment s hesitation notwithstanding he selected the paper he wanted and handed it to Hugh who read in it a letter to the editor of which the following is a portion I have for over thirty years been in the habit of investigating the question by means of crystals And since eighteen I have possessed the celebrated crystal once belonging to Lady Blessington in which very many persons both children and adults have seen visions of the spirits of the deceased or of beings claiming to be such and of numerous angels and other beings of the spiritual world These have in all cases supported the purest and most liberal Christianity The faculty of seeing in the crystal I have found to exist in about one person in ten among adults and in nearly nine in every ten among children many of whom appear to lose the faculty as they grow to adult age unless they practise it continually Is it possible said Hugh pausing that this can be a veritable paper of to day Are there people to believe such things There are more fools in the world mister Sutherland than there are crystals in its mountains Hugh resumed his reading He came at length to this passage The spirits which I feel certain they are which appear do not hesitate to inform us on all possible subjects which may tend to improve our morals and confirm our faith in the Christian doctrines The character they give of the class of spirits who are in the habit of communicating with mortals by rapping and such proceedings is such that it behoves all Christian people to be on their guard against error and delusion through their means Hugh had read this passage aloud Is not that a comfort now mister Sutherland said Falconer For in all the reports which I have seen of the religious instruction communicated in that highly articulate manner Calvinism high and low has predominated I strongly suspect the crystal phantoms of Arminianism though Fancy the old disputes of infant Christendom perpetuated amongst the paltry ghosts of another realm But said Hugh I do not quite see how this is to help me as to the count s object in securing the ring for certainly however deficient he may be in such knowledge he is not likely to have committed the theft for the sake of instruction in the doctrines of the sects No But such a crystal might be put to other not to say better uses Besides Lady Blessington s crystal might be a pious crystal and the other which belonged to Lady Lady Euphrasia To Lady Euphrasia might be a worldly crystal altogether This might reveal demons and their counsels while that was haunted by theological angels and evangelical ghosts Ah I see I should have thought however that the count had been too much of a man of the world to believe such things He might find his account in it notwithstanding But no amount of world wisdom can set a man above the inroads of superstition In fact there is but one thing that can free a man from superstition and that is belief All history proves it The most sceptical have ever been the most credulous This is one of the best arguments for the existence of something to believe You remind me of a passage in my story which I omitted as irrelevant to the matter in hand Do let me have it It cannot fail to interest me Hugh gave a complete account of the experiments they had made with the careering plate Now the writing of the name of David Elginbrod was the most remarkable phenomenon of the whole and Hugh was compelled in responding to the natural interest of Falconer to give a description of David This led to a sketch of his own sojourn at Turriepuffit in which the character of David came out far more plainly than it could have come out in any description When he had finished Falconer broke out as if he had been hitherto restraining his wrath with difficulty And that was the man the creatures dared to personate I hate the whole thing Sutherland It is full of impudence and irreverence Perhaps the wretched beings may want another thousand years damnation because of the injury done to their character by the homage of men who ought to know better I do not quite understand you I mean that you ought to believe as easily that such a man as you describe is laughing with the devil and his angels as that he wrote a copy at the order of a charlatan or worse But it could hardly be deception Not deception A man like him could not get through them without being recognised I don t understand you By whom By swarms of low miserable creatures that so lament the loss of their beggarly bodies that they would brood upon them in the shape of flesh flies rather than forsake the putrifying remnants After that chair or table or anything that they can come into contact with possesses quite sufficient organization for such Don t you remember that once rather than have no body to go into they crept into the very swine There was a fine passion for self embodiment and sympathy But the swine themselves could not stand it and preferred drowning Then you do think there was something supernatural in it Nothing in the least It required no supernatural powers to be aware that a great man was dead and that you had known him well It annoys me Sutherland that able men ay and good men too should consult with ghosts whose only possible superiority consists in their being out of the body Why should they be the wiser for that I should as soon expect to gain wisdom by taking off my clothes and to lose it by getting into bed or to rise into the seventh heaven of spirituality by having my hair cut An impudent forgery of that good man s name If I were you Sutherland I would have nothing to do with such a low set They are the canaille of the other world It s of no use to lay hold on their skirts for they can t fly They re just like the vultures easy to catch because they re full of garbage I doubt if they have more intellect left than just enough to lie with I have been compelled to think a good deal about these things of late Falconer put a good many questions to Hugh about Euphra and her relation to the count and such was the confidence with which he had inspired him that Hugh felt at perfect liberty to answer them all fully not avoiding even the exposure of his own feelings where that was involved by the story Now said Falconer I have material out of which to construct a theory The count is at present like a law of nature concerning which a prudent question is the first half of the answer as Lord Bacon says and you can put no question without having first formed a theory however slight or temporary for otherwise no question will suggest itself But in the meantime as I said before I will make inquiry upon the theory that he is somewhere in London although I doubt it Then I will not occupy your time any longer at present said Hugh Could you say without fettering yourself in the least when I might be able to see you again Let me see I will make an appointment with you Next Sunday here at ten o clock in the morning Make a note of it There is no fear of my forgetting it My consolations are not so numerous that I can afford to forget my sole pleasure You I should think have more need to make a note of it than I though I am quite willing to be forgotten if necessary I never forget my engagements said Falconer They parted and Hugh went home to his novel CHAPTER XI QUESTIONS AND DREAMS On a certain time the Lady saint Mary had commanded the Lord Jesus to fetch her some water out of the well And when he had gone to fetch the water the pitcher when it was brought up full brake But Jesus spreading his mantle gathered up the water again and brought it in that to his mother The First apocryphal Gospel of the INFANCY of JESUS CHRIST missus Elton read prayers morning and evening very elaborate compositions which would have instructed the apostles themselves in many things they had never anticipated But unfortunately missus Elton must likewise read certain remarks in the form of a homily intended to impress the scripture which preceded it upon the minds of the listeners Between the mortar of the homilist s faith and the dull blows of the pestle of his arrogance the fair form of truth was ground into the powder of pious small talk This result was not pleasant either to Harry or to Euphra Euphra with her life threatening to go to ruin about her was crying out for him who made the soul of man who loved us into being two and who alone can renew the life of his children and in such words as those a scoffing demon seemed to mock at her needs Harry had the natural dislike of all childlike natures to everything formal exclusive and unjust But having received nothing of what is commonly called a religious training this advantage resulted from his new experiences in missus Elton s family that a good direction was given to his thoughts by the dislike which he felt to such utterances More than this a horror fell upon him lest these things should be true lest the mighty All of nature should be only a mechanism without expression and without beauty lest the God who made us should be like us only in this that he too was selfish and mean and proud lest his ideas should resemble those that inhabit the brain of a retired money maker or of an arbitrary monarch claiming a divine right instead of towering as the heavens over the earth above the loftiest moods of highest poet most generous child or most devoted mother I do not mean that these thoughts took these shapes in Harry s mind but that his feelings were such as might have been condensed into such thoughts had his intellect been more mature One morning the passage of scripture which missus Elton read was the story of the young man who came to Jesus and went away sorrowful because the Lord thought so well of him and loved him so heartily that he wanted to set him free from his riches A great portion of the homily was occupied with proving that the evangelist could not possibly mean that Jesus loved the young man in any pregnant sense of the word but merely meant that Jesus felt kindly disposed towards him felt a poor little human interest in him in fact and did not love him divinely at all Harry s face was in a flame all the time she was reading When the service was over and a bond service it was for Euphra and him they left the room together As soon as the door was shut he burst out I say Euphra Wasn t that a shame They would have Jesus as bad as themselves We shall have somebody writing a book next to prove that after all Jesus was a Pharisee Never mind said the heart sore sceptical Euphra never mind Harry it s all nonsense No it s not all nonsense Jesus did love the young man I believe the story itself before all the Doctors of Divinity in the world He loves all of us he does with all his heart too I hope so was all she could reply but she was comforted by Harry s vehement confession of faith Euphra was so far softened or perhaps weakened by suffering that she yielded many things which would have seemed impossible before One of these was that she went to church with missus Elton where that lady hoped she would get good to her soul Harry of course was not left behind The church she frequented was a fashionable one with a vicar more fashionable still for had he left that church more than half his congregation which consisted mostly of ladies would have left it also and followed him to the ends of London He was a middle aged man with a rubicund countenance and a gentle familiarity of manner that was exceedingly pleasing to the fashionable sheep who conscious that they had wandered from the fold were waiting with exemplary patience for the barouches and mail phaetons of the skies to carry them back without the trouble of walking Alas for them they have to learn that the chariots of heaven are chariots of fire The Sunday morning following the conversation I have just recorded the clergyman s sermon was devoted to the illustration of the greatness and condescension of the Saviour After a certain amount of tame excitement expended upon the consideration of his power and kingdom one passage was wound up in this fashion Yes my friends even her most gracious Majesty Queen Victoria the ruler over millions diverse in speech and in hue to whom we all look up with humble submission and whom we acknowledge as our sovereign lady even she great as she is adds by her homage a jewel to his crown and hailing him as her Lord bows and renders him worship Yet this is he who comes down to visit yea dwells with his own elect his chosen ones whom he has led back to the fold of his grace For some reason known to himself Falconer had taken Hugh who had gone to him according to appointment that morning to this same church As they came out Hugh said mister is quite proud of the honour done his master by the queen I do not think answered Falconer that his master will think so much of it for he once had his feet washed by a woman that was a sinner The homily which missus Elton read at prayers that evening bore upon the same subject nominally as the chapter that preceded it that of election a doctrine which in the Bible asserts the fact of God s choosing certain persons for the specific purpose of receiving first and so communicating the gifts of his grace to the whole world but which in the homily referred to was taken to mean the choice of certain persons for ultimate salvation to the exclusion of the rest They were sitting in silence after the close when Harry started up suddenly saying I don t want God to love me if he does not love everybody and bursting into tears hurried out of the room missus Elton was awfully shocked at his wickedness Euphra hastened after him but he would not return and went supperless to bed Euphra however carried him some supper He sat up in bed and ate it with the tears in his eyes She kissed him and bade him good night when just as she was leaving the room he broke out with But only think Euphra if it should be true I would rather not have been made It is not true said Euphra in whom a faint glimmer of faith in God awoke for the sake of the boy whom she loved awoke to comfort him when it would not open its eyes for herself No Harry dear if there is a God at all he is not like that No he can t be said Harry vehemently and with the brightness of a sudden thought for if he were like that he wouldn t be a God worth being and that couldn t be you know Euphra knelt by her bedside and prayed more hopefully than for many days before She prayed that God would let her know that he was not an idol of man s invention Till friendly sleep came and untied the knot of care both Euphra and Harry lay troubled with things too great for them Even in their sleep the care would gather again and body itself into dreams The first thought that visited Harry when he awoke was the memory of his dream that he died and went to heaven that heaven was a great church just like the one missus Elton went to only larger that the pews were filled with angels so crowded together that they had to tuck up their wings very close indeed and Harry could not help wondering what they wanted them for that they were all singing psalms that the pulpit by a little change had been converted into a throne on which sat God the Father looking very solemn and severe that Jesus was seated in the reading desk looking very sad and that the Holy Ghost sat on the clerk s desk in the shape of a white dove that a cherub whose face reminded him very much of a policeman he knew took him by the shoulder for trying to pluck a splendid green feather out of an archangel s wing and led him up to the throne where God shook his head at him in such a dreadful way that he was terrified and then stretched out his hand to lay hold on him that he shrieked with fear and that Jesus put out his hand and lifted him into the reading desk and hid him down below And there Harry lay feeling so safe stroking and kissing the feet that had been weary and wounded for him till in the growing delight of the thought that he actually held those feet he came awake and remembered it all Truly it was a childish dream but not without its own significance For surely the only refuge from heathenish representations of God under Christian forms the only refuge from man s blinding and paralysing theories from the dead wooden shapes substituted for the living forms of human love and hope and aspiration from the interpretations which render scripture as dry as a speech in Chancery surely the one refuge from all these awful evils is the Son of man for no misrepresentation and no misconception can destroy the beauty of that face which the marring of sorrow has elevated into the region of reality beyond the marring of irreverent speculation and scholastic definition From the God of man s painting we turn to the man of God s being and he leads us to the true God the radiation of whose glory we first see in him Happy is that man who has a glimpse of this even in a dream such as Harry s a dream in other respects childish and incongruous but not more absurd than the instruction whence it sprung But the troubles returned with the day Prayers revived them He sought Euphra in her room They say I must repent and be sorry for my sins said he I have been trying very hard but I can t think of any except once that I gave Gog his Welsh pony such a beating because he would go where I didn t want him But he s forgotten it long ago and I gave him two feeds of corn after it and so somehow I can t feel very sorry now What shall I do But that s not what I mind most It always seems to me it would be so much grander of God to say Come along never mind I ll make you good I can t wait till you are good I love you so much His own words were too much for Harry and he burst into tears at the thought of God being so kind Euphra instead of trying to comfort him cried too Thus they continued for some time Harry with his head on her knees and she kindly fondling it with her distressed hands Harry was the first to recover for his was the April time when rain clears the heavens All at once he sprung to his feet and exclaimed Only think Euphra What if after all I should find out that God is as kind as you are How Euphra s heart smote her Dear Harry answered she God must be a great deal kinder than I am I have not been kind to you at all Don t say that Euphra I shall be quite content if God is as kind as you Oh Harry I hope God is like what I dreamed about my mother last night Tell me what you dreamed about her dear Euphra I dreamed that I was a little child Were you a little girl when your mother died Oh yes such a tiny But I can just remember her Tell me your dream then I dreamed that I was a little girl out all alone on a wild mountain moor tripping and stumbling on my night gown And the wind was so cold And somehow or other the wind was an enemy to me and it followed and caught me and whirled and tossed me about and then ran away again Then I hastened on and the thorns went into my feet and the stones cut them And I heard the blood from them trickling down the hill side as I walked Then they would be like the feet I saw in my dream last night Whose feet were they Jesus feet Tell me about it You must finish yours first please Euphra So Euphra went on I got dreadfully lame And the wind ran after me and caught me again and took me in his great blue ghostly arms and shook me about and then dropped me again to go on But it was very hard to go on and I couldn t stop and there was no use in stopping for the wind was everywhere in a moment Then suddenly I saw before me a great cataract all in white falling flash from a precipice and I thought with myself I will go into the cataract and it will beat my life out and then the wind will not get me any more So I hastened towards it but the wind caught me many times before I got near it At last I reached it and threw myself down into the basin it had hollowed out of the rocks But as I was falling something caught me gently and held me fast and it was not the wind I opened my eyes and behold I was in my mother s arms and she was clasping me to her breast for what I had taken for a cataract falling into a gulf was only my mother with her white grave clothes floating all about her standing up in her grave to look after me It was time you came home my darling she said and stooped down into her grave with me in her arms And oh I was so happy and her bosom was not cold or her arms hard and she carried me just like a baby And when she stooped down then a door opened somewhere in the grave I could not find out where exactly and in a moment after we were sitting together in a summer grove with the tree tops steeped in sunshine and waving about in a quiet loving wind oh how different from the one that chased me home and we underneath in the shadow of the trees And then I said Mother I ve hurt my feet Did you call her mother when you were a little girl interposed Harry No answered Euphra I called her mamma like other children but in my dreams I always call her mother And what did she say She said Poor child and held my feet to her bosom and after that when I looked at them the bleeding was all gone and I was not lame any more Euphra paused with a sigh Oh Harry I do not like to be lame What more said Harry intent only on the dream Oh then I was so happy that I woke up directly What a pity But if it should come true How could it come true dear Harry Why this world is sometimes cold and the road is hard you know what I mean Euphra Yes I do I wish I could dream dreams like that How clever you must be But you dream dreams too Harry Tell me yours Oh no I never dream dreams the dreams dream me answered Harry with a smile Then he told his dream to which Euphra listened with an interest uninjured by the grotesqueness of its fancy Each interpreted the other s with reverence They ceased talking and sat silent for a while Then Harry putting his arms round Euphra s neck and his lips close to her ear whispered Perhaps God will say my darling to you some day Euphra just as your mother did in your dream She was silent Harry looked round into her face and saw that the tears were flowing fast At that instant a gentle knock came to the door Euphra could not reply to it It was repeated After another moment s delay the door opened and Margaret walked in CHAPTER XII A SUNDAY WITH FALCONER How happy is he born and taught That serveth not another s will Whose armour is his honest thought And simple truth his utmost skill This man is freed from servile bands Of hope to rise or fear to fall Lord of himself though not of lands And having nothing yet hath all SIR HENRY WOTTON It was not often that Falconer went to church but he seemed to have some design in going oftener than usual at present The Sunday after the one last mentioned he went as well though not to the same church and calling for Hugh took him with him What they found there and the conversation following thereupon I will try to relate because although they do not immediately affect my outward story they greatly influenced Hugh s real history They heard the Morning Service and the Litany read in an ordinary manner though somewhat more devoutly than usual Then from the communion table rose a voice vibrating with solemn emotion like the voice of Abraham pleading for Sodom It thrilled through Hugh s heart The sermon which followed affected him no less although when he came out he confessed to Falconer that he had only caught flying glimpses of its meaning scope and drift I seldom go to church said Falconer but when I do I come here and always feel that I am in the presence of one of the holy servants of God s great temple not made with hands I heartily trust that man He is what he seems to be They say he is awfully heterodox They do How then can he remain in the church if he is as honest as you say In this way as I humbly venture to think Falconer answered He looks upon the formulae of the church as utterances of living truth vital embodiments to be regarded as one ought to regard human faces In these human faces others may see this or that inferior expression may find out the mean and the small and the incomplete he looks for and finds the ideal the grand sacred God meant meaning and by that he holds as the meaning of the human countenances for it is the meaning of him who made them So with the confession of the Church of England he believes that not man only but God also and God first and chief had to do with the making of it and therefore he looks in it for the Eternal and the Divine and he finds what he seeks And as no words can avoid bearing in them the possibility of a variety of interpretations he would exclude whatever the words might mean or regarded merely as words do mean in a narrow exposition he thinks it would be dishonest to take the low meaning as the meaning To return to the faces he passes by moods and tempers and beholds the main character that on whose surface the temporal and transient floats Both in faces and in formulae he loves the divine substance with his true manly brave heart and as for the faults in both for man too has his share in both I believe he is ready to die by them if only in so doing he might die for them I had a vision of him this morning as I sat and listened to his voice which always seems to me to come immediately from his heart as if his heart spoke with lips of its own Shall I tell you my vision I saw a crowd priests and laymen speeding hurrying darting away up a steep crumbling height Mitres hoods and hats rolled behind them to the bottom Every one for himself with hands and feet they scramble and flee to save their souls from the fires of hell which come rolling in along the hollow below with the forward pointing spires of billowy flame But beneath right in the course of the fire stands one man upon a little rock which goes down to the centre of the great world and faces the approaching flames He stands bareheaded his eyes bright with faith in God and the mighty mouth that utters his truth fixed in holy defiance His denial comes from no fear or weak dislike to that which is painful On neither side will he tell lies for peace He is ready to be lost for his fellow men In the name of God he rebukes the flames of hell The fugitives pause on the top look back call him lying prophet and shout evil opprobrious names at the man who counts not his own life dear to him who has forgotten his own soul in his sacred devotion to men who fills up what is left behind of the sufferings of Christ for his body s sake for the human race of which he is the head Be sure that come what may of the rest let the flames of hell ebb or flow that man is safe for he is delivered already from the only devil that can make hell itself a torture the devil of selfishness the only one that can possess a man and make himself his own living hell He is out of all that region of things and already dwelling in the secret place of the Almighty Go on go on He trusts in God so absolutely that he leaves his salvation to him utterly fearlessly and forgetting it as being no concern of his sets himself to do the work that God has given him to do even as his Lord did before him counting that alone worthy of his care Let God s will be done and all is well If God s will be done he cannot fare ill To him God is all in all If it be possible to separate such things it is the glory of God even more than the salvation of men that he seeks He will not have it that his Father in heaven is not perfect He believes entirely that God loves yea is love and therefore that hell itself must be subservient to that love and but an embodiment of it that the grand work of Justice is to make way for a Love which will give to every man that which is right and ten times more even if it should be by means of awful suffering a suffering which the Love of the Father will not shun either for himself or his children but will eagerly meet for their sakes that he may give them all that is in his heart Surely you speak your own opinions in describing thus warmly the faith of the preacher I do He is accountable for nothing I say All I assert is that this is how I seem to myself to succeed in understanding him How is it that so many good people call him heterodox I do not mind that I am annoyed only when good hearted people with small natures and cultivated intellects patronise him and talk forgivingly of his warm heart and unsound judgment To these theology must be like a map with plenty of lines in it They cannot trust their house on the high table land of his theology because they cannot see the outlines bounding the said table land It is not small enough for them They cannot take it in Such can hardly be satisfied with the creation one would think seeing there is no line of division anywhere in it They would take care there should be no mistake Does God draw no lines then When he does they are pure lines without breadth and consequently invisible to mortal eyes not Chinese walls of separation such as these definers would construct Such minds are a priori incapable of theorising upon his theories Or to alter the figure they will discover a thousand faults in his drawing but they can never behold the figure constructed by his lines and containing the faults which they believe they discover But can those theories in religion be correct which are so hard to see They are only hard to certain natures But those natures are above the average Yes in intellect and its cultivation nothing more You have granted them heart Not much but what there is good That is allowing a great deal though Is it not hard then to say that such cannot understand him Why They will get to heaven which is all they want And they will understand him one day which is more than they pray for Till they have done being anxious about their own salvation we must forgive them that they can contemplate with calmness the damnation of a universe and believe that God is yet more indifferent than they But do they not bring the charges likewise against you of being unable to understand them Yes And so it must remain till the Spirit of God decide the matter which I presume must take place by slow degrees For this decision can only consist in the enlightenment of souls to see the truth and therefore has to do with individuals only There is no triumph for the Truth but that She knows no glorying over the vanquished for in her victory the vanquished is already of the vanquishers Till then the Right must be content to be called the Wrong and which is far harder to seem the Wrong There is no spiritual victory gained by a verbal conquest or by any kind of torture even should the rack employed be that of the purest logic Nay more so long as the wicked themselves remain impenitent there is mourning in heaven and when there is no longer any hope over one last remaining sinner heaven itself must confess its defeat heap upon that sinner what plagues you will Hugh pondered and continued pondering till they reached Falconer s chambers At the door Hugh paused Will you not come in I fear I shall become troublesome No fear of that I promise to get rid of you as soon as I find you so Thank you Just let me know when you have had enough of me They entered missus Ashton who unlike her class was never missing when wanted got them some bread and cheese and Falconer s Fortunatus purse of a cellar the bottom of his cupboard supplied its usual bottle of port to which fare the friends sat down The conversation like a bird descending in spirals settled at last upon the subject which had more or less occupied Hugh s thoughts ever since his unsatisfactory conversation with Funkelstein at their first meeting and still more since he had learned that this man himself exercised an unlawful influence over Euphra He begged Falconer if he had any theory comprehending such things to let him know what kind of a relation it was in which Miss Cameron stood to Funkelstein or Count von Halkar I have had occasion to think a good deal about those things said Falconer The first thing evident is that Miss Cameron is peculiarly constituted belonging to a class which is however larger than is commonly supposed circumstances rarely combining to bring out its peculiarities In those who constitute this class the nervous element either from preponderating or from not being in healthy and harmonious combination with the more material element manifests itself beyond its ordinary sphere of operation and so occasions results unlike the usual phenomena of life though of course in accordance with natural laws To use a simile it is in such cases as if all the nerves of the human body came crowding to the surface and there exposed themselves to a thousand influences from which they would otherwise be preserved Of course I am not attempting to explain only to suggest a conceivable hypothesis Upon such constitutions it would not be surprising that certain other constitutions similar yet differing should exercise a peculiar influence You are I dare say more or less familiar with the main features of mesmerism and its allies among which is what is called biology I presume it is on such constitutions as I have supposed that those powers are chiefly operative Miss Cameron has at some time or other in her history submitted herself to the influences of this Count Halkar and he has thus gained a most dangerous authority over her which he has exercised for his own ends She more than implied as much in the last conversation I had with her So his will became her law There is in the world of mind a something corresponding to physical force in the material world I cannot avoid just touching upon a higher analogy The kingdom of heaven is not come even when God s will is our law it is come when God s will is our will While God s will is our law we are but a kind of noble slaves when his will is our will we are free children Nothing in nature is free enough to be a symbol for the state of those who act immediately from the essence of their hidden life and the recognition of God s will as that essence But as I said this belongs to a far higher region I only wanted to touch on the relation of the freedoms physical mental and spiritual To return to the point in hand I recognise in the story a clear evidence of strife and partial victory in the affair of the ring The count we will call him by the name he gives himself had evidently been anxious for years to possess himself of this ring the probable reasons we have already talked of He had laid his injunctions on his slave to find it for him and she perhaps at first nothing loath perhaps loving the man as well as submitting to him had for a long time attempted to find it but had failed The count probably doubting her sincerity and hoping at all events to urge her search followed her to Arnstead where it is very likely he had been before although he had avoided mister Arnold Judging it advantageous to get into the house in order to make observations he employed his chance meeting with you to that result But before this he had watched Miss Cameron s familiarity with you was jealous and tyrannical Hence the variations of her conduct to you for when his power was upon her she could not do as she pleased But she must have had a real regard for you for she evidently refused to get you into trouble by taking the ring from your custody But my surprise is that the fellow limited himself to that one jewel You may soon be relieved from that surprise answered Hugh he took a valuable diamond of mine as well The rascal We may catch him but you are not likely to find your diamond again Still there is some possibility How do you know she was not willing to take it from me Because by her own account he had to destroy her power of volition entirely before he could make her do it He threw her into a mesmeric sleep I should like to understand his power over her a little better In such cases of biology how they came to abuse the word I should like to know Just as they call table rapping c spiritualism I suppose his relation to her must be classed amongst phenomena of that sort Certainly Well tell me does the influence outlast the mesmeric condition If by mesmeric condition you mean any state evidently approaching to that of sleep undoubtedly It is in many cases quite independent of such a condition Perhaps the degree of willing submission at first may have something to do with it But mesmeric influence whatever it may mean is entirely independent of sleep That is an accident accompanying it perhaps sometimes indicating its culmination Does the person so influenced act with or against his will That is a most difficult question involving others equally difficult My own impression is that the patient for patient in a very serious sense he is acts with his inclination and often with his will but in many cases with his inclination against his will This is a very important distinction in morals but often overlooked When a man is acting with his inclination his will is in abeyance In our present imperfect condition it seems to me that the absolute will has no opportunity of pure action of operating entirely as itself except when working in opposition to inclination But to return the power of the biologist appears to me to lie in this he is able by some mysterious sympathy to produce in the mind of the patient such forceful impulses to do whatever he wills that they are in fact irresistible to almost all who are obnoxious to his influence The will requires an especial training and a distinct development before it is capable of acting with any degree of freedom The men who have undergone this are very few indeed and no one whose will is not educated as well can if subjected to the influences of biology resist the impulses roused in his passive brain by the active brain of the operator This at least is my impression Other things no doubt combined to increase the influence in the present case She liked him perhaps more than liked him once She was partially committed to his schemes and she was easily mesmerised It would seem besides that she was naturally disposed to somnambulism This is a remarkable company existence of distinct developments of the same peculiarity In this latter condition even if in others she were able to resist him she would be quite helpless for all the thoughts that passed through her brain would owe their origin to his Imagine being forced to think another man s thoughts That would be possession indeed And this is not far removed from the old stories about the demons entering into a man He would be ruler over the whole intellectual life that passed in her during the time and which to her as far as the ideas suggested belonged to the outward world would appear an outer life passing all round her not in her She would in fact be a creature of his imagination for the time as much as any character invented and sent through varied circumstances feelings and actions by the mind of the poet or novelist Look at the facts She warned you to beware of the count that night before you went into the haunted bed chamber Even when she entered it by your own account Entered it Then you do think it was Euphra who personated the ghost I am sure of it She was sleep walking But so different such a death like look All that was easy enough to manage She refused to obey him at first He mesmerized her It very likely went farther than he expected and he succeeded too well Experienced no doubt in disguises he dressed her as like the dead Lady Euphrasia as he could following her picture Perhaps she possessed such a disguise and had used it before He thus protected her from suspicion and himself from implication What was the colour of the hair in the picture Golden Hence the sparkle of gold dust in her hair The count managed it all He willed that she should go and she went Her disguise was certain safety should she be seen You would suspect the ghost and no one else if she appeared to you and you lost the ring after But even in this state she yielded against her better inclination for she was weeping when you saw her But she could not help it While you lay on the couch in the haunted chamber where he carried you the awful death ghost was busy in your room was opening your desk fingering your papers and stealing your ring It is rather a frightful idea She did not take my ring I am sure He followed her and took it But she could not have come in at either door Could not Did she not go out at one of them Besides I do not doubt that such a room as that had private communication with the open air as well I should much like to examine the place But how could she have gone through the bolted door then That door may have been set in another larger by half the frame or so and opening with a spring and concealed hinges There is no difficulty about that There are such places to be found now and then in old houses But indeed if you will excuse me I do not consider your testimony on every minute particular quite satisfactory Why asked Hugh rather offended First because of the state of excitement you must have been in and next because I doubt the wine that was left in your room The count no doubt knew enough of drugs to put a few ghostly horrors into the decanter But poor Miss Cameron The horrors he has put into her mind and life It is a sad fate all but a sentence of insanity Hugh sprang to his feet By heaven he cried I will strangle the knave Stop stop said Falconer No revenge Leave him to the sleeping divinity within him which will awake one day and complete the hell that he is now building for himself for the very fire of hell is the divine in it Your work is to set Euphra free If you did strangle him how do you know if that would free her from him Horrible Have you no news of him None whatever What then can I do for her You must teach her to foil him How am I to do that Even if I knew how I cannot see her I cannot speak to her I have a great faith in opportunity But how should she foil him She must pray to God to redeem her fettered will to strengthen her will to redeem herself She must resist the count should he again claim her submission as for her sake I hope he will as she would the devil himself She must overcome Then she will be free not before This will be very hard to do His power has been excessive and peculiar and her submission long and complete Even if he left her alone she would not therefore be free She must defy him break his bonds oppose his will assert her freedom and defeat him utterly Oh who will help her I have no power Even if I were with her I could not help her in such a struggle I wish David were not dead He was the man You could now mister Falconer No Except I knew her had known her for some time and had a strong hold of all her nature I could not would not try to help her If Providence brought this about I would do my best but otherwise I would not interfere But if she pray to God he will give her whatever help she needs and in the best way too I think it would be some comfort to her if we could find the ring the crystal I mean It would be more I think if we could find the diamond How can we find either We must find the count first I have not given that up of course I will tell you what I should like to do if I knew the lady What Get her to come to London and make herself as public as possible go to operas and balls and theatres be presented at court take a stall at every bazaar and sell charity puff balls get as much into the papers as possible The lovely accomplished fascinating Miss Cameron c c What do you mean I will tell you what I mean The count has forsaken her now but as soon as he heard that she was somebody that she was followed and admired his vanity would be roused his old sense of property in her would revive and he would begin once more to draw her into his toils What the result would be it is impossible to foretell but it would at least give us a chance of catching him and her a chance of resisting him I don t think however that she would venture on that course herself I should not dare to propose it to her No no It was only an invention to deceive myself with the fancy that I was doing something There would be many objections to such a plan even if it were practicable I must still try to find him and if fresh endeavours should fail devise fresher still Thank you a thousand times said Hugh It is too good of you to take so much trouble It is my business answered Falconer Is there not a soul in trouble Hugh went home full of his new friend With the clue he had given him he was able to follow all the windings of Euphra s behaviour and to account for almost everything that had taken place It was quite painful to him to feel that he could be of no immediate service to her but he could hardly doubt that before long Falconer would in his wisdom and experience excogitate some mode of procedure in which he might be able to take a part He sat down to his novel which had been making but little progress for some time for it is hard to write a novel when one is living in the midst of a romance But the romance at this time was not very close to him It had a past and a possible future but no present That same future however might at any moment dawn into the present In the meantime teaching the Latin grammar and the English alphabet to young aspirants after the honours of the ministry was not work inimical to invention from either the exhaustion of its excitement or the absorption of its interest CHAPTER XIII THE LADY S MAID Her yellow hair beyond compare Comes trinkling down her swan white neck And her two eyes like stars in skies Would keep a sinking ship frae wreck Oh Mally s meek Mally s sweet Mally s modest and discreet Mally s rare Mally s fair Mally s every way complete BURNS What arms for innocence but innocence GILES FLETCHER Margaret had sought Euphra s room with the intention of restoring to her the letter which she had written to David Elginbrod Janet had let it lie for some time before she sent it to Margaret and Euphra had given up all expectation of an answer Hopes of ministration filled Margaret s heart but she expected from what she knew of her that anger would be Miss Cameron s first feeling Therefore when she heard no answer to her application for admission and had concluded in consequence that Euphra was not in the room she resolved to leave the letter where it would meet her eye and thus prepare the way for a future conversation When she saw Euphra and Harry she would have retired immediately but Euphra annoyed by her entrance was now quite able to speak What do you want she said angrily This is your letter Miss Cameron is it not said Margaret advancing with it in her hand Euphra took it glanced at the direction pushed Harry away from her started up in a passion and let loose the whole gathered irritability of contempt weariness disappointment and suffering upon Margaret Her dark eyes flashed with rage and her sallow cheek glowed like a peach What right have you pray to handle my letters How did you get this It has never been posted And open too I declare I suppose you have read it Margaret was afraid of exciting more wrath before she had an opportunity of explaining but Euphra gave her no time to think of a reply You have read it you shameless woman Why don t you lie like the rest of your tribe and keep me from dying with indignation Impudent prying My maid never posted it and you have found it and read it Pray did you hope to find a secret worth a bribe She advanced on Margaret till within a foot of her Why don t you answer you hussy I will go this instant to your mistress You or I leave the house Margaret had stood all this time quietly waiting for an opportunity to speak Her face was very pale but perfectly still and her eyes did not quail She had not in the least lost her self possession She would not say at once that she had read the letter because that would instantly rouse the tornado again You do not know my name Miss Cameron of course you could not Your name What is that to me That said Margaret pointing to the letter is my father s name Euphra looked at her own direction again and then looked at Margaret She was so bewildered that if she had any thoughts she did not know them Margaret went on My father is dead My mother sent the letter to me Then you have had the impertinence to read it It was my duty to read it Duty What business had you with it Euphra felt ashamed of the letter as soon as she found that she had applied to a man whose daughter was a servant Margaret answered I could at least reply to it so far that the writer should not think my father had neglected it I did not know who it was from till I came to the end Euphra turned her back on her with the words You may go Margaret walked out of the room with an unconscious stately gentleness Come back cried Euphra Margaret obeyed Of course you will tell all your fellow servants the contents of this foolish letter Margaret s face flushed and her eye flashed at the first words of this speech but the last words made her forget the first and to them only she replied Clasping her hands she said Dear Miss Cameron do not call it foolish For God s sake do not call it foolish What is it to you Do you think I am going to make a confidante of you Margaret again left the room Notwithstanding that she had made no answer to her insult Euphra felt satisfied that her letter was safe from profanation No sooner was Margaret out of sight than with the reaction common to violent tempers which in this case resulted the sooner from the exhaustion produced in a worn frame by the violence of the outburst Euphra sat down in a hopeless unresting way upon the chair from which she had just risen and began weeping more bitterly than before She was not only exhausted but ashamed and to these feelings was added a far greater sense of disappointment than she could have believed possible at the frustration of the hope of help from David Elginbrod True this hope had been small but where there is only one hope its death is equally bitter whether it be a great or a little hope And there is often no power of reaction in a mind which has been gradually reduced to one little faint hope when that hope goes out in darkness There is a recoil which is very helpful from the blow that kills a great hope All this time Harry had been looking on in a kind of paralysed condition pale with perplexity and distress He now came up to Euphra and trying to pull her hand gently from her face said What is it all about Euphra dear Oh I have been very naughty Harry But what is it all about May I read the letter If you like answered Euphra listlessly Harry read the letter with quivering features Then laying it down on the table with a reverential slowness went to Euphra put his arms round her and kissed her Dear dear Euphra I did not know you were so unhappy I will find God for you But first I will what shall I do to the bad man Who is it I will Harry finished the sentence by setting his teeth hard Oh you can t do anything for me Harry dear Only mind you don t say anything about it to any one Put the letter in the fire there for me No that I won t said Harry taking up the letter and holding it tight It is a beautiful letter and it does me good Don t you think though it is not sent to God himself he may read it and take it for a prayer I wish he would Harry But it was very wrong of you Euphra dear to speak as you did to the daughter of such a good man Yes it was But then you see you got angry before you knew who she was But I shouldn t have got angry before I knew all about it Well you have only to say you are sorry and Margaret won t think anything more about it Oh she is so good Euphra recoiled from making confession of wrong to a lady s maid and perhaps she was a little jealous of Harry s admiration of Margaret For Euphra had not yet cast off all her old habits of mind and one of them was the desire to be first with every one whom she cared for She had got rid of a worse which was a necessity of being first in every company whether she cared for the persons composing it or not Mental suffering had driven the latter far enough from her though it would return worse than ever if her mind were not filled with truth in the place of ambition So she did not respond to what Harry said Indeed she did not speak again except to beg him to leave her alone She did not make her appearance again that day But at night when the household was retiring she rose from the bed on which she had been lying half unconscious and going to the door opened it a little way that she might hear when Margaret should pass from missus Elton s room towards her own She waited for some time but judging at length that she must have passed without her knowledge she went and knocked at her door Margaret opened it a little after a moment s delay half undressed May I come in Margaret Pray do Miss Cameron answered Margaret And she opened the door quite Her cap was off and her rich dark hair fell on her shoulders and streamed thence to her waist Her under clothing was white as snow What a lovely skin she has thought Euphra comparing it with her own tawny complexion She felt for the first time that Margaret was beautiful yes more that whatever her gown might be her form and her skin give me a prettier word kind reader for a beautiful fact and I will gladly use it were those of one of nature s ladies She was soon to find that her intellect and spirit were those of one of God s ladies I am very sorry Margaret that I spoke to you as I did today Never mind it Miss Cameron We cannot help being angry sometimes And you had great provocation under the mistake you made I was only sorry because I knew it would trouble you afterwards Please don t think of it again You are very kind Margaret I regretted my father s death for the first time after reading your letter for I knew he could have helped you But it was very foolish of me for God is not dead Margaret smiled as she said this looking full in Euphra s eyes It was a smile of meaning unfathomable and it quite overcame Euphra She had never liked Margaret before for from not very obscure psychological causes she had never felt comfortable in her presence especially after she had encountered the nun in the Ghost s Walk though she had had no suspicion that the nun was Margaret A great many of our dislikes both to persons and things arise from a feeling of discomfort associated with them perhaps only accidentally present in our minds the first time we met them But this vanished entirely now Do you then know God too Margaret Yes answered Margaret simply and solemnly Will you tell me about him I can at least tell you about my father and what he taught me Oh thank you thank you Do tell me about him now Not now dear Miss Cameron It is late and you are too unwell to stay up longer Let me help you to bed to night I will be your maid As she spoke Margaret proceeded to put on her dress again that she might go with Euphra who had no attendant She had parted with Jane and did not care in her present mood to have a woman about her especially a new one No Margaret You have enough to do without adding me to your troubles Please do let me Miss Cameron It will be a great pleasure to me I have hardly anything to call work You should see how I used to work when I was at home Euphra still objected but Margaret s entreaty prevailed She followed Euphra to her room There she served her like a ministering angel brushed her hair oh so gently smoothing it out as if she loved it There was health in the touch of her hands because there was love She undressed her covered her in bed as if she had been a child made up the fire to last as long as possible bade her good night and was leaving the room when Euphra called her Margaret returned to the bed side Kiss me Margaret she said Margaret stooped kissed her forehead and her lips and left her Euphra cried herself to sleep They were the first tears she had ever shed that were not painful tears She slept as she had not slept for months In order to understand this change in Euphrasia s behaviour to Margaret in order in fact to represent it to our minds as at all credible we must remember that she had been trying to do right for some time that Margaret as the daughter of David seemed the only attainable source of the knowledge she sought that long illness had greatly weakened her obstinacy that her soul hungered without knowing it for love and that she was naturally gifted with a strong will the position in which she stood in relation to the count proving only that it was not strong enough and not that it was weak Such a character must for any good be ruled by itself and not by circumstances To have been overcome in the process of time by the persistent goodness of Margaret might have been the blessed fate of a weaker and worse woman but if Euphra did not overcome herself there was no hope of further victory If Margaret could even wither the power of her oppressor it would be but to transfer the lordship from a bad man to a good woman and that would not be enough It would not be freedom And indeed the aid that Margaret had to give her could only be bestowed on one who already had freedom enough to act in some degree from duty She knew she ought to go and apologize to Margaret She went In Margaret s presence and in such a mood she was subjected at once to the holy enchantment of her loving kindness She had never received any tenderness from a woman before Perhaps she had never been in the right mood to profit by it if she had Nor had she ever before seen what Margaret was It was only when service divine service flowed from her in full outgoing that she reached the height of her loveliness Then her whole form was beautiful So was it interpenetrated by and respondent to the uprising soul within that it radiated thought and feeling as if it had been all spirit This beauty rose to its best in her eyes When she was ministering to any one in need her eyes seemed to worship the object of her faithfulness as if all the time she felt that she was doing it unto Him Her deeds were devotion She was the receiver and not the giver Before this Euphra had seen only the still waiting face and as I have said she had been repelled by it Once within the sphere of the radiation of her attraction she was drawn towards her as towards the haven of her peace she loved her To this at length had her struggle with herself in the silence of her own room and her meditations on her couch conducted her Shall we say that these alone had been and were leading her Or that to all these there was a hidden root and an informing spirit Who would not rather believe that his thoughts come from an infinite self sphered self constituting thought than that they rise somehow out of a blank abyss of darkness and are only thought when he thinks them which thinking he cannot pre determine or even foresee When Euphra woke her first breath was like a deep draught of spiritual water She felt as if some sorrow had passed from her and some gladness come in its stead She thought and thought and found that the gladness was Margaret She had scarcely made the discovery when the door gently opened and Margaret peeped in to see if she were awake May I come in she said Yes please Margaret How do you feel to day Oh so much better dear Margaret Your kindness will make me well I am so glad Do lie still awhile and I will bring you some breakfast missus Elton will be so pleased to find you let me wait on you She asked me Margaret if you should but I was too miserable and too naughty for I did not like you I knew that but I felt sure you would not dislike me always Why Because I could not help loving you Why did you love me I will tell you half the reason Because you looked unhappy What was the other half That I cannot I mean I will not tell you Never Perhaps never But I don t know Not now Then I must not ask you No please Very well I won t Thank you I will go and get your breakfast What can she mean said Euphra to herself But she would never have found out CHAPTER XIV DAVID ELGINBROD He being dead yet speaketh HEB xi four In all he did Some figure of the golden times was hid doctor DONNE From this time Margaret waited upon Euphra as if she had been her own maid Nor had missus Elton any cause of complaint for Margaret was always at hand when she was wanted Indeed her mistress was full of her praises Euphra said little Many and long were the conversations between the two girls when all but themselves were asleep Sometimes Harry made one of the company but they could always send him away when they wished to be alone And now the teaching for which Euphra had longed sprang in a fountain at her own door It had been nigh her long and she had not known it for its hour had not come Now she drank as only the thirsty drink as they drink whose very souls are fainting within them for drought But how did Margaret embody her lessons The second night she came to Euphra s room and said Shall I tell you about my father to night Are you able Euphra was delighted It was what she had been hoping for all day Do tell me I long to hear about him So they sat down and Margaret began to talk about her childhood the cottage she lived in the fir wood all around it the work she used to do her side in short of the story which in the commencement of this book I have partly related from Hugh s side Summer and winter spring time and harvest storm and sunshine all came into the tale Her mother came into it often and often too though not so often the grand form of her father appeared remained for a little while and then passed away Every time Euphra saw him thus in the mirror of Margaret s memory she saw him more clearly than before she felt as if soon she should know him quite well Sometimes she asked a question or two but generally she allowed Margaret s words to flow unchecked for she painted her pictures better when the colours did not dry between They talked on or rather Margaret talked and Euphra listened far into the night At length Margaret stopped suddenly for she became aware that a long time had passed Looking at the clock on the chimney piece she said I have done wrong to keep you up so late Come I must get you to bed You are an invalid you know and I am your nurse as well as your maid You will come to morrow night then Yes I will Then I will go to bed like a good child Margaret undressed her and left her to the healing of sleep The next night she spoke again of her father and what he taught her Euphra had thought much about him and at every fresh touch which the story gave to the portrait she knew him better till at last even when circumstances not mentioned before came up she seemed to have known them from the beginning What was your father like Margaret Margaret described him very nearly as I have done from Hugh s account in the former part of the story Euphra said Ah yes That is almost exactly as I had fancied him Is it not strange It is very natural I think answered Margaret I seem now to have known him for years But what is most worthy of record is that ever as the picture of David grew on the vision of Euphra the idea of God was growing unawares upon her inward sight She was learning more and more about God all the time The sight of human excellence awoke a faint Ideal of the divine perfection Faith came of itself and abode and grew for it needs but a vision of the Divine and faith in God is straightway born in the soul that beholds it Thus faith and sight are one The being of her father in heaven was no more strange and far off from her when she had seen such a father on earth as Margaret s was It was not alone David s faith that begot hers but the man himself was a faith begetting presence He was the evidence of God with them Thus he being dead yet spoke and the departed man was a present power Euphra began to read the story of the Gospel So did Harry They found much on which to desire enlightenment and they always applied to Margaret for the light they needed It was long before she ventured to say I think She always said My father used to say or I think my father would have said It was not until Euphra was in great trouble some time after this and required the immediate consolation of personal testimony that Margaret spoke as from herself and then she spoke with positive assurance of faith She did not then even say I think but I am sure I know I have seen Many interviews of this sort did not take place between them before Euphra in her turn began to confide her history to Margaret It was a strangely different one full of outward event and physical trouble but till it approached the last stages wonderfully barren as to inward production or development It was a history of Euphra s circumstances and peculiarities not of Euphra herself Till of late she had scarcely had any history Margaret s on the contrary was a true history for with much of the monotonous in circumstance it described individual growth and the change of progress Where there is no change there can be no history and as all change is either growth or decay all history must describe progress or retrogression The former had now begun for Euphra as well and it was one proof of it that she told Margaret all I have already recorded for my readers at least as far as it bore against herself How much more she told her I am unable to say but after she had told it Euphra was still more humble towards Margaret and Margaret more tender more full of service if possible and more devoted to Euphra CHAPTER XV MARGARET S SECRET Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds Or bends with the remover to remove SHAKSPERE Sonnet cxvi Margaret could not proceed very far in the story of her life without making some reference to Hugh Sutherland But she carefully avoided mentioning his name Perhaps no one less calm and free from the operation of excitement could have been so successful in suppressing it Ah said Euphra one day your history is a little like mine there a tutor comes into them both Did you not fall dreadfully in love with him I loved him very much Where is he now In London I believe Do you never see him No Have you never seen him since he left your home with the curious name Yes but not spoken to him Where Margaret was silent Euphra knew her well enough now not to repeat the question I should have been in love with him I know Margaret only smiled Another day Euphra said What a good boy that Harry is And so clever too Ah Margaret I have behaved like the devil to that boy I wanted to have him all to myself and so kept him a child Need I confess all my ugliest sins Not to me certainly dear Miss Cameron Tell God to look into your heart and take them all out of it I will I do I even enticed mister Sutherland away from him to me when he was the only real friend he had that I might have them both But you have done your best to make up for it since I have tried a little I cannot say I have done my best I have been so peevish and irritable You could not quite help that How kind you are to excuse me so It makes me so much stronger to try again My father used to say that God was always finding every excuse for us that could be found every true one you know not one false one That does comfort one After a pause Euphra resumed mister Sutherland did me some good Margaret I do not wonder at that He made me think less about Count Halkar and that was something for he haunted me I did not know then how very wicked he was I did love him once Oh how I hate him now And she started up and paced the room like a tigress in its cage Margaret did not judge this the occasion to read her a lecture on the duty of forgiveness She had enough to do to keep from hating the man herself I suspect But she tried to turn her thoughts into another channel mister Sutherland loved you very much Miss Cameron He loved me once said poor Euphra with a sigh I saw he did That was why I began to love you too Margaret had at last unwittingly opened the door of her secret She had told the other reason for loving Euphra But naturally enough Euphra could not understand what she meant Perhaps some of my readers understanding Margaret s words perfectly and their reference too may be so far from understanding Margaret herself as to turn upon me and say Impossible You cannot have understood her or any other woman Well What do you mean Margaret Margaret both blushed and laughed outright I must confess it said she at once it cannot hurt him now my tutor and yours are the same Impossible True And you never spoke all the time you were both at Arnstead Not once He never knew I was in the house How strange And you saw he loved me Yes And you were not jealous I did not say that But I soon found that the only way to escape from my jealousy if the feeling I had was jealousy was to love you too I did You beautiful creature But you could not have loved him much I loved him enough to love you for his sake But why did he stop loving you I fear I shall not be able to love him so much now He could not help it Margaret I deserved it Euphra hid her face in her hands He could not have really loved you then Which is better to believe Margaret said Euphra uncovering her face which two tears were lingering down and looking up at her that he never loved me or that he stopped loving me For his sake the first And for my sake the second That depends So it does He must have found plenty of faults in me But I was not so bad as he thought me when he stopped loving me Margaret s answer was one of her loving smiles in which her eyes had more share than her lips It would have been unendurable to Euphra a little while before to find that she had a rival in a servant Now she scarcely regarded that aspect of her position But she looked doubtfully at Margaret and then said How is it that you take it so quietly for your love must have been very different from mine Indeed I am not sure that I loved him at all and after I had made up my mind to it quite it did not hurt me so very much But you must have loved him dreadfully Perhaps I did But I had no anxiety about it But that you could not leave to a father such as yours even to settle No But I could to God I could trust God with what I could not speak to my father about He is my father s father you know and so more to him and me than we could be to each other The more we love God the more we love each other for we find he makes the very love which sometimes we foolishly fear to do injustice to by loving him most I love my father ten times more because he loves God and because God has secrets with him I wish God were a father to me as he is to you Margaret But he is your father whether you wish it or not He cannot be more your father than he is You may be more his child than you are but not more than he meant you to be nor more than he made you for You are infinitely more his child than you have grown to yet He made you altogether his child but you have not given in to it yet Oh yes I know what you mean I feel it is true The Prodigal Son was his father s child He knew it and gave in to it He did not say I wish my father loved me enough to treat me like a child again He did not say that but I will arise and go to my father Euphra made no answer but wept Margaret said no more Euphra was the first to resume mister Sutherland was very kind Margaret He promised and I know he will keep his promise to do all he could to help me I hope he is finding out where that wicked count is Write to him and ask him to come and see you He does not know where you are But I don t know where he is I do Do you rejoined Euphra with some surprise But he does not know where I am I will give you his address if you like Euphra pondered a little She would have liked very much to see him for she was anxious to know of his success The love she had felt for him was a very small obstacle to their meeting now for her thoughts had been occupied with affairs before the interest of which the poor love she had then been capable of had melted away and vanished vanished that is in all that was restrictive and engrossing in its character But now that she knew the relation that had existed between Margaret and him she shrunk from doing anything that might seem to Margaret to give Euphra an opportunity of regaining his preference Not that she had herself the smallest hope even had she had the smallest desire of doing so but she would not even suggest the idea of being Margaret s rival At length she answered No thank you Margaret As soon as he has anything to report he will write to Arnstead and missus Horton will forward me the letter No it is quite unnecessary Euphra s health was improving a little though still she was far from strong CHAPTER XVI FOREBODINGS Faust If heaven was made for man twas made for me Good Angel Faustus repent yet heaven will pity thee Bad Angel Thou art a spirit God cannot pity thee Faust Be I a devil yet God may pity me Bad Angel Too late Good Angel Never too late if Faustus will repent Bad Angel If thou repent devils will tear thee in pieces Old Man I see an angel hover o er thy head And with a vial full of precious grace Offers to pour the same into thy soul MARLOWE Doctor Faustus mister Appleditch had had some business misfortunes not of a heavy nature but sufficient to cast a gloom over the house in Dervish Town and especially over the face of his spouse who had set her heart on a new carpet for her drawing room and feared she ought not to procure it now It is wonderful how conscientious some people are towards their balance at the banker s How the drawing room however could come to want a new carpet is something mysterious except there is a peculiar power of decay inherent in things deprived of use These influences operating however she began to think that the two scions of grocery were not drawing nine shillings worth a week of the sap of divinity This she hinted to mister Appleditch It was resolved to give Hugh warning As it would involve some awkwardness to state reasons missus Appleditch resolved to quarrel with him as the easiest way of prefacing his discharge It was the way she took with her maids of all work for it was grand in itself and always left her with a comfortable feeling of injured dignity As a preliminary course she began to treat him with still less politeness than before Hugh was so careless of her behaviour that this made no impression upon him But he came to understand it all afterwards from putting together the remarks of the children and the partial communications of mister Appleditch to Miss Talbot which that good lady innocently imparted to her lodger At length one day she came into the room where Hugh was more busy in teaching than his pupils were in learning and seated herself by the fire to watch for an opportunity This was soon found For the boys rendered still more inattentive by the presence of their mother could not be induced to fix the least thought upon the matter in hand so that Hugh was compelled to go over the same thing again and again without success At last he said I am afraid missus Appleditch I must ask you to interfere for I cannot get any attention from the boys to day And how could it be otherwise mister Sutherland when you keep wearing them out with going over and over the same thing till they are sick of it Why don t you go on How can I go on when they have not learned the thing they are at That would be to build the chimneys before the walls It is very easy to be witty sir but I beg you will behave more respectfully to me in the presence of my children innocent lambs Looking round at the moment Hugh caught in his face what the elder lamb had intended for his back a grimace hideous enough to have procured him instant promotion in the kingdom of apes The mother saw it too and added You see you cannot make them respect you Really mister Sutherland Hugh was about to reply to the effect that it was useless in such circumstances to attempt teaching them at all some utterance of which sort was watched for as the occasion for his instant dismission but at that very moment a carriage and pair pulled sharply up at the door with more than the usual amount of quadrupedation and mother and sons darted simultaneously to the window My cried Johnnie what a rum go Isn t that a jolly carriage Peetie Papa s bought a carriage shouted Peetie Be quiet children said their mother as she saw a footman get down and approach the door Look at that buffer said Johnnie Do come and see this grand footman mister Sutherland He s such a gentleman A box on the ear from his mother silenced him The servant entering with some perturbation a moment after addressed her mistress for she dared not address any one else while she was in the room Please m the carriage is astin after mister Sutherland mister Sutherland Yes m The lady turned to mister Sutherland who although surprised as well was not inclined to show his surprise to missus Appleditch I did not know you had carriage friends mister Sutherland said she with a toss of her head Neither did I answered Hugh But I will go and see who it is When he reached the street he found Harry on the pavement who having got out of the carriage and not having been asked into the house was unable to stand still for impatience As soon as he saw his tutor he bounded to him and threw his arms round his neck standing as they were in the open street Tears of delight filled his eyes Come come come said Harry we all want you Who wants me missus Elton and Euphra and me Come get in And he pulled Hugh towards the carriage I cannot go with you now I have pupils here Harry s face fell When will you come In half an hour Hurrah I shall be back exactly in half an hour then Do be ready please mister Sutherland I will Harry jumped into the carriage telling the coachman to drive where he pleased and be back at the same place in half an hour Hugh returned into the house As may be supposed Margaret was the means of this happy meeting Although she saw plainly enough that Euphra would like to see Hugh she did not for some time make up her mind to send for him The circumstances which made her resolve to do so were these For some days Euphra seemed to be gradually regaining her health and composure of mind One evening after a longer talk than usual Margaret had left her in bed and had gone to her own room She was just preparing to get into bed herself when a knock at her door startled her and going to it she saw Euphra standing there pale as death with nothing on but her nightgown notwithstanding the bitter cold of an early and severe frost She thought at first she must be walking in her sleep but the scared intelligence of her open eyes soon satisfied her that it was not so What is the matter dear Miss Cameron she said as calmly as she could He is coming He wants me If he calls me I must go No you shall not go rejoined Margaret firmly I must I must answered Euphra wringing her hands Do come in said Margaret you must not stand there in the cold Let me get into your bed Better let me go with you to yours That will be more comfortable for you Oh yes please do Margaret threw a shawl round Euphra and went back with her to her room He wants me He wants me He will call me soon said Euphra in an agonised whisper as soon as the door was shut What shall I do Come to bed first and we will talk about it there As soon as they were in bed Margaret put her arm round Euphra who was trembling with cold and fear and said Has this man any right to call you No no answered Euphra vehemently Then don t go But I am afraid of him Defy him in God s name But besides the fear there is something that I can t describe that always keeps telling me no not telling me pushing me no drawing me as if I could not rest a moment till I go I cannot describe it I hate to go and yet I feel that if I were cold in my grave I must rise and go if he called me I wish I could tell you what it is like It is as if some demon were shaking my soul till I yielded and went Oh don t despise me I can t help it My darling I don t I can t despise you You shall not go to him But I must answered she with a despairing faintness more convincing than any vehemence and then began to weep with a slow hopeless weeping like the rain of a November eve Margaret got out of bed Euphra thought she was offended Starting up she clasped her hands and said Oh Margaret I won t cry Don t leave me Don t leave me She entreated like a chidden child No no I didn t mean to leave you for a moment Lie down again dear and cry as much as you like I am going to read a little bit out of the New Testament to you I am afraid I can t listen to it Never mind Don t try I want to read it Margaret got a New Testament and read part of that chapter of saint John s Gospel which speaks about human labour and the bread of life She stopped at these words For I came down from heaven not to do mine own will but the will of him that sent me Euphra s tears had ceased The sound of Margaret s voice which if it lost in sweetness by becoming more Scotch when she read the Gospel yet gained thereby in pathos and the power of the blessed words themselves had soothed the troubled spirit a little and she lay quiet The count is not a good man Miss Cameron You know he is not Margaret He is the worst man alive Then it cannot be God s will that you should go to him But one does many things that are not God s will But it is God s will that you should not go to him Euphra lay silent for a few moments Suddenly she exclaimed Then I must not go to him got out of bed threw herself on her knees by the bedside and holding up her clasped hands said in low tones that sounded as if forced from her by agony I won t I won t O God I will not Help me help me Margaret knelt beside her and put her arm round her Euphra spoke no more but remained kneeling with her extended arms and clasped hands lying on the bed and her head laid between them At length Margaret grew alarmed and looked at her But she found that she was in a sweet sleep She gently disengaged herself and covering her up soft and warm left her to sleep out her God sent sleep undisturbed while she sat beside and watched for her waking She slept thus for an hour Then lifting her head and seeing Margaret she rose quietly as if from her prayers and said with a smile Margaret I was dreaming that I had a mother So you have somewhere Yes so I have somewhere she repeated and crept into bed like a child lay down and was asleep again in a moment Margaret watched her for another hour and then seeing no signs of restlessness but that on the contrary her sleep was profound lay down beside her and soon shared in that repose which to weary women and men is God s best gift She rose at her usual hour the next day and was dressed before Euphra awoke It was a cold grey December morning with the hoar frost lying thick on the roofs of the houses Euphra opened her eyes while Margaret was busy lighting the fire Seeing that she was there she closed them again and fell once more fast asleep Before she woke again Margaret had some tea ready for her after taking which she felt able to get up She rose looking more bright and hopeful than Margaret had seen her before But Margaret who watched her intently through the day saw a change come over her cheer Her face grew pale and troubled Now and then her eyes were fixed on vacancy and again she would look at Margaret with a woebegone expression of countenance but presently as if recollecting herself would smile and look cheerful for a moment Margaret saw that the conflict was coming on if not already begun that at least its shadow was upon her and thinking that if she could have a talk with Hugh about what he had been doing it would comfort her a little and divert her thoughts from herself even if no farther or more pleasantly than to the count She let Harry know Hugh s address as given in the letter to her father She was certain that if Harry succeeded in finding him nothing more was necessary to insure his being brought to missus Elton s As we have seen Harry had traced him to Buccleuch Terrace Hugh re entered the house in the same mind in which he had gone out namely that after missus Appleditch s behaviour to him before his pupils he could not remain their tutor any longer however great his need might be of the pittance he received for his services But although missus Appleditch s first feeling had been jealousy of Hugh s acquaintance with carriage people the toadyism which is so essential an element of such jealousy had by this time revived and when Hugh was proceeding to finish the lesson he had begun intending it to be his last she said Why didn t you ask your friend into the drawing room mister Sutherland Good gracious The drawing room thought Hugh but answered He will fetch me when the lesson is over I am sure sir any friends of yours that like to call upon you here will be very welcome It will be more agreeable to you to receive them here of course for your accommodation at poor Miss Talbot s is hardly suitable for such visitors I am sorry to say however answered Hugh that after the way you have spoken to me to day in the presence of my pupils I cannot continue my relation to them any longer Ho ho resnorted the lady indignation and scorn mingling with mortification our grand visitors have set our backs up Very well mister Sutherland you will oblige me by leaving the house at once Don t trouble yourself pray to finish the lesson I will pay you for it all the same Anything to get rid of a man who insults me before the very faces of my innocent lambs And please to remember she added as she pulled out her purse while Hugh was collecting some books he had lent the boys that when you were starving my husband and I took you in and gave you employment out of charity pure charity mister Sutherland Here is your money Good morning missus Appleditch said Hugh and walked out with his books under his arm leaving her with the money in her hand He had to knock his feet on the pavement in front of the house to keep them from freezing for half an hour before the carriage arrived to take him away As soon as it came up he jumped into it and was carried off in triumph by Harry missus Elton received him kindly Euphra held out her hand with a slight blush and the quiet familiarity of an old friend Hugh could almost have fallen in love with her again from compassion for her pale worn face and subdued expression missus Elton went out in the carriage almost directly and Euphra begged Harry to leave them alone as she had something to talk to mister Sutherland about Have you found any trace of Count Halkar Hugh she said the moment they were by themselves I am very sorry to say I have not I have done my best I am quite sure of that I just wanted to tell you that from certain indications which no one could understand so well as myself I think you will have more chance of finding him now I am delighted to hear it responded Hugh If I only had him Euphra sighed paused and then said But I am not sure of it I think he is in London but he may be in Bohemia for anything I know I shall however in all probability know more about him within a few days Hugh resolved to go at once to Falconer and communicate to him what Euphra had told him But he said nothing to her as to the means by which he had tried to discover the count for although he felt sure that he had done right in telling Falconer all about it he was afraid lest Euphra not knowing what sort of a man he was might not like it Euphra on her part did not mention Margaret s name for she had begged her not to do so You will tell me when you know yourself Perhaps I will if I can I do wish you could get the ring I have a painful feeling that it gives him power over me That can only be a nervous fancy surely Hugh ventured to say Perhaps it is I don t know But still without that there are plenty of reasons for wishing to recover it He will put it to a bad use if he can But for your sake especially I wish we could get it Thank you You were always kind No she replied without lifting her eyes I brought it all upon you But you could not help it Not at the moment But all that led to it was my fault She paused then suddenly resumed I will confess Do you know what gave rise to the reports of the house being haunted No It was me wandering about it at night looking for that very ring to give to the count It was shameful But I did Those reports prevented me from being found out But I hope not many ghosts are so miserable as I was You remember my speaking to you of mister Arnold s jewels Yes perfectly I wanted to find out through you where the ring was But I had no intention of involving you I am sure you had not Don t be too sure of anything about me I don t know what I might have been led to do But I am very sorry Do forgive me I cannot allow that I have anything to forgive But tell me Euphra were you the creature in white that I saw in the Ghost s Walk one night I don t mean the last time Very likely she answered bending her head yet lower with a sigh Then who was the creature in black that met you And what became of you then Did you see her rejoined Euphra turning paler still I fainted at sight of her I took her for the nun that hangs in that horrid room So did I said Hugh But you could not have lain long for I went up to the spot where you vanished and found nothing I suppose I got into the shrubbery before I fell Or the count dragged me in But was that really a ghost I feel now as if it was a good messenger whether ghost or not come to warn me if I had had the courage to listen I wish I had taken the warning They talked about these and other things till missus Elton who had made Hugh promise to stay to lunch returned When they were seated at table the kind hearted woman said Now mister Sutherland when will you begin again with Harry I do not quite understand you answered Hugh Of course you will come and give him lessons poor boy He will be broken hearted if you don t I wish I could But I cannot at least yet for I know his father was dissatisfied with me That was one of the reasons that made him send Harry to London Harry looked wretchedly disappointed but said nothing I never heard him say anything of the sort I am sure of it though I am very sorry he has mistaken me but he will know me better some day I will take all the responsibility persisted missus Elton But unfortunately the responsibility sticks too fast for you to take it I cannot get rid of my share if I would You are too particular I am sure mister Arnold never could have meant that This is my house too But Harry is his boy If you will let me come and see him sometimes I shall be very thankful though I may be useful to him without giving him lessons Thank you said Harry with delight Well well I suppose you are so much in request in London that you won t miss him for a pupil On the contrary I have not a single engagement If you could find me one I should be exceedingly obliged to you Dear dear dear said missus Elton Then you shall have Harry Oh yes please take me said Harry beseechingly No I cannot I must not missus Elton rang the bell James tell the coachman I want the carriage in an hour missus Elton was as submissive to her coachman as ladies who have carriages generally are and would not have dreamed of ordering the horses out so soon again for herself but she forgot everything else when a friend was in need of help and became perfectly pachydermatous to the offended looks or indignant hints of that important functionary Within a few minutes after Hugh took his leave missus Elton was on her way to repeat a visit she had already paid the same morning and to make several other calls with the express object of finding pupils for Hugh But in this she was not so successful as she had expected In fact no one whom she could think of wanted such services at present She returned home quite down hearted and all but convinced that nothing could be done before the approach of the London season CHAPTER XVII STRIFE They ll turn me in your arms Janet An adder and a snake But haud me fast let me not pass Gin ye would be my maik They ll turn me in your arms Janet An adder and an aske They

And sae shall I be wan Scotch Ballad Tamlane As soon as Hugh had left the house Margaret hastened to Euphra She found her in her own room a little more cheerful but still strangely depressed This appearance increased towards the evening till her looks became quite haggard revealing an inward conflict of growing agony Margaret remained with her Just before dinner the upstairs bell whose summons Margaret was accustomed to obey rang and she went down missus Elton detained her for a few minutes The moment she was at liberty she flew to Euphra s room by the back staircase But as she ascended she was horrified to meet Euphra in a cloak and thick veil creeping down the stairs like a thief Without saying a word the strong girl lifted her in her arms as if she had been a child and carried her back to her room Euphra neither struggled nor spoke Margaret laid her on her couch and sat down beside her She lay without moving and although wide awake gave no other sign of existence than an occasional low moan that seemed to come from a heart pressed almost to death Having lain thus for an hour she broke the silence Margaret do you despise me dreadfully No not in the least Yet you found me going to do what I knew was wrong You had not made yourself strong by thinking about the will of God Had you dear No I will tell you how it was I had been tormented with the inclination to go to him and had been resisting it till I was worn out and could hardly bear it more Suddenly all grew calm within me and I seemed to hate Count Halkar no longer I thought with myself how easy it would be to put a stop to this dreadful torment just by yielding to it only this once I thought I should then be stronger to resist the next time for this was wearing me out so that I must yield the next time if I persisted now But what seemed to justify me was the thought that so I should find out where he was and be able to tell Hugh and then he would get the ring for me and perhaps that would deliver me But it was very wrong of me I forgot all about the will of God I will not go again Margaret Do you think I may try again to fight him That is just what you must do All that God requires of you is to try again God s child must be free Do try dear Miss Cameron I think I could if you would call me Euphra You are so strong and pure and good Margaret I wish I had never had any thoughts but such as you have you beautiful creature Oh how glad I am that you found me Do watch me always I will call you Euphra I will be your sister servant anything you like if you will only try again Thank you with all my troubled heart dear Margaret I will indeed try again She sprang from the couch in a sudden agony and grasping Margaret by the arm looked at her with such a terror stricken face that she began to fear she was losing her reason Margaret she said as if with the voice as of one just raised from the dead speaking with all the charnel damps in her throat could it be that I am in love with him still Margaret shuddered but did not lose her self possession No no Euphra darling You were haunted with him and so tired that you were not able to hate him any longer Then you began to give way to him That was all There was no love in that Euphra s grasp relaxed Do you think so Yes A pause followed Do you think God cares to have me do his will Is it anything to him I am sure of it Why did he make you else But it is not for the sake of being obeyed that he cares for it but for the sake of serving you and making you blessed with his blessedness He does not think about himself but about you Oh dear oh dear I must not go Let me read to you again Eupra Yes please do Margaret She read the fortieth chapter of Isaiah one of her father s favourite chapters where all the strength and knowledge of God are urged to a height that they may fall in overwhelming profusion upon the wants and fears and unbelief of his children How should he that calleth the stars by their names forget his people While she read the cloud melted away from Euphra s face a sweet sleep followed and the paroxysm was over for the time Was Euphra insane and were these the first accesses of daily fits of madness which had been growing and approaching for who could tell how long Even if she were mad or going mad was not this the right way to treat her I wonder how often the spiritual cure of faith in the Son of Man the Great Healer has been tried on those possessed with our modern demons Is it proved that insanity has its origin in the physical disorder which it is now said can be shown to accompany it invariably Let it be so it yet appears to me that if the physician would like the Son of Man himself descend as it were into the disorganized world in which the consciousness of his patient exists and receiving as fact all that he reveals to him of its condition for fact it is of a very real sort introduce by all the means that sympathy can suggest the one central cure for evil spiritual and material namely the truth of the Son of Man the vision of the perfect friend and helper with the revelation of the promised liberty of obedience if he did this it seems to me that cures might still be wrought as marvellous as those of the ancient time It seems to me too that that can be but an imperfect religion as it would be a poor salvation from which one corner of darkness may hide us from whose blessed health and freedom a disordered brain may snatch us making us hopeless outcasts till first the physician the student of physical laws shall interfere and restore us to a sound mind or the great God s angel Death crumble the soul oppressing brain with its thousand phantoms of pain and fear and horror into a film of dust in the hollow of the deserted skull Hugh repaired immediately to Falconer s chambers where he was more likely to find him during the day than in the evening He was at home He told him of his interview with Euphra and her feeling that the count was not far off Do you think there can be anything in it asked he when he had finished his relation I think very likely answered his friend I will be more on the outlook than ever It may after all be through the lady herself that we shall find the villain If she were to fall into one of her trances now I think it almost certain she would go to him She ought to be carefully watched and followed if that should take place Let me know all that you learn about her Go and see her again to morrow that we may be kept informed of her experiences so far as she thinks proper to tell them I will said Hugh and took his leave But Margaret who knew Euphra s condition both spiritual and physical better than any other had far different objects for her through means of the unholy attraction which the count exercised over her than the discovery of the stolen ring She was determined that neither sleeping nor waking should she follow his call or dance to his piping She should resist to the last in the name of God and so redeem her lost will from the power of this devil to whom she had foolishly sold it The next day the struggle evidently continued and it had such an effect on Euphra that Margaret could not help feeling very anxious about the result as regarded her health even if she should be victorious in the contest But not for one moment did Margaret quail for she felt convinced come of it what might that the only hope for Euphra lay in resistance Death to her mind was simply nothing in the balance with slavery of such a sort Once but evidently in a fit of absence Euphra rose went to the door and opened it But she instantly dashed it to again and walking slowly back resumed her seat on the couch Margaret came to her from the other side of the bed where she had been working by the window for the last quarter of an hour for the sake of the waning light What is it dear she said Oh Margaret are you there I did not know you were in the room I found myself at the door before I knew what I was doing But you came back of yourself this time Yes I did But I still feel inclined to go There is no sin in that so long as you do not encourage the feeling or yield to it I hate it You will soon be free from it Keep on courageously dear sister You will be in liberty and joy soon God grant it He will Euphra I am sure he will I am sure you know or you would not say it A knock came to the street door Euphra started and sat in the attitude of a fearful listener A message was presently brought her that mister Sutherland was in the drawing room and wished to see her Euphra rose immediately and went to him Margaret who did not quite feel that she could be trusted yet removed to a room behind the drawing room whence she could see Euphra if she passed to go down stairs Hugh asked her if she could tell him anything more about Count Halkar Only she answered that I am still surer of his being near me How do you know it I need not mind telling you for I have told you before that he has a kind of supernatural power over me I know it by his drawing me towards him It is true I might feel it just the same whether he was in America or in London but I do not think he would care to do it if he were so far off I know him well enough to know that he would not wish for me except for some immediate advantage to himself But what is the use of his doing so when you don t know where he is to be found I should go straight to him without knowing where I was going Hugh rose in haste Put on your bonnet and cloak and come with me I will take care of you Lead me to him and the ring shall soon be in your hands again Euphra hesitated half rose but sat down immediately No no Not for worlds she said Do not tempt me I must not I dare not I will not go But I shall be with you I will take care of you Don t you think I am able Euphra Oh yes quite able But I must not go anywhere at that man s bidding But it won t be at his bidding it will be at mine Ah that alters the case rather does it not I wonder what Margaret would say Margaret What Margaret said Hugh Oh my new maid answered Euphra recollecting herself Not being well at present she is my nurse We shall take a cab as soon as we get to the corner I don t think the count would be able to guide the horse said Euphra with a smile I must walk But I should like to go I will It would be such a victory to catch him in his own toils She rose and ran up stairs In a few minutes she came down again cloaked and veiled But Margaret met her as she descended and leading her into the back drawing room said Are you going Euphra Yes but I am going with mister Sutherland answered Euphra in a defensive tone It is to please him and not to obey the count Are you sure it is all to please mister Sutherland If it were I don t think you would be able to guide him right Is it not to get rid of your suffering by yielding to temptation Euphra At all events if you go even should mister Sutherland be successful with him you will never feel that you have overcome him or he that he has lost you He will still hold you fast Don t go I am sure you are deceiving yourself Euphra stood for a moment and pouted like a naughty child Then suddenly throwing her arms about Margaret s neck she kissed her and said I won t go Margaret Here take my things up stairs for me She threw off her bonnet and cloak and rejoined Hugh in the drawing room I can t go she said I must not go I should be yielding to him and it would make a slave of me all my life It is our only chance for the ring said Hugh Again Euphra hesitated and wavered but again she conquered I cannot help it she said I would rather not have the ring than go if you will forgive me Oh Euphra replied Hugh You know it is not for myself I do know it You won t mind then if I don t go Certainly not if you have made up your mind You must have a good reason for it Indeed I have And even already she felt that resistance brought its own reward Hugh went almost immediately in order to make his report to Falconer with whom he had an appointment for the purpose She is quite right said Falconer I do not think in the relation in which she stands to him that she could safely do otherwise But it seems to me very likely that this will turn out well for our plans too Let her persist and in all probability he will not only have to resign her perforce but will so far make himself subject to her in turn as to seek her who will not go to him He will pull upon his own rope till he is drawn to the spot where he has fixed it What remains for you and me to do is to keep a close watch on the house and neighbourhood Most likely we shall find the villain before long Do you really think so The whole affair is mysterious and has to do with laws with which we are most imperfectly acquainted but this seems to me a presumption worth acting upon Is there no one in the house on whom you could depend for assistance for information at least Yes There is the same old servant that missus Elton had with her at Arnstead He is a steady old fellow and has been very friendly with me Well what I would advise is that you should find yourself quarters as near the spot as possible and besides keeping as much of a personal guard upon the house as you can engage the servant you mention to let you know the moment the count makes his appearance It will probably be towards night when he calls for such a man may have reasons as well as instincts to make him love the darkness rather than the light You had better go at once and when you have found a place leave or send the address here to me and towards night fall I will join you But we may have to watch for several days We must not be too sanguine Almost without a word Hugh went to do as Falconer said The only place he could find suitable was a public house at the corner of a back street where the men servants of the neighbourhood used to resort He succeeded in securing a private room in it for a week and immediately sent Falconer word of his locality He then called a second time at missus Elton s and asked to see the butler When he came Irwan said he has Herr von Funkelstein called here to day No sir he has not You would know him would you not Yes sir perfectly Well if he should call to night or to morrow or any time within the next few days let me know the moment he is in the house You will find me at the Golden Staff round the corner It is of the utmost importance that I should see him at once But do not let him know that any one wants to see him You shall not repent helping me in this affair I know I can trust you Hugh had fixed him with his eyes before he began to explain his wishes He had found out that this was the best way of securing attention from inferior natures and that it was especially necessary with London servants for their superciliousness is cowed by it and the superior will brought to bear upon theirs It is the only way a man without a carriage has to command attention from such Irwan was not one of this sort He was a country servant for one difference But Hugh made his address as impressive as possible I will with pleasure sir answered Irwan and Hugh felt tolerably sure of him Falconer came They ordered some supper and sat till eleven o clock There being then no chance of a summons they went out together Passing the house they saw light in one upper window only That light would burn there all night for it was in Euphra s room They went on Hugh accompanying Falconer in one of his midnight walks through London as he had done repeatedly before From such companionship and the scenes to which Falconer introduced him he had gathered this fruit that he began to believe in God for the sake of the wretched men and women he saw in the world At first it was his own pain at the sight of such misery that drove him for consolation to hope in God so at first it was for his own sake But as he saw more of them and grew to love them more he felt that the only hope for them lay in the love of God and he hoped in God for them He saw too that a God not both humanly and absolutely divine a God less than that God shadowed forth in the Redeemer of men would not do But thinking about God thus and hoping in him for his brothers and sisters he began to love God Then last of all that he might see in him one to whom he could abandon everything that he might see him perfect and all in all and as he must be for the sake of God himself he believed in him as the Saviour of these his sinful and suffering kin As early as was at all excusable the following morning he called on Euphra The butler said that she had not come down yet but he would send up his name A message was brought back that Miss Cameron was sorry not to see him but she had had a bad night and was quite unable to get up Irwan replied to his inquiry that the count had not called Hugh withdrew to the Golden Staff A bad night it had been indeed As Euphra slept well the first part of it and had no attack such as she had had upon both the preceding nights Margaret had hoped the worst was over Still she laid herself only within the threshold of sleep ready to wake at the least motion In the middle of the night she felt Euphra move She lay still to see what she would do Euphra slipped out of bed and partly dressed herself then went to her wardrobe and put on a cloak with a large hood which she drew over her head Margaret lay with a dreadful aching at her heart Euphra went towards the door Margaret called her but she made no answer Margaret flew to the door and reached it before her Then to her intense delight she saw that Euphra s eyes were closed Just as she laid her hand on the door Margaret took her gently in her arms Let me go let me go Euphra almost screamed Then suddenly opening her eyes she stared at Margaret in a bewildered fashion like one waking from the dead Euphra dear Euphra said Margaret Oh Margaret is it really you exclaimed Euphra flinging her arms about her Oh I am glad Ah you see what I must have been about I suppose I knew when I was doing it but I don t know now I have forgotten all about it Oh dear oh dear I thought it would come to this Come to bed dear You couldn t help it It was not yourself There is not more than half of you awake when you walk in your sleep They went to bed Euphra crept close to Margaret and cried herself asleep again The next day she had a bad head ache This with her always followed somnambulation She did not get up all that day When Hugh called again in the evening he heard she was better but still in bed Falconer joined Hugh at the Golden Staff at night but they had no better success than before Falconer went out alone for Hugh wanted to keep himself fresh Though very strong he was younger and less hardened than Falconer who could stand an incredible amount of labour and lack of sleep Hugh would have given way under the half CHAPTER XVIII VICTORY O my admired mistress quench not out The holy fires within you though temptations Shower down upon you clasp thine armour on Fight well and thou shalt see after these wars Thy head wear sunbeams and thy feet touch stars MASSINGER The Virgin Martyr But Hugh could sleep no more than if he had been out with Falconer He was as restless as a wild beast in a cage Something would not let him be at peace So he rose dressed and went out As soon as he turned the corner he could see missus Elton s house It was visible both by intermittent moonlight above and by flickering gaslight below for the wind blew rather strong There was snow in the air he knew The light they had observed last night was burning now A moment served to make these observations and then Hugh s eyes were arrested by the sight of something else a man walking up and down the pavement in front of missus Elton s house He instantly stepped into the shadow of a porch to watch him The figure might be the count s it might not he could not be sure Every now and then the man looked up to the windows At length he stopped right under the lighted one and looked up Hugh was on the point of gliding out that he might get as near him as possible before rushing on him when at the moment to his great mortification a policeman emerged from some mysterious corner and the figure instantly vanished in another Hugh did not pursue him because it would be to set all on a single chance and that a poor one for if the count should it be he succeeded in escaping he would not return to a spot which he knew to be watched Hugh therefore withdrew once more under a porch and waited But whatever might be the cause the man made his appearance no more Hugh contrived to keep watch for two hours in spite of suspicious policemen He slept late into the following morning Calling at missus Elton s he learned that the count had not been there that Miss Cameron had been very ill all night but that she was rather better since the morning That night as the preceding Margaret had awaked suddenly Euphra was not in the bed beside her She started up in an agony of terror but it was soon allayed though not removed She saw Euphra on her knees at the foot of the bed an old fashioned four post one She had her arms twined round one of the bed posts and her head thrown back as if some one were pulling her backwards by her hair which fell over her night dress to the floor in thick black masses Her eyes were closed her face was death like almost livid and the cold dews of torture were rolling down from brow to chin Her lips were moving convulsively with now and then the appearance of an attempt at articulation as if they were set in motion by an agony of inward prayer Margaret unable to move watched her with anxious sympathy and fearful expectation How long this lasted she could not tell but it seemed a long time At length Margaret rose and longing to have some share in the struggle however small went softly and stood behind her shadowing her from a feeble ray of moonlight which through a wind rent cloud had stolen into the room and lay upon her upturned face There she lifted up her heart in prayer In a moment after the tension of Euphra s countenance relaxed a little composure slowly followed her head gradually rose so that Margaret could see her face no longer then as gradually drooped forward Next her arms untwined themselves from the bed post and her hands clasped themselves together She looked like one praying in the intense silence of absorbing devotion Margaret stood still as a statue In speaking about it afterwards to Hugh Margaret told him that she distinctly remembered hearing while she stood the measured steps of a policeman pass the house on the pavement below In a few minutes Euphra bowed her head yet lower and then rose to her feet She turned round towards Margaret as if she knew she was there To Margaret s astonishment her eyes were wide open She smiled a most child like peaceful happy smile and said It is over Margaret all over at last Thank you with my whole heart God has helped me At that moment the moon shone out full and her face appeared in its light like the face of an angel Margaret looked on her with awe Fear distress and doubt had vanished and she was already beautiful like the blessed Margaret got a handkerchief and wiped the cold damps from her face Then she helped her into bed where she fell asleep almost instantly and slept like a child Now and then she moaned but when Margaret looked at her she saw the smile still upon her countenance She woke weak and worn but happy I shall not trouble you to day Margaret dear said she I shall not get up yet but you will not need to watch me A great change has passed upon me I am free I have overcome him He may do as he pleases now I do not care I defy him I got up last night in my sleep but I remember all about it and although I was asleep and felt powerless like a corpse I resisted him even when I thought he was dragging me away by bodily force And I resisted him till he left me alone Thank God It had been a terrible struggle but she had overcome Nor was this all she would no more lead two lives the waking and the sleeping Her waking will and conscience had asserted themselves in her sleeping acts and the memory of the somnambulist lived still in the waking woman Hence her two lives were blended into one life and she was no more two but one This indicated a mighty growth of individual being I woke without terror she went on to say I always used to wake from such a sleep in an agony of unknown fear I do not think I shall ever walk in my sleep again Is not salvation the uniting of all our nature into one harmonious whole God first in us ourselves last and all in due order between Something very much analogous to the change in Euphra takes place in a man when he first learns that his beliefs must become acts that his religious life and his human life are one that he must do the thing that he admires The Ideal is the only absolute Real and it must become the Real in the individual life as well however impossible they may count it who never try it or who do not trust in God to effect it when they find themselves baffled in the attempt In the afternoon Euphra fell asleep and when she woke seemed better She said to Margaret Can it be that it was all a dream Margaret I mean my association with that dreadful man I feel as if it were only some horrid dream and that I could never have had anything to do with him I may have been out of my mind you know and have told you things which I believed firmly enough then but which never really took place It could not have been me Margaret could it Not your real true best self dear I have been a dreadful creature Margaret But I feel that all that has melted away from me and gone behind the sunset which will for ever stand in all its glory and loveliness between me and it an impassable rampart of defence Her words sounded strange and excited but her eye and her pulse were calm How could he ever have had that hateful power over me Don t think any more about him dear but enjoy the rest God has given you I will I will At that moment a maid came to the door with Funkelstein s card for Miss Cameron Very well said Margaret ask him to wait I will tell Miss Cameron She may wish to send him a message You may go She told Euphra that the count was in the house Euphra showed no surprise no fear no annoyance Will you see him for me Margaret if you don t mind and tell him from me that I defy him that I do not hate him only because I despise and forget him that I challenge him to do his worst She had forgotten all about the ring But Margaret had not I will said she and left the room On her way down she went into the drawing room and rang the bell Send mister Irwan to me here please It is for Miss Cameron The man went but presently returned saying that the butler had just stepped out Very well You will do just as well When the gentleman leaves who is calling now you must follow him Take a cab if necessary and follow him everywhere till you find where he stops for the night Watch the place and send me word where you are But don t let him know Put on plain clothes please as fast as you can Yes Miss directly The servants all called Margaret Miss She lingered yet a little to give the man time She was not at all satisfied with her plan but she could think of nothing better Happily it was not necessary Irwan had run as fast as his old legs would carry him to the Golden Staff Hugh received the news with delight His heart seemed to leap into his throat and he felt just as he did when deer stalking for the first time he tried to take aim at a great red stag I shall wait for him outside the door We must have no noise in the house He is a thief or worse Irwan Good gracious And there s the plate all laid out for dinner on the sideboard exclaimed Irwan and hurried off faster than he had come But Hugh was standing at the door long before Irwan got up to it Had Margaret known who was watching outside it would have been a wonderful relief to her She entered the dining room where the count stood impatient He advanced quickly acting on his expectation of Euphra but seeing his mistake stopped and bowed politely Margaret told him that Miss Cameron was ill and gave him her message word for word The count turned pale with mortification and rage He bit his lip made no reply and walked out into the hall where Irwan stood with the handle of the door in his hand impatient to open it No sooner was he out of the house than Hugh sprang upon him but the count who had been perfectly upon his guard eluded him and darted off down the street Hugh pursued at full speed mortified at his escape He had no fear at first of overtaking him for he had found few men his equals in speed and endurance but he soon saw to his dismay that the count was increasing the distance between them and feared that by a sudden turn into some labyrinth he might escape him altogether They passed the Golden Staff at full speed and at the next corner Hugh discovered what gave the count the advantage it was his agility and recklessness in turning corners But like the sorcerer s impunity they failed him at last for at the next turn he ran full upon Falconer who staggered back while the count reeled and fell Hugh was upon him in a moment Help roared the count for a last chance from the sympathies of a gathering crowd I ve got him cried Hugh Let the man alone growled a burly fellow in the crowd with his fists clenched in his trowser pockets Let me have a look at him said Falconer stooping over him Ah I don t know him That s as well for him Let him up Sutherland The bystanders took Falconer for a detective and did not seem inclined to interfere all except the carman before mentioned He came up pushing the crowd right and left Let the man alone said he in a very offensive tone I assure you said Falconer he s not worth your trouble for None o your cursed jaw said the fellow in a louder and deeper growl approaching Falconer with a threatening mien Well I can t help it said Falconer as if to himself Sutherland look after the count That I will said Hugh confidently Falconer turned on the carman who was just on the point of closing with him preferring that mode of fighting and saying only Defend yourself retreated a step The man was good at his fists too and having failed in his first attempt made the best use of them he could But he had no chance with Falconer whose coolness equalled his skill Meantime the Bohemian had been watching his chance and although the contest certainly did not last longer than one minute found opportunity in the middle of it to wrench himself free from Hugh trip him up and dart off The crowd gave way before him He vanished so suddenly and completely that it was evident he must have studied the neighbourhood from the retreat side of the question With rat like instinct he had consulted the holes and corners in anticipation of the necessity of applying to them Hugh got up and directed or possibly misdirected by the bystanders sped away in pursuit but he could hear or see nothing of the fugitive At the end of the minute the carman lay in the road Look after him somebody said Falconer No fear of him sir he s used to it answered one of the bystanders with the respect which Falconer s prowess claimed Falconer walked after Hugh who soon returned looking excessively mortified and feeling very small indeed Never mind Sutherland said he The fellow is up to a trick or two but we shall catch him yet If it hadn t been for that big fool there but he s punished enough But what can we do next He will not come here again Very likely not Still he may not give up his attempts upon Miss Cameron I almost wonder seeing she is so impressible that she can give no account of his whereabouts But I presume clairvoyance depends on the presence of other qualifications as well I should like to mesmerize her myself and see whether she could not help us then Well why not if you have the power Because I have made up my mind not to superinduce any condition of whose laws I am so very partially informed Besides I consider it a condition of disease in which as by sleeplessness for instance the senses of the soul if you will allow the expression are for its present state rendered unnaturally acute To induce such a condition I dare not exercise a power which itself I do not understand CHAPTER XIX MARGARET For though that ever virtuous was she She was increased in such excellence Of thewes good yset in high bounte And so discreet and fair of eloquence So benign and so digne of reverence And couthe so the poeple s hert embrace That each her loveth that looketh in her face CHAUCER The Clerk s Tale Hugh returned to missus Elton s and in the dining room wrote a note to Euphra to express his disappointment and shame that after all the count had foiled him but at the same time his determination not to abandon the quest till there was no room for hope left He sent this up to her and waited thinking that she might be on the sofa and might send for him A little weary from the reaction of the excitement he had just gone through he sat down in the corner farthest from the door The large room was dimly lighted by one untrimmed lamp He sat for some time thinking that Euphra was writing him a note or perhaps preparing herself to see him in her room Involuntarily he looked up and a sudden pang as at the vision of the disembodied shot through his heart A dim form stood in the middle of the room gazing earnestly at him He saw the same face which he had seen for a moment in the library at Arnstead the glorified face of Margaret Elginbrod shimmering faintly in the dull light Instinctively he pressed his hands together palm to palm as if he had been about to kneel before Madonna herself Delight mingled with hope and tempered by shame flushed his face Ghost or none she brought no fear with her only awe She stood still Margaret he said with trembling voice mister Sutherland she responded sweetly Are you a ghost Margaret She smiled as if she were all spirit and advancing slowly took his joined hands in both of hers Forgive me Margaret sighed he as if with his last breath and burst into an agony of tears She waited motionless till his passion should subside still holding his hands He felt that her hands were so good He is dead said Hugh at last with all effort followed by a fresh outburst of weeping Yes he is dead rejoined Margaret calmly You would not weep so if you had seen him die as I did die with a smile like a summer sunset Indeed it was the sunset to me but the moon has been up for a long time now She sighed a gentle painless sigh and smiled again like a saint She spoke nearly as Scotch as ever in tone though the words and pronunciation were almost pure English This lapse into so much of the old form or rather garment of speech constantly recurred as often as her feelings were moved and especially when she talked to children Forgive me said Hugh once more We are the same as in the old days answered Margaret and Hugh was satisfied How do you come to be here said Hugh at last after a silence I will tell you all about that another time Now I must give you Miss Cameron s message She is very sorry she cannot see you but she is quite unable Indeed she is not out of bed But if you could call to morrow morning she hopes to be better and to be able to see you She says she can never thank you enough The lamp burned yet fainter Margaret went and proceeded to trim it The virgins that arose must have looked very lovely trimming their lamps It is a deed very fair and womanly the best for a woman to make the lamp burn The light shone up in her face and the hands removing the globe handled it delicately He saw that the good hands were very beautiful hands not small but admirably shaped and very pure As she replaced the globe That man she said will not trouble her any more I hope not said Hugh but you speak confidently why Because she has behaved gloriously She has fought and conquered him on his own ground and she is a free beautiful and good creature of God for ever You delight me rejoined Hugh Another time perhaps you will be able to tell me all about it I hope so I think she will not mind my telling you They bade each other good night and Hugh went away with a strange feeling which he had never experienced before To compare great things with small it was something like what he had once felt in a dream in which digging in his father s garden he had found a perfect marble statue young as life and yet old as the hills To think of the girl he had first seen in the drawing room at Turriepuffit idealizing herself into such a creature as that so grand and yet so womanly so lofty and yet so lovely so strong and yet so graceful Would that every woman believed in the ideal of herself and hoped for it as the will of God not merely as the goal of her own purest ambition But even if the lower development of the hope were all she possessed it would yet be well for its inevitable failure would soon develope the higher and triumphant hope He thought about her till he fell asleep and dreamed about her till he woke Not for a moment however did he fancy he was in love with her the feeling was different from any he had hitherto recognized as embodying that passion It was the recognition and consequent admiration of a beauty which everyone who beheld it must recognize and admire but mingled in his case with old and precious memories doubly dear now in the increased earnestness of his nature and aspirations and with a deep personal interest from the fact that however little he had yet contributed a portion of the vital food whereby the gracious creature had become what she was In the so called morning he went to missus Elton s Euphra was expecting his visit and he was shown up into her room where she was lying on a couch by the fire She received him with the warmth of gratitude added to that of friendship Her face was pale and thin but her eyes were brilliant She did not appear at first sight to be very ill but the depth and reality of her sickness grew upon him Behind her couch stood Margaret like a guardian angel Margaret could bear the day for she belonged to it and therefore she looked more beautiful still than by the lamp light Euphra held out a pale little hand to Hugh and before she withdrew it led Hugh s towards Margaret Their hands joined How different to Hugh was the touch of the two hands Life strength persistency in the one languor feebleness and fading in the other I can never thank you enough said Euphra therefore I will not try It is no bondage to remain your debtor That would be thanks indeed if I had done anything I have found out another mystery Euphra resumed after a pause I am sorry to hear it answered he I fear there will be no mysteries left by and by No fear of that she rejoined so long as the angels come down to men And she turned towards Margaret as she spoke Margaret smiled In the compliment she felt only the kindness Hugh looked at her She turned away and found something to do at the other side of the room What mystery then have you destroyed Not destroyed it for the mystery of courage remains I was the wicked ghost that night in the Ghost s Walk you know the white one there is the good ghost the nun the black one Who Margaret Yes indeed She has just been confessing it to me I had my two angels as one whose fate was undetermined my evil angel in the count my good angel in Margaret Little did I think then that the holy powers were watching me in her I knew the evil one I knew nothing of the good I suppose it is so with a great many people Hugh sat silent in astonishment Margaret then had been at Arnstead with missus Elton all the time It was herself he had seen in the study Did you suspect me Margaret resumed Euphra turning towards her where she sat at the window Not in the least I only knew that something was wrong about the house that some being was terrifying the servants and poor Harry and I resolved to do my best to meet it especially if it should be anything of a ghostly kind Then you do believe in such appearances said Hugh I have never met anything of the sort yet I don t know And you were not afraid Not much I am never really afraid of anything Why should I be No justification of fear was suggested either by Hugh or by Euphra They felt the dignity of nature that lifted Margaret above the region of fear Come and see me again soon said Euphra as Hugh rose to go He promised Next day he dined by invitation with missus Elton and Harry Euphra was unable to see him but sent a kind message by Margaret as he was taking his leave He had been fearing that he should not see Margaret and when she did appear he was the more delighted but the interview was necessarily short He called the next day and saw neither Euphra nor Margaret She was no better missus Elton said the physicians could discover no definite disease either of the lungs or of any other organ Yet life seemed sinking Margaret thought that the conflict which she had passed through had exhausted her vitality that had she yielded she might have lived a slave but that now perhaps she must die a free woman Her continued illness made Hugh still more anxious to find the ring for he knew it would please her much Falconer would have applied to the police but he feared that the man would vanish from London upon the least suspicion that he was watched They held many consultations on the subject CHAPTER XX A NEW GUIDE Das Denken ist nur ein Traum des Fuhlens ein erstorbenes Fuhlen ein blass graues schwaches Leben Thinking is only a dream of feeling a dead feeling a pale grey feeble life NOVALIS Die Lehrlinge zu Sais For where s no courage there s no ruth nor mone Faerie Queene vi seven eighteen One morning as soon as she waked Euphra said Have I been still all the night Margaret Quite still Why do you ask Because I have had such a strange and vivid dream that I feel as if I must have been to the place It was a foolish question though because of course you would not have let me go I hope it did not trouble you much No not much for though I was with the count I did not seem to be there in the body at all only somehow near him and seeing him I can recall the place perfectly Do you think it really was the place he was in at the time I should not wonder But now I feel so free so far beyond him and all his power that I don t mind where or when I see him He cannot hurt me now Could you describe the place to mister Sutherland It might help him to find the count That s a good idea Will you send for him Yes certainly May I tell him for what By all means Margaret wrote to Hugh at once and sent the note by hand He was at home when it arrived He hurriedly answered it and went to find Falconer To his delight he was at home not out of bed in fact Read that Who is it from Miss Cameron s maid It does not look like a maid s production It is though Will you come with me You know London ten thousand times better than I do I don t think we ought to lose a chance Certainly not I will go with you But perhaps she will not see me Oh yes she will when I have told her about you It will be rather a trial to see a stranger A man cannot be a stranger with you ten minutes if he only looks at you still less a woman Falconer looked pleased and smiled I am glad you think so Let us go When they arrived Margaret came to them Hugh told her that Falconer was his best friend and one who knew London perhaps better than any other man in it Margaret looked at him full in the face for a moment Falconer smiled at the intensity of her still gaze Margaret returned the smile and said I will ask Miss Cameron to see ye Thank you was all Falconer s reply but the tone was more than speech After a little while they were shown up to Euphra s room She had wanted to sit up but Margaret would not let her so she was lying on her couch When Falconer was presented to her he took her hand and held it for a moment A kind of indescribable beam broke over his face as if his spirit smiled and the smile shone through without moving one of his features as it passed The tears stood in his eyes To understand all this look one would need to know his history as I do He laid her hand gently on her bosom and said God bless you Euphra felt that God did bless her in the very words She had been looking at Falconer all the time It was only fifteen seconds or so but the outcome of a life was crowded into Falconer s side of it and the confidence of Euphra rose to meet the faithfulness of a man of God What words those are A man of God Have I not written a revelation Yes to him who can read it yes I know enough of your story Miss Cameron he said to understand without any preface what you choose to tell me Euphra began at once I dreamed last night that I found myself outside the street door I did not know where I was going but my feet seemed to know They carried me round two or three corners into a wide long street which I think was Oxford street They carried me on into London far beyond any quarter I knew All I can tell further is that I turned to the left beside a church on the steeple of which stood what I took for a wandering ghost just lighted there only I ought to tell you that frequently in my dreams always in my peculiar dreams the more material and solid and ordinary things are the more thin and ghostly they appear to me Then I went on and on turning left and right too many times for me to remember till at last I came to a little old fashioned court with two or three trees in it I had to go up a few steps to enter it I was not afraid because I knew I was dreaming and that my body was not there It is a great relief to feel that sometimes for it is often very much in the way I opened a door upon which the moon shone very bright and walked up two flights of stairs into a back room And there I found him doing something at a table by candlelight He had a sheet of paper before him but what he was doing with it I could not see I tried hard but it was of no use The dream suddenly faded and I awoke and found Margaret Then I knew I was safe she added with a loving glance at her maid Falconer rose I know the place you mean perfectly he said It is too peculiar to be mistaken Last night let me see how did the moon shine Yes I shall be able to tell the very door I think or almost How kind of you not to laugh at me I might make a fool of myself if I laughed at any one So I generally avoid it We may as well get the good out of what we do not understand or at least try if there be any in it Will you come Sutherland Hugh rose and took his leave with Falconer How pleased she seemed with you Falconer said he as they left the house Yes she touched me Won t you go and see her again No there is no need except she sends for me It would please her comfort her I am sure She has got one of God s angels beside her Sutherland She doesn t want me What do you mean I mean that maid of hers A pang of jealousy was it shot through Hugh s heart How could he see what right had he to see anything in Margaret Hugh might have kept himself at peace even if he had loved Margaret as much as she deserved which would have been about ten times as much as he did Is a man not to recognize an angel when he sees her and to call her by her name Had Hugh seen into the core of that grand heart what form sat there and how he would have been at peace would almost have fallen down to do the man homage He was silent My dear fellow said Falconer as if he divined his feeling for Falconer s power over men and women came all from sympathy with their spirits and not their nerves if you have any hold of that woman do not lose it for as sure as there s a sun in heaven she is one of the winged ones Don t I know a woman when I see her He sighed with a kind of involuntary sigh which yet did not seek to hide itself from Hugh My dear boy he added laying a stress on the word I am nearly twice your age don t be jealous of me mister Falconer said Hugh humbly forgive me The feeling was involuntary and if you have detected in it more than I was aware of you are at least as likely to be right as I am But you cannot think more highly of Margaret than I do And yet Hugh did not know half the good of her then that the reader does now Well we had better part now and meet again at night What time shall I come to you Oh about nine I think will do So Hugh went home and tried to turn his thoughts to his story but Euphra Falconer Funkelstein and Margaret persisted in sitting to him the one after the other instead of the heroes and heroines of his tale He was compelled to lay it aside and betake himself to a stroll and a pipe As he went down stairs he met Miss Talbot You re soon tired of home mister Sutherland You haven t been in above half an hour and you re out again already Why you see Miss Talbot I want a pipe very much Well you ain t going to the public house to smoke it are you No answered Hugh laughing But you know Miss Talbot you made it part of the agreement that I shouldn t smoke indoors So I m going to smoke in the street Now think of being taken that way retorted Miss Talbot with an injured air Why that was before I knew anything about you Go up stairs directly and smoke your pipe and when the room can t hold any more you can open the windows Your smoke won t do any harm mister Sutherland But I m very sorry you quarrelled with missus Appleditch She s a hard woman and over fond of her money and her drawing room and for those boys of hers the Lord have mercy on them for she has none But she s a true Christian for all that and does a power of good among the poor people What does she give them Miss Talbot Oh she gives them hm m tracts and things You know she added perceiving the weakness of her position people s souls should come first And poor missus Appleditch you see some folks is made stickier than others and their money sticks to them somehow that they can t part with it poor woman To this Hugh had no answer at hand for though Miss Talbot s logic was more than questionable her charity was perfectly sound and Hugh felt that he had not been forbearing enough with the mother of the future pastors So he went back to his room lighted his pipe and smoked till he fell asleep over a small volume of morbid modern divinity which Miss Talbot had lent him I do not mention the name of the book lest some of my acquaintance should abuse me and others it more than either deserves Hugh however found the best refuge from the diseased self consciousness which it endeavoured to rouse and which is a kind of spiritual somnambulism in an hour of God s good sleep into a means of which the book was temporarily elevated When he woke he found himself greatly refreshed by the influence it had exercised upon him It was now the hour for the daily pretence of going to dine So he went out But all he had was some bread which he ate as he walked about Loitering here and trifling there passing five minutes over a volume on every bookstall in Holborn and comparing the shapes of the meerschaums in every tobacconist s window time ambled gently along with him and it struck nine just as he found himself at Falconer s door You are ready then said Falconer Quite Will you take anything before you go I think we had better have some supper first It is early for our project This was a welcome proposal to Hugh Cold meat and ale were excellent preparatives for what might be required of him for a tendency to collapse in a certain region called by courtesy the chest is not favourable to deeds of valour By the time he had spent ten minutes in the discharge of the agreeable duty suggested he felt himself ready for anything that might fall to his lot The friends set out together and under the guidance of the two foremost bumps upon Falconer s forehead soon arrived at the place he judged to be that indicated by Euphra It was very different from the place Hugh had pictured to himself Yet in everything it corresponded to her description Are we not great fools Sutherland to set out on such a chase with the dream of a sick girl for our only guide I am sure you don t think so else you would not have gone I think we can afford the small risk to our reputation involved in the chase of this same wild goose There is enough of strange testimony about things of the sort to justify us in attending to the hint Besides if we neglected it it would be mortifying to find out some day perhaps a hundred years after this that it was a true hint It is altogether different from giving ourselves up to the pursuit of such things But this ought to be the house he added going up to one that had a rather more respectable look than the rest He knocked at the door An elderly woman half opened it and looked at them suspiciously Will you take my card to the foreign gentleman who is lodging with you and say I am happy to wait upon him said Falconer She glanced at him again and turned inwards hesitating whether to leave the door half open or not Falconer stood so close to it however that she was afraid to shut it in his face Now Sutherland follow me whispered Falconer as soon as the woman had disappeared on the stair Hugh followed behind the moving tower of his friend who strode with long noiseless strides till he reached the stair That he took three steps at a time They went up two flights and reached the top just as the woman was laying her hand on the lock of the back room door She turned and faced them Speak one word said Falconer in a hissing whisper and He completed the sentence by an awfully threatening gesture She drew back in terror and yielded her place at the door Come in bawled some one in second answer to the knock she had already given It is he said Hugh trembling with excitement Hush said Falconer and went in Hugh followed He knew the back of the count at once He was seated at a table apparently writing but going nearer they saw that he was drawing A single closer glance showed them the portrait of Euphra growing under his hand In order to intensify his will and concentrate it upon her he was drawing her portrait from memory But at the moment they caught sight of it the wretch aware of a hostile presence sprang to his feet and reached the chimney piece at one bound whence he caught up a sword Take care Falconer cried Hugh that weapon is poisoned He is no every day villain you have to deal with He remembered the cat Funkelstein made a sudden lunge at Hugh his face pale with hatred and anger But a blow from Falconer s huge fist travelling faster than the point of his weapon stretched him on the floor Such was Falconer s impetus that it hurled both him and the table across the fallen villain Falconer was up in a moment Not so Funkelstein There was plenty of time for Hugh to secure the rapier and for Falconer to secure its owner before he came to himself Where s my ring said Hugh the moment he opened his eyes Gentlemen I protest began Funkelstein in a voice upon which the cord that bound his wrists had an evident influence No chaff said Falconer We ve got all our feathers Hand over the two rings or be the security for them yourself What witness have you against me The best of witnesses Miss Cameron And me added Hugh Gentlemen I am very sorry I yielded to temptation I meant to restore the diamond after the joke had been played out but I was forced to part with it The joke is played out you see said Falconer So you had better produce the other bauble you stole at the same time I have not got it Come come that s too much Nobody would give you more than five shillings for it And you knew what it was worth when you took it Sutherland you stand over him while I search the room This portrait may as well be put out of the way first As he spoke Falconer tore the portrait and threw it into the fire He then turned to a cupboard in the room Whether it was that Funkelstein feared further revelations I do not know but he quailed I have not got it he repeated however You lie answered Falconer I would give it you if I could You shall The Bohemian looked contemptible enough now despite the handsomeness of his features It needed freedom and the absence of any urgency to enable him to personate a gentleman Given those conditions he succeeded But as soon as he was disturbed the gloss vanished and the true nature came out that of a ruffian and a sneak He quite quivered at the look with which Falconer turned again to the cupboard Stop he cried here it is And muttering what sounded like curses he pulled out of his bosom the ring suspended from his neck Sutherland said Falconer taking the ring secure that rapier and be careful with it We will have its point tested Meantime here he turned again to his prisoner I give you warning that the moment I leave this house I go to Scotland Yard Do you know the place I there recommend the police to look after you and they will mind what I say If you leave London a message will be sent wherever you go that you had better be watched My advice to you is to stay where you are as long as you can I shall meet you again They left him on the floor to the care of his landlady whom they found outside the room speechless with terror As soon as they were in the square on which the moon was now shining as it had shone in Euphra s dream the night before Falconer gave the ring to Hugh Take it to a jeweller s Sutherland and get it cleaned before you give it to Miss Cameron I will answered Hugh and added I don t know how to thank you Then don t said Falconer with a smile When they reached the end of the street he turned and bade Hugh good night Take care of that cowardly thing It may be as you say Hugh turned towards home Falconer dived into a court and was out of sight in a moment CHAPTER XXI THE LAST GROAT Thou hast been As one in suffering all that suffers nothing A man that fortune s buffets and rewards Hast ta en with equal thanks and blessed are those Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled That they are not a pipe for fortune s finger To sound what stop she please Hamlet Most friends befriend themselves with friendship s show SOUTHWELL Hugh took the ring to missus Elton s and gave it into Margaret s hand She brought him back a message of warmest thanks from Euphra She had asked for writing materials at once and was now communicating the good news to mister Arnold in Madeira I have never seen her look so happy added Margaret She hopes to be able to see you in the evening if you would not mind calling again Hugh did call and saw her She received him most kindly He was distressed to see how altered she was The fire of one life seemed dying out flowing away and spending from her eyes which it illuminated with too much light as it passed out But the fire of another life the immortal life which lies in thought and feeling in truth and love divine which death cannot touch because it is not of his kind was growing as fast He sat with her for an hour and then went This chapter of his own history concluded Hugh returned with fresh energy to his novel and worked at it as his invention gave him scope There was the more necessity that he should make progress from the fact that having sent his mother the greater part of the salary he had received from mister Arnold he was now reduced to his last sovereign Poverty looks rather ugly when she comes so close as this But she had not yet accosted him and with a sovereign in his pocket and last week s rent paid a bachelor is certainly not poverty stricken at least when he is as independent not only of other people but of himself as Hugh was Still without more money than that a man walks in fetters and is ready to forget that the various restraints he is under are not incompatible with most honourable freedom So Hugh worked as hard as he could to finish his novel and succeeded within a week Then the real anxiety began He carried it with much doubtful hope to one of the principal publishing houses Had he been more selfishly wise he would have put it into the hands of Falconer to negotiate for him But he thought he had given him quite trouble enough already So he went without an introduction even The manuscript was received politely and attention was promised But a week passed and another and another A human soul was in commotion about the meat that perisheth and the manuscript lay all the time unread forgotten in a drawer At length he reached his last coin He had had no meat for several days except once that he dined at missus Elton s But he would not borrow till absolutely compelled and sixpence would keep him alive another day In the morning he had some breakfast for he knew his books were worth enough to pay all he owed Miss Talbot and then he wandered out Through the streets he paced and paced looking in at all the silversmiths and printsellers windows and solacing his poverty with a favourite amusement of his in uneasy circumstances an amusement cheap enough for a Scotchman reduced to his last sixpence castle building This is not altogether a bad employment where hope has laid the foundation but it is rather a heartless one where the imagination has to draw the ground plan as well as the elevations The latter however was not quite Hugh s condition yet He returned at night carefully avoiding the cook shops and their kindred snares with a silver groat in his pocket still But he crawled up stairs rather feebly it must be confessed for a youth with limbs moulded in the fashion of his He found a letter waiting him from a friend of his mother informing him that she was dangerously ill and urging him to set off immediately for home This was like the blast of fiery breath from the dragon s maw which overthrew the Red cross knight but into the well of life where all his wounds were healed and and well board and lodging provided him gratis When he had read the letter he fell on his knees and said to his father in heaven What am I to do There was no lake with golden pieces in its bottom whence a fish might bring him a coin Nor in all the wide London lay there one he could claim as his but the groat in his pocket He rose with the simple resolution to go and tell Falconer He went He was not at home Emboldened by necessity Hugh left his card with the words on it Come to me I need you He then returned packed a few necessaries and sat down to wait But he had not sat five minutes before Falconer entered What s the matter Sutherland my dear fellow You haven t pricked yourself with that skewer have you Hugh handed him the letter with one hand and when he had read it held out the fourpenny piece in the other hand to be read likewise Falconer understood at once Sutherland he said in a tone of reproof it is a shame of you to forget that men are brothers Are not two who come out of the heart of God as closely related as if they had lain in the womb of one mother Why did you not tell me You have suffered I am sure you have I have a little Hugh confessed I am getting rather low in fact I haven t had quite enough to eat He said this to excuse the tears which Falconer s kindness not hunger compelled from their cells But he added I would have come to you as soon as the fourpence was gone or at least if I hadn t got another before I was very hungry again Good heavens exclaimed Falconer half angrily Then pulling out his watch We have two hours said he before a train starts for the north Come to my place Hugh rose and obeyed Falconer s attendant soon brought them a plentiful supper from a neighbouring shop after which Falconer got out one of his bottles of port well known to his more intimate friends and Hugh thought no more about money than if he had had his purse full If it had not been for anxiety about his mother he would have been happier than he had ever been in his life before For crossing in the night the wavering heaving morass of the world had he not set his foot upon one spot which did not shake the summit indeed of a mighty Plutonic rock that went down widening away to the very centre of the earth As he sped along in the railway that night the prophecy of thousands of years came back A man shall be a hiding place from the wind a covert from the tempest the shadow of a great rock in a weary land And he thought it would be a blessed time indeed when this was just what a man was And then he thought of the Son of Man who by being such first was enabling all his friends to be such too Of him Falconer had already learned this truth in the inward parts and had found in the process of learning it that this was the true nature which God had made his from the first no new thing superinduced upon it He had had but to clear away the rubbish of worldliness which more or less buries the best natures for a time and so to find himself After Hugh had eaten and drunk and thus once more experienced the divinity that lay in food and wine he went to take leave of his friends at missus Elton s Like most invalids Euphra was better in the evening she requested to see him He found her in bed and much wasted since he saw her last He could not keep the tears from filling his eyes for all the events of that day had brought them near the surface Do not cry dear friend she said sweetly There is no room for me here any more and I am sent for Hugh could not reply She went on I have written to mister Arnold about the ring and all you did to get it Do you know he is going to marry Lady Emily Still Hugh could not answer Margaret stood on the other side of the bed the graceful embodiment of holy health and in his sorrow he could not help feeling the beauty of her presence Her lovely hands were the servants of Euphra and her light firm feet moved only in ministration He felt that Euphra had room in the world while Margaret waited on her It is not house and fire and plenty of servants and all the things that money can procure that make a home not father or mother or friends but one heart which will not be weary of helping will not be offended with the petulance of sickness nor the ministrations needful to weakness this entire affection hating nicer hands will make a home of a cave in a rock or a gipsy s tent This Euphra had in Margaret and Hugh saw it I trust you will find your mother better Hugh said Euphra I fear not answered he Well Margaret has been teaching me and I think I have learned it that death is not at all such a dreadful thing as it looks I said to her It is easy for you Margaret who are so far from death s door But she told me that she had been all but dead once and that you had saved her life almost with your own Oh Hugh she is such a dear Euphra smiled with ten times the fascination of any of her old smiles for the soul of the smile was love I shall never see you again I daresay she went on My heart thanks you from its very depths for your goodness to me It has been a thousand times more than I deserve Hugh kissed in silence the wasted hand held out to him in adieu and departed And the world itself was a sad wandering star Falconer had called for him They drove to Miss Talbot s where Hugh got his bag of needments and bade his landlady good bye for a time Falconer then accompanied him to the railway Having left him for a moment Falconer rejoined him saying I have your ticket and put him into a first class carriage Hugh remonstrated Falconer replied I find this hulk of mine worth taking care of You will be twice the good to your mother if you reach her tolerably fresh He stood by the carriage door talking to him till the train started walked alongside till it was fairly in motion then bidding him good bye left in his hand a little packet which Hugh opening it by the light of the lamp found to consist of a few sovereigns and a few shillings folded up in a twenty pound note I ought to tell one other little fact however Just before the engine whistled Falconer said to Hugh Give me that fourpenny piece you brave old fellow There it is said Hugh What do you want it for I am going to make a wedding present of it to your wife whoever she may happen to be I hope she will be worthy of it Hugh instantly thought within himself What a wife Margaret would make to Falconer The thought was followed by a pang keen and clear Those who are in the habit of regarding the real and the ideal as essentially and therefore irreconcileably opposed will remark that I cannot have drawn the representation of Falconer faithfully Perhaps the difficulty they will experience in recognizing its truthfulness may spring from the fact that they themselves are un ideal enough to belong to the not small class of strong minded friends whose chief care in performing the part of the rock in the weary land is not to shelter you imprudently They are afraid of weakening your constitution by it especially if it is not strong to begin with so if they do just take off the edge of the tempest with the sharp corners of their sheltering rock for a moment the next they will thrust you out into the rain to get hardy and self denying by being wet to the skin and well blown about The rich easily learn the wisdom of Solomon but are unapt scholars of him who is greater than Solomon It is on the other hand so easy for the poor to help each other that they have little merit in it it is no virtue only a beauty But there are a few rich who rivalling the poor in their own peculiar excellences enter into the kingdom of heaven in spite of their riches and then find that by means of their riches they are made rulers over many cities She to whose memory this book is dedicated is I will not say was one of the noblest of such There are two ways of accounting for the difficulty which a reader may find in believing in such a character either that not being poor he has never needed such a friend or that being rich he has never been such a friend Or if it be that being poor he has never found such a friend his difficulty is easy to remove I have CHAPTER XXII DEATH Think then my soul that death is but a groom Which brings a taper to the outward room Whence thou spy saint first a little glimmering light And after brings it nearer to thy sight For such approaches doth heaven make in death doctor DONNE Hugh found his mother even worse than he had expected but she rallied a little after his arrival In the evening he wandered out in the bright moonlit snow How strange it was to see all the old forms with his heart so full of new things The same hills rose about him with all the lines of their shapes unchanged in seeming Yet they were changing as surely as himself nay he continued more the same than they for in him the old forms were folded up in the new In the eyes of Him who creates time there is no rest but a living sacred change a journeying towards rest He alone rests and he alone in virtue of his rest creates change He thought with sadness how all the haunts of his childhood would pass to others who would feel no love or reverence for them that the house would be the same but sounding with new steps and ringing with new laughter A little further thought however soon satisfied him that places die as well as their dwellers that by slow degrees their forms are wiped out that the new tastes obliterate the old fashions and that ere long the very shape of the house and farm would be lapped as it were about the tomb of him who had been the soul of the shape and would vanish from the face of the earth All the old things at home looked sad The look came from this that though he could sympathize with them and their story they could not sympathize with him and he suffused them with his own sadness He could find no refuge in the past he must go on into the future His mother lingered for some time without any evident change He sat by her bedside the most of the day All she wanted was to have him within reach of her feeble voice that she might when she pleased draw him within touch of her feeble hand Once she said My boy I am going to your father Yes mother I think you are Hugh replied How glad he will be to see you But I shall leave you alone Mother I love God The mother looked at him as only a mother can look smiled sweetly closed her eyes as with the weight of her contentment fell asleep holding his hand and slept for hours Meanwhile in London Margaret was watching Euphra She was dying and Margaret was the angel of life watching over her I shall get rid of my lameness there Margaret shall I not said Euphra one day half playfully Yes dear It will be delightful to walk again without pain Perhaps you will not get rid of it all at once though Why do you think so asked Euphra with some appearance of uneasiness Because if it is taken from you before you are quite willing to have it as long as God pleases by and by you will not be able to rest till you have asked for it back again that you may bear it for his sake I am willing Margaret I am willing Only one can t like it you know I know that answered Margaret She spoke no more and Margaret heard her weeping gently Half an hour had passed away when she looked up and said Margaret dear I begin to like my lameness I think Why dear Why just because God made it and bade me bear it May I not think it is a mark on me from his hand Yes I think so Why do you think it came on me To walk back to Him with dear Yes yes I see it all Until now Margaret had not known to what a degree the lameness of Euphra had troubled her That her pretty ankle should be deformed and her light foot able only to limp had been a source of real distress to her even in the midst of far deeper The days passed on and every day she grew weaker She did not suffer much but nothing seemed to do her good missus Elton was kindness itself Harry was in dreadful distress He haunted her room creeping in whenever he had a chance and sitting in corners out of the way Euphra liked to have him near her She seldom spoke to him or to any one but Margaret for Margaret alone could hear with ease what she said But now and then she would motion him to her bedside and say it was always the same Harry dear be good I will indeed I will dear Euphra was still Harry s reply Once expressing to Margaret her regret that she should be such a trouble to her she said You have to do so much for me that I am ashamed Do let me wash the feet of one of his disciples Margaret replied gently expostulating after which Euphra never grumbled at her own demands upon her Again one day she said I am not right at all to day Margaret God can t love me I am so hateful Don t measure God s mind by your own Euphra It would be a poor love that depended not on itself but on the feelings of the person loved A crying baby turns away from its mother s breast but she does not put it away till it stops crying She holds it closer For my part in the worst mood I am ever in when I don t feel I love God at all I just look up to his love I say to him Look at me See what state I am in Help me Ah you would wonder how that makes peace And the love comes of itself sometimes so strong it nearly breaks my heart But there is a text I don t like Take another then But it will keep coming Give it back to God and never mind it But would that be right One day when I was a little girl so high I couldn t eat my porridge and sat looking at it Eat your porridge said my mother I don t want it I answered There s nothing else for you said my mother for she had not learned so much from my father then as she did before he died Hoots said my father I cannot dear Euphra make his words into English No no don t said Euphra I shall understand them perfectly Hoots Janet my woman said my father Gie the bairn a dish o tay Wadna ye like some tay Maggy my doo Ay wad I said I The parritch is guid eneuch said my mother Nae doot aboot the parritch woman it s the bairn s stamack it s no the parritch My mother said no more but made me a cup of such nice tea for whenever she gave in she gave in quite I drank it and half from anxiety to please my mother half from reviving hunger attacked the porridge next and ate it up Leuk at that said my father Janet my woman gie a body the guid that they can tak an they ll sune tak the guid that they canna Ye re better noo Maggy my doo I never told him that I had taken the porridge too soon after all and had to creep into the wood and be sick But it is all the same for the story Euphra laughed a feeble but delighted laugh and applied the story for herself So the winter days passed on I wish I could live till the spring said Euphra I should like to see a snowdrop and a primrose again Perhaps you will dear but you are going into a better spring I could almost envy you Euphra But shall we have spring there I think so And spring flowers I think we shall better than here But they will not mean so much Then they won t be so good But I should think they would mean ever so much more and be ever so much more spring like They will be the spring flowers to all winters in one I think Folded in the love of this woman anointed for her death by her wisdom baptized for the new life by her sympathy and its tears Euphra died in the arms of Margaret Margaret wept fell on her knees and gave God thanks missus Elton was so distressed that as soon as the funeral was over she broke up her London household sending some of the servants home to the country and taking some to her favourite watering place to which Harry also accompanied her She hoped that now the affair of the ring was cleared up she might as soon as Hugh returned succeed in persuading him to follow them to Devonshire and resume his tutorship This would satisfy her anxiety about Hugh and Harry both Hugh s mother died too and was buried When he returned from the grave which now held both father and mother he found a short note from Margaret telling him that Euphra was gone Sorrow is easier to bear when it comes upon sorrow but he could not help feeling a keen additional pang when he learned that she was dead whom he had loved once and now loved better Margaret s note informed him likewise that Euphra had left a written request that her diamond ring should be given to him to wear for her sake He prepared to leave the home whence all the homeness had now vanished except what indeed lingered in the presence of an old nurse who had remained faithful to his mother to the last The body itself is of little value after the spirit the love is out of it so the house and all the old things are little enough after the loved ones are gone who kept it alive and made it home All that Hugh could do for this old nurse was to furnish a cottage for her out of his mother s furniture giving her everything she liked best Then he gathered the little household treasures the few books the few portraits and ornaments his father s sword and his mother s wedding ring destroyed with sacred fire all written papers sold the remainder of the furniture which he would gladly have burnt too and so proceeded to take his last departure from the home of his childhood CHAPTER XXIII NATURE AND HER LADY Die Frauen sind ein liebliches Geheimniss nur verhullt nicht verschlossen NOVALIS Moralische Ansichten Women are a lovely mystery veiled however not shut up Her twilights were more clear than our mid day She dreamt devoutlier than most used to pray doctor DONNE Perhaps the greatest benefit that resulted to Hugh from being thus made a pilgrim and a stranger in the earth was that Nature herself saw him and took him in Hitherto as I have already said Hugh s acquaintance with Nature had been chiefly a second hand one he knew friends of hers Nature in poetry not in the form of Thomsonian or Cowperian descriptions good as they are but closely interwoven with and expository of human thought and feeling had long been dear to him In this form he had believed that he knew her so well as to be able to reproduce the lineaments of her beloved face But now she herself appeared to him the grand pure tender mother ancient in years yet ever young appeared to him not in the mirror of a man s words but bending over him from the fathomless bosom of the sky from the outspread arms of the forest trees from the silent judgment of the everlasting hills She spoke to him from the depths of air from the winds that harp upon the boughs and trumpet upon the great caverns and from the streams that sing as they go to be lost in rest She would have shone upon him out of the eyes of her infants the flowers but they had their faces turned to her breast now hiding from the pale blue eyes and the freezing breath of old Winter who was looking for them with his face bent close to their refuge And he felt that she had a power to heal and to instruct yea that she was a power of life and could speak to the heart and conscience mighty words about God and Truth and Love For he did not forsake his dead home in haste He lingered over it and roamed about its neighbourhood Regarding all about him with quiet almost passive spirit he was astonished to find how his eyes opened to see nature in the mass Before he had beheld only portions and beauties When or how the change passed upon him he could not tell But he no longer looked for a pretty eyebrow or a lovely lip on the face of nature the soul of nature looked out upon him from the harmony of all guiding him unsought to the discovery of a thousand separate delights while from the expanded vision new meanings flashed upon him every day He beheld in the great All the expression of the thoughts and feelings of the maker of the heavens and the earth and the sea and the fountains of water The powers of the world to come that is the world of unseen truth and ideal reality were upon him in the presence of the world that now is For the first time in his life he felt at home with nature and while he could moan with the wintry wind he no longer sighed in the wintry sunshine that foretold like the far off flutter of a herald s banner the approach of victorious lady spring With the sorrow and loneliness of loss within him and Nature around him seeming to sigh for a fuller expression of the thought that throbbed within her it is no wonder that the form of Margaret the gathering of the thousand forms of nature into one intensity and harmony of loveliness should rise again upon the world of his imagination to set no more Father and mother were gone Margaret remained behind Nature lay around him like a shining disk that needed a visible centre of intensest light a shield of silver that needed but a diamond boss Margaret alone could be that centre that diamond light giver for she alone of all the women he knew seemed so to drink of the sun rays of God as to radiate them forth for very fulness upon the clouded world She had dawned on him like a sweet crescent moon hanging far off in a cold and low horizon now lifting his eyes he saw that same moon nearly at the full and high overhead yet leaning down towards him through the deep blue air that overflowed with her calm triumph of light He knew that he loved her now He knew that every place he went through caught a glimmer of romance the moment he thought of her that every most trifling event that happened to himself looked like a piece of a story book the moment he thought of telling it to her But the growth of these feelings had been gradual so slow and gradual that when he recognized them it seemed to him as if he had felt them from the first The fact was that as soon as he began to be capable of loving Margaret he had begun to love her He had never been able to understand her till he was driven into the desert But now that Nature revealed herself to him full of Life yea of the Life of Life namely of God himself it was natural that he should honour and love that lady of her own that he should recognize Margaret as greater than himself as nearer to the heart of Nature yea of God the father of all She had been one with Nature from childhood and when he began to be one with nature too he must become one with her And now in absence he began to study the character of her whom in presence he had thought he knew perfectly He soon found that it was a Manoa a golden city in a land of Paradise too good to be believed in except by him who was blessed with the beholding of it He knew now that she had always understood what he was only just waking to recognize And he felt that the scholar had been very patient with the stupidity of the master and had drawn from his lessons a nourishment of which he had known nothing himself But dared he think of marrying her a creature inspired with a presence of the Spirit of God which none but the saints enjoy and thence clothed with a garment of beauty which her spirit wove out of its own loveliness She was a being to glorify any man merely by granting him her habitual presence what then if she gave her love She would bring with her the presence of God himself for she walked ever in his light and that light clung to her and radiated from her True many young maidens must be walking in the sunshine of God else whence the light and loveliness and bloom the smile and the laugh of their youth But Margaret not only walked in this light she knew it and whence it came She looked up to its source and it illuminated her face The silent girl of old days whose countenance wore the stillness of an unsunned pool as she listened with reverence to his lessons had blossomed into the calm stately woman before whose presence he felt rebuked he knew not why upon whose face lay slumbering thought ever ready to wake into life and motion Dared he love her Dared he tell her that he loved her Dared he so poor so worthless seek for himself such a world s treasure He might have known that worth does not need honour that its lowliness is content with ascribing it Some of my readers may be inclined to think that I hide for the sake of my hero poor little hero one of God s children learning to walk an inevitable struggle between his love and his pride inasmuch as being but a tutor he might be expected to think the more of his good family and the possibility of his one day coming to honour without the drawback of having done anything to merit it a title being almost within his grasp while Margaret was a ploughman s daughter and a lady s maid But although I know more of Hugh s faults than I have thought it at all necessary to bring out in my story I protest that had he been capable of giving the name of love to a feeling in whose presence pride dared to speak I should have considered him unworthy of my poor pen In plain language I doubt if I should have cared to write his story at all He gathered together as I have said the few memorials of the old ship gone down in the quiet ocean of time paid one visit of sorrowful gladness to his parent s grave over which he raised no futile stone leaving it like the forms within it in the hands of holy decay and took his road whither To Margaret s home to see old Janet and to go once to the grave of his second father Then he would return to the toil and hunger and hope of London What made Hugh go to Turriepuffit His love to Margaret No A better motive even than that Repentance Better I mean for Hugh as to the individual occasion not in itself for love is deeper than repentance seeing that without love there can be no repentance He had repented before but now that he haunted in silence the regions of the past the whole of his history in connection with David returned on him clear and vivid as if passing once again before his eyes and through his heart and he repented more deeply still Perhaps he was not quite so much to blame as he thought himself Perhaps only now was it possible for the seeds of truth which David had sown in his heart to show themselves above the soil of lower yet ministering cares They had needed to lie a winter long in the earth Now the keen blasts and grinding frosts had done their work and they began to grow in the tearful prime Sorrow for loss brought in her train sorrow for wrong a sister more solemn still and with a deeper blessing in the voice of her loving farewell It is a great mistake to suppose that sorrow is a part of repentance It is far too good a grace to come so easily A man may repent that is think better of it and change his way and be very much of a Pharisee I do not say a hypocrite for a long time after it needs a saint to be sorrowful Yet repentance is generally the road to this sorrow And now that in the gracious time of grief his eyesight purified by tears he entered one after another all the chambers of the past he humbly renewed once more his friendship with the noble dead and with the homely heartful living The grey headed man who walked with God like a child and with his fellow men like an elder brother who was always forgetting his birthright and serving the younger the woman who believed where she could not see and loved where she could not understand and the maiden who was still and lustreless because she ever absorbed and seldom reflected the light all came to him as if to comfort him once more in his loneliness when his heart had room for them and need of them yet again David now became after his departure yet more of a father to him than before for that spirit which is the true soul of all this body of things had begun to recall to his mind the words of David and so teach him the things that David knew the everlasting realities of God And it seemed to him the while that he heard David himself uttering in his homely kingly voice whatever truth returned to him from the echo cave of the past Even when a quite new thought arose within him it came to him in the voice of David or at least with the solemn music of his tones clinging about it as the murmur about the river s course Experience had now brought him up to the point where he could begin to profit by David s communion he needed the things which David could teach him and David began forthwith to give them to him That birth of nature in his soul which enabled him to understand and love Margaret helped him likewise to contemplate with admiration and awe the towering peaks of David s hopes trusts and aspirations He had taught the ploughman mathematics but that ploughman had possessed in himself all the essential elements of the grandeur of the old prophets glorified by the faith which the Son of Man did not find in the earth but left behind him to grow in it and which had grown to a noble growth of beauty and strength in this peasant simple and patriarchal in the midst of a self conceited age And oh how good he had been to him He had built a house that he might take him in from the cold and make life pleasant to him as in the presence of God He had given him his heart every time he gave him his great manly hand And this man this friend this presence of Christ Hugh had forsaken neglected all but forgotten He could not go and like the prodigal fall down before him and say Father I have sinned against heaven and thee for that heaven had taken him up out of his sight He could only weep instead and bitterly repent Yes there was one thing more he could do Janet still lived He would go to her and confess his sin and beg her forgiveness Receiving it he would be at peace He knew David forgave him whether he confessed or not and that if he were alive David would seek his confession only as the casting away of the separation from his heart as the banishment of the worldly spirit and as the natural sign by which he might know that Hugh was one with him yet Janet was David s representative on earth he would go to her So he returned rich and great rich in knowing that he was the child of Him to whom all the gold mines belong and great in that humility which alone recognizes greatness and in the beginnings of that meekness which shall inherit the earth No more would he stunt his spiritual growth by self satisfaction No more would he lay aside in the cellars of his mind poor withered bulbs of opinions which but for the evil ministrations of that self satisfaction seeking to preserve them by drying and salting might have been already bursting into blossoms of truth of infinite loveliness He knew that Margaret thought far too well of him honoured him greatly beyond his deserts He would not allow her to be any longer thus deceived He would tell her what a poor creature he was But he would say too that he hoped one day to be worthy of her praise that he hoped to grow to what she thought him If he should fail in convincing her he would receive all the honour she gave him humbly as paid not to him but to what he ought to be God grant it might be as to his future self In this mood he went to Janet CHAPTER XXIV THE FIR WOOD AGAIN Er stand vor der himmlischen Jungfrau Da hob er den leichten glanzenden Schleir und Rosenbluthchen sank in seine Arme Novalis Die Lehrlinge zu Sais He stood before the heavenly Virgin Isis the Goddess of Nature Then lifted he the light shining veil and Rosebud his old love sank into his arms So womanly so benigne and so meek CHAUCER Prol to Leg of Good Women It was with a mingling of strange emotions that Hugh approached the scene of those not very old and yet to his feeling quite early memories The dusk was beginning to gather The hoar frost lay thick on the ground The pine trees stood up in the cold looking in their garment of spikes as if the frost had made them The rime on the gate was unfriendly and chilled his hand He turned into the footpath He saw the room David had built for him Its thatch was one mass of mosses whose colours were hidden now in the cuckoo fruit of the frost Alas how Death had cast his deeper frost over all for the man was gone from the hearth But neither old Winter nor skeleton Death can withhold the feet of the little child Spring She is stronger than both Love shall conquer hate and God will overcome sin He drew nigh to the door trembling It seemed strange to him that his nerves only and not his mind should feel In moments of unusual excitement it sometimes happens that the only consciousness a strong man has of emotion lies in an unwonted physical vibration the mind itself refusing to be disturbed It is however but a seeming the emotion is so deep that consciousness can lay hold of its physical result only The cottage looked the same as ever only the peat stack outside was smaller In the shadowiness of the firs the glimmer of a fire was just discernible on the kitchen window He trembled so much that he could not enter He would go into the fir wood first and see Margaret s tree as he always called it in his thoughts and dreams Very poor and stunted and meagre looked the fir trees of Turriepuffit after the beeches and elms of Arnstead The evening wind whistled keen and cold through their dry needles and made them moan as if because they were fettered and must endure the winter in helpless patience Here and there amongst them rose the Titans of the little forest the huge old contorted wizard like yet benevolent beings the Scotch firs Towards one of these he bent his way It was the one under which he had seen Margaret when he met her first in the wood with her whole soul lost in the waving of its wind swung sun lighted top floating about in the sea of air like a golden nest for some silvery bird of heaven To think that the young girl to whom he had given the primrose he had just found the then first born of the Spring should now be the queen of his heart Her childish dream of the angel haunting the wood had been true only she was the angel herself He drew near the place How well he knew it He seated himself cold as it was in the February of Scotland at the foot of the blessed tree He did not know that it was cold While he sat with his eyes fixed on the ground a light rustle in the fallen leaves made him raise them suddenly It was all winter and fallen leaves about him but he lifted his eyes and in his soul it was summer Margaret stood before him He was not in the least surprised For how can one wonder to see before his eyes the form of which his soul is full there is no shock She stood a little way off looking as if she wanted to be sure before she moved a step She was dressed in a grey winsey gown close to her throat and wrists She had neither shawl nor bonnet Her fine health kept her warm even in a winter wood at sun down She looked just the same at home everywhere most at home in Nature s secret chamber Like the genius of the place she made the winter wood look homely What were the oaks and beeches of Arnstead now Homeliness and glory are Heaven She came nearer Margaret he murmured and would have risen No no sit still she rejoined in a pleading tone I thought it was the angel in the picture Now I know it Sit still dear mister Sutherland one moment more Humbled by his sense of unworthiness and a little distressed that she could so quietly reveal the depth of her feeling towards him he said Ah Margaret I wish you would not praise one so little deserving it Praise she repeated with an accent of wonder I praise you No mister Sutherland that I am not guilty of Next to my father you made me know and feel And as I walked here I was thinking of the old times and older times still and all at once I saw the very picture out of the old Bible She came close to him now He rose trembling but held out no hand uttered no greeting Margaret dare I love you he faltered She looked at him with wide open eyes Me she said and her eyes did not move from his A slight rose flush bloomed out on her motionless face Will you be my wife he said trembling yet more She made no answer but looked at him still with parted lips motionless I am very poor Margaret I could not marry now It was a stupid speech but he made it I don t care she answered with a voice like thinking if you never marry me He misunderstood her and turned cold to the very heart He misunderstood her stillness Her heart lay so deep that it took a long time for its feelings to reach and agitate the surface He said no more but turned away with a sigh Come home to my mother she said He obeyed mechanically and walked in silence by her side They reached the cottage and entered Margaret said Here he is mother and disappeared Janet was seated in her widow s mutch with the plain black ribbon down both sides and round the back in the arm chair by the fire pondering on the past or gently dreaming of him that was gone She turned her head Sorrow had baptized her face with a new gentleness The tender expression which had been but occasional while her husband lived was almost constant now She did not recognize Hugh He saw it and it added weight to his despair He was left outside Mother he said involuntarily She started to her feet cried My bairn my bairn threw her arms around him and laid her head on his bosom Hugh sobbed as if his heart would break Janet wept but her weeping was quiet as a summer rain He led her to her chair knelt by her side and hiding his face in her lap like a child faltered out interrupted by convulsive sobs Forgive me forgive me I don t deserve it but forgive me Hoot awa my bairn my bonny man Dinna greet that gait The Lord preserve s what are ye greetin for Are na ye come hame to yer ain Didna Dawvid aye say Gie the lad time woman It s unco chaip for the Lord s aye makin t The best things is aye the maist plentifu Gie the lad time my bonny woman didna he say

bein An noo ye re come hame an nothing cud glaidden my heart mair cep maybe the Maister himsel was to say to my man Dawvid come furth Hugh could make no reply He got hold of Margaret s creepie which stood in its usual place and sat down upon it at the old woman s feet She gazed in his face for a while and then putting her arm round his neck drew his head to her bosom and fondled him as if he had been her own first born But eh yer bonnie face is sharp an sma to what it used to be Maister Sutherlan I doot ye hae come through a heap o trouble I ll tell you all about it said Hugh Na na bide still a wee I ken a aboot it frae Maggy An guid preserve s ye re clean perished wi cauld Lat me up my bairn Janet rose and made up the fire which soon cast a joyful glow throughout the room The peat fire in the little cottage was a good symbol of the heart of its mistress it gave far more heat than light And for my part dear as light is I like heat better She then put on the kettle or the boiler I think she called it saying I m jist gaein to mak ye a cup o tay mister Sutherlan It s the handiest thing ye ken An I doot ye re muckle in want o something Wad ye no tak a drappy oot o the bottle i the mane time No thank you said Hugh who longed to be alone for his heart was cold as ice I would rather wait for the tea but I should be glad to have a good wash after my journey Come yer wa s than ben the hoose I ll jist gang an get a drappy o het water in a decanter Bide ye still by the fire Hugh stood and gazed into the peat fire But he saw nothing in it A light step passed him several times but he did not heed it The loveliest eyes looked earnestly towards him as they passed but his were not lifted to meet their gaze Noo Maister Sutherlan come this way Hugh was left alone at length in the room where David had slept where David had used to pray He fell on his knees and rose comforted by the will of God A few things of Margaret s were about the room The dress he had seen her in at missus Elton s was hanging by the bed He kissed the folds of the garment and said God s will be done He had just finished a hasty ablution when Janet called him Come awa Maister Sutherlan come ben to yer ain chaumer said she leading the way to the room she still called the study Margaret was there The room was just as he had left it A bright fire was on the hearth Tea was on the table with eggs and oatcakes and flour scones in abundance for Janet had the best she could get for Margaret who was only her guest for a little while But Hugh could not eat Janet looked distressed and Margaret glanced at him uneasily Do eat something mister Sutherland said Margaret Hugh looked at her involuntarily She did not understand his look and it alarmed her His countenance was changed What is the matter dear Hugh she said rising and laying her hand on his shoulder Hoots lassie broke in her mother are ye makin love till a man a gentleman afore my verra een He did it first mother answered Margaret with a smile A pang of hope shot through Hugh s heart Ow that s the gait o t is t The bairn s gane dementit Ye re no efter merryin a gentleman Maggy Na na lass So saying the old lady rather crossly and very imprudently left the room to fill the teapot in the kitchen Do you remember this said Margaret who felt that Hugh must have misunderstood something or other taking from her pocket a little book and from the book a withered flower Hugh saw that it was like a primrose and hoped against hope that it was the one which he had given to her on the spring morning in the fir wood Still a feeling very different from his might have made her preserve it He must know all about it Why did you keep that he said Because I loved you Loved me Yes Didn t you know Why did you say then that you didn t care if if Because love is enough Hugh That was why THE END one ch guttural The land rail is a corn scraich two Goldsmith twice in the Citizen of the World Note from John Bechard creator of this Electronic text The following is a list of Scottish words which are found in George MacDonald s David Elginbrod I have compiled this list myself and worked out the definitions from context with the help of Margaret West from Leven in Fife Scotland and also by referring to a word list found in a collection of poems by Robert Burns There are about six words which we could not work out definitions for and would welcome any feedback on those words or any others in the list which may be wrong my e mail address is JaBBechard aol com This was never meant to be a comprehensive list of the National Scottish Language but rather an aid to understanding some of mister MacDonald s conversations which are carried out in the Broad Scots I do apologise for any mistakes or omissions I aimed for my list to be very comprehensive and it often repeats the same word in a plural or diminutive form As well it includes words that are quite obvious to native English speakers There is a web site under construction which will feature the Scottish language and the National Scottish Dictionary can be consulted if you have access to one This list is a compressed form that consists of three columns for word definition and additional notes It is set up with a comma between each item and a hard return at the end of each definition This means that this section could easily be cut and pasted into its own text file and imported into a database or spreadsheet as a comma separated variable file csv file Failing that you could do a search and replace for commas in this section I have not used any commas
