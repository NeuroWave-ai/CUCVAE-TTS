5022_29405_000012_000001	train-clean-100	well 
none	none	knew by experience Many a fine insect specimen have I lost when the bats were near me in search of their evening meal What had happened before in other woods happened now The first moth that I had snared was a large one and a specimen well worth securing As I stretched out my hand to take it the apparition of a flying shadow passed swift and noiseless between me and the tree In less than an instant the insect was snatched away when my fingers were within an inch of it The bat had begun his supper and the man and the mixture had provided it for him Out of five moths caught I became the victim of clever theft in the case of three The other two of no great value as specimens I was just quick enough to secure Under other circumstances my patience as a collector would still have been a match for the dexterity of the bats But on that evening a memorable evening when I look back at it now my spirits were depressed and I was easily discouraged My favorite studies of the insect world seemed to have lost their value in my estimation In the silence and the darkness I lay down under a tree and let my
5022_29405_000072_000001	train-clean-100	 mind 
none	none	dwell on myself and on my new life to come I am Gerard Roylake son and only child of the late Gerard Roylake of Trimley Deen At twenty two years of age my father s death had placed me in possession of his large landed property On my arrival from Germany only a few hours since the servants innocently vexed me When I drove up to the door I heard them say to each other Here is the young Squire My father used to be called the old Squire I shrank from being reminded of him not as other sons in my position might have said because it renewed my sorrow for his death 
4853_29413_000017_000013	train-clean-100	There 
none	none	was no sorrow in me to be renewed It is a shocking confession to make my heart remained unmoved when I thought of the father whom I had lost Our mothers have the most sacred of all claims on our gratitude and our love They have nourished us with their blood they have risked their lives in bringing us into the world they have preserved and guided our helpless infancy with divine patience and love What claim equally strong and equally tender does the other parent establish on his offspring What motive does the instinct of his young children find for preferring their father before any other person who may be a familiar object in their daily lives They love him naturally and rightly love him because he lives in their remembrance if he is a good man as the first the best the dearest of their friends My father was a bad man He was my mother s worst enemy and he was never my friend The little that I know of the world tells me that it is not the common lot in life of women to marry the object of their first love A sense of duty had compelled my mother to part with the man who had won her heart in the first days of her maidenhood and my father had discovered it after his marriage His insane jealousy foully wronged the truest wife the most long suffering woman that ever lived I have no patience to write of it For ten miserable years she suffered her martyrdom she lived through it dear angel sweet suffering soul for my sake At her death my father was able to gratify his hatred of the son whom he had never believed to be his own child Under pretence of preferring the foreign system of teaching he sent me to a school in France My education having been so far completed I was next transferred to a German University Never again did I see the place of my birth never did I get a letter from home until the family lawyer wrote from Trimley Deen requesting me to assume possession of my house and lands under the entail I should not even have known that my father had taken a second wife but for some friend or enemy I never discovered the person who sent me a newspaper containing an announcement of the marriage When we saw each other for the first time my stepmother and I met necessarily as strangers We were elaborately polite and we each made a meritorious effort to appear at our ease On her side she found herself confronted by a young man the new master of the house who looked more like a foreigner than an Englishman who when he was congratulated in view of the approaching season on the admirable preservation of his partridges and pheasants betrayed an utter want of interest in the subject and who showed no sense of shame in acknowledging that his principal amusements were derived from reading books and collecting insects How I must have disappointed missus Roylake and how considerately she hid from me the effect that I had produced Turning next to my own impressions I discovered in my newly found relative a little light eyed light haired elegant woman trim and bright and smiling dressed to perfection clever to her fingers ends skilled in making herself agreeable and yet in spite of these undeniable fascinations perfectly incomprehensible to me After my experience of foreign society I was incapable of understanding the extraordinary importance which my stepmother seemed to attach to rank and riches entirely for their own sakes When she described my unknown neighbors from one end of the county to the other 
5022_29411_000102_000001	train-clean-100	she took it 
none	none	for granted that I must be interested in them on account of their titles and their fortunes She held me up to my own face as a kind of idol to myself without producing any better reason than might be found in my inheritance of an income of sixteen thousand pounds And when I expressed in excusing myself for not accompanying her uninvited to the dinner party a perfectly rational doubt whether I might prove to be a welcome guest missus Roylake held up her delicate little hands in unutterable astonishment My dear Gerard in your position She appeared to think that this settled the question I submitted in silence the truth is I was beginning already to despair of my prospects Kind as my stepmother was and agreeable as she was what chance could I see of establishing any true sympathy between us And if my neighbors resembled her in their ways of thinking what hope could I feel of finding new friends in England to replace the friends in Germany whom I had lost A stranger among my own country people with the every day habits and every day pleasures of my youthful life left behind me without plans or hopes to interest me in looking at the future it is surely not wonderful that my spirits had sunk to their lowest ebb and that I even failed to appreciate with sufficient gratitude the fortunate accident of my birth Perhaps the journey to England had fatigued me or perhaps the controlling influences of the dark and silent night proved irresistible This only is certain my solitary meditations under the tree ended in sleep I was awakened by a light falling on my face The moon had risen In the outward part of the wood beyond which I had not advanced the pure and welcome light penetrated easily through the scattered trees I got up and looked about me A path into the wood now showed itself broader and better kept than any path that I could remember in the days of my boyhood The moon showed it to me plainly and my curiosity was aroused Following the new track I found that it led to a little glade which I at once recognized The place was changed in one respect only A neglected water spring had been cleared of brambles and stones and had been provided with a drinking cup a rustic seat and a Latin motto on a marble slab The spring at once reminded me of a greater body of water a river at some little distance farther on which ran between the trees on one side and the desolate open country on the other Ascending from the glade I found myself in one of the narrow woodland paths familiar to me in the by gone time Unless my memory was at fault this was the way which led to an old water mill on the river bank The image of the great turning wheel which half frightened half fascinated me when I was a child now presented itself to my memory for the first time after an interval of many years In my present frame of mind the old scene appealed to me with the irresistible influence of an old friend I said to myself Shall I walk on and try if I can find the river and the mill again This perfectly trifling question to decide presented to me nevertheless fantastic difficulties so absurd that they might have been difficulties encountered in a dream To my own astonishment I hesitated walked back again along the path by which I had advanced reconsidered my decision without knowing why and turning in the opposite direction set my face towards the river once more I wonder how my life would have ended if I had gone the other way CHAPTER II 
3698-29401-0000	train-other-500	THE RIVER INTRODUCES US I stood alone on the bank of the ugliest stream in England The moonlight pouring its unclouded radiance over open space
none	none	 failed to throw a beauty not their own 
3698-29401-0001	train-other-500	on those sluggish waters Broad and muddy their stealthy current flowed onward to the sea without a rock to diversify without a bubble to break the sullen surface On the side from which I was looking at the river
3698-29401-0002	train-other-500	the neglected trees grew so close together that they were undermining their own lives and poisoning each other On the opposite bank a rank growth of gigantic bulrushes hid the ground beyond except where it rose in hillocks
none	none	 and showed its surface of desert sand spotted here and there by mean patches of health 
3698-29401-0003	train-other-500	A repellent river in itself a repellent river in its surroundings a repellent river even in its name It was called The Loke Neither popular tradition nor antiquarian research could explain what the name meant
3698-29401-0004	train-other-500	or could tell when the name had been given We call it The Loke they do say no fish can live in it and it dirties the clean salt water when it runs into the sea Such was the character of the river in the estimation of the people who knew it best
3698-29401-0005	train-other-500	But I was pleased to see The Loke again The ugly river like the woodland glade looked at me with the face of an old friend On my right hand side rose the venerable timbers of the water mill The wheel was motionless at that time of night
3698-29401-0006	train-other-500	and the whole structure looked as remembered objects will look when we see them again after a long interval smaller than I had supposed it to be Otherwise I could discover no change in the mill But the wooden cottage attached to it
3698-29401-0007	train-other-500	had felt the devastating march of time A portion of the decrepit building still stood revealed in its wretched old age propped partly by beams which reached from the thatched roof to the ground and partly by the wall of a new cottage attached
3698-29401-0008	train-other-500	presenting in yellow brick work a hideous modern contrast to all that was left of its ancient neighbor Had the miller whom I remembered died and were these changes the work of his successor I thought of asking the question and tried the door
3698-29401-0009	train-other-500	it was fastened The windows were all dark excepting one which I discovered in the upper storey at the farther side of the new building Here there was a dim light burning It was impossible to disturb a person who for all I knew to the contrary
3698-29401-0010	train-other-500	might be going to bed I turned back to The Loke proposing to extend my walk by a mile or a little more to a village that I remembered on the bank of the river
none	none	 I had not advanced far when the stillness around me was disturbed by an intermittent sound of splashing in the water 
3698-29401-0011	train-other-500	Pausing to listen I heard next the working of oars in their rowlocks After another interval a boat appeared turning a projection in the bank and rowed by a woman pulling steadily against the stream As the boat approached me in the moonlight
3698-29401-0012	train-other-500	this person corrected my first impression and revealed herself as a young girl So far as I could perceive she was a stranger to me Who could the girl be alone on the river at that time of night Idly curious I followed the boat
3698-29401-0013	train-other-500	instead of pursuing my way to the village to see whether she would stop at the mill or pass it She stopped at the mill secured the boat and stepped on shore Taking a key from her pocket she was about to open the door of the cottage
3698-29401-0014	train-other-500	when I advanced and spoke to her As far from recognizing her as ever I found myself nevertheless thinking of an odd outspoken child living at the mill in past years who had been one of my poor mother s favorites at our village school
3698-29401-0015	train-other-500	I ran the risk of offending her by bluntly expressing the thought which was then in my mind Is it possible that you are Cristel Toller I said The question seemed to amuse her Why shouldn t I be Cristel Toller she asked
3698-29401-0016	train-other-500	You were a little girl I explained when I saw you last You are so altered now and so improved that I should never have guessed you might be the daughter of Giles Toller of the mill if I had not seen you opening the cottage door She acknowledged my compliment by a curtsey
3698-29401-0017	train-other-500	which reminded me again of the village school Thank you young man she said smartly I wonder who you are Try if you can recollect me I suggested May I take a long look at you As long as you like
3698-29401-0018	train-other-500	She studied my face with a mental effort to remember me which gathered her pretty eyebrows together quaintly in a frown There s something in his eyes she remarked not speaking to me but to herself which doesn t seem to be quite strange
none	none	 But I don t know his voice and I don t know his beard She considered a little and addressed herself directly to me once more Now I look at you again you seem to be a gentleman Are you one I hope so Then you re not making game of me 
3698-29401-0019	train-other-500	My dear I am only trying if you can remember Gerard Roylake While in charge of the boat the miller s daughter had been rowing with bared arms beautiful dusky arms at once delicate and strong Thus far she had forgotten to cover them up
none	none	 The moment mentioned my name she started back as if I had frightened her pulled her sleeves down in a hurry and hid the objects of my admiration as an act of homage to myself 
3698-29401-0020	train-other-500	Her verbal apologies followed You used to be such a sweet spoken pretty little boy she said how should I know you again with a big voice and all that hair on your face
none	none	 It seemed to strike her on a sudden that she had been too familiar Oh Lord I heard her say to herself 
3698-29401-0021	train-other-500	half the county belongs to him She tried another apology and hit this time on the conventional form I beg your pardon sir
none	none	 Welcome back to your own country sir 
3698-29401-0022	train-other-500	I wish you good night sir She attempted to escape into the cottage I followed her to the threshold of the door Surely it s not time to go to bed yet I ventured to say She was still on her good behavior to her landlord Not if you object to it sir
3698-29401-0023	train-other-500	she answered This recognition of my authority was irresistible Cristel had laid me under an obligation to her good influence for which I felt sincerely grateful she had made me laugh for the first time since my return to England
3698-29401-0024	train-other-500	We needn t say good night just yet I suggested I want to hear a little more about you Shall I come in She stepped out of the doorway even more rapidly than she had stepped into it I might have been mistaken
3698-29401-0025	train-other-500	but I thought Cristel seemed to be actually alarmed by my proposal We walked up and down the river bank On every occasion when we approached the cottage I detected her in stealing a look at the ugly modern part of it There could be no mistake this time
3698-29401-0026	train-other-500	I saw doubt I saw anxiety in her face What was going on at the mill I made some domestic inquiries beginning with her father Was the miller alive and well Oh yes sir Father gets thinner as he gets older that s all
5022_29405_000059_000000	train-clean-100	 yes 
5022_29411_000043_000000	train-clean-100	 yes 
none	none	sir Father gets thinner as he gets older that s all 
3698-29401-0027	train-other-500	Did he send you out by yourself at this late hour in the boat
none	none	 They were waiting for a sack of flour down there she replied 
3698-29401-0028	train-other-500	pointing in the direction of the river side village Father isn t as quick as he used to be He s often late over his work now Was there no one to give Giles Toller the help that he must need at his age
none	none	 Do you and your father really live alone in this solitary place 
3698-29401-0029	train-other-500	I said A change of expression appeared in her bright brown eyes which roused my curiosity I also observed that she evaded a direct reply What makes you doubt sir if father and I live alone she asked I pointed to the new cottage
3698-29401-0030	train-other-500	That ugly building I answered seems to give you more room than you want unless there is somebody else living at the mill I had no intention of trying to force the reply from her which she had hitherto withheld but she appeared to put that interpretation on what I had said
3698-29401-0031	train-other-500	If you will have it she burst out there is somebody else living with us A man who helps your father No A man who pays my father s rent I was quite unprepared for such a reply as this Cristel had surprised me
3698-29401-0032	train-other-500	To begin with her father was well connected as we say in England His younger brother had made a fortune in commerce and had vainly offered him the means of retiring from the mill with a sufficient income Then again Giles Toller was known to have saved money
3698-29401-0033	train-other-500	His domestic expenses made no heavy demand on his purse his German wife whose Christian name was now borne by his daughter had died long since his sons were no burden on him they had never lived at the mill in my remembrance
3698-29401-0034	train-other-500	With all these reasons against his taking a stranger into his house he had nevertheless if my interpretation of Cristel s answer was the right one let his spare rooms to a lodger
none	none	 mister Toller can t possibly be in want of money 
3698-29401-0035	train-other-500	I said The more money father has the more he wants That s the reason she added bitterly why he asked for plenty of room when the cottage was built and why we have got a lodger
none	none	 Is the lodger a gentleman 
3698-29401-0036	train-other-500	I don t know Is a man a gentleman if he keeps a servant Oh don t trouble to think about it sir It isn t worth thinking about This was plain speaking at last You don t seem to like the lodger I said I hate him
3698-29401-0037	train-other-500	Why She turned on me with a look of angry amazement not undeserved I must own on my part which showed her dark beauty in the perfection of its luster and its power To my eyes she was at the moment irresistibly charming
3698-29401-0038	train-other-500	I daresay I was blind to the defects in her face My good German tutor used to lament that there was too much of my boyhood still left in me Honestly admiring her I let my favorable opinion express itself a little too plainly
3698-29401-0039	train-other-500	What a splendid creature you are I burst out Cristel did her duty to herself and to me she passed over my little explosion of nonsense without taking the smallest notice of it Master Gerard she began and checked herself
3698-29401-0040	train-other-500	Please to excuse me sir you have set my head running on old times What I want to say is
none	none	 you were not so inquisitive when you were a young gentleman in short jackets Please behave as you used to behave then 
3698-29401-0041	train-other-500	and don t say anything more about our lodger I hate him because I hate him There Ignorant as I was of the natures of women I understood her at last Cristel s opinion of the lodger was evidently the exact opposite of the lodger s opinion of Cristel
3698-29401-0042	train-other-500	When I add that this discovery did decidedly operate as a relief to my mind the impression produced on me by the miller s daughter is stated without exaggeration and without reserve Good night she repeated for the last time
3698-29401-0043	train-other-500	I held out my hand Is it quite right sir she modestly objected for such as me to shake hands with such as you She did it nevertheless and dropping my hand cast a farewell look at the mysterious object of her interest
3698-29401-0044	train-other-500	the new cottage Her variable humor changed on the instant
none	none	 Apparently in a state of unendurable irritation she stamped on the ground Just what I didn t want to happen she said to herself CHAPTER III HE SHOWS HIMSELF I too looked at the cottage and made a discovery that surprised me at one of the upper windows If I could be sure that the moon had not deceived me the most beautiful face that I had ever seen was looking down on us and it was the face of a man By the uncertain light I could discern the perfection of form in the features and the expression of power which made it impossible to mistake the stranger for a woman although his hair grew long and he was without either moustache or beard He was watching us intently he neither moved nor spoke when we looked up at him Evidently the lodger I whispered to Cristel What a handsome man She tossed her head contemptuously my expression of admiration seemed to have irritated her I didn t want him to see you she said The lodger persecutes me with his attentions he s impudent enough to be jealous of me She spoke without even attempting to lower her voice I endeavored to warn her He s at the window still I said in tones discreetly lowered he can hear everything you are saying Not one word of it mister Gerard What do you mean The man is deaf Don t look at him again Don t speak to me again Go home pray go home Without further explanation she abruptly entered the cottage and shut the door As I turned into the path which led through the wood I heard a voice behind me It said Stop sir I stopped directly standing in the shadow cast by the outermost line of trees which I had that moment reached In the moonlight that I had left behind me I saw again the man whom I had discovered at the window His figure tall and slim his movements graceful and easy were in harmony with his beautiful face He lifted his long finely shaped hands and clasped them with a frantic gesture of entreaty For God s sake he said don t be offended with me His voice startled me even more than his words I had never heard anything like it before Low dull and muffled it neither rose nor fell it spoke slowly and deliberately without laying the slightest emphasis on any one of the words that it uttered In the astonishment of the moment I forgot what Cristel had told me I answered him as I should have answered any other unknown person who had spoken to me What do you want His hands dropped his head sunk on his breast You are speaking sir to a miserable creature who can t hear you I am deaf I stepped nearer to him intending to raise my voice in pity for his infirmity He shuddered and signed to me to keep back Don t come close to my ear don t shout As he spoke strong excitement flashed at me in his eyes without producing the slightest change in his voice I don t deny he resumed that I can hear sometimes when people take that way with me They hurt when they do it Their voices go through my nerves as a knife might go through my flesh I live at the mill sir I have a great favour to ask Will you come and speak to me in my room for five minutes only I hesitated Any other man in my place would I think have done the same receiving such an invitation as this from a stranger whose pitiable infirmity seemed to place him beyond the pale of social intercourse He must have guessed what was passing in my mind he tried me again in words which might have proved persuasive had they been uttered in the customary variety of tone I can t help being a stranger to you I can t help being deaf You re a young man You look more merciful and more patient than young men in general Won t you hear what I have to say Won t you tell me what I want to know How were we to communicate Did he by any chance suppose that I had learnt the finger alphabet I touched my fingers and shook my head as a means of dissipating his delusion if it existed He instantly understood me Even if you knew the finger alphabet he said it would be of no use I have been too miserable to learn it my deafness only came on me a little more than a year since Pardon me if I am obliged to give you trouble I ask persons who pity me to write their answers when I speak to them Come to my room and you will find what you want a candle to write by Was his will as compared with mine the stronger will of the two And was it helped insensibly to myself by his advantages of personal appearance I can only confess that his apology presented a picture of misery to my mind which shook my resolution to refuse him His ready penetration discovered this change in his favour he at once took advantage of it Five minutes of your time is all I ask for he said Won t you indulge a man who sees his fellow creatures all talking happily round him and feels dead and buried among them The very exaggeration of his language had its effect on my mind It revealed to me the horrible isolation among humanity of the deaf as I had never understood it yet Discretion is I am sorry to say not one of the strong points in my character I committed one more among the many foolish actions of my life I signed to the stranger to lead the way back to the mill CHAPTER IV HE EXPLAINS HIMSELF Giles Toller s miserly nature had offered to his lodger shelter from wind and rain and the furniture absolutely necessary to make a bedroom habitable and

none	none	more 
4771-29403-0001	train-other-500	There was no carpet on the floor no paper on the walls no ceiling to hide the rafters of the roof The chair that I sat on was the one chair in the room the man whose guest I had rashly consented to be found a seat on his bed Upon his table I saw pens and pencils paper and ink
4771-29403-0002	train-other-500	and a battered brass candlestick with a common tallow candle in it His changes of clothing were flung on the bed his money was left on the unpainted wooden chimney piece his wretched little morsel of looking glass propped up near the money had been turned with its face to the wall
4771-29403-0003	train-other-500	He perceived that the odd position of this last object had attracted my notice Vanity and I have parted company he explained I shrink from myself when I look at myself now
none	none	 The ugliest man living 
4771-29403-0004	train-other-500	if he has got his hearing is a more agreeable man in society than I am
none	none	 Does this wretched place disgust you He pushed a pencil and some sheets of writing paper across the table to me 
4771-29403-0005	train-other-500	I wrote my reply The place makes me sorry for you He shook his head Your sympathy is thrown away on me A man who has lost his social relations with his fellow creatures doesn t care how he lodges or where he lives When he has found solitude he has found all he wants for the rest of his days
4771-29403-0006	train-other-500	Shall we introduce ourselves It won t be easy for me to set the example I used the pencil again Why not Because you will expect me to give you my name I can t do it I have ceased to bear my family name
4771-29403-0007	train-other-500	and being out of society what need have I for an assumed name As for my Christian name it s so detestably ugly that I hate the sight and sound of it Here they know me as The Lodger Will you have that
none	none	 or will you have an appropriate nick name I come of a mixed breed and I m likely after what has happened to me to turn out a worthless fellow 
4771-29403-0008	train-other-500	Call me The Cur Oh you needn t start that s as accurate a description of me as any other What s your name I wrote it for him His face darkened when he found out who I was Young personally attractive and a great landowner he said
4771-29403-0009	train-other-500	I saw you just now talking familiarly with Cristel Toller I didn t like that at the time I like it less than ever now My pencil asked him without ceremony what he meant He was ready with his reply I mean this you owe something to the good luck which has placed you where you are
4771-29403-0010	train-other-500	Keep your familiarity for ladies in your own rank of life This to a young man like me was unendurable insolence I had hitherto refrained from taking him at his own bitter word in the matter of nick name In the irritation of the moment I now first resolved to adopt his suggestion seriously

none	none	 As I opened the leaves which were to reveal to me the secret soul of the man whom I had so strangely met the fading moonlight vanished and the distant trees were lost in the gloom of a starless night CHAPTER V HE BETRAYS HIMSELF The confession was entitled Memoirs of a Miserable Man It began abruptly in these words I I acknowledge at the outset that misfortune has had an effect on me which frail humanity is for the most part anxious to conceal Under the influence of suffering I have become of enormous importance to myself In this frame of mind I naturally enjoy painting my own portrait in words Let me add that they must be written words because it is a painful effort to me since I lost my hearing to speak to anyone continuously for any length of time I have also to confess that my brains are not so completely under my own command as I could wish For instance I possess considerable skill for an amateur as a painter in water colors But I can only produce a work of art when irresistible impulse urges me to express my thoughts in form and color The same obstacle to regular exertion stands in my way if I am using my pen I can only write when the fit takes me sometimes at night when I ought to be asleep sometimes at meals when I ought to be handling my knife and fork sometimes out of doors when I meet with inquisitive strangers who stare at me As for paper the first stray morsel of anything that I can write upon will do provided I snatch it up in time to catch my ideas as they fly My method being now explained I proceed to the deliberate act of self betrayal which I contemplate in producing this picture of myself II I divide my life into two Epochs respectively entitled Before my Deafness and After my Deafness Or suppose I define the melancholy change in my fortunes more sharply still by contrasting with each other my days of prosperity and my days of disaster Of these alternatives I hardly know which to choose It doesn t matter the one thing needful is to go on In any case then I have to record that I passed a happy childhood thanks to my good mother Her generous nature had known adversity and had not been deteriorated by undeserved trials Born of slave parents she had not reached her eighteenth year when she was sold by auction in the Southern States of America The person who bought her she never would tell me who he was freed her by a codicil added to his will on his deathbed My father met with her a few years afterwards in American society fell as I have heard madly in love with her and married her in defiance of the wishes of his family He was quite right no better wife and mother ever lived The one vestige of good feeling that I still possess lives in my empty heart when I dwell at times on the memory of my mother My good fortune followed me when I was sent to school Our head master was more nearly a perfect human being than any other man that I have ever met with Even the worst tempered boys among us ended in loving him Under his encouragement and especially to please him I won every prize that industry intelligence and good conduct could obtain and I rose at an unusually early age to be the head boy in the first class When I was old enough to be removed to the University and when the dreadful day of parting arrived I fainted under the agony of leaving the teacher no the dear friend whom I devotedly loved There must surely have been some good in me at that time What has become of it now The years followed each other and I was Fortune s spoilt child still Under adverse circumstances my sociable disposition my delight in the society of young people of my own age might have exposed me to serious dangers in my new sphere of action Happily for me my father consulted a wise friend before he sent me to Cambridge I was entered at one of the smaller colleges and I fell at starting among the right set of men Good examples were all round me We formed a little club of steady students our pleasures were innocent we were too proud and too poor to get into debt I look back on my career at Cambridge as I look back on my career at school and wonder what has become of my better self III During my last year at Cambridge my father died The profession which he had intended that I should follow was the Bar I believed myself to be quite unfit for the sort of training imperatively required by the Law and my mother agreed with me When I left the University my own choice of a profession pointed to the medical art and to that particular branch of it called surgery After three years of unremitting study at one of the great London hospitals I started in practice for myself Once more my persistent luck was faithful to me at the outset of my new career The winter of that year was remarkable for alternate extremes of frost and thaw Accidents to passengers in the streets were numerous and one of them happened close to my own door A gentleman slipped on the icy pavement and broke his leg On sending news of the accident to his house I found that my chance patient was a nobleman My lord was so well satisfied with my services that he refused to be attended by any of my elders and betters in the profession Little did I think at the time that I had received the last of the favours which Fortune was to bestow on me I enjoyed the confidence and goodwill of a man possessing boundless social influence and I was received most kindly by the ladies of his family In one word at the time when my professional prospects justified the brightest hopes that I could form sudden death deprived me of the dearest and truest of all friends I suffered the one dreadful loss which it is impossible to replace the loss of my mother We had parted at night when she was to all appearance in the enjoyment of her customary health The next morning she was found dead in her bed IV Keen observers who read these lines will remark that I have said nothing about the male members of my family and that I have even passed over my father with the briefest possible allusion to his death This curious reticence on my part is simply attributable to pure ignorance Until affliction lay heavy on me my father my uncle and my grandfather were hardly better known to me in their true characters than if they had been strangers passing in the street How I contrived to become more intimately acquainted with my ancestors I am now to reveal In the absence of any instructions to guide me after my mother s death I was left to use my own discretion in examining the papers which she had left behind her Reading her letters carefully before I decided what to keep and what to destroy I discovered a packet protected by an unbroken seal and bearing an inscription addressed abruptly to my mother in these words For fear of accidents my dear we will mention no names in this place The sight of my handwriting will remind you of my devotion to your interests in the past and will satisfy you that I am to be trusted in the service that I now offer to my good sister friend In the fewest words let me tell you that I have heard of the circumstances under which your marriage has taken place Your origin has unfortunately become known to the members of your husband s family their pride has been deeply wounded and the women especially regard you with feelings of malignant hatred I have good reason for fearing that they may try to excuse their inhuman way of speaking of you by making public the calamity of your slave birth What deplorable influence might be exercised on your husband s mind by such an exposure as this I will not stop to inquire It will be more to the purpose to say that I am able to offer you a sure means of protecting yourself through information which I have unexpectedly obtained and the source of which I am obliged to keep secret If you are ever threatened by your enemies open the packet which I have now sealed up and you will command the silence of the bitterest man or woman who longs to injure you I may add that absolute proof accompanies every assertion which my packet contains Keep it carefully as long as you live and God grant you may never have occasion to break the seal Such was the inscription copied exactly word for word I cannot even guess who my mother s devoted friend may have been Neither can I doubt that she would have destroyed the packet but for the circumstance of her sudden death After hesitating a little I hardly know why I summoned my resolution and broke the seal Of the horror with which I read the contents of the packet I shall say nothing Who ever yet sympathized with the sorrows and sufferings of strangers Let me merely announce that I knew my ancestors at last and that I am now able to present them in their true characters as follows V My grandfather was tried on a charge of committing willful murder was found guilty on the clearest evidence and died on the scaffold by the hangman s hands His two sons abandoned the family name and left the family residence They were nevertheless not unworthy representatives of their atrocious father as will presently appear My uncle a captain in the Army was discovered at the hazard table playing with loaded dice Before this abject scoundrel could be turned out of his regiment he was killed in a duel by one of his brother officers whom he had cheated My father when he was little more than a lad deserted a poor girl who had trusted him under a promise of marriage Friendless and hopeless she drowned herself and her child His was the most infamous in the list of the family crimes and he escaped without answering to a court of law or a court of honor for what he had done Some of us come of one breed and some of another There is the breed from which I drew the breath of life What do you think of me now VI I looked back over the past years of my existence from the time of my earliest recollections to the miserable day when I opened the sealed packet What wholesome influences had preserved me so far from moral contamination by the vile blood that ran in my veins There were two answers to that question which in some degree quieted my mind In the first place resembling my good mother physically I might hope to have resembled her morally In the second place the happy accidents of my career had preserved me from temptation at more than one critical period of my life On the other hand in the ordinary course of nature not one half of that life had yet elapsed What trials might the future have in store for me and what protection against them would the better part of my nature be powerful enough to afford While I was still troubled by these doubts the measure of my disasters was filled by an attack of illness which threatened me with death My medical advisers succeeded in saving my life and left me to pay the penalty of their triumph by the loss of one of my senses At an early period of my convalescence I noticed one day with languid surprise that the voices of the doctors when they asked me how I had slept and if I felt better sounded singularly dull and distant A few hours later I observed that they stooped close over me when they had something important to say On the same evening my day nurse and my night nurse happened to be in the room together To my surprise they had become so wonderfully quiet in their movements that they opened the door or stirred the fire without making the slightest noise I intended to ask them what it meant I had even begun to put the question when I was startled by another discovery relating this time to myself I was certain that I had spoken and yet I had not heard myself speak As well as my weakness would let me I called to the nurses in my loudest tones Has anything happened to my voice I asked The two women consulted together looking at me with pity in their eyes One of them took the responsibility on herself She put her lips close to my ear the horrid words struck me with a sense of physical pain Your illness has left you in a sad state sir You are deaf VII As soon as I was able to leave my bed well meaning people in and out of the medical profession combined to torment me with the best intentions One famous aural surgeon after another came to me and quoted his experience of cases in which the disease that had struck me down had affected the sense of hearing in other unhappy persons they had submitted to surgical treatment generally with cheering results I submitted in my turn All that skill could do for me was done and without effect My deafness steadily increased my case was pronounced to be hopeless the great authorities retired Judicious friends who had been waiting for their opportunity undertook the moral management of me next I was advised to cultivate cheerfulness to go into society to encourage kind people who tried to make me hear what was going on to be on my guard against morbid depression to check myself when the sense of my own horrible isolation drove me away to my room and last but by no means least to beware of letting my vanity disincline me to use an ear trumpet I did my best honestly did my best to profit by the suggestions that were offered to me not because I believed in the wisdom of my friends but because I dreaded the effect of self imposed solitude on my nature Since the fatal day when I had opened the sealed packet I was on my guard against the inherited evil lying dormant for all I knew to the contrary in my father s son Impelled by that horrid dread I suffered my daily martyrdom with a courage that astonishes me when I think of it now What the self inflicted torture of the deaf is none but the deaf can understand When benevolent persons did their best to communicate to me what was clever or amusing while conversation was going on in my presence I was secretly angry with them for making my infirmity conspicuous and directing the general attention to me When other friends saw in my face that I was not grateful to them and gave up the attempt to help me I suspected them of talking of me contemptuously and amusing themselves by making my misfortune the subject of coarse jokes Even when I deserved encouragement by honestly trying to atone for my bad behavior I committed mistakes arising out of my helpless position which prejudiced people against me Sometimes I asked questions which appeared to be so trivial to ladies and gentlemen happy in the possession of a sense of hearing that they evidently thought me imbecile as well as deaf Sometimes seeing the company enjoying an interesting story or a good joke I ignorantly appealed to the most incompetent person present to tell me what had been said with this result that he lost the thread of the story or missed the point of the joke and blamed my unlucky interference as the cause of it These mortifications and many more I suffered patiently until little by little my last reserves of endurance felt the cruel strain on them and failed me My friends detected a change in my manner which alarmed them They took me away from London to try the renovating purity of country air So far as any curative influence over the state of my mind was concerned the experiment proved to be a failure I had secretly arrived at the conclusion that my deafness was increasing and that my friends knew it and were concealing it from me Determined to put my suspicions to the test I took long solitary walks in the neighborhood of my country home and tried to hear the new sounds about me I was deaf to everything with the one exception of the music of the birds How long did I hear the little cheering songsters who comforted me I am unable to measure the interval that elapsed my memory fails me I only know that the time came when I could see the skylark in the heavens but could no longer hear its joyous notes In a few weeks more the nightingale and even the loud thrush became silent birds to my doomed ears My last effort to resist my own deafness was made at my bedroom window For some time I still heard faintly and more faintly the shrill twittering just above me under the eaves of the house When this last poor enjoyment came to an end when I listened eagerly desperately and heard nothing think of it nothing I gave up the struggle Persuasions arguments entreaties were entirely without effect on me Reckless what came of it I retired to the one fit place for me to the solitude in which I have buried myself ever since VIII With some difficulty I discovered the lonely habitation of which was in search No language can describe the heavenly composure of mind that came to me when I first found myself alone living the death in life of deafness apart from creatures no longer my fellow creatures who could hear apart also from those privileged victims of hysterical impulse who wrote me love letters and offered to console the poor beautiful deaf man by marrying him Through the distorting medium of such sufferings as I have described women and men even young women were repellent to me alike Ungratefully impatient of the admiration excited by my personal advantages savagely irritated by tender looks and flattering compliments I only consented take lodgings on condition that there should be no young women living under the same roof with me If this confession of morbid feeling looks like vanity I can only say that appearances lie I write in sober sadness determined to present my character with photographic accuracy as a true likeness What were my habits in solitude How did I get through the weary and wakeful hours of the day Living by myself I became as I have already acknowledged important to myself and as a necessary consequence I enjoyed registering my own daily doings Let passages copied from my journal reveal how I got through the day IX EXTRACTS FROM A DEAF MAN S DIARY Monday Six weeks today since I first occupied my present retreat My landlord and landlady are two hideous old people They look as if they disliked me on the rare occasions when we meet So much the better they don t remind me of my deafness by trying to talk and they keep as much as possible out of my way This morning after breakfast I altered the arrangement of my books and then I made my fourth attempt in the last ten days to read some of my favorite authors No my taste has apparently changed since the time when I could hear I closed one volume after another caring nothing for what used to be deeply interesting to me Reckless and savage with a burning head and a cold heart I went out to look about me After two hours of walking and thinking I found that I had wandered to our county town The rain began to fall heavily just as I happened to be passing a bookseller s shop After some hesitation for I hate exposing my deafness to strangers I asked leave to take shelter and looked at the books Among them was a collection of celebrated Trials I thought of my grandfather consulted the index and finding his name there bought the work The shopman as I could guess from his actions and looks proposed sending the parcel to me I insisted on taking it away The sky had cleared and I was eager to read the details of my grandfather s crime Tuesday Sat up late last night reading my new book My favorite poets novelists and historians have failed to interest me I devoured the Trials with breathless delight beginning
5022_29405_000084_000000	train-clean-100	 of course 
none	none	with the murder in which I felt a family interest Prepared to find my grandfather a ruffian I confess I was surprised by the discovery that he was also a fool The officers of justice had no merit in tracing the crime to him his own stupidity delivered him into their hands I read the evidence twice over and put myself in his position and saw the means plainly by which he might have set discovery at defiance In the Preface to the Trials I found an allusion in terms of praise to a work of the same kind published in the French language I wrote to London at once and ordered the book Wednesday Is there some mysterious influence in the silent solitude of my life that is hardening my nature Is there something unnatural in the existence of a man who never hears a sound Is there a moral sense that suffers when a bodily sense is lost These questions have been suggested to me by an incident that happened this morning Looking out of window I saw a brutal carter on the road before the house beating an over loaded horse A year since I should have interfered to protect the horse without a moment s hesitation If the wretch had been insolent I should have seized his whip and applied the heavy handle of it to his own shoulders In past days I have been more than once fined by a magistrate privately in sympathy with my offence for assaults committed by me in the interests of helpless animals What did I feel now Nothing but a selfish sense of uneasiness at having been accidentally witness of an act which disturbed my composure I turned away regretting that I had gone to the window and looked out This was not an agreeable train of thought to follow What could I do I was answered by the impulse which commands me to paint I sharpened my pencils and opened my box of colors and determined to produce a work of art To my astonishment the brutal figure of the carter forced its way into my memory again and again It without in the least knowing why as if the one chance of getting rid of this curious incubus was to put the persistent image of the man on paper It was done mechanically and yet done so well that I was encouraged to add to the picture I put in next the poor beaten horse another good likeness and then I introduced a life like portrait of myself giving the man the sound thrashing that he had deserved Strange to say this representation of what I ought to have done relieved my mind as if I had actually done it I looked at the pre eminent figure of myself and felt good and turned to my Trials and read them over again and liked them better than ever Thursday The bookseller has found a second hand copy of the French Trials and has sent them to me as he expresses it on approval I more than approve I admire and I more than admire I imitate These criminal stories are told with a dramatic power which has impelled me to try if I can rival the clever French narrative I found a promising subject by putting myself in my grandfather s place and tracing the means by which it had occurred to me that he might have escaped the discovery of his crime I cannot remember having read any novel with a tenth part of the interest that absorbed me in constructing my imaginary train of circumstances So completely did the reality of the narrative impress itself on my mind that I felt as if the murder that I was relating had been a crime committed by myself It was my own ingenuity that hid the dead body and removed the traces of blood and my own self control that presented me as an innocent person when the victim was missing and I was asked among other respectable people to say whether I thought he was living or dead A whole week has passed and has been occupied by my new literary pursuit My inexhaustible imagination invents plots and conspiracies of which I am the happy hero I set traps which invariably catch my enemies I place myself in positions which are entirely new to me Yesterday for instance I invented a method of spiriting away a young person whose disappearance was of considerable importance under the circumstances and succeeded in completely bewildering her father her friends and the police not a trace of her could they find If I ever have occasion to do in reality what I only suppose myself to do in these exercises of ingenuity what a dangerous man I may yet prove to be This morning I rose planning to amuse myself with a new narrative when the ideal world in which I am now living became a world annihilated by collision with the sordid interests of real life In plainer words I received a written message from my landlord which has annoyed me and not without good cause This tiresome person finds himself unexpectedly obliged to give up possession of his house The circumstances are not worth relating The result is important I am compelled to find new lodgings Where am I to go I left it to chance That is to say I looked at the railway time table and took a ticket for the first place of which the name happened to catch my eye Arrived at my destination I found myself in a dirty manufacturing town with an ugly river running through it After a little reflection I turned my back on the town and followed the course of the river in search of shelter and solitude on one or the other of its banks An hour of walking brought me to an odd looking cottage half old and half new attached to a water mill A bill in one of the windows announced that rooms were to be let and a look round revealed a thick wood on my left hand and a wilderness of sand and heath on my right So far as appearances went here was the very place for me I knocked at the door and was admitted by a little lean sly looking old man He showed me the rooms one for myself and one for my servant Wretched as they were the loneliness of the situation recommended them to me I made no objections and I consented to pay the rent that was asked The one thing that remained to be done in the interests of my tranquillity was to ascertain if any other persons lived the cottage besides my new landlord He wrote his answer to the question Nobody but my daughter With serious misgivings I inquired if his daughter was young He wrote two fatal figures eighteen Here was a discovery which disarranged all my plans just as I had formed them The prospect of having a girl in the house at the age associated with my late disagreeable experience of the sensitive sex was more than my irritable temper could endure I saw the old man going to the window to take down the bill Turning in a rage to stop him I was suddenly brought to a standstill by the appearance of a person who had just entered the room Was this the formidable obstacle to my tranquillity which had prevented me from taking the rooms that I had chosen Yes I knew the miller s daughter intuitively Delirium possessed me my eyes devoured her my heart beat as if it would burst out of my bosom The old man approached me he nodded and grinned and pointed to her Did he claim his parental interest in her Did he mean that she belonged to him No she belonged to me She might be his daughter She was My Fate I don t know what it was in the girl that took me by storm Nothing in her look or her manner expressed the slightest interest in me That famous beauty of mine which had worked such ravages in the hearts of other young women seemed not even to attract her notice When her father put his hand to his ear and told her as I guessed that I was deaf there was no pity in her splendid brown eyes they expressed a momentary curiosity and nothing more Possibly she had a hard heart or perhaps she took a dislike to me at first sight It made no difference to my mind either way Was she the most beautiful creature I had ever seen Not even that excuse was to be made for me I have met with women of her dark complexion who were beyond dispute her superiors in beauty and have looked at them with indifference Add to this that I am one of the men whom women offend if they are not perfectly well dressed The miller s daughter was badly dressed her magnificent figure was profaned by the wretchedly made gown that she wore I forgave the profanation In spite of the protest of my own better taste I resigned myself to her gown Is it possible adequately to describe such infatuation as this Quite possible I have only to acknowledge that I took the rooms at the cottage and there is the state of my mind exposed without mercy How will it end CHAPTER VI THE RETURN OF THE PORTFOLIO With that serious question the last of the leaves entrusted to me by the Lodger at the Mill came to an end

none	none	Of course that bold girl contrived to attract your notice 
5022_29405_000016_000000	train-clean-100	I replied that I had met with the bold girl purely by accident on her side as well as on mine and then I started a new topic 
5022_29405_000016_000001	train-clean-100	 Was it a pleasant dinner party last night I asked as if the subject really interested me 
none	none	I had not been quite four and twenty hours in England yet and I was becoming a humbug already My stepmother was her charming self again the moment my question had passed my lips 
5022_29405_000017_000001	train-clean-100	Society provided it was not society at the mill was always attractive as a topic of conversation 
5022_29405_000017_000002	train-clean-100	 Your absence was the only drawback she answered 
none	none	I have asked the two ladies my lord has an engagement to dine here to day without ceremony They are most anxious to meet you 
5022_29405_000017_000005	train-clean-100	My dear Gerard you look surprised 
none	none	Surely you know who the ladies are 
5022_29405_000018_000000	train-clean-100	I was obliged to acknowledge my ignorance 
5022_29405_000019_000000	train-clean-100	missus Roylake was shocked 
5022_29405_000019_000001	train-clean-100	 At any rate she resumed you have heard of their father Lord Uppercliff 
none	none	I made another shameful confession 
5022_29405_000020_000001	train-clean-100	Either I had forgotten Lord Uppercliff during my long absence abroad or I had never heard of him 
none	none	missus Roylake was disgusted And this is a foreign education she exclaimed Thank Heaven you have returned to your own country 
5022_29405_000021_000003	train-clean-100	We will drive out after luncheon and pay a round of visits When this prospect was placed before me I remembered having read in books of sensitive persons receiving impressions which made their blood run cold I now found myself one of those persons for the first time in my life 
none	none	In the meanwhile missus Roylake continued I must tell you excuse me for laughing it seems so very absurd that you should not know who Lord Uppercliff s daughters are I must tell you that Lady Rachel is the eldest 
5022_29405_000021_000005	train-clean-100	She is married to the Honorable Captain Millbay of the Navy now away in his ship 
none	none	A person of extraordinary strength of mind I don t mean the Captain I mean Lady Rachel I admire her intellect but her political and social opinions I must always view with regret Her younger sister Lady Lena not married Gerard remember that is simply the most charming girl in England If you don t fall in love with her you will be the only young man in the county who has resisted Lady Lena Poor Sir George she refused him last week you really must have heard of Sir George our member of parliament conservative of course quite broken hearted about Lady Lena gone away to America to shoot bears You seem to be restless What are you fidgeting about Ah I know You want to smoke after breakfast 
5022_29405_000021_000014	train-clean-100	Well I won t be in your way 
5022_29405_000021_000015	train-clean-100	Go out on the terrace your poor father always took his cigar on the terrace 
5022_29405_000021_000016	train-clean-100	They say smoking leads to meditation I leave you to meditate on Lady Lena 
none	none	Don t forget luncheon at one o clock and the carriage at two 
5022_29405_000022_000000	train-clean-100	She smiled and kissed her hand and fluttered out of the room 
5022_29405_000022_000001	train-clean-100	Charming perfectly charming 
none	none	And yet I was ungrateful enough to wish myself back in Germany again 
5022_29405_000023_000000	train-clean-100	I lit my cigar but not on the terrace 
none	none	Leaving the house I took the way once more that led to Fordwitch Wood What would missus Roylake have said if she had discovered that I was going back to the mill 
5022_29405_000023_000003	train-clean-100	There was no other alternative 
5022_29405_000023_000004	train-clean-100	The portfolio was a trust confided to me the sooner I returned it to the writer of the confession the sooner I told him plainly the conclusion at which I had arrived the more at ease my mind would be 
none	none	The sluggish river looked muddier than ever the new cottage looked uglier than ever exposed to the searching ordeal of sunlight 
5022_29405_000024_000001	train-clean-100	I knocked at the door on the ancient side of the building 
none	none	Cristel s father shall I confess I had hoped that it might be Cristel herself let me in In by gone days I dimly remembered him as old and small and withered Advancing years had wasted him away in the interval until his white miller s clothes hung about him in empty folds 
5022_29405_000025_000003	train-clean-100	His fleshless face would have looked like the face of a mummy but for the restless brightness of his little watchful black eyes 
none	none	He stared at me in momentary perplexity and suddenly recovering himself asked me to walk in
5022_29405_000026_000000	train-clean-100	 Are you the young master sir 
5022_29405_000026_000001	train-clean-100	Ah yes yes I thought so 
none	none	My girl Cristy said she saw the young master last night Thank you kindly sir I m pretty well considering how I ve fallen away in my flesh I have got a fine appetite but somehow or other my meals don t show on me You will excuse my receiving you in the kitchen sir it s the best room we have Did Cristy tell you how badly we are off here for repairs 
5022_29405_000026_000007	train-clean-100	You being our landlord we look to you to help us 
5022_29405_000026_000008	train-clean-100	We are falling to pieces as it were on this old side of the house 
5022_29405_000026_000009	train-clean-100	There s first drains 
5022_29405_000027_000000	train-clean-100	He proceeded to reckon up the repairs counting with his fleshless thumb on his skinny fingers when he was interrupted by a curious succession of sounds which began with whining and ended with scratching at the cottage door 
5022_29405_000028_000000	train-clean-100	In a minute after the door was opened from without 
5022_29405_000028_000001	train-clean-100	A brown dog of the companionable retriever breed ran in and fawned upon old Toller 
5022_29405_000028_000002	train-clean-100	Cristel followed from the kitchen garden with a basket of vegetables on her arm 
5022_29405_000028_000003	train-clean-100	Unlike the river and the cottage she gained by being revealed in the brilliant sunlight 
5022_29405_000028_000004	train-clean-100	I now saw in their full beauty the luster of her brown eyes the warm rosiness of her dark complexion the delightful vivacity of expression which was the crowning charm of her face 
5022_29405_000028_000005	train-clean-100	She paused confusedly in the doorway and tried to resist me when I insisted on relieving her of the basket 
none	none	mister Gerard she protested you are treating me as if I was a young lady What would they say at the great house if they knew you had done that My answer would no doubt have assumed the form of a foolish compliment if her father had not spared her that infliction He returned to the all important question the question of repairs
5022_29405_000031_000000	train-clean-100	 You see sir it s no use speaking to the bailiff 
none	none	Saving your presence he s a miser with his master s money 
5022_29405_000031_000002	train-clean-100	He says All right and he does nothing 
none	none	There s first as I told you just now the truly dreadful state of the drains 
5022_29405_000032_000000	train-clean-100	I tried to stop him by promising to speak to the bailiff myself 
5022_29405_000032_000001	train-clean-100	On hearing this good news mister Toller s gratitude became ungovernable he was more eager than ever and more eloquent than ever in returning to the repairs 
none	none	And then sir there s the oven They do call bread the staff of life It s a burnt staff at one time and a clammy staff at another in our domestic experience Satisfy yourself sir do please cross the kitchen and look with your own eyes at the state the scandalous state of the oven 
5022_29405_000034_000000	train-clean-100	His daughter interfered and stopped him at the critical moment when he was actually offering his arm to conduct me in state across the kitchen Cristel had just put her pretty brown hand over his mouth and said Oh father do pray be quiet when we were all three disturbed by another interruption 
5022_29405_000035_000000	train-clean-100	A second door communicating as I concluded from its position with the new cottage was suddenly opened 
5022_29405_000035_000001	train-clean-100	In the instant before the person behind it appeared the dog looked that way started up frightened and took refuge under the table 
5022_29405_000035_000002	train-clean-100	At the next moment the deaf Lodger walked into the room 
5022_29405_000035_000003	train-clean-100	It was he beyond all doubt who had frightened the dog forewarned by instinct of his appearance 
none	none	What I had read of his writing disposed me now that I saw the man by daylight to find something devilish in the expression of his face No strong as it was my prejudice failed to make any discoveries that presented him at a disadvantage 
5022_29405_000036_000002	train-clean-100	His personal attractions triumphed in the clear searching light 
none	none	I now perceived that his eyes were of that deeply dark blue which is commonly and falsely described as resembling the color of the violet To my thinking they were so entirely beautiful that they had no right to be in a man s face 
5022_29405_000036_000005	train-clean-100	I might have felt the same objection to the pale delicacy of his complexion to the soft profusion of his reddish brown hair to his finely shaped sensitive lips but for two marked peculiarities in him which would have shown me to be wrong that is to say the expression of power about his head and the signs of masculine resolution presented by his mouth and chin 
5022_29405_000037_000000	train-clean-100	On entering the room the first person and the only person who attracted his attention was Cristel 
5022_29405_000038_000000	train-clean-100	He bowed smiled possessed himself abruptly of her hand and kissed it She tried to withdraw it from his grasp and met with an obstinate resistance 
5022_29405_000038_000001	train-clean-100	His gallantry addressed her in sweet words and his voice destroyed their charm by the dreary monotony of the tone in which he spoke 
5022_29405_000038_000002	train-clean-100	 On this lovely day Cristel Nature pleads for me 
none	none	Your heart feels the sunshine and softens towards the poor deaf man who worships you Ah my dear it s 
5022_29411_000008_000001	train-clean-100	useless 
none	none	to say No 
5022_29405_000038_000005	train-clean-100	My affliction is my happiness when you say cruel things to me 
5022_29405_000038_000006	train-clean-100	I live in my fool s paradise I don t hear you He tried to draw her nearer to him 
5022_29405_000038_000007	train-clean-100	 Come my angel let me kiss you 
none	none	She made a second attempt to release herself and this time she wrenched her hand out of his grasp with a strength for which he was not prepared 
5022_29405_000040_000000	train-clean-100	That fiercest anger which turns the face pale was the anger that had possession of Cristel as she took refuge with her father 
5022_29405_000040_000001	train-clean-100	 You asked me to bear with that man she said because he paid you a good rent 
none	none	I tell you this father my patience is coming to an end Either he must go or I must go Make up your mind to choose between your money and me 
5022_29405_000041_000000	train-clean-100	Old Toller astonished me 
5022_29405_000041_000001	train-clean-100	He seemed to have caught the infection of his daughter s anger 
5022_29405_000041_000002	train-clean-100	Placed between Cristel and his money he really acted as if he preferred Cristel 
5022_29405_000041_000003	train-clean-100	He hobbled up to his lodger and shook his infirm fists and screamed at the highest pitch of his old cracked voice Let her be or I won t have you here no longer 
5022_29405_000041_000004	train-clean-100	You deaf adder let her be 
none	none	The sensitive nerves of the deaf man shrank as those shrill tones pierced them
5022_29405_000042_000001	train-clean-100	 If you want to speak to me write it he said with rage and suffering in every line of his face 
5022_29405_000042_000002	train-clean-100	He tore from his pocket his little book filled with blank leaves and threw it at Toller s head 
5022_29405_000042_000003	train-clean-100	 Write he repeated 
5022_29405_000042_000004	train-clean-100	 If you murder me with your screeching again look out for your skinny throat I ll throttle you 
5022_29405_000043_000000	train-clean-100	Cristel picked up the book 
none	none	She was gratefully sensible of her father s interference He shall know what you said to him she promised the old man
5022_29405_000043_000003	train-clean-100	 I ll write it myself 
none	none	She took the pencil from its sheath in the leather binding of the book Controlling himself the lover whom she hated advanced towards her with a persuasive smile Have you forgiven me he asked Have you been speaking kindly of me 
5022_29405_000045_000002	train-clean-100	I think I see it in your face 
5022_29405_000045_000003	train-clean-100	There are some deaf people who can tell what is said by looking at the speaker s lips 
5022_29405_000045_000004	train-clean-100	I am too stupid or too impatient or too wicked to be able to do that 
5022_29405_000045_000005	train-clean-100	Write it for me dear and make me happy for the day 
5022_29405_000046_000000	train-clean-100	Cristel was not attending to him she was speaking to me 
none	none	I hope sir you don t think that father and I are to blame for what has happened this morning she said 
5022_29405_000046_000002	train-clean-100	He looked where she was looking and discovered for the first time that I was in the room 
none	none	He had alluded to his wickedness a moment since When his face turned my way I thought it bore witness to his knowledge of his own character Why didn t you come to my side of the house he said to me What am I to understand sir by seeing you here 
5022_29405_000049_000000	train-clean-100	Cristel dropped his book on the table and hurried to me in breathless surprise 
5022_29405_000049_000001	train-clean-100	 He speaks as if he knew you she cried 
5022_29405_000049_000002	train-clean-100	 What does it mean 
none	none	Only that I met him last night I explained after leaving you
5022_29405_000051_000000	train-clean-100	 Did you know him before that 
none	none	No 
5022_29405_000052_000001	train-clean-100	He was a perfect stranger to me 
5022_29405_000053_000000	train-clean-100	He picked up his book from the table and took his pencil out of Cristel s hand while we were speaking 
5022_29405_000053_000001	train-clean-100	 I want my answer he said handing me the book and the pencil 
none	none	I gave him his answer
5022_29405_000054_000000	train-clean-100	 You find me here because I don t wish to return to your side of the house 
5022_29405_000055_000000	train-clean-100	 Is that the impression he asked produced by what I allowed you to read 
5022_29405_000056_000000	train-clean-100	I replied by a sign in the affirmative 
5022_29405_000056_000001	train-clean-100	He inquired next if I had brought his portfolio with me 
5022_29405_000056_000002	train-clean-100	I put it at once into his hand 
5022_29405_000057_000000	train-clean-100	In some way unknown to me I had apparently roused his suspicions 
none	none	He opened the portfolio and counted the loose leaves of writing in it carefully While he was absorbed in this occupation old Toller s eccentricity assumed a new form 
5022_29405_000057_000003	train-clean-100	His little restless black eyes followed the movements of his lodger s fingers as they turned over leaf after leaf of the manuscript with such eager curiosity and interest that I looked at him in surprise 
5022_29405_000057_000004	train-clean-100	Finding that he had attracted my notice he showed no signs of embarrassment he seized the opportunity of asking for information 
none	none	Did my gentleman trust you sir with all that writing he began Yes
5022_29405_000060_000000	train-clean-100	 Did he want you to read it 
5022_29405_000061_000000	train-clean-100	 He did 
none	none	What s it all about sir Confronted by this cool inquiry I informed mister Toller that the demands of curiosity had their limits and that he had reached them 
5022_29405_000063_000001	train-clean-100	On this ground I declined to answer any more questions 
5022_29405_000063_000002	train-clean-100	mister Toller went on with his questions immediately 
5022_29405_000064_000000	train-clean-100	 Do you notice sir that he seems to set a deal of store by his writings 
5022_29405_000064_000001	train-clean-100	Perhaps you can say what the value of them may be 
5022_29405_000065_000000	train-clean-100	I shook my head 
5022_29405_000065_000001	train-clean-100	 It won t do mister Toller 
5022_29405_000066_000000	train-clean-100	He tried again I declare it positively he tried again 
none	none	You ll excuse me sir 
5022_29405_000066_000002	train-clean-100	I ve never seen his portfolio before 
none	none	Am I right if I think you know where he keeps it
5022_29405_000067_000000	train-clean-100	 Spare your breath mister Toller 
5022_29405_000067_000001	train-clean-100	Once more it won t do 
5022_29405_000068_000000	train-clean-100	Cristel joined us amazed at his pertinacity 
none	none	Why are you so anxious father to know about that portfolio she asked 
5022_29405_000069_000000	train-clean-100	Her father seemed to have reasons of his own for following my example and declining to answer questions 
5022_29405_000069_000001	train-clean-100	More polite however than I had been he left his resolution to be inferred 
none	none	His daughter was answered by a few general remarks setting forth the advantage to the landlord of having a lodger who had lost one of senses You see there s something convenient my dear in the circumstance of that nice looking gentleman over there being deaf We can talk about him before his face just as comfortably as if it was behind his back Isn t that so mister Gerard Don t you see it yourself Cristy For instance I say it without fear in his presence tis the act of a fool to be fumbling over writings when there s nothing in them that s not well known to himself already unless indeed they are worth money which I don t doubt is no secret to you mister Gerard Eh 
5022_29405_000070_000006	train-clean-100	I beg your pardon sir did you speak 
none	none	No 
5022_29405_000070_000008	train-clean-100	I beg your pardon again 
5022_29405_000070_000009	train-clean-100	Yes yes Cristy I m noticing him he s done with his writings 
none	none	Suppose I offer to put them away for him 
5022_29405_000070_000011	train-clean-100	You can see in his face he finds the tale of them correct He s coming this way 
5022_29405_000070_000012	train-clean-100	What s he going to do next 
none	none	He was going to establish a claim on my gratitude by relieving me of Giles Toller
5022_29405_000072_000000	train-clean-100	 I have something to say to mister Roylake he announced with a haughty look at his landlord 
none	none	Mind I don t forget your screaming at me just now and I intend to know what you meant by it 
5022_29405_000072_000003	train-clean-100	That will do 
5022_29405_000072_000004	train-clean-100	Get out of the way 
5022_29405_000073_000000	train-clean-100	The old fellow received his dismissal with a low bow and left the kitchen with a look at the Lodger which revealed unless I was entirely mistaken a sly sense of triumph 
none	none	What did it mean 
5022_29405_000074_000000	train-clean-100	The deaf man addressed me with a cold and distant manner 
none	none	We must understand each other he said
5022_29405_000074_000002	train-clean-100	 Will you follow me to my side of the cottage I shook my head 
5022_29405_000074_000003	train-clean-100	 Very well he resumed we will have it out here 
5022_29405_000074_000004	train-clean-100	When I trusted you with my confession last night I left you to decide after reading it whether you would make an enemy of me or not You remember that I nodded my head 
5022_29405_000074_000005	train-clean-100	 Then I now ask you mister Roylake Which are we enemies or friends 
5022_29405_000075_000000	train-clean-100	I took the pencil and wrote my reply 
5022_29405_000076_000000	train-clean-100	 Neither enemies nor friends 
none	none	We are strangers from this time forth Some internal struggle produced a change in his face visible for one moment hidden from me in a moment more I think you will regret the decision at which you have arrived He said that and saluted me with his grandly gracious bow As he turned away he perceived Cristel at the other end of the room and eagerly joined her
5022_29405_000078_000000	train-clean-100	 The only happy moments I have are my moments passed in your presence he said 
5022_29405_000078_000001	train-clean-100	 I shall trouble you no more for to day 
5022_29405_000078_000002	train-clean-100	Give me a little comfort to take back with me to my solitude 
none	none	I didn t notice that there were other persons present when I asked leave to kiss you 
5022_29405_000078_000004	train-clean-100	May I hope that you forgive me 
5022_29405_000079_000000	train-clean-100	He held out his hand it was not taken 
5022_29405_000079_000001	train-clean-100	He waited a little in the vain hope that she would relent she turned away from him 
none	none	A spasm of pain distorted his handsome face 
5022_29405_000080_000001	train-clean-100	He opened the door that led to his side of the cottage paused and looked back at Cristel 
5022_29405_000080_000002	train-clean-100	She took no notice of him 
5022_29405_000080_000003	train-clean-100	As he moved again to the door and left us the hysterical passion in him forced its way outward he burst into tears 
5022_29405_000081_000000	train-clean-100	The dog sprang up from his refuge under the table and shook himself joyfully 
none	none	Cristel breathed again freely and joined me at my end of the room 
5022_29405_000081_000002	train-clean-100	Shall I make another acknowledgment of weakness 
none	none	I began to fear that we might all of us even including the dog have been a little hard on the poor deaf wretch who had gone away in such bitter distress 
5022_29405_000081_000004	train-clean-100	I communicated this view of the matter to Cristel 
none	none	She failed to see it as I did 
5022_29405_000082_000000	train-clean-100	The dog laid his head on her lap asking to be caressed 
none	none	She patted him while she answered me
5022_29405_000083_000000	train-clean-100	 I agree with this old friend mister Gerard 
none	none	We were both of us frightened on the very first day when the person you are pitying came to lodge with us 
5022_29405_000083_000002	train-clean-100	I have got to hate him since that time perhaps to despise him 
5022_29405_000083_000003	train-clean-100	But the dog has never changed he feels and knows there is something dreadful in that man 
none	none	One of these days poor Ponto may turn out to be right May I ask you something sir Of course
5022_29405_000085_000000	train-clean-100	 You won t think I am presuming on your kindness 
5022_29405_000086_000000	train-clean-100	 You ought to know me better than that Cristel 
none	none	The truth is sir I have been a little startled by what I saw in our lodger s face when he asked if you were his enemy or his friend I know he is thought to be handsome but mister Gerard those beautiful eyes of his sometimes tell tales and I have seen his pretty complexion change to a color that turned him into an ugly man 
5022_29405_000087_000002	train-clean-100	Will you tell me what you wrote when you answered him 
5022_29405_000088_000000	train-clean-100	I repeated what I had written word for word 
5022_29405_000088_000001	train-clean-100	It failed to satisfy her 
none	none	He is very vain she said and you may have wounded his vanity by treating him like a stranger after he had given you his writings to read and invited you to his room But I thought I saw something much worse than mortification in his face Shall I be taking a liberty if I ask how it was you got acquainted with him last night 
5022_29405_000090_000000	train-clean-100	She was evidently in earnest 
none	none	I saw that I must answer her without reserve and I was a little afraid of being myself open to a suspicion of vanity if I mentioned the distrust which I had innocently excited in the mind of my new acquaintance 
5022_29405_000090_000002	train-clean-100	In this state of embarrassment I took a young man s way out of the difficulty and spoke lightly of a serious thing 
5022_29405_000091_000000	train-clean-100	 I became acquainted with your deaf Lodger Cristel under ridiculous circumstances 
5022_29405_000091_000001	train-clean-100	He saw us talking last night and did me the honor to be jealous of me 
5022_29405_000092_000000	train-clean-100	I had expected to see her blush 
5022_29405_000092_000001	train-clean-100	To my surprise she turned pale and vehemently remonstrated 
5022_29405_000093_000000	train-clean-100	 Don t laugh sir 
none	none	There s nothing to be amused at in what you have just told me You didn t go into his room last night 
5022_29405_000093_000003	train-clean-100	Oh what made you do that 
5022_29405_000094_000000	train-clean-100	I described his successful appeal to my compassion not very willingly for it made me look as I thought like a weak person 
none	none	Little by little she extracted from me the rest how he objected to find a young man especially in my social position talking to Cristel how he insisted on my respecting his claims and engaging not to see her again how when I refused to do this he gave me his confession to read so that I might find out what a formidable man I was setting at defiance how I had not been in the least alarmed and had treated him as Cristel had just heard on the footing of a perfect stranger
5022_29405_000095_000000	train-clean-100	 There s the whole story I concluded 
5022_29405_000095_000001	train-clean-100	 Like a scene in a play isn t it 
none	none	She protested once more against the light tone that I persisted in assuming
5022_29405_000097_000000	train-clean-100	 I tell you again sir this is no laughing matter 
none	none	You have roused his jealousy 
5022_29405_000097_000002	train-clean-100	You had better have roused the fury of a wild beast 
none	none	Knowing what you know of him why did you stay here when he came in And oh why did I humiliate him in your presence 
5022_29405_000097_000005	train-clean-100	Leave us mister Gerard pray pray leave us and don t come near this place again till father has got rid of him 
5022_29405_000098_000000	train-clean-100	Did she think I was to be so easily frightened as that 
none	none	My sense of my own importance was up in arms at the bare suspicion of it
5022_29405_000099_000000	train-clean-100	 My dear child I said grandly do you really suppose I am afraid of that poor wretch 
none	none	Am I to give up the pleasure of seeing you because a mad fellow is simple enough to think you will marry him 
5022_29405_000099_000002	train-clean-100	Absurd Cristel absurd 
none	none	The poor girl wrung her hands in despair
5022_29405_000101_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh sir don t distress me by talking in that way 
none	none	Do please remember who you are and who I am If I was the miserable means of your coming to any harm I can t bear even to speak of it 
5022_29405_000101_000003	train-clean-100	Pray don t think me bold I don t know how to express myself 
none	none	You ought never to have come here you ought to go you must go Driven by strong impulse she ran to the place in which I had left my hat and brought it to me and opened the door with a look of entreaty which it was impossible to resist 
5022_29405_000102_000001	train-clean-100	It would have been an act of downright cruelty to persist in opposing her 
5022_29405_000102_000002	train-clean-100	 I wouldn t distress you Cristel for the whole world I said and left her to conclude that I had felt the influence of her entreaties in the right way 
5022_29405_000102_000003	train-clean-100	She tried to thank me the tears rose in her eyes she signed to me to leave her poor soul as if she felt ashamed of herself 
5022_29405_000102_000004	train-clean-100	I was shocked I was grieved I was more than ever secretly resolved to go back to her 
5022_29405_000102_000005	train-clean-100	When we said good bye I have been told that I did wrong I meant no harm I kissed her 
5022_29405_000103_000000	train-clean-100	Having traversed the short distance between the cottage and the wood I remembered that I had left my walking stick behind me and returned to get it 
5022_29405_000104_000000	train-clean-100	Cristel was leaving the kitchen I saw her at the door which communicated with the Lodger s side of the cottage 
5022_29405_000104_000001	train-clean-100	Her back was turned towards me astonishment held me silent 
5022_29405_000104_000002	train-clean-100	She opened the door passed through it and closed it behind her 
none	none	Going to that man after she had repelled his advances in my presence Going to the enemy against whom she had warned me after I had first been persuaded to leave her 
5022_29405_000105_000001	train-clean-100	Angry thoughts these and surely thoughts unworthy of me 
none	none	If it had been the case of another man I should have said he was jealous Jealous of the miller s daughter in my position 
5022_29405_000105_000004	train-clean-100	Absurd contemptible 
5022_29405_000105_000005	train-clean-100	But I was still in such a vile temper that I determined to let Cristel know she had been discovered 
5022_29405_000105_000006	train-clean-100	Taking one of my visiting cards I wrote on it I came back for my stick and saw you go to him After I had pinned this spiteful little message to the door so that she might see it when she returned I suffered a disappointment 
none	none	I was not half so well satisfied with myself as I had anticipated CHAPTER VII THE BEST SOCIETY Leaving the cottage for the second time I was met at the door by a fat man of solemn appearance dressed in black who respectfully touched his hat My angry humor acknowledged the harmless stranger s salute by a rude inquiry What the devil do you want 
4771-29406-0000	train-other-500	Instead of resenting this uncivil language he indirectly reproved me by becoming more respectful than ever My mistress desires me to tell you sir that luncheon is waiting I was in the presence of a thoroughbred English servant
none	none	 and I had failed to discover it until he spoke of his mistress 
4771-29406-0001	train-other-500	I had also by keeping luncheon waiting treated an English institution with contempt And worse even than this as a misfortune which personally affected me my stepmother evidently knew that I had paid another visit to the mill I hurried along the woodland path followed by the fat domestic in black
none	none	 Not used apparently to force his legs into rapid motion he articulated with the greatest difficulty in answering my next question How did you know where to find me 
4771-29406-0002	train-other-500	missus Roylake ordered inquiries to be made sir The head gardener There his small reserves of breath failed him The head gardener saw me Yes sir When Hours ago sir when you went into Toller s cottage
none	none	 I troubled my fat friend with no more questions Returning to the house and making polite apologies I discovered one more among missus Roylake s many accomplishments 
4771-29406-0003	train-other-500	She possessed two smiles a sugary smile with which I was already acquainted
none	none	 and an acid smile which she apparently reserved for special occasions It made its appearance when I led her to the luncheon table 
4771-29406-0004	train-other-500	Don t let me detain you my stepmother began Won t you give me some luncheon I inquired
none	none	 Dear me hav n t 
4771-29406-0005	train-other-500	you lunched already Where should I lunch my dear lady I thought this would induce the sugary smile to show itself I was wrong Where missus Roylake repeated With your friends at the mill of course Very inhospitable not to offer you lunch When are we to have flour cheaper
4771-29406-0006	train-other-500	I began to get sulky All I said was
none	none	 I don t know Curious missus Roylake observed You not only don t get luncheon among your friends you don t even get information To know a miller and not to know the price of flour is ignorance presented in one of its most pitiable aspects And how is Miss Toller looking 
4771-29406-0007	train-other-500	Perfectly charming I was angry by this time You have exactly described her I said missus Roylake began to get angry on her side Surely a little coarse and vulgar she suggested reverting to poor Cristel
none	none	 Would you like to judge for yourself I asked 
4771-29406-0008	train-other-500	I shall be happy missus Roylake to take you to the mill
none	none	 My stepmother s knowledge of the world implied considerable acquaintance how obtained I do not pretend to know with the characters of men Discovering that she was in danger of overstepping the limits of my patience 
4771-29406-0009	train-other-500	she drew back with a skill which performed the retrograde movement without permitting it to betray itself We have carried our little joke my dear Gerard far enough she said I fancy your residence in Germany has rather blunted your native English sense of humor
4771-29406-0010	train-other-500	You don t suppose I hope and trust that I am so insensible to our relative positions as to think of interfering in your choice of friends or associates
none	none	 If you are not aware of it already let me remind you that this house is now yours 
4771-29406-0011	train-other-500	not mine I live here
none	none	 gladly live here my dear boy by your indulgence fortified I am sure by your regard for your excellent father s wishes as expressed in his will 
4771-29406-0012	train-other-500	I stopped her there She had got the better of me with a dexterity which I see now but which I was not clever enough to appreciate at time
none	none	 In a burst of generosity I entreated her to consider Trimley Deen as her house and never to mention such a shocking subject as my authority again After this need I say that the most amiable of women took me out in her carriage and introduced me to some of the best society in England 
4771-29406-0013	train-other-500	If I could only remember all the new friends to whom I made my bow
none	none	 as well as the conversation in which we indulged I might write a few pages here interesting in a high degree to persons with well balanced minds Unhappily so far as my own impressions were concerned the best society proved to be always the same society Every house that we entered was in the same beautiful order every mistress of the house was dressed in the best taste every master of the house had the same sensible remarks to make on conservative prospects at the coming election every young gentleman wanted to know how my game preserves had been looked after in my absence every young lady said How nice it must have been mister Roylake to find yourself again at Trimley Deen Has anybody ever suffered as I suffered during that round of visits under the desire to yawn and the effort to suppress it Is there any sympathetic soul who can understand me when I say that I would have given a hundred pounds for a gag and for the privilege of using it to stop my stepmother s pleasant chat in the carriage following on our friends pleasant chat in the drawing room Finally when we got home and when missus Roylake kindly promised me another round of visits and more charming people in the neighborhood to see will any good Christian forgive me if I own that I took advantage of being alone to damn the neighborhood and to feel relieved by it Now that I was no longer obliged to listen to polite strangers my thoughts reverted to Cristel and to the suspicions that she had roused in me Recovering its influence in the interval that had passed my better nature sharply reproached me I had presumed to blame Cristel with nothing to justify me but my own perverted view of her motives How did I know that she had not opened that door and gone to that side of the cottage with a perfectly harmless object in view I was really anxious if I could find the right way to do it to make amends for an act of injustice of which I felt ashamed If I am asked why I was as eager to set myself right with a miller s daughter as if she had been a young lady in the higher ranks of life I can only reply that no such view of our relative positions as this ever occurred to me A strange state of mind no doubt What was the right explanation of it The right explanation presented itself at a later time when troubles had quickened my intellect and when I could estimate the powerful influence of circumstances at its true value I had returned to England to fill a prominent place in my own little world without relations whom I loved without friends whose society I could enjoy Hopeful ardent eager for the enjoyment of life I had brought with me to my own country the social habits and the free range of thought of a foreign University and as a matter of course I failed to feel any sympathy with the society new to me in which my lot had been cast Beset by these disadvantages I had met with a girl possessed of remarkable personal attractions and associated with my earliest remembrances of my own happy life and of my mother s kindness a girl at once simple and spirited unspoilt by the world and the world s ways and placed in a position of peril due to the power of her own beauty which added to the interest that she naturally inspired Estimating these circumstances at their true value did a state of mind which rendered me insensible to the distinctions that separate the classes in England stand in any need of explanation As I thought and think still it explained itself My stepmother and I parted on the garden terrace which ran along the pleasant southern side of the house The habits that I had contracted among my student friends in Germany made tobacco and beer necessary accompaniments to the process of thinking I had nearly exhausted my cigar my jug and my thoughts when I saw two men approaching me from the end of the terrace As they came nearer I recognized in one of the men my fat domestic in black He stopped the person who was accompanying him and came on to me by himself Will you see that man sir waiting behind me Who is he I don t know sir He says he has got a letter to give you and he must put it in your own hands I think myself he s a beggar He s excessively insolent he insists on seeing you Shall I tell him to go The servant evidently expected me to say Yes He was disappointed my curiosity was roused I said I would see the insolent stranger As he approached me the man certainly did not look like a beggar Poor he might be judging by his dress The upper part of him was clothed in an old shooting jacket of velveteen his legs presented a pair of trousers once black now turning brown with age Both garments were too long for him and both were kept scrupulously clean He was a short man thickly and strongly made Impenetrable composure appeared on his ugly face His eyes were sunk deep in his head his nose had evidently been broken and not successfully mended 
4771-29406-0014	train-other-500	his grey hair when he took off his hat on addressing me was cut short
none	none	 and showed his low forehead and his bull neck An Englishman of the last generation would as I have since been informed have set him down as a retired prize fighter Thanks to my ignorance of the pugilistic glories of my native country I was totally at a loss what to make of him Have I the honor of speaking to mister Roylake he asked His quiet steady manner prepossessed me in his favour it showed no servile reverence for the accident of birth on the one hand and no insolent assertion of independence on the other When I had told him that my name was Roylake he searched one of the large pockets of his shooting jacket produced a letter and silently offered it to me Before I took the letter seeing that he was a stranger and that he mentioned no name known to me I thought it desirable to make some inquiry Is it a letter of your own writing I asked No sir Who sends you with it He was apparently a man of few words 
4771-29406-0015	train-other-500	My master was the guarded answer that this odd servant returned
none	none	 I became as inquisitive as old Toller himself Who is your master I went on The reply staggered me Speaking as quietly and respectfully as ever he said I can t tell you sir 
4771-29406-0016	train-other-500	Do you mean that you are forbidden to tell me No sir Then what do you mean
none	none	 I mean that I don t know my master s name I instantly took the letter from him and looked at the address For once in a way I had jumped at a conclusion and I had proved to be right The handwriting on the letter and the handwriting of the confession which I had read overnight 
4771-29406-0017	train-other-500	were one and the same Are you to wait for an answer I asked as I opened the envelope I am to wait sir if you tell me to do so The letter was a long one
none	none	 After running my eye over the first sentences I surprised myself by acting discreetly You needn t wait I said I will send a reply The man of few words raised his shabby hat turned about in silence and left me CHAPTER VIII THE DEAF LODGER The letter was superscribed Private and Confidential It was written in these words Sir You will do me grievous wrong if you suppose that I am trying to force myself on your acquaintance My object in writing is to prevent you if I can from misinterpreting my language and my conduct on the only two occasions when we happen to have met I am conscious that you must have thought me rude and ungrateful perhaps even a little mad when I returned your kindness last night in honoring me with a visit by using language which has justified you in treating me as a stranger Fortunately for myself I gave you my autobiography to read After what you now know of me I may hope that your sense of justice will make some allowance for a man tried I had almost written cursed by such suffering as mine There are other deaf persons as I have heard who set me a good example They feel the consolations of religion Their sweet tempers find relief even under the loss of the most precious of all the senses They mix with society submitting to their dreadful isolation and preserving unimpaired sympathy with their happier fellow creatures who can hear I am not one of those persons With sorrow I say it I never have submitted I never can submit to my hard fate Let me not omit to ask your indulgence for my behavior when we met at the cottage this morning What unfavorable impression I may have produced on you I dare not inquire So little capable am I of concealing the vile feelings which sometimes get the better of me that Miss Cristel observe that I mention her with respect appears to have felt positive alarm on your account when she looked at me I may tell you in confidence that this charming person came to my side of the cottage as soon as you had taken your departure to intercede with me in your favour If your wicked mind is planning to do evil to mister Roylake she wrote in my book either you will promise me to give it up or I will never allow you to see me again I will even leave home secretly to be out of your way In that strong language she expressed how shall I refer to it shall I say the sisterly interest that she felt in your welfare I laid down the letter for a moment If I had not already reproached myself for having misjudged Cristel and if I had not in that way done her some little justice in my own better thoughts I should never have recovered my self respect after reading the deaf man s letter The good girl The dear good girl Yes that was how I thought of her under the windows of my stepmother s boudoir while missus Roylake for all I knew to the contrary might be looking down at me and when Lady Lena the noble and beautiful was coming to dinner The letter concluded as follows To return to myself I gave Miss Cristel the promise on which she had insisted and then naturally enough I inquired into her motive for interfering in your favour She frankly admitted that she was interested in you First in grateful remembrance of old times when you and your mother had been always good to her Secondly because she had found you as kind and as friendly as ever now that you were a man and had become the greatest landowner in the county There was the explanation I had asked for at my service And on that she left me Did I believe her when I was meditating on our interview alone in my room Or did I suspect you of having robbed me of the only consolation that makes my life endurable No such unworthy suspicion as this was admitted to my mind With all my heart I believe her And with perfect sincerity I trust You If your knowledge of me has failed to convince you that there is any such thing as a better side to my nature you will no doubt conclude that this letter is a trick of mine to throw you off your guard and you will continue to distrust me as obstinately as ever In that case I will merely remind you that my letter is private and confidential and I will not ask you to send me a reply I remain Sir yours as you may receive me THE DEAF LODGER I wonder what another man in my position would have done when he had read this letter Would he have seen in it nothing to justify some respect and some kindly feeling towards the writer Could he have reconciled it to his conscience to leave the afflicted man who had trusted him without a word of reply For my part do not forget what a young man I was in those days I made up my mind to reply in the friendliest manner that is to say in person After consulting my watch I satisfied myself that I could go to the mill and get back again before the hour fixed for our late dinner supper we should have called it in Germany For the second time that day and without any hesitation I took the road that led to Fordwitch Wood Crossing the glade I encountered a stout young woman filling a can with water from the spring She curtseyed on seeing me I asked if she belonged to the village The reply informed me that I had taken another of my servants for a stranger The stout nymph of the spring was my kitchen maid and she was fetching the water which we drank at the house and there s no water sir like yours for all the country round Furnished with these stores of information I went my way and the kitchen maid went hers She spoke of course of having seen her new master on returning to the servants hall In this manner as I afterwards heard the discovery of me at the spring and my departure by the path that led to the mill reached missus Roylake s ears the medium of information being the lady s own maid So far Fordwitch Wood seemed to be a place to avoid in the interests of my domestic tranquillity Arriving at the cottage I found the Lodger standing by the open window at which I had first seen him But on this occasion his personal appearance had undergone a singular process of transformation The lower part of his face from his nostrils to his chin was hidden by a white handkerchief tied round it He had removed the stopper from a strangely shaped bottle and was absorbed in watching some interesting condition in a dusky liquid that it contained To attract his attention by speaking was of course out of the question I could only wait until he happened to look my way My patience was not severely tried he soon replaced the stopper in the bottle and looking up from it saw me With his free hand he quickly removed the handkerchief and spoke Let me ask you to wait in the boat house he said I will come to you directly He pointed round the corner of the new cottage indicating of course the side of it that was farthest from the old building Following his directions I first passed the door that he used in leaving or returning to his room and then gained the bank of the river On my right hand rose the mill building with its big waterwheel and above it a little higher up the stream I recognized the boat house built out in the water on piles and approached by a wooden pier No structure of this elaborate and expensive sort would have been set up by my father for the miller s convenience The boat house had been built many years since by a rich retired tradesman with a mania for aquatic pursuits Our ugly river had not answered his expectations and our neighborhood had abstained from returning his visits When he left us with his wherries and canoes and outriggers the miller took possession of the abandoned boat house It s the sort of fixture that don t pay nohow old Toller remarked Suppose you remove it there s a waste of money Suppose you knock it to pieces is it worth a rich gentleman s while to sell a cartload of firewood Neither of these alternatives having been adopted and nobody wanting an empty boat house the clumsy mill boat hitherto tied to a stake and exposed to the worst that the weather could do to injure it was now snugly sheltered under a roof with empty lockers once occupied by aquatic luxuries gaping on either side of it I was looking out on the river and thinking of all that had happened since my first meeting with Cristel by moonlight when the voice of the deaf man made itself discordantly heard behind me Let me apologize for receiving you here he said and let me trouble you with one more of my confessions Like other unfortunate deaf people I suffer from nervous irritability Sometimes we restlessly change our places of abode And sometimes as in my case we take refuge in variety of occupation You remember the ideal narratives of crime which I was so fond of writing at one time I gave the affirmative answer in the usual way Well he went on my literary inventions have ceased to interest me I have latterly resumed the chemical studies associated with that happy time in my life when I was entering on the medical profession Unluckily for you I have been trying an experiment to day which makes such an abominable smell in my room that I dare not ask you to enter it The fumes are not only disagreeable but in some degree dangerous You saw me at the window perhaps with my nose and mouth protected before I opened the bottle I repeated the affirmative sign He produced his little book of blank leaves and opened it ready for use May I hope he said that your visit is intended as a favorable reply to my letter I took the pencil and answered him in these terms Your letter has satisfied me that I was mistaken in treating you like a stranger I have come here to express my regret at having failed to do you justice Pray be assured that I believe in your better nature and that I accept your letter in the spirit in which you have written it He read my reply and suddenly looked at me Never had I seen his beautiful eyes so brightly soft so irresistibly tender as they appeared now He held out his hand to me It is one of my small merits to be in the popular phrase as good as my word I took his hand well knowing that the action committed me to accepting his friendship In relating the events which form this narrative I look back at the chain as I add to it link by link sometimes with surprise sometimes with interest and sometimes with the discovery that I have omitted a circumstance which it is necessary to replace But I search my memory in vain while I dwell on the lines that I have just written for a recollection of some attendant event which might have warned me of the peril towards which I was advancing blindfold My remembrance presents us as standing together with clasped hands but nothing in the slightest degree ominous is associated with the picture There was no sinister chill communicated from his hand to mine no shocking accident happened close by us in the river not even a passing cloud obscured the sunlight shining in its gayest glory over our heads After having shaken hands neither he nor I had apparently anything more to say A little embarrassed I turned to the boat house window and looked out Trifling as the action was my companion noticed it Do you like that muddy river he asked I took the pencil again Old associations make even the ugly Loke interesting to me He sighed as he read those words I wish mister Roylake I could say the same Your interesting river frightens me It was needless to ask for the pencil again My puzzled face begged for an explanation When you were in my room he said you may have noticed a second window which looks out on The Loke I have got into a bad habit of sitting by that window on moonlight nights I watch the flow of the stream and it seems to associate itself with the flow of my thoughts Nothing remarkable so far while I am awake But later when I get to sleep dreams come to me All of them sir without exception connect Cristel with the river Look at the stealthy current that makes no sound In my last night s sleep it made itself heard it was flowing in my ears with a water music of its own No longer my deaf ears I heard in my dream as well as you can hear Yes the same water music singing over and over again the same horrid song Fool fool no Cristel for you bid her good bye bid her good bye I saw her floating away from me on those hideous waters The cruel current held me back when I tried to follow her I struggled and screamed and shivered and cried I woke up with a start that shook me to pieces and cursed your interesting river Don t write to me about it again Don t look at it again Why did you bring up the subject I beg your pardon I had no right to say that Let me be polite let me be hospitable I beg to invite you to come and see me when my room is purified from its pestilent smell I can only offer you a cup of tea Oh that river that river what devil set me talking about it I m not mad mister Roylake only wretched When may I expect you Choose your own evening next week Who could help pitying him Compared with my sound sweet dreamless sleep what dreadful nights were his I accepted his invitation as a matter of course When we had completed our arrangements it was time for me to think of returning to Trimley Deen Moving towards the door I accidentally directed his attention to the pier by which the boat house was approached His face instantly reminded me of Cristel s description of him when he was strongly and evilly moved I too saw his beautiful eves tell tales and his pretty complexion change to a color which turned him into an ugly man He seized my arm and pointed to the pier at the end of it which joined the river bank Pray accept my excuses I can t answer for my temper if that wretch comes near me With this apology he hurried away and sly Giles Toller having patiently waited until the coast was clear accosted me with his best bow and said Beautiful weather isn t it sir I had no remarks to make on the weather but I was interested in discovering what had happened at the cottage You have mortally offended the gentleman who has just left me I said What have you done mister Toller had purposes of his own to serve and kept those purposes as usual exclusively in view he presented deaf ears to me now I don t think I ever remember such wonderful weather sir in my time and I m an old fellow as I needn t tell you Being at the mill just now I saw you in the boat house and came to pay my respects Would you be so good as to look at this slip of paper mister Gerard If you will kindly ask what it is you will in a manner help me I knew but too well what it was The repairs again I said resignedly Hand it over you obstinate old man mister Toller was so tickled by my discovery and by the cheering prospect consequent on seeing his list of repairs safe in my pocket that he laughed until I really thought he would shake his lean little body to pieces By way of bringing his merriment to an end I assumed a look of severity and insisted on knowing how he had offended the Lodger My venerable tenant trembling for his repairs drifted into a question of personal experience and seemed to anticipate that it might improve my temper When you have a woman about the house mister Gerard you may have noticed that she s an everlasting expense to you especially when she s a young one Isn t that so I inquired if he applied this remark to his daughter That s it sir I m talking of Cristy When her back s up there isn t her equal in England for strong language My gentleman has misbehaved himself in some way since you were with us this morning sir how I don t quite understand All I can tell you is I ve given him notice to quit A clear loss of money to me every week and Cristy s responsible for it Yes sir I ve been worked up to it by my girl If Cristy s mother had asked me to get rid of a paying lodger I should have told her to go to we won t say where sir you ll know where when you re married yourself The upshot of it is that I have offended my gentleman for the sake of my girl which last is a luxury I can t afford unless I let the rooms again If you hear of a tenant say what a good landlord I am and what sweet pretty rooms I ve got to let I led the way to the bank of the river before mister Toller could make any more requests We passed the side of the old cottage The door was open and I saw Cristel employed in the kitchen My watch told me that I had still two or three minutes to spare and my guilty remembrance of the message that I had pinned to the door suggested an immediate expression of regret I approached Cristel with a petition for pardon on my lips She looked distrustfully at the door of communication with the new cottage as if she expected to see it opened from the other side Not now she said and went on sadly with her household work May I see you to morrow I asked It had better not be here sir was the only reply she made I offered to meet her at any other place which she might appoint Cristel persisted in leaving it to me she spoke absently as if she was thinking all the time of something else I could propose no better place at the moment than the spring in Fordwitch Wood She consented to meet me there on the next day if seven o clock in the morning would not be too early for me My German habits had accustomed me to early rising She heard me tell her this and looked again at the Lodger s door and abruptly wished me good evening Her polite father was shocked at this unceremonious method of dismissing the great man who had only to say the word and stop the repairs Where are your manners Cristy he asked indignantly Before he could say another word I was out of the cottage As I passed the spring on my way home I thought of my two appointments On that evening my meeting with the daughter of the lord On the next morning my meeting with the daughter of the miller Lady Lena at dinner Cristel before breakfast If missus Roylake found out that social contrast what would she say I was a merry young fool I burst out laughing CHAPTER IX missus ROYLAKE S GAME FIRST MOVE The dinner at Trimley Deen has left in my memory little that I can distinctly recall Only a faintly marked vision of Lady Lena rewards me for doing my best to remember her A tall slim graceful person dressed in white with a simplicity which is the perfection of art presents to my admiration gentle blue eyes a pale complexion delicately touched with color a well carried head crowned by lovely light brown hair So far time helps the reviving past to come to life again and permits nothing more I cannot say that I now remember the voice once so musical in my ears or that I am able to repeat the easy unaffected talk which once interested me or that I see again in my thoughts the perfect charm of manner which delighted everybody not forgetting myself My unworthy self I might say for I was the only young man honored by an introduction to Lady Lena who stopped at admiration and never made use of opportunity to approach love On the other hand I distinctly recollect what my stepmother and I said to each other when our guests had wished us good night If I am asked to account for this I can only reply that the conspiracy to lead me into proposing marriage to Lady Lena first showed itself on the occasion to which I have referred In her eagerness to reach her ends missus Roylake failed to handle the fine weapons of deception as cleverly as usual Even I with my small experience of worldly women discovered the object that she had in view I had retired to the seclusion of the smoking room and was already encircled by the clouds which float on the heaven of tobacco when I heard a rustling of silk outside and saw the smile of missus Roylake beginning to captivate me through the open door If you throw away your cigar cried this amiable person you will drive me out of the room Dear Gerard I like your smoke My fat man in black coming in at the moment to bring me some soda water looked at his mistress with an expression of amazement and horror which told me that he now saw missus Roylake in the smoking room for the first time I involved myself in new clouds If I suffocated my stepmother her own polite equivocation would justify the act She settled herself opposite to me in an armchair The agonies that she must have suffered in preventing her face from expressing emotions of disgust I dare not attempt to imagine even at this distance of time Now Gerard let us talk about the two ladies What do you think of my friend Lady Rachel I don t like your friend Lady Rachel You astonish me Why I think she s a false woman Heavens what a thing to say of a lady and that lady my friend Her politics may very reasonably have surprised you But surely her vigorous intellect ought to have challenged your admiration you can t deny that I was not clever enough to be able to deny it But I was bold enough to say that Lady Rachel seemed to me to be a woman who talked for the sake of producing effect She expressed opinions as I ventured to declare which in her position I did not believe she could honestly entertain missus Roylake entered a vigorous protest She assured me that I was completely mistaken Lady Rachel she said is the most perfectly candid person in the whole circle of my acquaintance With the best intentions on my part this was more than I could patiently endure Isn t she the daughter of a nobleman I asked Doesn t she owe her rank and her splendor and the respect that people show to her to the fortunate circumstance of her birth And yet she talks as if she was a red republican You yourself heard her say that she was a thorough Radical and hoped she might live to see the House of Lords abolished Oh I heard her And what is more I listened so attentively to such sentiments as these from a lady with a title that I can repeat word for word what she said next We hav n t deserved our own titles we hav n t earned our own incomes and we legislate for the country without having been trusted by the country In short we are a set of impostors and the time is coming when we shall be found out Do you believe she really meant that All as false as false can be that s what I say of it There I stopped privately admiring my own eloquence Quite a mistake on my part my eloquence had done just what missus Roylake wished me to do She wanted an opportunity of dropping Lady Rachel and taking up Lady Lena with a producible reason which forbade the imputation of a personal motive on her part I had furnished her with the reason Thus far I cannot deny it my stepmother was equal to herself Really Gerard you are so violent in your opinions that I am sorry I spoke of Lady Rachel Shall I find you equally prejudiced and equally severe if I change the subject to dear Lady Lena Oh don t say you think She is false too Here missus Roylake made her first mistake She over acted her part and when it was too late she arrived I suspect at that conclusion herself If you hav n t seen that I sincerely admire Lady Lena I said as smartly as I could the sooner you disfigure yourself with a pair of spectacles my dear lady the better She is very pretty perfectly unaffected and if I may presume to judge delightfully well bred and well dressed My stepmother s face actually brightened with pleasure Reflecting on it now I am strongly disposed to think that she had not allowed her feelings to express themselves so unreservedly since the time when she was a girl After all missus Roylake was paying her step son a compliment in trying to entrap him into a splendid marriage It was my duty to think kindly of my ambitious relative I did my duty You really like my sweet Lena she said I am so glad What were you talking about with her She made you exert all your powers of conversation and she seemed to be deeply interested More over acting Another mistake And I could see through it With no English subject which we could discuss in common Lady Lena s ready tact alluded to my past life missus Roylake had told her that I was educated at a German University She had heard vaguely of students with long hair who wore Hessian boots and fought duels and she appealed to my experience to tell her something more I did my best to interest her with very indifferent success and was undeservedly rewarded by a patient attention which presented the unselfish refinements of courtesy under their most perfect form But let me do my step mother justice She contrived to bend me to her will before she left the smoking room I am sure I don t know how You have entertained the charming daughters at dinner she reminded me and the least you can do after that is to pay your respects to their noble father In your position my dear boy you cannot neglect our English customs without producing the worst possible impression In two words I found myself pledged under pretence of visiting my lord to improve my acquaintance with Lady Lena on the next day And pray be careful missus Roylake proceeded still braving the atmosphere of the smoking room not to look surprised if you find Lord Uppercliff s house presenting rather a poor appearance just now I was dying for another cigar and I entirely misunderstood the words of warning which had just been addressed to me I tried to bring our interview to a close by making a generous proposal Does he want money I asked I ll lend him some with the greatest pleasure missus Roylake s horror expressed itself in a little thin wiry scream Oh Gerard what people you must have lived among What shocking ignorance of my lord s enormous fortune He and his family have only just returned to their country seat after a long absence parliament you know and foreign baths and so on and their English establishment is not yet complete I don t know what mistake you may not make next Do listen to what I want to say to you Listening I must acknowledge with an absent mind my attention was suddenly seized by missus Roylake without the slightest conscious effort towards that end on the part of the lady herself The first words that startled me in her flow of speech were these And I must not forget to tell you of poor Lord Uppercliff s misfortune He had a fall some time since and broke his leg As I think he was so unwise as to let a plausible young surgeon set the broken bone Anyway the end of it is that my lord slightly limps when he walks and pray remember that he hates to see it noticed Lady Rachel doesn t agree with me in attributing her father s lameness to his surgeon s want of experience Between ourselves the man seems to have interested her Very handsome very clever very agreeable and the manners of a gentleman When his medical services came to an end he was quite an acquisition at their parties in London with one drawback he mysteriously disappeared and has never been heard of since Ask Lady Lena about it She will give you all the details without her elder sister s bias in favour of the handsome young man What a pretty compliment you are paying me You really look as if I had interested you Knowing what I knew I was unquestionably interested Although the recent return of Lord Uppercliff and his daughter to their country home had as yet allowed no opportunity of a meeting out of doors between the deaf Lodger and the friends whom he had lost sight of no doubt at the time of his serious illness still the inevitable discovery might happen on any day What result would follow And what would be the effect on Lady Rachel when she met with the fascinating young surgeon and discovered the terrible change in him CHAPTER X WARNED We were alone in the glade by the side of the spring At that early hour there were no interruptions to dread but Cristel was ill at ease She seemed to be eager to get back to the cottage as soon as possible Father tells me she began abruptly he saw you at the boathouse And it seemed to him that you were behaving yourself like a friend to that terrible man I reminded her of my having expressed the fear that we had been needlessly hard on him and I added that he had written a letter which confirmed me in that opinion She looked not only disappointed but even alarmed I had hoped she said sadly that father was mistaken So little mistaken I assured her that I am going to drink tea with the man who seems to frighten you I hope he will ask you to meet She recoiled from the bare idea of an invitation Will you hear what I want to tell you she said earnestly You may alter your opinion if you know what I have been foolish enough to do when you saw me go to the other side of the cottage Dear Cristel I know what I owe to your kind interest in me on that occasion Before I could say a word of apology for having wronged her by my suspicions she insisted on an explanation of what I had just said Did he mention it in his letter she asked I owned that I had obtained my information in this way And I declared that he had expressed his admiration of her and his belief in her in terms which made it a subject of regret to me not to be able to show what he had written Cristel forgot her fear of our being interrupted Her dismay expressed itself in a cry that rang through the wood You even believe in his letter she exclaimed mister Gerard His writing in that way to You about Me is a proof that he lies and I ll make you see it If you were anybody else but yourself I would leave you to your fate Yes your fate she passionately repeated Oh forgive me sir I m behaving disrespectfully I beg your pardon No no let me go on When I spoke to him in your best interests as I did most truly believe I never suspected what mischief I had done till I looked in his face Then I saw how he hated you and how vilely he was thinking in secret of me Pure delusion How could I allow it to go on I interrupted her My dear you have quite mistaken him As I have already said he sincerely respects you and he owns that he misjudged me when he and I first met What Is that in his letter too It s worse even than I feared Again and again and again I say it she stamped on the ground in the fervor of her conviction he hates you with the hatred that never forgives and never forgets You think him a good man Do you suppose I would have begged and prayed of my father to send him away without having reasons that justified me mister Gerard you force me to tell you what my unlucky visit did put into his head Yes he does believe believes firmly that you have forgotten what is due to your rank that I have been wicked enough to forget it too and that you are going to take me away from him Say what he may and write what he may he is deceiving you for his own wicked ends If you go to drink tea with him God only knows what cause you may have to regret it Forgive me for being so violent sir I have done now You have made me very wretched but you are too good and kind to mean it Good bye I took her hand I pressed it tenderly I was touched deeply touched No let me write honestly Her eyes betrayed her her voice betrayed her while she said her parting words What I saw what I heard was no longer within the limits of doubt The sweet girl s interest in my welfare was not the merely friendly interest which she herself believed it to be And I said just now that I was touched Cant Lies I loved her more dearly than I had ever loved her yet There is the truth stripped of poor prudery and the mean fear of being called Vain What I might have said to her if the opportunity had offered itself may be easily imagined Before I could open my lips a man appeared on the path which led from the mill to the spring the man whom Cristel had secretly suspected of a design to follow her I felt her hand trembling in my hand and gave it a little encouraging squeeze Let us judge him I suggested by what he says and does on finding us together Without an attempt at concealment on his part he advanced towards us briskly smiling and waving his hand What mister Roylake you have already found out the virtues of your wonderful spring and you are drinking the water before breakfast I have often done it myself when I was not too lazy to get up And this charming girl he went on turning to Cristel has she been trying the virtues of the spring by your advice She won t listen to me or I should have recommended it long since See me set the example He took a silver mug from his pocket and descended the few steps that led to the spring Allowing for the dreadful deaf monotony in his voice no man could have been more innocently joyous and agreeable While he was taking his morning draught I appealed to Cristel s better sense Is this the hypocrite who is deceiving me for his own wicked ends I asked Does he look like the jealous monster who is plotting my destruction and who will succeed if I am fool enough to accept his invitation Poor dear she was as obstinate as ever Think over what I have said to you think for your own sake was her only reply And a little for your sake I ventured to add She ran away from me taking the path which would lead her home again The deaf man and I were left together He looked after her until she was out of sight Then he produced his book of blank leaves But instead of handing it to me as usual he began to write in it himself I have something to say to you he explained It was only possible while the book was in his possession to remind him that I could hear and that he could speak by using the language of signs I touched my lips and pointed to him I touched my ear and pointed to myself Yes he said understanding me with his customary quickness but I want you to remember as well as to hear When I have filled this leaf I shall beg you to keep it about you and to refer to it from time to time He wrote on steadily until he had filled both sides of the slip of paper Quite a little letter he said Pray read it This is what I read You must have seen for yourself that I was incapable of insulting you and Miss Cristel by an outbreak of jealousy when I found you together just now Only remember that we all have our weaknesses and that it is my hard lot to be in a state of contest with the inherited evil which is the calamity of my life With your encouragement I may resist temptation in the future and keep the better part of me in authority over my thoughts and actions But be on your guard and advise Miss Cristel to be on her guard against false appearances As we all know they lie like truth Consider me Pity me I ask no more Straightforward and manly and modest I appeal to any unprejudiced mind whether I should not have committed a mean action if I had placed an evil construction on this Am I understood he asked I signed to him to give me his book and relieved him of anxiety in these words If I had failed to understand you I should have felt ashamed of myself May I show what you have written to Cristel He smiled more sweetly and pleasantly than I had seen him smile yet If you wish it he answered I leave it entirely to you Thank you and good morning Having advanced a few steps on his way to the cottage he paused and reminded me of the tea drinking Don t forget to morrow evening at seven o clock CHAPTER XI WARNED AGAIN The breakfast hour had not yet arrived when I got home I went into the garden to refresh my eyes a little weary of the solemn uniformity of color in Fordwitch Wood by looking at the flowers Reaching the terrace in the first place I heard below me a man s voice speaking in tones of angry authority and using language which expressed an intention of turning somebody out of the garden I at once descended the steps which led to the flower beds The man in authority proved to be one of my gardeners and the man threatened with instant expulsion was the oddly dressed servant of the friend whom I had just left The poor fellow s ugly face presented a picture of shame and contrition the moment I showed myself He piteously entreated me to look over it and to forgive him Wait a little I said Let me see if I have anything to forgive I turned to the gardener What is your complaint of this man He s a trespasser on your grounds sir And his impudence to say the least of it is such as I never met with before What harm has he done Harm sir Yes harm Has he been picking the flowers The gardener looked round him longing to refer me to the necessary evidence and failing to discover it anywhere The wretched trespasser took heart of grace and said a word in his own defence Nobody ever knew me to misbehave myself in a gentleman s garden he said I own sir to having taken a peep at the flowers over the wall And they tempted you to look a little closer at them That s the truth sir So you are fond of flowers Yes sir I once failed in business as a nurseryman but I don t blame the flowers The delightful simplicity of this was lost on the gardener I heard the brute mutter to himself Gammon For once I asserted my authority over my servant Understand this I said to him I don t confine the enjoyment of my garden to myself and my friends Any well behaved persons are welcome to come here and look at the flowers Remember that Now you may go Having issued these instructions I next addressed myself to my friend in the shabby shooting jacket telling him to roam wherever he liked and to stay as long as he pleased Instead of thanking me and using his liberty he hesitated and looked thoroughly ill at ease What s the matter now I asked I m afraid you don t know sir who it is you are so kind to I ve been something else in my time besides a nurseryman What have you been A prize fighter If he expected me to exhibit indignation or contempt he was disappointed My ignorance treated him as civilly as ever What is a prize fighter I inquired The unfortunate pugilist looked at me in speechless bewilderment I told him that I had been brought up among foreigners and that I had never even seen an English newspaper for the last ten years This explanation seemed to encourage the man of few words it set him talking freely at last He delivered a treatise on the art of prizefighting and he did something else which I found more amusing he told me his name To my small sense of humor his name so to speak completed this delightfully odd man it was Gloody As to the list of his misfortunes the endless length of it became so unendurably droll that we both indulged in unfeeling fits of laughter over the sorrows of Gloody The first lucky accident of the poor fellow s life had been literally the discovery of him by his present master This event interested me I said I should like to hear how it had happened Gloody modestly described himself as one of the starving lot sir that looks out for small errands I got my first dinner for three days by carrying a gentleman s portmanteau for him And he if you please was afterwards my master He lived alone Bless you he was as deaf then as he is now He says to me If you bawl in my ears I ll knock you down I thought to myself you wouldn t say that master if you knew how I was employed twenty years ago He took me into his service sir because I was ugly I m so handsome myself he says I want a contrast of something ugly about me You may have noticed that he s a bitter one and bitterly enough he sometimes behaved to me But there s a good side to him He gives me his old clothes and sometimes he speaks almost as kindly to me as you do But for him I believe I should have perished of starvation He suddenly checked himself Whether he was afraid of wearying me or whether some painful recollection had occurred to him it was of course impossible to say The ugly face to which he owed his first poor little morsel of prosperity became overclouded by care and doubt Bursting into expressions of gratitude which I had certainly not deserved expressions so evidently sincere that they bore witness to constant ill usage suffered in the course of his hard life he left me with a headlong haste of movement driven away as I fancied by an unquiet mind I watched him retreating along the path and saw him stop abruptly still with his back to me His deep strong voice travelled farther than he supposed I heard him say to himself What an infernal rascal I am He waited a little and turned my way again Slowly and reluctantly he came back to me As he approached I saw the man who had lived by the public exhibition of his courage looking at me with fear plainly visible in the change of his color and the expression of his face Anything wrong I inquired Nothing wrong sir Might I be so bold as to ask We waited a little I gave him time to collect his thoughts Perhaps the silence confused him Anyhow I was obliged to help him to get on What do you wish to ask of me I said I wished to speak sir He stopped again About what I asked About to morrow evening Well He burst out with it at last Are you coming to drink tea with my master Of course I am coming mister Gloody do you know that you rather surprise me I hope no offence sir Nonsense It seems odd my good fellow that your master shouldn t have told you I was coming to drink tea with him Isn t it your business to get the things ready He shifted from one foot to another and looked as if he wished himself out of my way At a later time of my life I have observed that these are signs by which an honest man is apt to confess that he has told or is going to tell a lie As it was I only noticed that he answered confusedly I can t quite say mister Roylake that my master didn t mention the thing to me But you failed to understand him is that it Well sir if I want to ask him anything I have to write it I m slow at writing and bad at writing and he isn t always patient However as you reminded me just now I have got to get the things ready To cut it short perhaps I might say that I didn t quite expect the tea party would come off Why shouldn t it come off Well sir you might have some other engagement Was this a hint or only an excuse In either case it was high time if he still refused to speak out that I should set him the example You have given me some curious information I said on the subject of fighting with the fists and you have made me understand the difference between fair hitting and foul hitting Are you hitting fair now Very likely I am mistaken but you seem to me to be trying to prevent my accepting your master s invitation He pulled off his hat in a hurry I beg your pardon sir I won t detain you any longer If you will allow me I ll take my leave Don t go mister Gloody without telling me whether I am right or wrong Is there really some objection to my coming to tea tomorrow Quite a mistake sir he said still in a hurry I ve led you wrong without meaning it being an ignorant man and not knowing how to express myself Don t think me ungrateful mister Roylake After your kindness to me I d go through fire and water for you I would His sunken eyes moistened his big voice faltered I let him leave me in mercy to the strong feeling which I had innocently roused But I shook hands with him first Yielding to one of my headlong impulses Yes And doing a very indiscreet thing Wait a little and we shall see CHAPTER XII WARNED FOR THE LAST TIME My loyalty towards the afflicted man whose friendly advances I had seen good reason to return was in no sense shaken His undeserved misfortunes his manly appeal to me at the spring his hopeless attachment to the beautiful girl whose aversion towards him I had unhappily encouraged all pleaded with me in his favour 
5022_29411_000002_000002	train-clean-100	I had accepted his invitation and I had no other engagement to claim me it would have been an act of meanness amounting to a confession of fear if I had sent an excuse

5022_29411_000006_000001	train-clean-100	I was secretly annoyed feeling that my stepmother s singular indifference to domestic interests of paramount importance at other times must have some object in view entirely beyond the reach of my penetration

5022_29411_000011_000000	train-clean-100	Men will wonder what possessed me women will think it a proceeding that did me credit I took the familiar road which led to the gloomy wood and the guilty river 
5022_29411_000011_000001	train-clean-100	The longing in me to see Cristel again was more than I could resist 
5022_29411_000011_000002	train-clean-100	Not because I was in love with her only because I had left her in distress 
none	none	Beyond the spring and within a short distance of the river I saw a lady advancing towards me on the path which led from the mill Brisk smiling tripping along like a young girl behold the mock republican known in our neighborhood as Lady Rachel 
5022_29411_000013_000001	train-clean-100	She held out both hands to me 
none	none	But for her petticoats I should have thought I had met with a jolly young man I have been wandering in your glorious wood mister Roylake Anything to escape the respectable classes on Sunday patronizing piety on the way to afternoon church 
5022_29411_000014_000002	train-clean-100	I must positively make a sketch of the cottage by the mill I mean of course the picturesque side of it 
5022_29411_000014_000003	train-clean-100	That fine girl of Toller s was standing at the door 
none	none	She is really handsomer than ever Are you going to see her you wicked man 
5022_29411_000014_000006	train-clean-100	Which do you admire that gypsy complexion or Lena s lovely skin 
5022_29411_000014_000007	train-clean-100	Both I have no doubt at your age Good bye 
5022_29411_000015_000000	train-clean-100	When we had left each other I thought of the absent Captain in the Navy who was Lady Rachel s husband 
none	none	He was a perfect stranger but I put myself in his place and felt that I too should have gone to sea Old Toller was alone in his kitchen evidently annoyed and angry We are all at sixes and sevens mister Gerard 
5022_29411_000017_000001	train-clean-100	I ve had another row with that deaf devil my new name for him and I think it s rather clever 
none	none	He swears sir that he won t go at the end of his week s notice Says if I think I m likely to get rid of him before he has married Cristy I m mistaken 
5022_29411_000017_000004	train-clean-100	Threatens if any man attempts to take her away he ll shoot her and shoot the man and shoot himself 
none	none	Aha old as I am if he believes he s going to have it all his own way he s mistaken 
5022_29411_000017_000006	train-clean-100	I ll be even with him 
5022_29411_000017_000007	train-clean-100	You mark my words I ll be even with him 
5022_29411_000018_000000	train-clean-100	That old Toller the most exasperating of men judged by a quick temper had irritated my friend into speaking rashly was plain enough Nevertheless I felt some anxiety jealous anxiety I am afraid about Cristel 
5022_29411_000018_000001	train-clean-100	After looking round the kitchen again I asked where she was 
none	none	Sitting forlorn in her bedroom crying her father told me I went out for a walk by the river and I sat down and being Sunday I fell asleep 
5022_29411_000019_000002	train-clean-100	When I woke and got home again just now that was how I found her 
none	none	I don t like to hear my girl crying she s as good as gold and better 
5022_29411_000019_000004	train-clean-100	No sir our deaf devil is not to blame for this 
5022_29411_000019_000005	train-clean-100	He has given Cristy no reason to complain of him 
5022_29411_000019_000006	train-clean-100	She says so herself and she never told a lie yet 
5022_29411_000020_000000	train-clean-100	 But mister Toller I objected something must have happened to distress her 
5022_29411_000020_000001	train-clean-100	Has she not told you what it is 
5022_29411_000021_000000	train-clean-100	 Not she 
5022_29411_000021_000001	train-clean-100	Obstinate about it 
5022_29411_000021_000002	train-clean-100	Leaves me to guess 
none	none	It s clear to my mind mister Gerard that somebody has got at her in my absence and said something to upset her 
5022_29411_000021_000004	train-clean-100	You will ask me who the person is 
none	none	I can t say I have found that out yet
5022_29411_000022_000000	train-clean-100	 But you mean to try 
5022_29411_000023_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes I mean to try 
none	none	He answered me with little of the energy which generally distinguished him 
5022_29411_000024_000001	train-clean-100	Perhaps he was fatigued or perhaps he had something else to think of 
5022_29411_000024_000002	train-clean-100	I offered a suggestion 
5022_29411_000025_000000	train-clean-100	 When we are in want of help I said we sometimes find it nearer than we had ventured to expect at our own doors 
5022_29411_000026_000000	train-clean-100	The ancient miller rose at that hint like a fish at a fly 
none	none	Gloody he cried Find him at once mister Toller He hobbled to the door and looked round at me
5022_29411_000029_000001	train-clean-100	 I ve got burdens on my mind he explained or I should have thought of it too Having done justice to his own abilities he bustled out 
5022_29411_000029_000002	train-clean-100	In less than a minute he was back again in a state of breathless triumph 
5022_29411_000029_000003	train-clean-100	 Gloody has seen the person he announced and what do you think sir it s a woman 
5022_29411_000030_000000	train-clean-100	I beckoned to Gloody waiting modestly at the door to come in and tell me what he had discovered 
none	none	I saw her outside sir rapping at the door here with 
5022_29411_000032_000000	train-clean-100	her parasol 
none	none	That was the servant s report Her parasol Not being acquainted with the development of dress among female servants in England I asked if she was a lady There seemed to be no doubt of it in the man s mind She was also as Gloody supposed a person whom he had never seen before
5022_29411_000033_000000	train-clean-100	 How is it you are not sure of that I said 
none	none	Well sir she was waiting to be let in and I was behind her coming out of the wood Who let her in
5022_29411_000036_000000	train-clean-100	 Miss Cristel His face brightened with an expression of interest when he mentioned the miller s daughter 
5022_29411_000036_000001	train-clean-100	He went on with his story without wanting questions to help him 
none	none	Miss Cristel looked like a person surprised at seeing a stranger what I should call a free and easy stranger 
5022_29411_000036_000003	train-clean-100	She walked in sir as if the place belonged to her 
5022_29411_000037_000000	train-clean-100	I am not suspicious by nature as I hope and believe 
none	none	But I began to be reminded of Lady Rachel already
5022_29411_000038_000000	train-clean-100	 Did you notice the lady s dress I asked 
none	none	A woman who had seen her would have been able to describe every morsel of her dress from head to foot The man had only observed her hat and all he could say was that he thought it a smartish one
5022_29411_000040_000000	train-clean-100	 Any particular color I went on 
5022_29411_000041_000000	train-clean-100	 Not that I know of 
5022_29411_000041_000001	train-clean-100	Dark green I think 
5022_29411_000042_000000	train-clean-100	 Any ornament in it 
none	none	Yes 
5022_29411_000043_000001	train-clean-100	A purple feather 
none	none	The hat I had seen on the head of that hateful woman was now sufficiently described for a man Sly old Toller leaving Gloody unnoticed and keeping his eye on me saw the signs of conviction in my face and said with his customary audacity Who is she I followed at my humble distance the example of Sir Walter Scott when inquisitive people asked him if he was the author of the Waverley Novels In plain English I denied all knowledge of the stranger wearing the green hat 
5022_29411_000045_000001	train-clean-100	But I was naturally desirous of discovering next what Lady Rachel had said and I asked to speak with Cristel 
none	none	Her far seeing father might or might not have perceived a chance of listening to our conversation 
5022_29411_000045_000003	train-clean-100	He led me to the door of his daughter s room and stood close by when I knocked softly and begged that she would come out 
5022_29411_000046_000000	train-clean-100	The tone of the poor girl s voice answering Forgive me sir I can t do it convicted the she socialist as I thought of merciless conduct of some sort 
none	none	Assuming this conclusion to be the right one I determined then and there that Lady Rachel should not pass the doors of Trimley Deen again If her bosom friend resented that wise act of severity by leaving the house I should submit with resignation and should remember the circumstance with pleasure
5022_29411_000047_000000	train-clean-100	 I am afraid you are ill Cristel was all I could find to say under the double disadvantage of speaking through a door and having a father listening at my side 
none	none	Oh no mister Gerard not ill A little low in my mind that s all 
5022_29411_000048_000002	train-clean-100	I don t mean to be rude sir pray be kinder to me than ever pray let me be 
5022_29411_000049_000000	train-clean-100	I said I would return on the next day and left the room with a sore heart 
5022_29411_000050_000000	train-clean-100	Old Toller highly approved of my conduct 
5022_29411_000050_000001	train-clean-100	He rubbed his fleshless hands and whispered You ll get it out of Cristy to morrow and I ll help you 
none	none	I found Gloody waiting for me outside the cottage He was anxious about Miss Cristel his only excuse he told me being the fear that she might be ill 
5022_29411_000051_000002	train-clean-100	Having set him at ease in that particular I said You seem to be interested in Miss Cristel 
none	none	His answer raised him a step higher in my estimation
5022_29411_000053_000000	train-clean-100	 How can I help it sir 
none	none	An odd man with a personal appearance that might excite a prejudice against him in some minds 
5022_29411_000054_000001	train-clean-100	I failed to see it myself in that light 
none	none	It struck me as I walked home that Cristel might have made many a worse friend than the retired prize fighter A change in my manner was of course remarked by missus Roylake s ready observation I told her that I had been annoyed and offered no other explanation Wonderful to relate she showed no curiosity and no surprise 
5022_29411_000055_000003	train-clean-100	More wonderful still at every fair opportunity that offered she kept out of my way 
5022_29411_000056_000000	train-clean-100	My next day s engagement being for seven o clock in the evening I put missus Roylake s self control to a new test 
none	none	With prefatory excuses I informed her that I should not be able to dine at home as usual Impossible as it was that she could have been prepared to hear this her presence of mind was equal to the occasion 
5022_29411_000056_000002	train-clean-100	I left the house followed by my stepmother s best wishes for a pleasant evening 
5022_29411_000057_000000	train-clean-100	Hoping to speak with Cristel alone I had arranged to reach the cottage before seven o clock 
none	none	On the river margin of the wood I was confronted by a wild gleam of beauty in the familiar view for which previous experience had not prepared me Am I wrong in believing that all scenery no matter how magnificent or how homely it may be derives a splendor not its own from favouring conditions of light and shade Our gloomy trees and our repellent river presented an aspect superbly transfigured under the shadows of the towering clouds the fantastic wreaths of the mist and the lurid reddening of the sun as it stooped to its setting 
5022_29411_000058_000003	train-clean-100	Lovely interfusions of sobered color rested faded returned again on the upper leaves of the foliage as they lightly moved 
none	none	The mist rolling capriciously over the waters revealed the grandly deliberate course of the flowing current while it dimmed the turbid earthy yellow that discolored and degraded the stream under the full glare of day 
5022_29411_000058_000005	train-clean-100	While my eyes followed the successive transformations of the view as the hour advanced tender and solemn influences breathed their balm over my mind Days happy days that were past revived 
none	none	Again I walked hand in hand with my mother among the scenes that were round me and learnt from her to be grateful for the beauty of the earth with a heart that felt it 
5022_29411_000058_000007	train-clean-100	We were tracing our way along our favorite woodland path and we found a companion of tender years hiding from us 
none	none	She showed herself blushing hesitating offering a nosegay of wild flowers 
5022_29411_000058_000009	train-clean-100	My mother whispered to me I thanked the little mill girl and gave her a kiss 
5022_29411_000058_000010	train-clean-100	Did I feel the child s breath in my day dream still fluttering on my cheek 
5022_29411_000058_000011	train-clean-100	Was I conscious of her touch 
5022_29411_000058_000012	train-clean-100	I started trembled returned reluctantly to my present self 
5022_29411_000058_000013	train-clean-100	A visible hand touched my arm 
5022_29411_000058_000014	train-clean-100	As I turned suddenly a living breath played on my face 
none	none	The child had faded into a vanishing shade the perfected woman who had grown from her had stolen on me unawares and was asking me to pardon her mister Gerard you were lost in your thoughts I spoke and you never heard me 
5022_29411_000059_000000	train-clean-100	I looked at her in silence 
5022_29411_000060_000000	train-clean-100	Was this the dear Cristel so well known to me 
5022_29411_000060_000001	train-clean-100	Or was it a mockery of her that had taken her place 
none	none	I hope I have not offended you she said
5022_29411_000062_000000	train-clean-100	 You have surprised me I answered 
none	none	Something must have happened since I saw you last 
5022_29411_000062_000002	train-clean-100	What is it 
none	none	Nothing I advanced a step and drew her closer to me 
5022_29411_000064_000001	train-clean-100	A dark flush discolored her face 
none	none	An overpowering brilliancy flashed from her eyes there was an hysterical defiance in her manner Are you excited 
5022_29411_000064_000004	train-clean-100	are you angry 
5022_29411_000064_000005	train-clean-100	are you trying to startle me by acting a part I urged those questions on her one after another and I was loudly and confidently answered 
5022_29411_000065_000000	train-clean-100	 I dare say I am excited mister Gerard by the honor that has been done me You are going to keep your engagement of course 
5022_29411_000065_000001	train-clean-100	Well your friend your favorite friend has invited me to meet you 
5022_29411_000065_000002	train-clean-100	No that s not quite true 
5022_29411_000065_000003	train-clean-100	I invited myself the deaf gentleman submitted 
5022_29411_000066_000000	train-clean-100	 Why did you invite yourself 
5022_29411_000067_000000	train-clean-100	 Because a tea party is not complete without a woman 
none	none	Her manner was as strangely altered as her looks That she was beside herself for the moment I clearly saw That she had answered me unreservedly it was impossible to believe I began to feel angry when I ought to have made allowances for her
5022_29411_000069_000000	train-clean-100	 Is this Lady Rachel s doing I said 
none	none	What do you know of Lady Rachel sir I know that she has visited you and spoken to you Do you know what she has said
5022_29411_000073_000000	train-clean-100	 I can guess 
none	none	mister Gerard don t abuse that good and kind lady She deserves your gratitude as well as mine 
5022_29411_000075_000000	train-clean-100	Her manner had become quieter her face was more composed her expression almost recovered its natural charm while she spoke of Lady Rachel 
5022_29411_000075_000001	train-clean-100	I was stupefied 
5022_29411_000076_000000	train-clean-100	 Try sir to forget it and forgive it she resumed gently if I have misbehaved myself 
none	none	I don t rightly know what I am saying or doing I pointed to the new side of the cottage behind us
5022_29411_000078_000000	train-clean-100	 Is the cause there I asked 
5022_29411_000079_000000	train-clean-100	 No no indeed 
5022_29411_000079_000001	train-clean-100	I have not seen him I have not heard from him 
none	none	His servant often brings me messages Not one message to day
5022_29411_000080_000000	train-clean-100	 Have you seen Gloody to day 
none	none	Oh yes There s one thing if I may make so bold I should like to know mister Gloody is as good to me as good can be we see each other continually living in the same place But you are different and he tells me himself he has only seen you twice 
5022_29411_000081_000004	train-clean-100	What have you done mister Gerard to make him like you so well in that short time 
none	none	I told her that he had been found in my garden looking at the flowers As he had done no harm I said I wouldn t allow the servant to turn him out and I walked round the flower beds with him Little enough to deserve such gratitude as the poor fellow expressed and felt I don t doubt it I had intended to say no more than this But the remembrance of Gloody s mysterious prevarication and of the uneasiness which I had undoubtedly felt when I thought of it afterwards led me I cannot pretend to say how into associating Cristel s agitation with something which this man might have said to her 
5022_29411_000083_000002	train-clean-100	I was on the point of putting the question when she held up her hand and said Hush 
none	none	The wind was blowing towards us from the river side village to which I have already alluded I am not sure whether I have mentioned that the name of the place was Kylam It was situated behind a promontory of the river bank clothed thickly with trees and was not visible from the mill 
5022_29411_000084_000003	train-clean-100	In the present direction of the wind we could hear the striking of the church clock 
5022_29411_000084_000004	train-clean-100	Cristel counted the strokes 
5022_29411_000085_000000	train-clean-100	 Seven she said 
5022_29411_000085_000001	train-clean-100	 Are you determined to keep your engagement 
none	none	She had repeated in an unsteady voice and with a sudden change in her color to paleness the strange question put to me by Gloody 
5022_29411_000086_000001	train-clean-100	In his case I had failed to trace the motive 
5022_29411_000086_000002	train-clean-100	I tried to discover it now 
5022_29411_000087_000000	train-clean-100	 Tell me why I ought to break my engagement I said 
5022_29411_000088_000000	train-clean-100	 Remember what I told you at the spring she answered 
none	none	You are deceived by a false friend who lies to you and hates you 
5022_29411_000089_000000	train-clean-100	The man she was speaking of turned the corner of the new cottage 
5022_29411_000089_000001	train-clean-100	He waved his hand gaily and approached us along the road 
none	none	Go she said Your guardian angel has forgotten you 
5022_29411_000090_000002	train-clean-100	It s too late now 
none	none	Instead of letting me precede her as I had anticipated she ran on before me made a sign to the deaf man as she passed him not to stop her and disappeared through the open door of her father s side of the cottage 
5022_29411_000092_000000	train-clean-100	I was left to decide for myself 
none	none	What should I have done if I had been twenty years older Say that my moral courage would have risen superior to the poorest of all fears the fear of appearing to be afraid and that I should have made my excuses to my host of the evening how would my moral courage have answered him if he had asked for an explanation 
5022_29411_000093_000001	train-clean-100	Useless to speculate on it 
none	none	Had I possessed the wisdom of middle life his book of leaves would not have told him in my own handwriting that I believed in his better nature and accepted his friendly letter in the spirit in which he had written 
5022_29411_000094_000000	train-clean-100	Explain it who can I knew that I was going to drink tea with him and yet I was unwilling to advance a few steps and meet him on the road 
none	none	I find a new bond of union between us he said as he joined me We both feel that He pointed to the grandly darkening view The two men who could have painted the mystery of those growing shadows and fading lights lie in the graves of Rembrandt and Turner 
5022_29411_000095_000003	train-clean-100	Shall we go to tea 
none	none	On our way to his room we stopped at the miller s door Will you inquire he said if Miss Cristel is ready 
5022_29411_000098_000000	train-clean-100	I went in 
5022_29411_000098_000001	train-clean-100	Old Toller was in the kitchen smoking his pipe without appearing to enjoy it 
none	none	What s come to my girl he asked the moment he saw me Yesterday she was in her room crying To day she s in her room praying The warnings which I had neglected rose in judgment against me 
5022_29411_000100_000001	train-clean-100	I was silent I was awed 
5022_29411_000100_000002	train-clean-100	Before I recovered myself Cristel entered the kitchen 
5022_29411_000100_000003	train-clean-100	Her father whispered Look at her 
5022_29411_000101_000000	train-clean-100	Of the excitement which had disturbed I had almost said profaned her beautiful face not a vestige remained 
5022_29411_000101_000001	train-clean-100	Pale composed resolute she said I am ready and led the way out

none	none	She took it CHAPTER XIII THE CLARET JUG I perceived but one change in the Lodger s miserable room since I had seen it last A second table was set against one of the walls Our boiling water for the tea was kept there in a silver kettle heated by a spirit lamp I next observed a delicate little china vase which held the tea and a finely designed glass claret jug with a silver cover Other men possessing that beautiful object would have thought it worthy of the purest Bordeaux wine which the arts of modern adulteration permit us to drink This man had filled the claret jug with water All my valuable property ostentatiously exposed to view he said in his bitterly facetious manner My landlord s property matches it on the big table The big table presented a coarse earthenware teapot cups and saucers with pieces chipped out of them a cracked milk jug a tumbler which served as a sugar basin and an old vegetable dish honored by holding delicate French sweet meats for the first time since it had left the shop My deaf friend in boisterously good spirits pointed backwards and forwards between the precious and the worthless objects on the two tables as if he saw a prospect that delighted him I don t believe the man lives he said who enjoys Contrast as I do What do you want now This question was addressed to Gloody who had just entered the room He touched the earthenware teapot His master answered Let it alone I make the tea at other times the man persisted looking at me What does he say Write it down for me mister Roylake I beg you will write it down There was anger in his eyes as he made that request I took his book and wrote the words harmless words surely He read them and turned savagely to his unfortunate servant In the days when you were a ruffian in the prize ring did the other men s fists beat all the brains out of your head Do you think you can make tea that is fit for mister Roylake to drink He pointed to an open door communicating with another bedroom Gloody s eyes rested steadily on Cristel she failed to notice him being occupied at the moment in replacing the pin of a brooch which had slipped out of her dress The man withdrew into the second bedroom and softly closed the door Our host recovered his good humor He took a wooden stool and seated himself by Cristel Borrowed furniture he said as well as borrowed tea things What a debt of obligation I owe to your excellent father How quiet you are dear girl Do you regret having followed the impulse which made you kindly offer to drink tea with us He suddenly turned to me Another proof mister Roylake of the sisterly interest that she feels in you she can t hear of your coming to my room without wanting to be with you Ah you possess the mysterious attractions which fascinate the sex One of these days some woman will love you as never man was loved yet He addressed himself again to Cristel Still out of spirits I dare say you are tired of waiting for your tea No You have had tea already It s Gloody s fault he ought to have told me that seven o clock was too late for you The poor devil deserved that you should take no notice of him when he looked at you just now Are you one of the few women who dislike an ugly man Women in general I can tell you prefer ugly men A handsome man matches them on their own ground and they don t like that We are so fond of our ugly husbands they set us off to such advantage Oh I don t report what they say I speak the language in which they think mister Roylake does it strike you that the Cur is a sad cynic By the by do you call me the Cur as I suggested when you speak of me to other people to Miss Cristel for instance My charming young friends you both look shocked you both shake your heads Perhaps I am in one of my tolerant humors to day I see nothing disgraceful in being a Cur He is a dog who represents different breeds Very well the English are a people who represent different breeds Saxons Normans Danes The consequence in one case is a great nation The consequence in the other case is the cleverest member of the whole dog family as you may find out for yourself if you will only teach him Ha how I am running on My guests try to slip in a word or two and can t find their opportunity Enjoyment Miss Cristel Excitement mister Roylake For more than a year past I have not luxuriated in the pleasures of society I feel the social glow I love the human family I never never never was such a good man as I am now Let vile slang express my emotions isn t it jolly Cristel and I stopped him at the same moment We instinctively lifted our hands to our ears In his delirium of high spirits he had burst through the invariable monotony of his articulation Without the slightest gradation of sound his voice broke suddenly into a screech prolonged in its own discord until it became perfectly unendurable to hear The effect that he had produced upon us was not lost on him His head sank on his breast horrid shudderings shook him without mercy he said to himself not to us I had forgotten I was deaf There was a whole world of misery in those simple words Cristel kept her place unmoved I rose and put my hand kindly on his shoulder It was the best way I could devise of assuring him of my sympathy He looked up at me in silence His book of leaves was on the table he did once more what he had already done at the spring Instead of using the book as usual he wrote in it himself and then handed it to me Let me spare your nerves a repetition of my deaf discord Sight smell touch taste I would give them all to be able to hear In reminding me of that vain aspiration my infirmity revenges itself my deafness is not accustomed to be forgotten Well I can be silently useful I can make the tea He rose and taking the teapot with him went to the table that had been placed against the wall In that position his back was turned towards us At the same time I felt his book gently taken out of my hand Cristel had been reading while I read over my shoulder She wrote on the next blank leaf Shall I make the tea Now she said to me notice what happens Following him she touched his arm and presented her request He shook his head in token of refusal She came back to her place by me You expected that I said Yes Why did you ask me to notice his refusal Because I may want to remind you that he wouldn t let me make the tea Mysteries my dear Yes mysteries Not to be mentioned more particularly I will mention one of them more particularly After the tea has been made you may possibly feel me touch your knee under the table I was fool enough to smile at this and wise enough afterwards to see in her face that I had made a mistake What is your touch intended to mean I asked It means Wait she said My sense of humor was by this time completely held in check That some surprise was in store for me and that Cristel was resolved not to take me into her confidence were conclusions at which I naturally arrived I felt and surely not without good cause a little annoyed The Lodger came back to us with the tea made As he put the teapot on the table he apologized to Cristel Don t think me rude in refusing your kind offer If there is one thing I know I can do better than anybody else that thing is making tea Do you take sugar and milk mister Roylake I made the affirmative sign He poured out the tea When he had filled two cups the supply was exhausted Cristel and I noticed this He saw it and at once gratified our curiosity It is a rule he said with masters in the art of making tea that one infusion ought never to be used twice If we want any more we will make more and if you feel inclined to join us Miss Cristel we will fill the third cup What was there in this I wondered to make her turn pale And why after what he had just said did I see her eyes willingly rest on him for the first time in my experience Entirely at a loss to understand her I resignedly stirred my tea On the point of tasting it next felt her hand on my knee under the table Bewildered as I was I obeyed my instructions and went on stirring my tea Our host smiled Your sugar takes a long time to melt he said and drank his tea As he emptied the cup the touch was taken off me I followed his example In spite of his boasting the tea was the worst I ever tasted I should have thrown it out of the window if they had offered us such nasty stuff at Trimley Deen When I set down my cup he asked facetiously if I wished him to brew any more My negative answer was a masterpiece of strong expression in the language of signs Instead of sending for Gloody to clear the table he moved away the objects near him so as to leave an empty space at his disposal I ought perhaps to have hesitated before I asked you to spend the evening with me he said speaking with a gentleness and amiability of manner strongly in contrast with his behavior up to this time It is my misfortune as you both well know to be a check on conversation I dare say you have asked yourselves How is he going to amuse us after tea If you will allow me I propose to amuse you by exhibiting the dexterity of my fingers and thumbs Before I was deaf I should have preferred the piano for this purpose As it is an inferior accomplishment must serve my turn He opened a cupboard in the wall close by the second table and returned with a pack of cards Cristel imitated the action of dealing cards for a game No he said that is not the amusement which I have in view Allow me to present myself in a new character I am no longer the Lodger and no longer the Cur My new name is more honorable still I am the Conjurer He shuffled the pack by pouring it backwards and forwards from one hand to the other in a cascade of cards The wonderful ease with which he did it prepared me for something worth seeing Cristel s admiration of his dexterity expressed itself by a prolonged clapping of hands and a strange uneasy laugh As his excitement subsided her agitation broke out I saw the flush again on her face and the fiery brightness in her eyes Once when his attention was engaged she stole a look at the door by which Gloody had left the room Did this indicate another of the mysteries which by her own confession she had in preparation for me My late experience had not inclined me favorably towards mysteries I devoted my whole attention to the Conjurer Whether he chose the easiest examples of skill in sleight of hand is more than I know I can only say that I never was more completely mystified by any professor of legerdemain on the public platform After the performance of each trick he asked leave to time himself by looking at his watch being anxious to discover if he had lost his customary quickness of execution through recent neglect of the necessary practice Of Cristel s conduct while he was amusing us I can only say that it justified missus Roylake s spiteful description of her as a bold girl The more cleverly the tricks were performed the more they seemed to annoy and provoke her I hate being puzzled she said addressing herself of course to me Yes yes his fingers are quicker than my eyes I have heard that explanation before When he has done one of his tricks I want to know how he does it Conjurers are people who ask riddles and when one can t guess them refuse to say what the answer is It s as bad as calling me a fool to suppose that I like being deceived Ah she cried with a shocking insolence of look and manner if our friend could only hear what I am saying He had paused while she was speaking observing her attentively Your face doesn t encourage me he said with a patience and courtesy of manner which it was impossible not to admire I am coming gradually to my greatest triumph and I think I can surprise and please you He timed his last trick and returned to the table placed against the wall Excuse me for a moment he resumed I am suffering as usual after drinking tea I so delight in it that the temptation to night was more than I could resist Tea disagrees with my weak stomach It always produces thirst What nonsense he talks Cristel exclaimed All mere fancy He reminds me of the old song called The Nervous Man Do you know it mister Roylake In spite of my efforts to prevent her she burst out with the first verse of a stupid comic song Spared by his deafness from this infliction of vulgarity our host filled a tumbler from the water in the claret jug and drank it As he set the tumbler down we were startled by an accident in the next room The floor was suddenly shaken by the sound of a heavy fall The fall was followed by a groan which instantly brought me to my feet Although his infirmity made him unconscious of the groan my friend felt the vibration of the floor and saw me start up from my chair He looked even more alarmed than I was judging by the ghastly change that I saw in his color and he reached the door of the second room as soon as I did It is needless to say that I allowed him to enter first On the point of following him I felt myself roughly pulled back When I turned round and saw Cristel I did really and truly believe that she was mad The furious impatience in her eyes the frenzied strength of her grasp on my arm would have led most other men to form the same conclusion Come she cried No not a word There isn t a moment to lose She dragged me across the room to the table on which the claret jug stood She filled the tumbler from it as he had filled the tumbler The material of which the jug had been made was so solid crystal not glass as I had supposed that the filling of the two tumblers emptied it Cristel held the water out to me gasping for breath trembling as if she saw some frightful reptile before her instead of myself Drink it she said if you value your life I should of course have found it perfectly easy to obey her strange as her language was if I had been in full possession of myself Between distress and alarm my mind I suppose had lost its balance With or without a cause I hesitated She crossed the room and threw open the window which looked out on the river You shan t die alone she said If you don t drink it I ll throw myself out I drank from the tumbler to the last drop It was not water It had a taste which I can compare to no drink and to no medicine known to me I thought of the other strange taste peculiar to the tea At last the tremendous truth forced itself on my mind The man in whom my boyish generosity had so faithfully believed had attempted my life Cristel took the tumbler from me My poor angel clasped her free arm round my neck and pressed her lips in an ecstasy of joy on my cheek The next instant she seized the claret jug and dashed it into pieces on the floor Get the jug from his washhand stand she said When I gave it to her she poured some of the water upon the broken fragments of crystal scattered on the floor I had put the jug back in its place and was returning to Cristel when the poisoner showed himself entering from the servant s room Don t be alarmed he said Gloody s name ought to be Glutton An attack of giddiness thoroughly well deserved I have relieved him You remember mister Roylake that I was once a surgeon The broken claret jug caught his eye We have all read of men who were petrified by terror Of the few persons who have really witnessed that spectacle I am one The utter stillness of him was really terrible to see Cristel wrote in his book an excuse no doubt prepared beforehand That fall in the next room frightened me and I felt faint I went to get some water from the jug you drank out of and it slipped from my hand She placed those words under his eyes she might just as well have shown them to the dog A dead man erect on his feet so he looked to our eyes So he still looked when I took Cristel s arm and led her out of that dreadful presence Take me into the air she whispered A burst of tears relieved her after the unutterable suspense that she had so bravely endured When she was in some degree composed again we walked gently up and down for a minute or two in the cool night air Don t speak to me she said as we stopped before her father s door I am not fit for it yet I know what you feel I pressed her to my heart and let the embrace speak for me She yielded to it faintly sighing To morrow I whispered She bent her head and left me Walking home through the wood I became aware little by little that my thoughts were not under the customary control Over and over again I tried to review the events of that terrible evening and failed Fragments of other memories presented themselves and then deserted me Nonsense absolute nonsense found its way into my mind next and rose in idiotic words to my lips I grew too lazy even to talk to myself I strayed from the path The mossy earth began to rise and sink under my feet like the waters in a ground swell at sea I stood still in a state of idiot wonder The ground suddenly rose right up to my face I remember no more My first conscious exercise of my senses when I revived came to me by way of my ears Leaden weights seemed to close my eyes to fetter my movements to silence my tongue to paralyze my touch But I heard a wailing voice speaking close to me so close that it might have been my own voice I distinguished the words I knew the tones Oh my master my lord who am I that I should live and you die and you die Was it her warm young breath that quickened me with its vigorous life I only know that the revival of my sense of touch did certainly spring from the contact of her lips pressed to mine in the reckless abandonment of grief without hope Her cry of joy when my first sigh told her that I was still a living creature ran through me like an electric shock I opened my eyes I held out my hand I tried to help her when she raised my head and set me against the tree under which I had been stretched helpless With an effort I could call her by her name Even that exhausted me My mind was so weak that I should have believed her if she had declared herself to be a spirit seen in a dream keeping watch over me in the wood Wiser than I was she snatched up my hat ran on before me and was lost in the darkness An interval an unendurable interval passed She returned having filled my hat from the spring But for the exquisite coolness of the water falling on my face trickling down my throat I should have lost my senses again In a few minutes more I could take that dear hand and hold it to me as if I was holding to my life We could only see each other obscurely and in that very circumstance as we confessed to each other afterwards we found the needful composure before we could speak Cristel what does it mean Poison she answered And he has suffered too To my astonishment there was no anger in her tone she spoke of him as quietly as if she had been alluding to an innocent man Do you mean that he has been at death s door like me Yes thank God or I should never have found you here Poor old Gloody came to us in search of help My master s in a swoon and I can t bring him to Directly I heard that I remembered that you had drunk what he had drunk What had happened to him must have happened to you Don t ask me how long it was before I found you and what I felt when I did find you I do so want to enjoy my happiness Only let me see you safely home and I ask no more She helped me to rise with the encouraging words which she might have used to a child She put my arm in hers and led me carefully along through the wood as if I had been an old man Cristel had saved my life but she would hear of no allusion to it She knew how the poisoner had plotted to get rid of me but nothing that I could say induced her to tell me how she had made the discovery In view of Trimley Deen my guardian angel dropped my arm Go on she said and let me see the servant let you in before I run home If she had not been once more wiser than I was I should have taken her with me to the house I should have positively refused to let her go back by herself Nothing that I could say or do had the slightest effect on her resolution Does the man live who could have taken leave of her calmly in my place She tore herself away from me with a sigh of bitterness that was dreadful to hear Oh my darling I said do I distress you Horribly she answered but you are not to blame Those were her farewell words I called after her I tried to follow her She was lost to me in the darkness CHAPTER XIV GLOODY SETTLES THE ACCOUNT A night of fever a night when I did slumber for a few minutes of horrid dreams this was what I might have expected and this is what really happened The fresh morning air flowing through my open window cooled and composed me the mercy of sleep found me When I woke and looked at my watch I was a new man The hour was noon I rang my bell The servant announced that a man was waiting to see me The same man sir who was found in the garden looking at your flowers I at once gave directions to have him shown up into my bedroom The delay of dressing was more than I had patience to encounter Unless I was completely mistaken here was the very person whom I wanted to enlighten me Gloody showed himself at the door with a face ominously wretched as well as ugly I instantly thought of Cristel If you bring me bad news I said don t keep me waiting for it It s nothing that need trouble You sir I m dismissed from my master s service that s all It was plainly not all Relieved even by that guarded reply I pointed to a chair by the bedside Do you believe that I mean well by you I asked I do sir with all my heart
4853_29413_000013_000000	train-clean-100	 Then sit down Gloody and make a clean breast of it 
none	none	He lifted his enormous fist by way of emphasizing his answer I was within a hair s breadth sir of striking him 
4853_29413_000015_000001	train-clean-100	If I hadn t kept my temper I might have killed him 
none	none	What did he do
4853_29413_000017_000000	train-clean-100	 Flew into a furious rage 
none	none	I don t complain of that I daresay I deserved it Please to excuse my getting up again 
4853_29413_000017_000003	train-clean-100	I can t look you in the face and tell you of it He walked away to the window 
none	none	Even a poor devil like me does sometimes feel it when he is insulted 
4853_29413_000017_000005	train-clean-100	mister Roylake he kicked me 
none	none	Say no more about it sir I would never have mentioned it if I hadn t had something else to tell you only I don t know how In this difficulty he came back to my bedside Look here sir What I say is that kick has wiped out the debt of thanks I owe him Yes I say the account between us two is settled now on both sides 
4853_29413_000017_000012	train-clean-100	In two words sir if you mean to charge him before the magistrates with attempting your life I ll take my Bible oath he did attempt it and you may call me as your witness 
none	none	There Now it s out What his master had no doubt inferred was what I saw plainly too Cristel had saved my life and had been directed how to do it by the poor fellow who had suffered in my cause We will wait a little before we talk of setting the law in force I said In the meantime Gloody I want you to tell me what you would tell the magistrate if I called you as a witness He considered a little The magistrate would put questions to me wouldn t he sir 
4853_29413_000020_000002	train-clean-100	Very good 
none	none	You put questions to me and I ll answer them to the best of my ability The investigation that followed was far too long and too wearisome to be related here If I give the substance of it I shall have done enough Sometimes when he was awake and supposed that he was alone sometimes when he was asleep and dreaming the Cur had betrayed himself It was a paltry vengeance I own to gratify a malicious pleasure as I did now in thinking of him and speaking of him by the degrading name which his morbid humility had suggested But are the demands of a man s dignity always paid in the ready money of prompt submission Anyway it appeared that Gloody had heard enough in the sleeping moments and the solitary moments of his master to give him some idea of the jealous hatred with which the Cur regarded me He had done his best to warn me without actually betraying the man who had rescued him from starvation or the workhouse and he had failed But his resolution to do me good service in return for my kindness to him far from being shaken was confirmed by circumstances When his master returned to the chemical studies which have been already mentioned Gloody was employed as assistant to the extent of his limited capacity for making himself useful He had no reason to suppose that I was the object of any of the experiments until the day before the tea party Then he saw the dog enticed into the new cottage and apparently killed by the administration of poison of some sort After an interval a dose of another kind was poured down the poor creature s throat and he began to revive A lapse of a quarter of an hour followed the last dose was repeated and the dog soon sprang to his feet again as lively as ever Gloody was thereupon told to set the animal free and was informed at the same time that he would be instantly dismissed if he mentioned to any living creature what he had just seen By what process he arrived at the suspicion that my safety might be threatened by the experiment on the dog he was entirely unable to explain It was borne in on my mind sir and that s all I can tell you he said
4853_29413_000026_000001	train-clean-100	 I didn t dare speak to you about it you wouldn t have believed me 
none	none	Or if you did believe me you might have sent for the police 
4853_29413_000026_000003	train-clean-100	The one way of putting a stop to murdering mischief if murdering mischief it might be was to trust Miss Cristel 
none	none	That she was fond of you I don t mean any offence sir I pretty well guessed That she was true as steel and not easily frightened I didn t need to guess I knew it Gloody had done his best to prepare Cristel for the terrible confidence which he had determined to repose in her and had not succeeded What the poor girl must have suffered I could but too readily understand on recalling the startling changes in her look and manner when we met at the river margin of the wood She was pledged to secrecy under penalty of ruining the man who was trying to save me and to her presence of mind was trusted the whole responsibility of preserving my life What a situation for a girl of eighteen We made it out between us sir in two ways Gloody proceeded First and foremost she was to invite herself to tea And being at the table she was to watch my master Whatever she saw him drink she was to insist on your drinking it too You heard me ask leave to make the tea Yes Well that was one of the signals agreed on between us When he sent me away we were certain of what he had it in his mind to do
4853_29413_000031_000000	train-clean-100	 And when you looked at Miss Cristel and she was too busy with her brooch to notice you was that another signal 
none	none	It was sir When she handled her silver ornament she told me that I might depend on her to forget nothing and to be afraid of nothing I remembered the quiet firmness in her face after the prayer that she had said in her own room Her steady resolution no longer surprised me Did you wonder sir what possessed her Gloody went on when she burst out singing That was a signal to me We wanted him out of our way while you were made to drink what he had drunk out of the jug How did you know that he would not drink the whole contents of the jug You forget sir that I had seen the dog revived by two doses given with a space of time between them I ought to have remembered this after what he had already told me My intelligence brightened a little as I went on And your accident in the next room was planned of course I said
4853_29413_000038_000001	train-clean-100	 Do you think he saw through it 
none	none	I should say No judging by his looks 
4853_29413_000038_000003	train-clean-100	He turned pale when he felt the floor shaken by your fall 
none	none	For once in a way he was honest honestly frightened I noticed the same thing sir when he picked me up off the floor A man who can change his complexion at will is a man we hav n t heard of yet mister Roylake I had been dressing for some time past longing to see Cristel it is needless to say Is there anything more I asked that I ought to know Only one thing mister Roylake that I can think of Gloody replied I m afraid it s Miss Cristel s turn next What do you mean While the deaf man lodges at the cottage he means mischief and his eye is on Miss Cristel Early this morning sir I happened to be at the boat house Somebody I leave you to guess who it is has stolen the oars I was dressed by this time and so eager to get to the cottage that I had already opened my door What I had just heard brought me back into the room As a matter of course we both suspected the same person of stealing the oars 
4853_29413_000045_000003	train-clean-100	Had we any proof to justify us 
4853_29413_000046_000000	train-clean-100	Gloody at once acknowledged that we had no proof 
4853_29413_000046_000001	train-clean-100	 I happened to look at the boat he said and I missed the oars 
none	none	Oh yes I searched the boat house No oars no oars And nothing more that you have forgotten and ought to tell me
4853_29413_000048_000000	train-clean-100	 Nothing sir 
none	none	I left Gloody to wait my return being careful to place him under the protection of the upper servants who would see that he was treated with respect by the household generally CHAPTER XV THE MILLER S HOSPITALITY On the way to Toller s cottage my fears for Cristel weighed heavily on my mind That the man who had tried to poison me was capable of committing any other outrage provided he saw a prospect of escaping with impunity no sane person could hesitate to conclude But the cause of my alarm was not to be traced to this conviction It was a doubt that made me tremble After what I had myself seen and what Gloody had told me could I hope to match my penetration or the penetration of any person about me whom I could trust against the fathomless cunning the Satanic wickedness of the villain who was still an inmate with Cristel under her father s roof I have spoken of his fathomless cunning and his Satanic wickedness The manner in which the crime had been prepared and carried out would justify stronger expressions still Such was the deliberate opinion of the lawyer whom I privately consulted under circumstances still to be related Let us arrive at a just appreciation of the dangerous scoundrel whom we have to deal with this gentleman said His preliminary experiment with the dog his resolution to make suspicion an impossibility by drinking from the same tea which he had made ready for you his skilled preparation of an antidote the color of which might court appearances by imitating water are there many poisoners clever enough to provide themselves beforehand with such a defence as this How are you to set the circumstances in their true light on your side You may say that you threw out the calculations on which he had relied for securing his own safety by drinking his second dose of the antidote while he was out of the room and you can appeal to the fainting fits from which you and he suffered on the same evening as a proof that the action of the poison was partially successful in your case and in his because you and he were insufficiently protected by half doses only of the antidote A bench of Jesuits would understand these refinements A bench of British magistrates would look at each other and say Where is the medical evidence No mister Roylake we must wait You can t even turn him out of the cottage before he has had the customary notice to quit The one thing to take care of in case some other suspicions of ours turn out to be well founded is that our man shall not give us the slip One of my clerks and one of your gamekeepers shall keep watch on his lodgings turn and turn about till his time is up Go where he may after that he shall not escape us I may now take up the chain of events again On reaching Toller s cottage I was distressed but hardly surprised to hear that Cristel exhausted after a wakeful night still kept her bed in the hope of getting some sleep I was so anxious to know if she was at rest that her father went upstairs to look at her I followed him and saw Ponto watching on the mat outside her door Did this indicate a wise distrust of the Cur A guardian I can trust sir the old man whispered while I m at the mill He looked into Cristel s room and permitted me to look over his shoulder My poor darling was peacefully asleep Judging by the miller s manner which was as cool and composed as usual I gathered that Cristel had wisely kept him in ignorance of what had happened on the previous evening The inquiry which I had next in my mind was forestalled by old Toller Our deaf devil mister Gerard has done a thing this morning which puzzles me he began and I should like to hear what you think of it For the first time since we have had him here he has opened his door to a visitor And what a surprise for you it s the other devil with the hat and feather who got at my Cristy and made her cry That this meeting would be only too likely to happen in due course of time I had never doubted That it had happened now confirmed me in my resolution to keep guard over Cristel at the cottage till the Cur left it I asked of course how those two enemies of mine had first seen each other She was just going to knock at our door mister Gerard when she happened to look up There he was airing himself at his window as usual Do you think she was too much staggered at the sight of him to speak At any rate he got the start of her Wait till I come down says he and there he was almost as soon as he said it They went into his place together and for best part of an hour they were in each other s company Every man has his failings I don t deny that I m a little inquisitive by nature Between ourselves I got under the open window and listened At a great disadvantage I needn t tell you for she was obliged to write what she had to say But he talked I was too late for the cream of it I only heard him wish her good bye If your ladyship telegraphs this morning says he when will the man come to me Now what do you say to that More than I have time to say now mister Toller Can you find me a messenger to take a note to Trimley Deen We have no messengers in this lonesome place sir Very well Then I must take my own message You will see me again as soon as I can get back mister Toller s ready curiosity was roused in a moment Perhaps you wish to have a look at the repairs he suggested in his most insinuating manner I wish to see what her ladyship s telegram brings forth I said and mean to be here when the man arrives My venerable tenant was delighted Turn him inside out sir and get at his secrets I ll help you Returning to Trimley Deen I ordered the pony chaise to be got ready and a small portmanteau to be packed speaking in the hall The sound of my voice brought missus Roylake out of the morning room She was followed by Lady Rachel If I could only have heard their private conference I should have seen the dangerous side of the Cur s character under a new aspect Gerard cried my stepmother what did I hear just now You can t be going back to Germany Certainly not I answered Going to stay with some friends perhaps Lady Rachel suggested I wonder whether I know them It was spitefully done but in respect of tone and manner done to perfection The pony chaise drew up at the door This was another of the rare occasions in my life on which I acted discreetly It was necessary for me to say something I said Good morning Nothing had happened at the cottage during the interval of my absence Clever as he was old Toller had never suspected that I should return to him with luggage in the character of a self invited guest His jaw dropped and his wicked little eyes appealed to the sky Merciful Providence what have I done to deserve this There as I read him was the thought in the miller s mind expressed in my best English Have you got a spare bed in the house I asked mister Toller forgot the respect due to the person who could stop the repairs at a moment s notice He answered in the tone of a man who had been grossly insulted No But for the anxieties that oppressed me I should have only perceived the humorous side of old Toller s outbreak of temper He had chosen his time badly and he got a serious reply Understand this I said either you receive me civilly or you make up your mind to find a flour mill on some other property than mine This had its effect The miller s servility more than equalled his insolence With profuse apologies he offered me his own bedroom I preferred a large old fashioned armchair which stood in a corner of the kitchen Listening in a state of profound bewilderment longing to put inquisitive questions and afraid to do so Toller silently appealed to my compassion I had nothing to conceal I mentioned my motive Without intending it I had wounded him in one of his most tender places the place occupied by his good opinion of himself He said with sulky submission Much obliged mister Gerard My girl is safe under my protection Leave it to me sir leave it to me I had just reminded old Toller of his age and of the infirmities which age brings with it when his daughter pale and languid with signs of recent tears in her eyes entered the kitchen When I approached her she trembled and drew back apparently designing to leave the room Her father stopped her mister Gerard has something to tell you he said I m off to the mill He took up his hat and left us Submitting sadly she let me take her in my arms and try to cheer her But when I alluded to what I owed to her admirable devotion and courage she entreated me to be silent Don t bring it all back she cried shuddering at the remembrances which I had awakened Father said you had something to tell me What is it I repeated in language more gentle and more considerate what I had already said to her father She took my hand and kissed it gratefully You have your mother s face and your mother s heart she said you are always good you are never selfish But it mustn t be How can I let you suffer the discomfort of staying here Indeed I am in no danger you are alarming yourself without a cause How can you be sure of that I asked She looked reluctantly at the door of communication Must I speak of him Only to tell me I pleaded whether you have seen him since last night She had both seen him and heard from him on reaching home He opened that door she told me and threw on the floor one of the leaves out of his book After doing that he relieved me from the sight of him Show me the leaf Cristel Father has got it I thought he was asleep in the armchair He snatched it out of my hand It isn t worth reading She turned pale nevertheless when she replied in those terms I could see that I was disturbing her when I asked if she remembered what the Cur had written But our position was far too serious to be trifled with I suppose he threatened you I said trying to lead her on What did he say He said if any attempt was made to remove me out of his reach after what had happened that evening my father would find him on the watch day and night and would regret it to the end of his life The wretch thinks me cruel enough to have told my father of the horrors we went through You know that he has dismissed his poor old servant Was I wrong in advising Gloody to go to you You were quite right He is at my house and I should like to keep him at Trimley Deen but I am afraid he and the other servants might not get on well together Will you let him come here She spoke earnestly reminding me that I had thought it wrong to leave her father at his age without someone to help him If an accident separated me from him she went on he would be left alone in this wretched place What accident are you thinking of I asked Is there something going on Cristel that I don t know of Had I startled her or had I offended her Can we tell what may or may not happen to us in the time to come she asked abruptly I don t like to think of my father being left without a creature to take care of him Gloody is so good and so true and they always get on well together If you have nothing better in view for him My dear I have nothing half so good in view and Gloody I am sure will think so too I privately resolved to insure a favorable reception for the poor fellow by making him the miller s partner Bank notes in Toller s pocket What a place reserved for Gloody in Toller s estimation But I confess that Cristel s allusion to a possible accident rather oppressed my mind situated as we were at that time What we talked of next has slipped from my memory I only recollect that she made an excuse to go back to her room and that nothing I could say or do availed to restore her customary cheerfulness As the twilight was beginning to fade we heard the sound of a carriage The new man had arrived in a fly from the station Before bedtime he made his appearance in the kitchen to receive the domestic instructions of which a stranger stood in need A quiet man and a civil man even my prejudiced examination could discover nothing in him that looked suspicious I saw a well trained servant and I saw nothing more Old Toller made a last attempt to persuade me that it was not worth a gentleman s while to accept his hospitality and found me immovable I was equally obstinate when Cristel asked leave to make up a bed for me in the counting house at the mill With the purpose that I had in view if I accepted her proposal I might as well have been at Trimley Deen Left alone I placed the armchair and another chair for my feet across the door of communication That done I examined a little door behind the stairs used I believe for domestic purposes which opened on a narrow pathway running along the river side of the house It was properly locked I have only to add that nothing happened during the night The next day showed no alteration for the better in Cristel She made an excuse when I proposed to take her out with me for a walk Her father s business kept him away from the cottage and thus gave me many opportunities of speaking to her in private I was so uneasy or so reckless I hardly know which that I no longer left it to be merely inferred that I had resolved to propose marriage to her My sweet girl you are so wretched and so unlike yourself in this place that I entreat you to leave it Come with me to London and let me make you safe and happy as my wife Oh mister Roylake Why do you call me mister Roylake Have I done anything to offend you There seems to be some estrangement between us Do you believe that I love you I wish I could doubt it she answered Why You know why Cristel Have I made some dreadful mistake The truth I want the truth Do you love me A low cry of misery burst from her Was she mastered by love or by despair She threw herself on my breast I kissed her She murmured Oh don t tempt me Don t tempt me Again and again I kissed her Ah I broke out in the ecstasy of my sense of relief I know that you love me now Yes she said simply and sadly I do love you My selfish passion asked for more even than this Prove it by being my wife I answered She put me back from her firmly and gently I will prove it Gerard by not letting you disgrace yourself With those horrible words put into her mouth beyond all doubt by the woman who had interfered between us she left me The long hours of the day passed I saw her no more People who are unable to imagine what I suffered are not the people to whom I now address myself After all the years that have passed after age and contact with the world have hardened me it is still a trial to my self control to look back to that day Events I can remember with composure To events therefore let me return No communication of any sort reached us from the Cur Towards evening I saw him pacing up and down on the road before the cottage and speaking to his new servant The man listening attentively had the master s book of leaves in his hand and wrote in it from time to time as replies were wanted from him He was probably receiving instructions The Cur s discretion was a bad sign I should have felt more at ease if he had tried to annoy Cristel or to insult me Towards bedtime old Toller s sense of hospitality exhibited marked improvement He was honored and happy to have me under his poor roof a roof by the way which was also in need of repairs but he protested against my encountering the needless hardship of sleeping in a chair when a bed could be set up for me in the counting house Not what you re used to mister Gerard Empty barrels and samples of flour and account books smelling strong of leather instead of velvet curtains and painted ceilings but better than a chair sir better than a chair I was as obstinate as ever With thanks I insisted on the chair Feverish anxious oppressed in my breathing with nerves unstrung as a doctor would have put it I disturbed the order of the household towards twelve o clock by interfering with old Toller in the act of locking up the house door Let me get a breath of fresh air I said to him or there will be no sleep for me to night He opened the door with a resignation to circumstances so exemplary that it claimed some return I promised to be back in a quarter of an hour Old Toller stifled a yawn I call that truly considerate he said and stifled another yawn Dear old man Stepping into the road I first examined the Cur s part of the cottage Not a sound was audible inside not a creature was visible outside The usual dim light was burning behind the window that looked out on the road Nothing absolutely nothing that was suspicious could I either hear or see I walked on by what we called the upper bank of the river leading from the village of Kylam The night was cloudy and close Now the moonlight reached the earth at intervals now again it was veiled in darkness The trees at this part of the wood so encroached on the bank of the stream as considerably to narrow and darken the path Seeing a possibility of walking into the river if I went on much farther I turned back again in the more open direction of Kylam and kept on briskly as I reckon for about five minutes more I had just stopped to look at my watch when I saw something dark floating towards me urged by the slow current of the river As it came nearer I thought I recognized the mill boat It was one of the dark intervals when the moon was overcast I was sufficiently interested to follow the boat on the chance that a return of the moonlight might show me who could possibly be in it After no very long interval the yellow light for which I was waiting poured through the lifting clouds The mill boat beyond all doubt and nobody in it The empty inside of the boat was perfectly visible to me Even if I had felt inclined to do so it would have been useless to jump into the water and swim to the boat There were no oars in it and therefore no means of taking it back to the mill The one thing I could do was to run to old Toller and tell him that his boat was adrift On my way to the cottage I thought I heard a sound like the shutting of a door I was probably mistaken In expectation of my return the door was secured by the latch only and the miller looking out of his bedroom window said Don t forget to lock it sir the key s inside I followed my instructions and ascended the stairs Surprised to hear me in that part of the house he came out on the landing in his nightgown What is it he asked Nothing very serious I said The boat s adrift I suppose it will run on shore somewhere It will do that mister Gerard everybody along the river knows the boat He held up his lean trembling hand Old fingers don t always tie fast knots He went back into his bed It was opposite the window and the window being at the side of the old cottage looked out on the great open space above the river When the moonlight appeared it shone straight into his eyes I offered to pull down the blind Thank you kindly sir please to let it be I wake often in the night and I like to see the heavens when I open my eyes Something touched me behind it was the dog Like his noble and beautiful race Ponto knew his friends He licked my hand and then he walked out through the bedroom door Instead of taking his usual place on the mat before Cristel s room he smelt for a moment under the door whined softly and walked up and down the landing What s the matter with the dog I asked Restless to night said old Toller Dogs are restless sometimes Lie down he called through the doorway The dog obeyed but only for a moment He whined at the door again and then once more he walked up and down the landing I went to the bedside The old man was just going to sleep I shook him by the shoulder There s something wrong I said Come out and look at Ponto He grumbled but he came out Better get the whip he said Before you do that I answered knock at your daughter s door And wake her he asked in amazement I knocked at the door myself There was no reply I knocked again with the same result Open the door I said or I will do it myself He obeyed me The room was empty and the bed had not been slept in Standing helpless on the threshold of the door I looked into the empty room hearing nothing but my heart thumping heavily seeing nothing but the bed with the clothes on it undisturbed The sudden growling of the dog shook me back if I may say so into the possession of myself He was looking through the balusters that guarded the landing The head of a man appeared slowly ascending the stairs Acting mechanically I held the dog back Thinking mechanically I waited for the man The face of the new servant showed itself The dog frightened him he spoke in tones that trembled standing still on the stairs My master has sent me sir A voice below interrupted him Come back I heard the Cur say I ll do it myself Toller where is Toller The enraged dog barking furiously struggled to get away from me I dragged him the good honest creature who was incapable of concealments and treacheries into his master s room In the moment before I closed the door again I saw Toller down on his knees with his arms laid helplessly on the window sill staring up at the sky as if he had gone mad There was no time for questions I drove poor Ponto back into the room and shut the door On the landing I found myself face to face with the Cur You he said I lifted my hand The servant ran between us For God s sake control yourself sir We mean no harm It s only to tell mister Toller that his boat is missing mister Toller knows it already I said No honest man would touch your master if he could help it I warn him to go and I make him understand me by a sign I pointed down the stairs and turned my head to look at him He was no longer before me His face hideously distorted by rage and terror showed itself at the door of Cristel s empty room He rushed out on me his voice rose to the detestable screech which I had heard once already Where have you hidden her Give her back to me or you die He drew a pistol out of the breast pocket of his coat I seized the weapon by the barrel and snatched it away from him As the charge exploded harmlessly between us I struck him on the head with the butt end of the pistol He dropped on the landing The door of Toller s room opened behind me He stood speechless the report of the pistol had terrified him In the instant when I looked at the old man I saw through the window of his room a rocket soar into the sky from behind the promontory between us and Kylam Some cry of surprise must I suppose have escaped me Toller suddenly looked round towards the window just as the last fiery particles of the rocket were floating slowly downwards against the black clouds I had barely time enough to see this before a trembling hand was laid on my shoulder from behind The servant white with terror pointed to his master Have you killed him the man said The same question must have been in the mind of the dog He was quiet now Doubtfully reluctantly he was smelling at the prostrate human creature I knelt down and put my hand on the wretch s heart Ponto finding us both on a level together gave me the dog s kiss I returned the caress with my free hand The servant saw me with my attention divided in this way between the animal and the man Damn it sir he burst out indignantly isn t a Christian of more importance than a dog A Christian but I was in no humor to waste words Are you strong enough to carry him to his own side of the house I asked I won t touch him if he s dead He is not dead Take him away All this time my mind was pre occupied by the extraordinary appearance of the rocket rising from the neighborhood of a lonely little village between midnight and one in the morning How I connected that mysterious signal with a possibility of tracing Cristel it is useless to inquire That was the thought in me when I led my lost darling s father back to his room Without stopping to explain myself I reminded him that the cottage was quiet again and told him to wait my return In the kitchen I overtook the servant and his burden The door of communication by which they had entered was still open Lock that door I said Lock it yourself he answered I ll have nothing to do with this business He passed through the doorway and along the passage and ascended his master s stairs It struck me directly that the man had suggested a sure way of protecting Toller during my absence The miller s own door was already secured I took the key so as to be able to let myself in again then passed through the door of communication fastened it and put the key in my pocket The third door by which the Cur entered his lodgings was of course at my disposal I had just closed it when I discovered that I had a companion Ponto had followed me I felt at once that the dog s superior powers of divination might be of use on such an errand as mine was We set out together for Kylam Wildly hurried without any fixed idea in my mind I ran to Kylam for the greater part of the way It was now very dark On a sandy creek below the village I came in contact with something solid enough to hurt me for the moment It was the stranded boat A smoker generally has matches about him Helped by my little short lived lights I examined the interior of the boat There was absolutely nothing in it but a strip of old tarpaulin used as I guessed to protect the boat or something that it carried in rainy weather The village population had long since been in bed Silence and darkness mercilessly defied me to discover anything For a while I waited encouraging the dog to circle round me and exercise his sense of smell Any suspicious person or object he would have certainly discovered Nothing not even the fallen stick of the rocket rewarded our patience Determined to leave nothing untried I groped rather than found my way to the village ale house and succeeded at last in rousing the landlord He hailed me from the window naturally enough in no friendly voice I called out my name Within my own little limits it was the name of a celebrated person The landlord opened his door directly eager to answer my questions if he could do it Nothing in the least out of the common way had happened at Kylam No strangers had been seen in or near the place The stranded boat had not been discovered and the crashing flight of the rocket into the air had failed to disturb the soundly sleeping villagers On my melancholy way back fatigue of body and far worse fatigue of mind forced me to take a few minutes rest The dimly flowing river was at my feet the river on which I had seen Cristel again for the first time since we were children Thus far the dreadful loss of her had been a calamity held away from me in some degree by events which had imperatively taken possession of my mind In the darkness and the stillness the misery of having lost her was free to crush me My head dropped on the neck of the dog nestling close at my side Oh Ponto I said to him she s gone Nobody could see me nobody could despise me I burst out crying CHAPTER XVI BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION Twice I looked into Toller s room during the remainder of the night and found him sleeping When the sun rose I could endure the delay no longer I woke him What is it he asked peevishly You must be the last person who saw Cristel I answered I want to know all that you can tell me His anger completely mastered him he burst out with a furious reply It s you two you my landlord and him my lodger who have driven Cristy away from her home She said she would go and she has gone Get out of my place sir You ought to be ashamed to look at me It was useless to reason with him and it was of vital importance to lose no time in instituting a search After the reception I had met with I took care to restore the key of the door leading into the new cottage before I left him It was his key and the poor distracted old man might charge me with taking away his property next As I set forth on my way home I found the new man servant on the look out His first words showed that he was acting under orders He asked if I had found the young lady and he next informed me that his master had revived some hours since and bore no malice This outrageous assertion suddenly fired me with suspicion I believed that the Cur had been acting a part when he threatened me with his pistol and that he was answerable for the disappearance of Cristel My first impulse now was to get the help of a lawyer The men at my stables were just stirring when I got home In ten minutes more I was driving to our town The substance of the professional opinion which I received has been already stated in these pages One among my answers to the many questions which my legal adviser put to me led him to a conclusion that made my heart ache He was of opinion that my brief absence while I was taking that fatal breath of air on the banks of the river had offered to Cristel her opportunity of getting away without discovery Her old father the lawyer said was no doubt in his bed and you yourself found nobody watching in the neighborhood of the cottage Employ me in some way I burst out I can t endure my life if I m not helping to trace Cristel He was most kind I understand he said Try what you can get those two ladies to tell you and you may help us materially missus Roylake was nearest to me I appealed to her womanly sympathies and was answered by tears I made another attempt I said I was willing to believe that she meant well and that I should be sorry to offend her She got up and indignantly left the room I went to Lady Rachel next She was at home but the servant returned to me with an excuse her ladyship was particularly engaged I sent a message upstairs asking when I might hope to be received The servant was charged with the delivery of another excuse her ladyship would write After waiting at home for hours I was foolish enough to write on my side and how could I help it to express myself strongly The she socialist s reply is easy to remember Dear mister Roylake when you have recovered your temper you will hear from me again Even my stepmother gained by comparison with this To rest and do nothing was to exercise a control over myself of which I was perfectly incapable I went back to the cottage Having no hopeful prospect in any other quarter I persisted in believing that Toller must have seen something or heard something that might either help me or suggest an idea to my legal adviser On entering the kitchen I found the door of communication wide open and the new servant established in the large armchair I m waiting for my master sir He had got over his fright and had recovered his temper The respectful side of him was turned to me again Your master is with mister Toller Yes sir What I felt amply justified the lawyer in having exacted a promise from me to keep carefully out of the Cur s presence You might knock him on the head again mister Roylake and might hit a little too hard next time But I had an idea of my own I said as if speaking to myself I would give a five pound note to know what is going on upstairs I shall be glad to earn it sir the fellow said If I make a clean breast of what I know already and if I tell you to morrow what I can find out will it be worth the money I began to feel degraded in my own estimation But I nodded to him for all that I am the innocent cause sir of what happened last night he coolly resumed We kept a look out on the road and saw you though you didn t see us But my master never suspected you for reasons which he kept to himself of making use of the boat I reminded him that one of us had better have an eye on the slip of pathway between the cottage and the river This led to his sending me to the boathouse and you know what happened afterwards My master as I suppose is pumping mister Toller That s all sir for to night When may I have the honor of expecting you to morrow morning I appointed an hour and left the place As I entered the wood again I found a man on the watch He touched his hat and said I m the clerk sir Your gamekeeper is wanted for his own duties to night he will relieve me in the morning I went home with my mind in a ferment of doubt If I could believe the servant the Cur was as innocent of the abduction of Cristel as I was But could I trust the servant The events of the next morning altered the whole complexion of affairs fatally for the worse Arriving at the cottage I found a man prostate on the road dead drunk and the Cur s servant looking at him May I ask something the man said Have you been having my master watched Yes Bad news in that case sir Your man there is a drunken vagabond and my master has gone to London by the first train When I had recovered the shock I denied for the sake of my own credit that the brute on the road could be a servant of mine Why not sir Do you think I should have been kept in ignorance of it if my gamekeeper had been a drunkard His fellow servants would have warned me The man smiled I m afraid sir you don t know much about servants It s a point of honor among us never to tell tales of each other to our masters I began to wish that I had never left Germany The one course to take now was to tell the lawyer what had happened I turned away to get back and drive at once to the town The servant remembered what I had forgotten the five pound note Wait and hear my report sir he suggested The report informed me First that mister Toller was at the mill and had been there for some time past Secondly that the Cur had been alone for a while on mister Toller s side of the cottage in mister Toiler s absence for what purpose his servant had not discovered Thirdly that the Cur had returned to his room in a hurry and had packed a few things in his travelling bag Fourthly that he had ordered the servant to follow with his luggage in a fly which he would send from the railway station and to wait at the London terminus for further orders Fifthly and lastly that it was impossible to say whether the drunkenness of the gamekeeper was due to his own habits or to temptation privately offered by the very person whose movements he had been appointed to watch I paid the money The man pocketed it and paid me a compliment in return I wish I was your servant sir CHAPTER XVII UTTER FAILURE My lawyer took a serious view of the disaster that had overtaken us He would trust nobody but his head clerk to act in my interests after the servant had been followed to the London terminus and when it became a question of matching ourselves against the deadly cunning of the man who had escaped us Provided with money and with a letter to the police authorities in London the head clerk went to the station I accompanied him to point out the servant without being allowed to show myself and then returned to wait for telegraphic information at the lawyer s office This was the first report transmitted by the telegram The Cur had been found waiting for his servant at the terminus and the two had been easily followed to the railway hotel close by The clerk had sent his letter of introduction to the police had consulted with picked men who joined him at the hotel had given the necessary instructions and would return to us by the last train in the evening In two days the second telegram arrived Our man had been traced to the Thames Yacht Club in Albemarle Street had consulted a yachting list in the hall and had then travelled to the Isle of Wight There he had made inquiries at the Squadron Yacht Club and the Victoria Yacht Club and had returned to London and the railway hotel The third telegram announced the utter destruction of all our hopes As far as Marseilles the Cur had been followed successfully and in that city the detective officers had lost sight of him My legal adviser insisted on having the men sent to him to explain themselves Nothing came of it but one more repetition of an old discovery When the detective police force encounters intelligence instead of stupidity in seven cases out of ten the detective police force is beaten There were still two persons at our disposal Lady Rachel might help us as I believed if she chose to do it As for old Toller I suggested on reflection that the lawyer should examine him The lawyer declined to waste any more of my money I called again on Lady Rachel This time I was let in I found the noble lady smoking a cigarette and reading a French novel This is going to be a disagreeable interview she said Let us get it over mister Roylake as soon as possible Tell me what you want and speak as freely as if you were in the company of a man I obeyed her to the letter and I got these replies Yes I did have a talk in your best interests with Miss Toller She is as sensible as she is charming and as good as she is sensible We entirely agreed that the sacrifice must be on her side and that it was due to her own self respect to prevent a gentleman of your rank from ruining himself by marrying a miller s daughter The next reply was equally free from the smallest atom of sympathy on Lady Rachel s part You are quite right your deaf man was at his window when I went by We recognized each other and had a long talk If I remember correctly he said you knew of his reasons for concealing his name I gave my promise being a matter of perfect indifference to me to conceal it too One thing led to another and I discovered that you were his hated rival in the affections of Miss Toller I proved worthy of his confidence in me That is to say I told him that missus Roylake and I would be only too glad as representing your interests if he succeeded in winning the young lady I asked if he had any plans He said one of his plans had failed What it was and how it had failed he did not mention I asked if he could devise nothing else He said Yes if I was not a poor man In my place you would have offered as I did to find the money if the plan was approved of He produced some manuscript story of an abduction of a lady which he had written to amuse himself The point of it was that the lover successfully carried away the lady by means of a boat while the furious father s attention was absorbed in watching the high road It seemed to me to be a new idea If you think you can carry it out I said send your estimate of expenses to me and missus Roylake and we will subscribe We received the estimate But the plan has failed and the man is off I am quite certain myself that Miss Toller has done what she promised to do Wherever she may be now she has sacrificed herself for your sake When you have got over it you will marry my sister I wish you good morning Between Lady Rachel s hard insolence and missus Roylake s sentimental hypocrisy I was in such a state of irritation that I left Trimley Deen the next morning to find forgetfulness as I rashly supposed in the gay world of London I had been trying my experiment for something like three weeks and was beginning to get heartily weary of it when I received a letter from the lawyer Dear Sir Your odd tenant old mister Toller has died suddenly of rupture of a blood vessel on the brain as the doctor thinks There is to be an inquest as I need hardly tell you What do you say to having the report of the proceedings largely copied in the newspapers If it catches his daughter s eye important results may follow To speculate in this way on the impulse which might take its rise in my poor girl s grief to surprise her as it were at her father s grave revolted me I directed the lawyer to take no steps whatever in the matter and to pay the poor old fellow s funeral expenses on my account He had died intestate The law took care of his money until his daughter appeared and the mill being my property I gave to Toller s surviving partner our good Gloody And what did I do next I went away travelling one of the wretchedest men who ever carried his misery with him to foreign countries Go where I might on the continent of Europe the dreadful idea pursued me that Cristel might be dead CHAPTER XVIII THE MISTRESS OF TRIMLEY DEEN Three weary months had passed when a new idea was put into my head by an Englishman whom I met at Trieste He advised turning my back on Europe and trying the effect of scenes of life that would be new to me I hired a vessel and sailed out of the civilized world When I next stood on terra firma my feet were on the lovely beach of one of the Pacific Islands What I suffered I have not told yet and do not design to tell The bitterness of those days hid itself from view at the time and shall keep its concealment still Even if I could dwell on my sorrows with the eloquence of a practised writer some obstinate inner reluctance would persist in holding me dumb More than a year had passed before I returned to Trimley Deen and alarmed my stepmother by looking like a foreign sailor The irregular nature of my later travels had made it impossible to forward the few letters that had arrived for me They were neatly laid out on the library table The second letter that I took up bore the postmark of Genoa I opened it and discovered that the No I cannot write of him by that mean name and his own name is still unknown to me Let me call him and oh don t think that I am deceived again let me call him the Penitent The letter had been addressed to me from his deathbed and had been written under dictation It contained an extraordinary enclosure a small torn fragment of paper with writing on it Read the poor morsel that I send to you first the letter began My time on earth is short you will save me explanations which may be too much for my strength On one side of the fragment I found these words cruise to the Mediterranean for my wife s health If Cristel isn t afraid of passing some months at sea On the other side there was a fragment of conclusion thoroughly understand All ready Write word what night and what loving brother Stephen Toller I instantly remembered the miller s rich brother thinking of him for the first time since he had been in my mind for a moment on the night of my meeting with Cristel On the fourteenth page of this narrative Toller s brother will be found briefly alluded to in a few lines I returned eagerly to the letter Thus it was continued That bit of torn paper I found under the bed while I was secretly searching mister Toller s room I had previously suspected You From my own examination of his face when he refused to humor my deafness by writing what I asked him to tell me I suspected mister Toller next You will see in the fragment what I saw that Toller the brother had a yacht and was going to the Mediterranean and that Toller the miller had written asking him to favour Cristel s escape The rest Cristel herself can tell you I know you had me followed At Marseilles I got tired of it and gave your men the slip At every port in the Mediterranean I inquired for the yacht and heard nothing of her They must have changed their minds on board and gone somewhere else I refer you to Cristel again Arrived at Genoa on my way back to England I met with a skilled Italian surgeon He declared that he could restore my hearing but he warned me that I was in a weak state of health and he refused to answer for the result of the operation Without hesitating for a moment I told him to operate I would have given fifty lives for one exquisite week of perfect hearing I have had three weeks of perfect hearing Otherwise I have had a life of enjoyment before I die It is useless to ask your pardon My conduct was too infamous for that Will you remember the family taint developed by a deaf man s isolation among his fellow creatures But I had some days when my mother s sweet nature tried to make itself felt in me and did not wholly fail I am going to my mother now her spirit has been with me ever since my hearing was restored her spirit said to me last night Atone my son Give the man whom you have wronged the woman whom he loves I had found out the uncle s address in England which I now enclose at one of the Yacht Clubs I had intended to go to the house and welcome her on her return You must go instead of me you will see that lovely face when I am in my grave Good bye Roylake The cold hand that touches us all sooner or later is very near to me Be merciful to the next scoundrel you meet for the sake of The Cur I say there was good in that suffering man and I thank God I was not quite wrong about him after all Arriving at mister Stephen Toller s country seat by the earliest train that would take me there I found a last trial of endurance in store for me Cristel was away with her uncle visiting some friends Cristel s aunt received me with kindness which I can never forget We have noticed lately that Cristel was in depressed spirits no uncommon thing missus Stephen Toller continued looking at me with a gentle smile since a parting which I know you must have felt deeply too No mister Roylake she is not engaged to be married and she will never be married unless you forgive her Ah you forgive her because you love her She thought of writing to tell you her motives when she visited her father s grave on our return to England But I was unable to obtain your address Perhaps I may speak for her now I knew how Lady Rachel s interference had appealed to Cristel s sense of duty and sense of self respect I had heard from her own lips that she distrusted herself if she allowed me to press her But she had successfully concealed from me the terror with which she regarded her rejected lover and the influence over her which her father had exercised Always mindful of his own interests the miller knew that he would be the person blamed if he allowed his daughter to marry me They will say I did it with an eye to my son in law s money and gentlefolks may ruin a man who lives by selling flour That was how he expressed himself in a letter to his brother The whole of the correspondence was shown to me by missus Stephen Toller After alluding to his wealthy brother s desire that he should retire from business the miller continued as follows What you are ready to do for me I want you to do for Cristy She is in danger in more ways than one and I am obliged to get her away from my house as if I was a smuggler and my girl contraband goods I am a bad hand at writing so I leave Cristy to tell you the particulars Will you receive her brother Stephen and take care of her and do it as soon as possible mister Stephen Toller s cordial reply mentioned that his vessel was ready to sail and would pass the mouth of The Loke on her southward voyage His brother caught at the idea thus suggested I have alluded to Giles Toller s sly look to his lodger when I returned the manuscript of the confession The old man s unscrupulous curiosity had already applied a second key to the cupboard in the lodger s room There he had found the criminal stories mentioned in the journal including the story of abduction referred to by Lady Rachel This gave him the very idea which his lodger had already relied on for carrying Cristel away by the river under the influence of course of a soporific drug while her father was keeping watch on the road The secreting of the oars with this purpose in view had failed as a measure of security The miller s knowledge of the stream and his daughter s ready courage had suggested the idea of letting the boat drift with Cristel hidden in it Two of the yacht s crew hidden among the trees watched the progress of the boat until it rounded the promontory and struck the shore There the yacht s boat was waiting The rocket was fired to re assure her father and Cristel was rowed to the mouth of the river and safely received on board the yacht Thus with his good brother s help the miller had made the River his Guilty accomplice in the abduction of his own child When I had read the correspondence we spoke again of Cristel To save time missus Stephen Toller said I will write to my husband to day by a mounted messenger He shall only tell Cristel that you have come back to England and you shall arrange to meet her in our grounds when she returns I am a childless woman mister Roylake and I love her as I should have loved a daughter of my own Where improvement in external matters only has seemed to be possible it has been my delight to improve her Your stepmother and Lady Rachel will acknowledge even from their point of view that there is a mistress who is worthy of her position at Trimley Deen When Cristel returned the next day she found that her uncle had deserted her and suddenly discovered a man in the shrubbery What that man said and did and what the result of it was may be inferred if I relate a remarkable event missus Roylake has retired from the domestic superintendence of Trimley Deen End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Guilty River
