within it has been released as Project Gutenberg s eBook one hundred thirty two I LAYING PLANS one Sun Tzu said The art of war is of vital importance to the State two It is a matter of life and death a road either to safety or to ruin Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected three The art of war then is governed by five constant factors to be taken into account in one s deliberations when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field four These are one The Moral Law two Heaven three Earth four The Commander five Method and discipline fifty six The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler so that they will follow him regardless of their lives undismayed by any danger seven Heaven signifies night and day cold and heat times and seasons eight Earth comprises distances great and small danger and security open ground and narrow passes the chances of life and death nine The Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom sincerity benevolence courage and strictness ten By method and discipline are to be understood the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions the graduations of rank among the officers the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army and the control of military expenditure eleven These five heads should be familiar to every general he who knows them will be victorious he who knows them not will fail twelve Therefore in your deliberations when seeking to determine the military conditions let them be made the basis of a comparison in this wise thirteen one Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral law two Which of the two generals has most ability three With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth four On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced five Which army is stronger six On which side are officers and men more highly trained seven In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment fourteen By means of these seven considerations I can forecast victory or defeat fifteen The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon it will conquer let such a one be retained in command The general that hearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it will suffer defeat let such a one be dismissed sixteen While heading the profit of my counsel avail yourself also of any helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules seventeen According as circumstances are favorable one should modify one s plans eighteen All warfare is based on deception nineteen Hence when able to attack we must seem unable when using our forces we must seem inactive when we are near we must make the enemy believe we are far away when far away we must make him believe we are near twenty Hold out baits to entice the enemy Feign disorder and crush him twenty one If he is secure at all points be prepared for him If he is in superior strength evade him twenty two If your opponent is of choleric temper seek to irritate him Pretend to be weak that he may grow arrogant twenty three If he is taking his ease give him no rest If his forces are united separate them twenty four Attack him where he is unprepared appear where you are not expected twenty five These military devices leading to victory must not be divulged beforehand twenty six Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand Thus do many calculations lead to victory and few calculations to defeat how much more no calculation at all It is by attention to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose II WAGING WAR one Sun Tzu said In the operations of war where there are in the field a thousand swift chariots as many heavy chariots and a hundred thousand mail clad soldiers with provisions enough to carry them a thousand li the expenditure at home and at the front including entertainment of guests small items such as glue and paint and sums spent on chariots and armor will reach the total of a thousand ounces of silver per day Such is the cost of raising an army of one hundred thousand men two When you engage in actual fighting if victory is long in coming then men s weapons will grow dull and their ardor will be damped If you lay siege to a town you will exhaust your strength three Again if the campaign is protracted the resources of the State will not be equal to the strain four Now when your weapons are dulled your ardor damped your strength exhausted and your treasure spent other chieftains will spring up to take advantage of your extremity Then no man however wise will be able to avert the consequences that must ensue five Thus though we have heard of stupid haste in war cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays six There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare seven It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war that can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on eight The skillful soldier does not raise a second levy neither are his supply wagons loaded more than twice nine Bring war material with you from home but forage on the enemy Thus the army will have food enough for its needs ten Poverty of the State exchequer causes an army to be maintained by contributions from a distance Contributing to maintain an army at a distance causes the people to be impoverished eleven On the other hand the proximity of an army causes prices to go up and high prices cause the people s substance to be drained away twelve When their substance is drained away the peasantry will be afflicted by heavy exactions thirteen fourteen With this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength the homes of the people will be stripped bare and three tenths of their income will be dissipated while government expenses for broken chariots worn out horses breast plates and helmets bows and arrows spears and shields protective mantles draught oxen and heavy wagons will amount to four tenths of its total revenue fifteen Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy One cartload of the enemy s provisions is equivalent to twenty of one s own and likewise a single picul of his provender is equivalent to twenty from one s own store sixteen Now in order to kill the enemy our men must be roused to anger that there may be advantage from defeating the enemy they must have their rewards seventeen Therefore in chariot fighting when ten or more chariots have been taken those should be rewarded who took the first Our own flags should be substituted for those of the enemy and the chariots mingled and used in conjunction with ours The captured soldiers should be kindly treated and kept eighteen This is called using the conquered foe to augment one s own strength nineteen In war then let your great object be victory not lengthy campaigns twenty Thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the arbiter of the people s fate the man on whom it depends whether the nation shall be in peace or in peril III ATTACK BY STRATAGEM one Sun Tzu said In the practical art of war the best thing of all is to take the enemy s country whole and intact to shatter and destroy it is not so good So too it is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it to capture a regiment a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them two Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy s resistance without fighting three Thus the highest form of generalship is to balk the enemy s plans the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy s forces the next in order is to attack the enemy s army in the field and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities four The rule is not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be avoided The preparation of mantlets movable shelters and various implements of war will take up three whole months and the piling up of mounds over against the walls will take three months more five The general unable to control his irritation will launch his men to the assault like swarming ants with the result that one third of his men are slain while the town still remains untaken Such are the disastrous effects of a siege six Therefore the skillful leader subdues the enemy s troops without any fighting he captures their cities without laying siege to them he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field seven With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire and thus without losing a man his triumph will be complete This is the method of attacking by stratagem eight It is the rule in war if our forces are ten to the enemy s one to surround him if five to one to attack him if twice as numerous to divide our army into two nine If equally matched we can offer battle if slightly inferior in numbers we can avoid the enemy if quite unequal in every way we can flee from him ten Hence though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force in the end it must be captured by the larger force eleven Now the general is the bulwark of the State if the bulwark is complete at all points the State will be strong if the bulwark is defective the State will be weak twelve There are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his army thirteen one By commanding the army to advance or to retreat being ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey This is called hobbling the army fourteen two By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a kingdom being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in an army This causes restlessness in the soldier s minds fifteen three By employing the officers of his army without discrimination through ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to circumstances This shakes the confidence of the soldiers sixteen But when the army is restless and distrustful trouble is sure to come from the other feudal princes This is simply bringing anarchy into the army and flinging victory away seventeen Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory one He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight two He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces three He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks four He will win who prepared himself waits to take the enemy unprepared five He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign eighteen Hence the saying If you know the enemy and know yourself you need not fear the result of a hundred battles If you know yourself but not the enemy for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat If you know neither the enemy nor yourself you will succumb in every battle IV TACTICAL DISPOSITIONS one Sun Tzu said The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy two To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself three Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy four Hence the saying One may know how to conquer without being able to do it five Security against defeat implies defensive tactics ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive six Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength attacking a superabundance of strength seven The general who is skilled in defense hides in the most secret recesses of the earth he who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven Thus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves on the other a victory that is complete eight To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the acme of excellence nine Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and the whole Empire says Well done ten To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength to see the sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear eleven What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins but excels in winning with ease twelve Hence his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor credit for courage thirteen He wins his battles by making no mistakes Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated fourteen Hence the skillful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy fifteen Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory sixteen The consummate leader cultivates the moral law and strictly adheres to method and discipline thus it is in his power to control success seventeen In respect of military method we have firstly Measurement secondly Estimation of quantity thirdly Calculation fourthly Balancing of chances fifthly Victory eighteen Measurement owes its existence to Earth Estimation of quantity to Measurement Calculation to Estimation of quantity Balancing of chances to Calculation and Victory to Balancing of chances nineteen A victorious army opposed to a routed one is as a pound s weight placed in the scale against a single grain twenty The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent up waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep V ENERGY one Sun Tzu said The control of a large force is the same principle as the control of a few men it is merely a question of dividing up their numbers two Fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different from fighting with a small one it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals three To ensure that your whole host may withstand the brunt of the enemy s attack and remain unshaken this is effected by maneuvers direct and indirect four That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against an egg this is effected by the science of weak points and strong five In all fighting the direct method may be used for joining battle but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory six Indirect tactics efficiently applied are inexhaustible as Heaven and Earth unending as the flow of rivers and streams like the sun and moon they end but to begin anew like the four seasons they pass away to return once more seven There are not more than five musical notes yet the combinations of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard eight There are not more than five primary colors blue yellow red white and black yet in combination they produce more hues than can ever been seen nine There are not more than five cardinal tastes sour acrid salt sweet bitter yet combinations of them yield more flavors than can ever be tasted ten In battle there are not more than two methods of attack the direct and the indirect yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series of maneuvers eleven The direct and the indirect lead on to each other in turn It is like moving in a circle you never come to an end Who can exhaust the possibilities of their combination twelve The onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent which will even roll stones along in its course thirteen The quality of decision is like the well timed swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its victim fourteen Therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his onset and prompt in his decision fifteen Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow decision to the releasing of a trigger sixteen Amid the turmoil and tumult of battle there may be seeming disorder and yet no real disorder at all amid confusion and chaos your array may be without head or tail yet it will be proof against defeat seventeen Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline simulated fear postulates courage simulated weakness postulates strength eighteen Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply a question of subdivision concealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of latent energy masking strength with weakness is to be effected by tactical dispositions nineteen Thus one who is skillful at keeping the enemy on the move maintains deceitful appearances according to which the enemy will act He sacrifices something that the enemy may snatch at it twenty By holding out baits he keeps him on the march then with a body of picked men he lies in wait for him twenty one The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy and does not require too much from individuals Hence his ability to pick out the right men and utilize combined energy twenty two When he utilizes combined energy his fighting men become as it were like unto rolling logs or stones For it is the nature of a log or stone to remain motionless on level ground and to move when on a slope if four cornered to come to a standstill but if round shaped to go rolling down twenty three Thus the energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum of a round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height So much on the subject of energy VI WEAK POINTS AND STRONG one Sun Tzu said Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy will be fresh for the fight whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted two Therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy but does not allow the enemy s will to be imposed on him three By holding out advantages to him he can cause the enemy to approach of his own accord or by inflicting damage he can make it impossible for the enemy to draw near four If the enemy is taking his ease he can harass him if well supplied with food he can starve him out if quietly encamped he can force him to move five Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend march swiftly to places where you are not expected six An army may march great distances without distress if it marches through country where the enemy is not seven You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended You can ensure the safety of your defense if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked eight Hence that general is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend and he is skillful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack nine O divine art of subtlety and secrecy Through you we learn to be invisible through you inaudible and hence we can hold the enemy s fate in our hands ten You may advance and be absolutely irresistible if you make for the enemy s weak points you may retire and be safe from pursuit if your movements are more rapid than those of the enemy eleven If we wish to fight the enemy can be forced to an engagement even though he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch All we need do is attack some other place that he will be obliged to relieve twelve If we do not wish to fight we can prevent the enemy from engaging us even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the ground All we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in his way thirteen By discovering the enemy s dispositions and remaining invisible ourselves we can keep our forces concentrated while the enemy s must be divided fourteen We can form a single united body while the enemy must split up into fractions Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate parts of a whole which means that we shall be many to the enemy s few fifteen And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior one our opponents will be in dire straits sixteen The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points and his forces being thus distributed in many directions the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few seventeen For should the enemy strengthen his van he will weaken his rear should he strengthen his rear he will weaken his van should he strengthen his left he will weaken his right should he strengthen his right he will weaken his left If he sends reinforcements everywhere he will everywhere be weak eighteen Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against possible attacks numerical strength from compelling our adversary to make these preparations against us nineteen Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle we may concentrate from the greatest distances in order to fight twenty But if neither time nor place be known then the left wing will be impotent to succor the right the right equally impotent to succor the left the van unable to relieve the rear or the rear to support the van How much more so if the furthest portions of the army are anything under a hundred LI apart and even the nearest are separated by several LI twenty one Though according to my estimate the soldiers of Yueh exceed our own in number that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory I say then that victory can be achieved twenty two Though the enemy be stronger in numbers we may prevent him from fighting Scheme so as to discover his plans and the likelihood of their success twenty three Rouse him and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity Force him to reveal himself so as to find out his vulnerable spots twenty four Carefully compare the opposing army with your own so that you may know where strength is superabundant and where it is deficient twenty five In making tactical dispositions the highest pitch you can attain is to conceal them conceal your dispositions and you will be safe from the prying of the subtlest spies from the machinations of the wisest brains twenty six How victory may be produced for them out of the enemy s own tactics that is what the multitude cannot comprehend twenty seven All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved twenty eight Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances twenty nine Military tactics are like unto water for water in its natural course runs away from high places and hastens downwards thirty So in war the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak thirty one Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over which it flows the soldier works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing thirty two Therefore just as water retains no constant shape so in warfare there are no constant conditions thirty three He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and thereby succeed in winning may be called a heaven born captain thirty four The five elements water fire wood metal earth are not always equally predominant the four seasons make way for each other in turn There are short days and long the moon has its periods of waning and waxing VII MANEUVERING one Sun Tzu said In war the general receives his commands from the sovereign two Having collected an army and concentrated his forces he must blend and harmonize the different elements thereof before pitching his camp three After that comes tactical maneuvering than which there is nothing more difficult The difficulty of tactical maneuvering consists in turning the devious into the direct and misfortune into gain four Thus to take a long and circuitous route after enticing the enemy out of the way and though starting after him to contrive to reach the goal before him shows knowledge of the artifice of DEVIATION five Maneuvering with an army is advantageous with an undisciplined multitude most dangerous six If you set a fully equipped army in march in order to snatch an advantage the chances are that you will be too late On the other hand to detach a flying column for the purpose involves the sacrifice of its baggage and stores seven Thus if you order your men to roll up their buff coats and make forced marches without halting day or night covering double the usual distance at a stretch doing a hundred LI in order to wrest an advantage the leaders of all your three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy eight The stronger men will be in front the jaded ones will fall behind and on this plan only one tenth of your army will reach its destination nine If you march fifty LI in order to outmaneuver the enemy you will lose the leader of your first division and only half your force will reach the goal ten If you march thirty LI with the same object two thirds of your army will arrive eleven We may take it then that an army without its baggage train is lost without provisions it is lost without bases of supply it is lost twelve We cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the designs of our neighbors thirteen We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country its mountains and forests its pitfalls and precipices its marshes and swamps fourteen We shall be unable to turn natural advantage to account unless we make use of local guides fifteen In war practice dissimulation and you will succeed sixteen Whether to concentrate or to divide your troops must be decided by circumstances seventeen Let your rapidity be that of the wind your compactness that of the forest eighteen In raiding and plundering be like fire in immovability like a mountain nineteen Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night and when you move fall like a thunderbolt twenty When you plunder a countryside let the spoil be divided amongst your men when you capture new territory cut it up into allotments for the benefit of the soldiery twenty one Ponder and deliberate before you make a move twenty two He will conquer who has learnt the artifice of deviation Such is the art of maneuvering twenty three The Book of Army Management says On the field of battle the spoken word does not carry far enough hence the institution of gongs and drums Nor can ordinary objects be seen clearly enough hence the institution of banners and flags twenty four Gongs and drums banners and flags are means whereby the ears and eyes of the host may be focused on one particular point twenty five The host thus forming a single united body is it impossible either for the brave to advance alone or for the cowardly to retreat alone This is the art of handling large masses of men twenty six In night fighting then make much use of signal fires and drums and in fighting by day of flags and banners as a means of influencing the ears and eyes of your army twenty seven A whole army may be robbed of its spirit a commander in chief may be robbed of his presence of mind twenty eight Now a soldier s spirit is keenest in the morning by noonday it has begun to flag and in the evening his mind is bent only on returning to camp twenty nine A clever general therefore avoids an army when its spirit is keen but attacks it when it is sluggish and inclined to return This is the art of studying moods thirty Disciplined and calm to await the appearance of disorder and hubbub amongst the enemy this is the art of retaining self possession thirty one To be near the goal while the enemy is still far from it to wait at ease while the enemy is toiling and struggling to be well fed while the enemy is famished this is the art of husbanding one s strength thirty two To refrain from intercepting an enemy whose banners are in perfect order to refrain from attacking an army drawn up in calm and confident array this is the art of studying circumstances thirty three It is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy nor to oppose him when he comes downhill thirty four Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen thirty five Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy Do not interfere with an army that is returning home thirty six When you surround an army leave an outlet free Do not press a desperate foe too hard thirty seven Such is the art of warfare VIII VARIATION IN TACTICS one Sun Tzu said In war the general receives his commands from the sovereign collects his army and concentrates his forces two When in difficult country do not encamp In country where high roads intersect join hands with your allies Do not linger in dangerously isolated positions In hemmed in situations you must resort to stratagem In desperate position you must fight three There are roads which must not be followed armies which must be not attacked towns which must not be besieged positions which must not be contested commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed four The general who thoroughly understands the advantages that accompany variation of tactics knows how to handle his troops five The general who does not understand these may be well acquainted with the configuration of the country yet he will not be able to turn his knowledge to practical account six So the student of war who is unversed in the art of war of varying his plans even though he be acquainted with the Five Advantages will fail to make the best use of his men seven Hence in the wise leader s plans considerations of advantage and of disadvantage will be blended together eight If our expectation of advantage be tempered in this way we may succeed in accomplishing the essential part of our schemes nine If on the other hand in the midst of difficulties we are always ready to seize an advantage we may extricate ourselves from misfortune ten Reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage on them and make trouble for them and keep them constantly engaged hold out specious allurements and make them rush to any given point eleven The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy s not coming but on our own readiness to receive him not on the chance of his not attacking but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable twelve There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general one Recklessness which leads to destruction two cowardice which leads to capture three a hasty temper which can be provoked by insults four a delicacy of honor which is sensitive to shame five over solicitude for his men which exposes him to worry and trouble thirteen These are the five besetting sins of a general ruinous to the conduct of war fourteen When an army is overthrown and its leader slain the cause will surely be found among these five dangerous faults Let them be a subject of meditation IX 
964-140397-0000	train-other-500	THE ARMY ON THE MARCH one Sun Tzu said We come now to the question of encamping the army and observing signs of the enemy
964-140397-0001	train-other-500	Pass quickly over mountains and keep in the neighborhood of valleys two Camp in high places facing the sun Do not climb heights in order to fight So much
964-140397-0002	train-other-500	for mountain warfare three After crossing a river you should get far away from it four When an invading force crosses a river
964-140397-0003	train-other-500	in its onward march do not advance to meet it in mid stream It will be best to let half the army get across and then deliver your attack five
964-140397-0004	train-other-500	If you are anxious to fight you should not go to meet the invader near a river which he has to cross six Moor your craft higher up than the enemy
964-140397-0005	train-other-500	and facing the sun Do not move up stream to meet the enemy So much for river warfare seven In crossing salt marshes your sole concern
964-140397-0006	train-other-500	should be to get over them quickly without any delay eight If forced to fight in a salt marsh you should have water and grass near you and get your back to a clump of trees
964-140397-0007	train-other-500	So much for operations in salt marches nine In dry level country take up an easily accessible position with rising ground to your right
964-140397-0008	train-other-500	and on your rear so that the danger may be in front and safety lie behind So much for campaigning in flat country ten
964-140397-0009	train-other-500	These are the four useful branches of military knowledge which enabled the Yellow Emperor to vanquish four several sovereigns eleven All armies prefer high ground to low
964-140397-0010	train-other-500	and sunny places to dark twelve If you are careful of your men and camp on hard ground the army will be free from disease of every kind and this will spell victory
964-140397-0011	train-other-500	thirteen When you come to a hill or a bank occupy the sunny side with the slope on your right rear Thus you will at once act for the benefit of your soldiers
964-140397-0012	train-other-500	and utilize the natural advantages of the ground fourteen When in consequence of heavy rains up country a river which you wish to ford is swollen and flecked with foam
964-140397-0013	train-other-500	you must wait until it subsides fifteen Country in which there are precipitous cliffs with torrents running between deep natural hollows
964-140397-0014	train-other-500	confined places tangled thickets quagmires and crevasses should be left with all possible speed and not approached sixteen
964-140397-0015	train-other-500	While we keep away from such places we should get the enemy to approach them while we face them we should let the enemy have them on his rear seventeen
964-140397-0016	train-other-500	If in the neighborhood of your camp there should be any hilly country ponds surrounded by aquatic grass hollow basins filled with reeds or woods with thick undergrowth
964-140397-0017	train-other-500	they must be carefully routed out and searched for these are places where men in ambush or insidious spies are likely to be lurking eighteen
964-140397-0018	train-other-500	When the enemy is close at hand and remains quiet he is relying on the natural strength of his position nineteen When he keeps aloof and tries to provoke a battle
964-140397-0019	train-other-500	he is anxious for the other side to advance twenty If his place of encampment is easy of access he is tendering a bait twenty one
none	none	 Movement amongst the trees of a forest 
964-140397-0020	train-other-500	shows that the enemy is advancing The appearance of a number of screens in the midst of thick grass means that the enemy wants to make us suspicious twenty two
964-140397-0021	train-other-500	The rising of birds in their flight is the sign of an ambuscade Startled beasts indicate that a sudden attack is coming
964-140397-0022	train-other-500	twenty three When there is dust rising in a high column
none	none	 it is the sign of chariots advancing when the dust is low but spread over a wide area 
964-140397-0023	train-other-500	it betokens the approach of infantry When it branches out in different directions it shows that parties have been sent to collect firewood A few clouds of dust moving to and fro signify that the army
964-140397-0024	train-other-500	is encamping twenty four Humble words and increased preparations are signs that the enemy is about to advance Violent language and driving forward as if
964-140397-0025	train-other-500	to the attack are signs that he will retreat twenty five When the light chariots come out first and take up a position on the wings it is a sign that the enemy
964-140397-0026	train-other-500	is forming for battle twenty six Peace proposals unaccompanied by a sworn covenant indicate a plot twenty seven
964-140397-0027	train-other-500	When there is much running about and the soldiers fall into rank it means that the critical moment has come twenty eight When some are seen advancing and some retreating
none	none	 it is a lure 
964-140397-0028	train-other-500	twenty nine When the soldiers stand leaning on their spears they are faint
none	none	 from want of food 
964-140397-0029	train-other-500	thirty If those who are sent to draw water begin by drinking themselves the army is suffering from thirst thirty one
964-140397-0030	train-other-500	If the enemy sees an advantage to be gained and makes no effort to secure it the soldiers are exhausted thirty two If birds gather on any spot
none	none	 it is unoccupied 
964-140397-0031	train-other-500	Clamor by night betokens nervousness thirty three If there is disturbance in the camp
none	none	 the general s authority is weak 
964-140397-0032	train-other-500	If the banners and flags are shifted about sedition is afoot If the officers are angry it means that the men are weary thirty four
964-140397-0033	train-other-500	When an army feeds its horses with grain and kills its cattle for food

964-140397-0035	train-other-500	The sight of men whispering together in small knots or speaking in subdued tones points to disaffection amongst the rank and file thirty six
964-140397-0036	train-other-500	Too frequent rewards signify that the enemy is at the end of his resources too many punishments betray a condition of dire distress thirty seven
964-140397-0037	train-other-500	To begin by bluster but afterwards to take fright at the enemy s numbers shows a supreme lack of intelligence thirty eight When
964-140397-0038	train-other-500	envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths it is a sign that the enemy wishes for a truce thirty nine If the enemy s troops march up angrily

964-140397-0040	train-other-500	If our troops are no more in number than the enemy that is amply sufficient it only means that no direct attack can be made What we can do is simply to concentrate

964-140397-0043	train-other-500	will be practically useless If when the soldiers have become attached to you punishments are not enforced they will still be useless forty three Therefore
964-140397-0044	train-other-500	soldiers must be treated in the first instance with humanity but kept under control by means of iron discipline This is a certain road to victory forty four

none	none	 the gain will be mutual X TERRAIN one Sun Tzu said We may distinguish six kinds of terrain to wit one Accessible ground two entangling ground three temporizing ground four narrow passes five precipitous heights six positions at a great distance from the enemy two Ground which can be freely traversed by both sides is called accessible three With regard to ground of this nature be before the enemy in occupying the raised and sunny spots and carefully guard your line of supplies Then you will be able to fight with advantage four Ground which can be abandoned but is hard to re occupy is called entangling five From a position of this sort if the enemy is unprepared you may sally forth and defeat him But if the enemy is prepared for your coming and you fail to defeat him then return being impossible disaster will ensue six When the position is such that neither side will gain by making the first move it is called temporizing ground seven In a position of this sort even though the enemy should offer us an attractive bait it will be advisable not to stir forth but rather to retreat thus enticing the enemy in his turn then when part of his army has come out we may deliver our attack with advantage eight With regard to narrow passes if you can occupy them first let them be strongly garrisoned and await the advent of the enemy nine Should the army forestall you in occupying a pass do not go after him if the pass is fully garrisoned but only if it is weakly garrisoned ten With regard to precipitous heights if you are beforehand with your adversary you should occupy the raised and sunny spots and there wait for him to come up eleven If the enemy has occupied them before you do not follow him but retreat and try to entice him away twelve If you are situated at a great distance from the enemy and the strength of the two armies is equal it is not easy to provoke a battle and fighting will be to your disadvantage thirteen These six are the principles connected with Earth The general who has attained a responsible post must be careful to study them fourteen Now an army is exposed to six several calamities not arising from natural causes but from faults for which the general is responsible These are one Flight two insubordination three collapse four ruin five disorganization six rout fifteen Other conditions being equal if one force is hurled against another ten times its size the result will be the flight of the former sixteen When the common soldiers are too strong and their officers too weak the result is insubordination When the officers are too strong and the common soldiers too weak the result is collapse seventeen When the higher officers are angry and insubordinate and on meeting the enemy give battle on their own account from a feeling of resentment before the commander in chief can tell whether or not he is in a position to fight the result is ruin eighteen When the general is weak and without authority when his orders are not clear and distinct when there are no fixes duties assigned to officers and men and the ranks are formed in a slovenly haphazard manner the result is utter disorganization nineteen When a general unable to estimate the enemy s strength allows an inferior force to engage a larger one or hurls a weak detachment against a powerful one and neglects to place picked soldiers in the front rank the result must be rout twenty These are six ways of courting defeat which must be carefully noted by the general who has attained a responsible post twenty one The natural formation of the country is the soldier s best ally but a power of estimating the adversary of controlling the forces of victory and of shrewdly calculating difficulties dangers and distances constitutes the test of a great general twenty two He who knows these things and in fighting puts his knowledge into practice will win his battles He who knows them not nor practices them will surely be defeated twenty three If fighting is sure to result in victory then you must fight even though the ruler forbid it if fighting will not result in victory then you must not fight even at the ruler s bidding twenty four The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign is the jewel of the kingdom twenty five Regard your soldiers as your children and they will follow you into the deepest valleys look upon them as your own beloved sons and they will stand by you even unto death twenty six If however you are indulgent but unable to make your authority felt kind hearted but unable to enforce your commands and incapable moreover of quelling disorder then your soldiers must be likened to spoilt children they are useless for any practical purpose twenty seven If we know that our own men are in a condition to attack but are unaware that the enemy is not open to attack we have gone only halfway towards victory twenty eight If we know that the enemy is open to attack but are unaware that our own men are not in a condition to attack we have gone only halfway towards victory twenty nine If we know that the enemy is open to attack and also know that our men are in a condition to attack but are unaware that the nature of the ground makes fighting impracticable we have still gone only halfway towards victory thirty Hence the experienced soldier once in motion is never bewildered once he has broken camp he is never at a loss thirty one Hence the saying If you know the enemy and know yourself your victory will not stand in doubt if you know Heaven and know Earth you may make your victory complete XI THE NINE SITUATIONS one Sun Tzu said The art of war recognizes nine varieties of ground one Dispersive ground two facile ground three contentious ground four open ground five ground of intersecting highways six serious ground seven difficult ground eight hemmed in ground nine desperate ground two When a chieftain is fighting in his own territory it is dispersive ground three When he has penetrated into hostile territory but to no great distance it is facile ground four Ground the possession of which imports great advantage to either side is contentious ground five Ground on which each side has liberty of movement is open ground six Ground which forms the key to three contiguous states so that he who occupies it first has most of the Empire at his command is a ground of intersecting highways seven When an army has penetrated into the heart of a hostile country leaving a number of fortified cities in its rear it is serious ground eight Mountain forests rugged steeps marshes and fens all country that is hard to traverse this is difficult ground nine Ground which is reached through narrow gorges and from which we can only retire by tortuous paths so that a small number of the enemy would suffice to crush a large body of our men this is hemmed in ground ten Ground on which we can only be saved from destruction by fighting without delay is desperate ground eleven On dispersive ground therefore fight not On facile ground halt not On contentious ground attack not twelve On open ground do not try to block the enemy s way On the ground of intersecting highways join hands with your allies thirteen On serious ground gather in plunder In difficult ground keep steadily on the march fourteen On hemmed in ground resort to stratagem On desperate ground fight fifteen Those who were called skillful leaders of old knew how to drive a wedge between the enemy s front and rear to prevent company operation between his large and small divisions to hinder the good troops from rescuing the bad the officers from rallying their men sixteen When the enemy s men were united they managed to keep them in disorder seventeen When it was to their advantage they made a forward move when otherwise they stopped still eighteen If asked how to cope with a great host of the enemy in orderly array and on the point of marching to the attack I should say Begin by seizing something which your opponent holds dear then he will be amenable to your will nineteen Rapidity is the essence of war take advantage of the enemy s unreadiness make your way by unexpected routes and attack unguarded spots twenty The following are the principles to be observed by an invading force The further you penetrate into a country the greater will be the solidarity of your troops and thus the defenders will not prevail against you twenty one Make forays in fertile country in order to supply your army with food twenty two Carefully study the well being of your men and do not overtax them Concentrate your energy and hoard your strength Keep your army continually on the move and devise unfathomable plans twenty three Throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape and they will prefer death to flight If they will face death there is nothing they may not achieve Officers and men alike will put forth their uttermost strength twenty four Soldiers when in desperate straits lose the sense of fear If there is no place of refuge they will stand firm If they are in hostile country they will show a stubborn front If there is no help for it they will fight hard twenty five Thus without waiting to be marshaled the soldiers will be constantly on the qui vive without waiting to be asked they will do your will without restrictions they will be faithful without giving orders they can be trusted twenty six Prohibit the taking of omens and do away with superstitious doubts Then until death itself comes no calamity need be feared twenty seven If our soldiers are not overburdened with money it is not because they have a distaste for riches if their lives are not unduly long it is not because they are disinclined to longevity twenty eight On the day they are ordered out to battle your soldiers may weep those sitting up bedewing their garments and those lying down letting the tears run down their cheeks But let them once be brought to bay and they will display the courage of a Chu or a Kuei twenty nine The skillful tactician may be likened to the shuai jan Now the shuai jan is a snake that is found in the ChUng mountains Strike at its head and you will be attacked by its tail strike at its tail and you will be attacked by its head strike at its middle and you will be attacked by head and tail both thirty Asked if an army can be made to imitate the shuai jan I should answer Yes For the men of Wu and the men of Yueh are enemies yet if they are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a storm they will come to each other s assistance just as the left hand helps the right thirty one Hence it is not enough to put one s trust in the tethering of horses and the burying of chariot wheels in the ground thirty two The principle on which to manage an army is to set up one standard of courage which all must reach thirty three How to make the best of both strong and weak that is a question involving the proper use of ground thirty four Thus the skillful general conducts his army just as though he were leading a single man willy nilly by the hand thirty five It is the business of a general to be quiet and thus ensure secrecy upright and just and thus maintain order thirty six He must be able to mystify his officers and men by false reports and appearances and thus keep them in total ignorance thirty seven By altering his arrangements and changing his plans he keeps the enemy without definite knowledge By shifting his camp and taking circuitous routes he prevents the enemy from anticipating his purpose thirty eight At the critical moment the leader of an army acts like one who has climbed up a height and then kicks away the ladder behind him He carries his men deep into hostile territory before he shows his hand thirty nine He burns his boats and breaks his cooking pots like a shepherd driving a flock of sheep he drives his men this way and that and nothing knows whither he is going forty To muster his host and bring it into danger this may be termed the business of the general forty one The different measures suited to the nine varieties of ground the expediency of aggressive or defensive tactics and the fundamental laws of human nature these are things that must most certainly be studied forty two When invading hostile territory the general principle is that penetrating deeply brings cohesion penetrating but a short way means dispersion forty three When you leave your own country behind and take your army across neighborhood territory you find yourself on critical ground When there are means of communication on all four sides the ground is one of intersecting highways forty four When you penetrate deeply into a country it is serious ground When you penetrate but a little way it is facile ground forty five When you have the enemy s strongholds on your rear and narrow passes in front it is hemmed in ground When there is no place of refuge at all it is desperate ground forty six Therefore on dispersive ground I would inspire my men with unity of purpose On facile ground I would see that there is close connection between all parts of my army forty seven On contentious ground I would hurry up my rear forty eight On open ground I would keep a vigilant eye on my defenses On ground of intersecting highways I would consolidate my alliances forty nine On serious ground I would try to ensure a continuous stream of supplies On difficult ground I would keep pushing on along the road fifty On hemmed in ground I would block any way of retreat On desperate ground I would proclaim to my soldiers the hopelessness of saving their lives fifty one For it is the soldier s disposition to offer an obstinate resistance when surrounded to fight hard when he cannot help himself and to obey promptly when he has fallen into danger fifty two We cannot enter into alliance with neighboring princes until we are acquainted with their designs We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country its mountains and forests its pitfalls and precipices its marshes and swamps We shall be unable to turn natural advantages to account unless we make use of local guides fifty three To be ignored of any one of the following four or five principles does not befit a warlike prince fifty four When a warlike prince attacks a powerful state his generalship shows itself in preventing the concentration of the enemy s forces He overawes his opponents and their allies are prevented from joining against him fifty five Hence he does not strive to ally himself with all and sundry nor does he foster the power of other states He carries out his own secret designs keeping his antagonists in awe Thus he is able to capture their cities and overthrow their kingdoms fifty six Bestow rewards without regard to rule issue orders without regard to previous arrangements and you will be able to handle a whole army as though you had to do with but a single man fifty seven Confront your soldiers with the deed itself never let them know your design When the outlook is bright bring it before their eyes but tell them nothing when the situation is gloomy fifty eight Place your army in deadly peril and it will survive plunge it into desperate straits and it will come off in safety fifty nine For it is precisely when a force has fallen into harm s way that is capable of striking a blow for victory sixty Success in warfare is gained by carefully accommodating ourselves to the enemy s purpose sixty one By persistently hanging on the enemy s flank we shall succeed in the long run in killing the commander in chief sixty two This is called ability to accomplish a thing by sheer cunning sixty three On the day that you take up your command block the frontier passes destroy the official tallies and stop the passage of all emissaries sixty four Be stern in the council chamber so that you may control the situation sixty five If the enemy leaves a door open you must rush in sixty six Forestall your opponent by seizing what he holds dear and subtly contrive to time his arrival on the ground sixty seven Walk in the path defined by rule and accommodate yourself to the enemy until you can fight a decisive battle sixty eight At first then exhibit the coyness of a maiden until the enemy gives you an opening afterwards emulate the rapidity of a running hare and it will be too late for the enemy to oppose you XII THE ATTACK BY FIRE one Sun Tzu said There are five ways of attacking with fire The first is to burn soldiers in their camp the second is to burn stores the third is to burn baggage trains the fourth is to burn arsenals and magazines the fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy two In order to carry out an attack we must have means available The material for raising fire should always be kept in readiness three There is a proper season for making attacks with fire and special days for starting a conflagration four The proper season is when the weather is very dry the special days are those when the moon is in the constellations of the Sieve the Wall the Wing or the Cross bar for these four are all days of rising wind five In attacking with fire one should be prepared to meet five possible developments six one When fire breaks out inside to enemy s camp respond at once with an attack from without seven two If there is an outbreak of fire but the enemy s soldiers remain quiet bide your time and do not attack eight three When the force of the flames has reached its height follow it up with an attack if that is practicable if not stay where you are nine four If it is possible to make an assault with fire from without do not wait for it to break out within but deliver your attack at a favorable moment ten five When you start a fire be to windward of it Do not attack from the leeward eleven A wind that rises in the daytime lasts long but a night breeze soon falls twelve In every army the five developments connected with fire must be known the movements of the stars calculated and a watch kept for the proper days thirteen Hence those who use fire as an aid to the attack show intelligence those who use water as an aid to the attack gain an accession of strength fourteen By means of water an enemy may be intercepted but not robbed of all his belongings fifteen Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed in his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise for the result is waste of time and general stagnation sixteen Hence the saying The enlightened ruler lays his plans well ahead the good general cultivates his resources seventeen Move not unless you see an advantage use not your troops unless there is something to be gained fight not unless the position is critical eighteen No ruler should put troops into the field merely to gratify his own spleen no general should fight a battle simply out of pique nineteen If it is to your advantage make a forward move if not stay where you are twenty Anger may in time change to gladness vexation may be succeeded by content twenty one But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into being nor can the dead ever be brought back to life twenty two Hence the enlightened ruler is heedful and the good general full of caution This is the way to keep a country at peace and an army intact XIII THE USE OF SPIES one Sun Tzu said Raising a host of a hundred thousand men and marching them great distances entails heavy loss on the people and a drain on the resources of the State The daily expenditure will amount to a thousand ounces of silver There will be commotion at home and abroad and men will drop down exhausted on the highways As many as seven hundred thousand families will be impeded in their labor two Hostile armies may face each other for years striving for the victory which is decided in a single day This being so to remain in ignorance of the enemy s condition simply because one grudges the outlay of a hundred ounces of silver in honors and emoluments is the height of inhumanity three One who acts thus is no leader of men no present help to his sovereign no master of victory four Thus what enables the wise sovereign and the good general to strike and conquer and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men is foreknowledge five Now this foreknowledge cannot be elicited from spirits it cannot be obtained inductively from experience nor by any deductive calculation six Knowledge of the enemy s dispositions can only be obtained from other men seven Hence the use of spies of whom there are five classes one Local spies two inward spies three converted spies four doomed spies five surviving spies eight When these five kinds of spy are all at work none can discover the secret system This is called divine manipulation of the threads It is the sovereign s most precious faculty nine Having local spies means employing the services of the inhabitants of a district ten Having inward spies making use of officials of the enemy eleven Having converted spies getting hold of the enemy s spies and using them for our own purposes twelve Having doomed spies doing certain things openly for purposes of deception and allowing our spies to know of them and report them to the enemy thirteen Surviving spies finally are those who bring back news from the enemy s camp fourteen Hence it is that which none in the whole army are more intimate relations to be maintained than with spies None should be more liberally rewarded In no other business should greater secrecy be preserved fifteen Spies cannot be usefully employed without a certain intuitive sagacity sixteen They cannot be properly managed without benevolence and straightforwardness seventeen Without subtle ingenuity of mind one cannot make certain of the truth of their reports eighteen Be subtle be subtle and use your spies for every kind of business nineteen If a secret piece of news is divulged by a spy before the time is ripe he must be put to death together with the man to whom the secret was told twenty Whether the object be to crush an army to storm a city or to assassinate an individual it is always necessary to begin by finding out the names of the attendants the aides de camp and door keepers and sentries of the general in command Our spies must be commissioned to ascertain these twenty one The enemy s spies who have come to spy on us must be sought out tempted with bribes led away and comfortably housed Thus they will become converted spies and available for our service twenty two It is through the information brought by the converted spy that we are able to acquire and employ local and inward spies twenty three It is owing to his information again that we can cause the doomed spy to carry false tidings to the enemy twenty four Lastly it is by his information that the surviving spy can be used on appointed occasions twenty five The end and aim of spying in all its five varieties is knowledge of the enemy and this knowledge can only be derived in the first instance from the converted spy Hence it is essential that the converted spy be treated with the utmost liberality twenty six Of old the rise of the Yin dynasty was due to I Chih who had served under the Hsia Likewise the rise of the Chou dynasty was due to Lu Ya who had served under the Yin twenty seven Hence it is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who will use the highest intelligence of the army for purposes of spying and thereby they achieve great results Spies are a most important element in water

electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support Project Gutenberg tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U S unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook s eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII compressed zipped HTML and others Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility http www gutenberg org This Web site includes information about Project
