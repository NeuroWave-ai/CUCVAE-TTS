1050_134119_000014_000001	train-clean-360	It would not take so long to write as a letter and would not be so expensive 
1050_134119_000014_000002	train-clean-360	But could they get the whole subject on a postal 
1050_134119_000015_000000	train-clean-360	mister Peterkin believed there could be no difficulty there was but one question 
1050_134119_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Shall the adventures of the Peterkin family be published 
none	none	This was decided upon and there was room for each of the family to sign the little boys contenting themselves with rough sketches of their india rubber boots mister Peterkin Agamemnon and Solomon John took the postal card to the post office early one morning and by the afternoon of that very day and all the next day and for many days came streaming in answers on postals and on letters 
1050_134119_000018_000001	train-clean-360	Their card had been addressed to the lady from Philadelphia with the number of her street 
none	none	But it must have been read by their neighbors in their own town post office before leaving it must have been read along its way for by each mail came piles of postals and letters from town after town in answer to the question and all in the same tone Yes yes publish the adventures of the Peterkin family
1050_134119_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Publish them of course 
1050_134119_000020_000000	train-clean-360	And in time came the answer of the lady from Philadelphia Yes of course publish them 
none	none	This is why they were published THE LADY WHO PUT SALT IN HER COFFEE 
1050_134119_000023_000000	train-clean-360	THIS was missus Peterkin 
1050_134119_000023_000001	train-clean-360	It was a mistake 
none	none	She had poured out a delicious cup of coffee and just as she was helping herself to cream she found she had put in salt instead of sugar 
1050_134119_000023_000003	train-clean-360	It tasted bad 
none	none	What should she do Of course she couldn t drink the coffee so she called in the family for she was sitting at a late breakfast all alone The family came in they all tasted and looked and wondered what should be done and all sat down to think At last Agamemnon who had been to college said Why don t we go over and ask the advice of the chemist For the chemist lived over the way and was a very wise man missus Peterkin said Yes and mister Peterkin said Very well and all the children said they would go too So the little boys put on their india rubber boots and over they went Now the chemist was just trying to find out something which should turn everything it touched into gold and he had a large glass bottle into which he put all kinds of gold and silver and many other valuable things and melted them all up over the fire till he had almost found what he wanted 
1050_134119_000025_000001	train-clean-360	He could turn things into almost gold 
none	none	But just now he had used up all the gold that he had round the house and gold was high He had used up his wife s gold thimble and his great grandfather s gold bowed spectacles and he had melted up the gold head of his great great grandfather s cane and just as the Peterkin family came in he was down on his knees before his wife asking her to let him have her wedding ring to melt up with an the rest because this time he knew he should succeed and should be able to turn everything into gold and then she could have a new wedding ring of diamonds all set in emeralds and rubies and topazes and all the furniture could be turned into the finest of gold Now his wife was just consenting when the Peterkin family burst in You can imagine how mad the chemist was 
1050_134119_000026_000001	train-clean-360	He came near throwing his crucible that was the name of his melting pot at their heads 
1050_134119_000026_000002	train-clean-360	But he didn t 
none	none	He listened as calmly as he could to the story of how missus Peterkin had put salt in her coffee At first he said he couldn t do anything about it but when Agamemnon said they would pay in gold if he would only go he packed up his bottles in a leather case and went back with them all 
1050_134119_000028_000000	train-clean-360	First he looked at the coffee and then stirred it 
none	none	Then he put in a little chlorate of potassium and the family tried it all round but it tasted no better Then he stirred in a little bichlorate of magnesia But missus Peterkin didn t like that 
1050_134119_000028_000003	train-clean-360	Then he added some tartaric acid and some hypersulphate of lime 
1050_134119_000028_000004	train-clean-360	But no it was no better 
1050_134119_000028_000005	train-clean-360	 I have it exclaimed the chemist a little ammonia is just the thing No it wasn t the thing at all 
1050_134119_000029_000000	train-clean-360	Then he tried each in turn some oxalic cyanic acetic phosphoric chloric hyperchloric sulphuric boracic silicic nitric formic nitrous nitric and carbonic acids 
1050_134119_000029_000001	train-clean-360	missus Peterkin tasted each and said the flavor was pleasant but not precisely that of coffee 
none	none	So then he tried a little calcium aluminum barium and strontium a little clear bitumen and a half of a third of a sixteenth of a grain of arsenic This gave rather a pretty color but still missus Peterkin ungratefully said it tasted of anything but coffee 
1050_134119_000030_000001	train-clean-360	The chemist was not discouraged 
none	none	He put in a little belladonna and atropine some granulated hydrogen some potash and a very little antimony finishing off with a little pure carbon But still missus Peterkin was not satisfied 
1050_134119_000031_000000	train-clean-360	The chemist said that all he had done ought to have taken out the salt 
none	none	The theory remained the same although the experiment had failed Perhaps a little starch would have some effect If not that was all the time he could give 
1050_134119_000031_000003	train-clean-360	He should like to be paid and go 
none	none	They were all much obliged to him and willing to give him one dollar thirty seven cents one two in gold Gold was now two point sixty nine three four so mister Peterkin found in the newspaper This gave Agamemnon a pretty little sum 
1050_134119_000031_000007	train-clean-360	He sat himself down to do it 
none	none	But there was the coffee All sat and thought awhile till Elizabeth Eliza said Why don t we go to the herb woman Elizabeth Eliza was the only daughter She was named after her two aunts Elizabeth from the sister of her father Eliza from her mother s sister Now the herb woman was an old woman who came round to sell herbs and knew a great deal They all shouted with joy at the idea of asking her and Solomon John and the younger children agreed to go and find her too The herb woman lived down at the very end of the street so the boys put on their india rubber boots again and they set off It was a long walk through the village but they came at last to the herb woman s house at the foot of a high hill They went through her little garden Here she had marigolds and hollyhocks and old maids and tall sunflowers and all kinds of sweet smelling herbs so that the air was full of tansy tea and elder blow Over the porch grew a hop vine and a brandy cherry tree shaded the door and a luxuriant cranberry vine flung its delicious fruit across the window They went into a small parlor which smelt very spicy All around hung little bags full of catnip and peppermint and all kinds of herbs and dried stalks hung from the ceiling and on the shelves were jars of rhubarb senna manna and the like But there was no little old woman She had gone up into the woods to get some more wild herbs so they all thought they would follow her Elizabeth Eliza Solomon John and the little boys They had to climb up over high rocks and in among huckleberry bushes and black berry vines But the little boys had their india rubber boots At last they discovered the little old woman 
1050_134119_000032_000005	train-clean-360	They knew her by her hat 
1050_134119_000032_000006	train-clean-360	It was steeple crowned without any vane 
1050_134119_000032_000007	train-clean-360	They saw her digging with her trowel round a sassafras bush 
none	none	They told her their story how their mother had put salt in her coffee and how the chemist had made it worse instead of better and how their mother couldn t drink it and wouldn t she come and see what she could do And she said she would and took up her little old apron with pockets all round all filled with everlasting and pennyroyal and went back to her house 
1050_134119_000033_000000	train-clean-360	There she stopped and stuffed her huge pockets with some of all the kinds of herbs 
none	none	She took some tansy and peppermint and caraway seed and dill spearmint and cloves pennyroyal and sweet marjoram basil and rosemary wild thyme and some of the other time such as you have in clocks sappermint and oppermint catnip valerian and hop indeed there isn t a kind of herb you can think of that the little old woman didn t have done up in her little paper bags that had all been dried in her little Dutch oven She packed these all up and then went back with the children taking her stick 
1050_134119_000034_000000	train-clean-360	Meanwhile missus Peterkin was getting quite impatient for her coffee 
none	none	As soon as the little old woman came she had it set over the fire and began to stir in the different herbs First she put in a little hop for the bitter missus Peterkin said it tasted like hop tea and not at all like coffee 
1050_134119_000036_000001	train-clean-360	Then she tried a little flagroot and snakeroot then some spruce gum and some caraway and some dill some rue and rosemary some sweet marjoram and sour some oppermint and sappermint a little spearmint and peppermint some wild thyme and some of the other tame time some tansy and basil and catnip and valerian and sassafras ginger and pennyroyal 
1050_134119_000036_000002	train-clean-360	The children tasted after each mixture but made up dreadful faces 
1050_134119_000036_000003	train-clean-360	missus Peterkin tasted and did the same 
1050_134119_000036_000004	train-clean-360	The more the old woman stirred and the more she put in the worse it all seemed to taste 
none	none	So the old woman shook her head and muttered a few words and said she must go 
1050_134119_000037_000001	train-clean-360	She believed the coffee was bewitched 
none	none	She bundled up her packets of herbs and took her trowel and her basket and her stick and went back to her root of sassafras that she had left half in the air and half out 
1050_134119_000037_000003	train-clean-360	And all she would take for pay was five cents in currency 
1050_134119_000038_000000	train-clean-360	Then the family were in despair and all sat and thought a great while It was growing late in the day and missus Peterkin hadn t had her cup of coffee 
1050_134119_000038_000001	train-clean-360	At last Elizabeth Eliza said They say that the lady from Philadelphia who is staying in town is very wise 
1050_134119_000038_000002	train-clean-360	Suppose I go and ask her what is best to be done To this they all agreed it was a great thought and off Elizabeth Eliza went 
none	none	She told the lady from Philadelphia the whole story how her mother had put salt in the coffee how the chemist had been called in how he tried everything but could make it no better and how they went for the little old herb woman and how she had tried in vain for her mother couldn t drink the coffee The lady from Philadelphia listened very attentively and then said Why doesn t your mother make a fresh cup of coffee Elizabeth Eliza started with surprise Solomon John shouted with joy so did Agamemnon who had just finished his sum so did the little boys who had followed on
1050_134119_000040_000001	train-clean-360	 Why didn t we think of that said Elizabeth Eliza and they all went back to their mother and she had her cup of coffee 
none	none	ABOUT ELIZABETH ELIZA S PIANO 
1050_134120_000002_000000	train-clean-360	ELIZABETH ELIZA had a present of a piano and she was to take lessons of the postmaster s daughter 
none	none	They decided to have the piano set across the window in the parlor and the carters brought it in and went away After they had gone the family all came in to look at the piano but they found the carters had placed it with its back turned towards the middle of the room standing close against the window 
1050_134120_000005_000000	train-clean-360	How could Elizabeth Eliza open it 
1050_134120_000005_000001	train-clean-360	How could she reach the keys to play upon it 
none	none	Solomon John proposed that they should open the window which Agamemnon could do with his long arms Then Elizabeth Eliza should go round upon the piazza and open the piano Then she could have her music stool on the piazza and play upon the piano there So they tried this and they all thought it was a very pretty sight to see Elizabeth Eliza playing on the piano while she sat on the piazza with the honeysuckle vines behind her 
1050_134120_000008_000000	train-clean-360	It was very pleasant too moonlight evenings 
none	none	mister Peterkin liked to take a doze on his sofa in the room but the rest of the family liked to sit on the piazza 
1050_134120_000009_000000	train-clean-360	So did Elizabeth Eliza only she had to have her back to the moon 
none	none	All this did very well through the summer but when the fall came mister Peterkin thought the air was too cold from the open window and the family did not want to sit out on the piazza Elizabeth Eliza practiced in the mornings with her cloak on but she was obliged to give up her music in the evenings the family shivered so 
1050_134120_000012_000000	train-clean-360	One day when she was talking with the lady from Philadelphia she spoke of this trouble 
none	none	The lady from Philadelphia looked surprised and then said But why don t you turn the piano round One of the little boys pertly said It is a square piano But Elizabeth Eliza went home directly and with the help of Agamemnon and Solomon John turned the piano round
1050_134120_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Why did we not think of that before said missus Peterkin 
none	none	What shall we do when the lady from Philadelphia goes home again THE PETERKINS TRY TO BECOME WISE THEY were sitting round the breakfast table and wondering what they should do because the lady from Philadelphia had gone away If said missus Peterkin we could only be more wise as a family How could they manage it Agamemnon had been to college and the children all went to school but still as a family they were not wise
1050_134120_000018_000003	train-clean-360	 It comes from books said one of the family 
1050_134120_000018_000004	train-clean-360	 People who have a great many books are very wise Then they counted up that there were very few books in the house a few school books and missus Peterkin s cook book were all 
none	none	That s the thing said Agamemnon We want a library We want a library said Solomon John And all of them exclaimed We want a library
1050_134120_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Let us think how we shall get one said missus Peterkin 
none	none	I have observed that other people think a great deal of thinking So they all sat and thought a great while Then said Agamemnon I will make a library There are some boards in the wood shed and I have a hammer and some nails and perhaps we can borrow some hinges and there we have our library They were all very much pleased at the idea
1050_134120_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 That s the book case part said Elizabeth Eliza but where are the books 
none	none	So they sat and thought a little while when Solomon John exclaimed I will make a book They all looked at him in wonder
1050_134120_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes said Solomon John books will make us wise but first I must make a book 
1050_134120_000029_000000	train-clean-360	So they went into the parlor and sat down to make a book 
1050_134120_000029_000001	train-clean-360	But there was no ink 
1050_134120_000030_000000	train-clean-360	What should he do for ink 
none	none	Elizabeth Eliza said she had heard that nutgalls and vinegar made very good ink 
1050_134120_000030_000002	train-clean-360	So they decided to make some The little boys said they could find some nutgalls up in the woods So they all agreed to set out and pick some 
1050_134120_000030_000003	train-clean-360	missus Peterkins put on her cape bonnet and the little boys got into their india rubber boots and off they went 
none	none	The nutgalls were hard to find There was almost everything else in the woods chestnuts and walnuts and small hazel nuts and a great many squirrels and they had to walk a great way before they found any nutgalls At last they came home with a large basket and two nutgalls in it Then came the question of the vinegar missus Peterkin had used her very last on some beets they had the day before Suppose we go and ask the minister s wife said Elizabeth Eliza So they all went to the minister s wife She said if they wanted some good vinegar they had better set a barrel of cider down in the cellar and in a year or two it would make very nice vinegar But they said they wanted it that very afternoon When the minister s wife heard this she said she should be very glad to let them have some vinegar and gave them a cupful to carry home So they stirred in the nutgalls and by the time evening came they had very good ink Then Solomon John wanted a pen Agamemnon had a steel one but Solomon John said Poets always used quills Elizabeth Eliza suggested that they should go out to the poultry yard and get a quill 
1050_134120_000033_000002	train-clean-360	But it was already dark 
none	none	They had however two lanterns and the little boys borrowed the neighbors 
1050_134120_000033_000004	train-clean-360	They set out in procession for the poultry yard 
1050_134120_000033_000005	train-clean-360	When they got there the fowls were all at roost so they could look at them quietly 
none	none	SOLOMON JOHN S BOOK 
1050_134120_000035_000000	train-clean-360	But there were no geese 
none	none	There were Shanghais and Cochin Chinas and Guinea hens and Barbary hens and speckled hens and Poland roosters and bantams and ducks and turkeys but not one goose
1050_134120_000035_000002	train-clean-360	 No geese but ourselves said missus Peterkin wittily as they returned to the house The sight of this procession roused up the village 
none	none	A torchlight procession cried all the boys of the town and they gathered round the house shouting for the flag and mister Peterkin had to invite them in and give them cider and gingerbread before he could explain to them that it was only his family visiting his hens 
1050_134120_000036_000000	train-clean-360	After the crowd had dispersed Solomon John sat down to think of his writing again 
none	none	Agamemnon agreed to go over to the bookstore to get a quill They all went over with him 
1050_134120_000036_000003	train-clean-360	The bookseller was just shutting up his shop 
none	none	However he agreed to go in and get a quill which he did and they hurried home 
1050_134120_000037_000000	train-clean-360	So Solomon John sat down again but there was no paper 
1050_134120_000037_000001	train-clean-360	And now the bookstore was shut up 
none	none	mister Peterkin suggested that the mail was about in and perhaps he should have a letter and then they could use the envelope to write upon So they all went to the post office and the little boys had their india rubber boots on and they all shouted when they found mister Peterkin had a letter The postmaster inquired what they were shouting about and when they told him he said he would give Solomon John a whole sheet of paper for his book And they all went back rejoicing So Solomon John sat down and the family all sat round the table looking at him He had his pen his ink and his paper He dipped his pen into the ink and held it over the paper and thought a minute and then said But I haven t got anything to say missus PETERKIN WISHES TO GO TO DRIVE ONE morning missus Peterkin was feeling very tired as she had been having a great many things to think of and she said to mister Peterkin I believe I shall take a ride this morning And the little boys cried out Oh may we go too missus Peterkin said that Elizabeth Eliza and the little boys might go So mister Peterkin had the horse put into the carryall and he and Agamemnon went off to their business and Solomon John to school and missus Peterkin began to get ready for her ride She had some currants she wanted to carry to old missus Twomly and some gooseberries for somebody else and Elizabeth Eliza wanted to pick some flowers to take to the minister s wife so it took them a long time to prepare The little boys went out to pick the currants and the gooseberries and Elizabeth Eliza went out for her flowers and missus Peterkin put on her cape bonnet and in time they were all ready The little boys were in their india rubber boots and they got into the carriage Elizabeth Eliza was to drive so she sat on the front seat and took up the reins and the horse started off merrily and then suddenly stopped and would not go any farther 
1050_134120_000047_000000	train-clean-360	Elizabeth Eliza shook the reins and pulled them and then she clucked to the horse and missus Peterkin clucked and the little boys whistled and shouted but still the horse would not go 
1050_134120_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 We shall have to whip him said Elizabeth Eliza 
none	none	Now missus Peterkin never liked to use the whip but as the horse would not go she said she would get out and turn her head the other way while Elizabeth Eliza whipped the horse and when he began to go she would hurry and get in 
1050_134120_000050_000000	train-clean-360	So they tried this but the horse would not stir 
none	none	Perhaps we have too heavy a load said missus Peterkin as she got in So they took out the currants and the gooseberries and the flowers but still the horse would not go One of the neighbors from the opposite house looking out just then called out to them to try the whip There was a high wind and they could not hear exactly what she said
1050_134120_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 I have tried the whip said Elizabeth Eliza 
none	none	She says whips such as you eat said one of the little boys
1050_134120_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 We might make those said missus Peterkin thoughtfully 
1050_134120_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 We have got plenty of cream said Elizabeth Eliza 
none	none	Yes let us have some whips cried the little boys getting out And the opposite neighbor cried out something about whips and the wind was very high So they went into the kitchen and whipped up the cream and made some very delicious whips and the little boys tasted all round and they all thought they were very nice 
1050_134120_000061_000000	train-clean-360	They carried some out to the horse who swallowed it down very quickly 
1050_134120_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 That is just what he wanted said missus Peterkin now he will certainly go 
none	none	So they all got into the carriage again and put in the currants and the gooseberries and the flowers and Elizabeth Eliza shook the reins and they all clucked but still the horse would not go We must either give up our ride said missus Peterkin mournfully or else send over to the lady from Philadelphia and see what she will say 
1050_134120_000065_000000	train-clean-360	The little boys jumped out as quickly as they could they were eager to go and ask the lady from Philadelphia 
none	none	Elizabeth Eliza went with them while her mother took the reins They found that the lady from Philadelphia was very ill that day and was in her bed But when she was told what the trouble was she very kindly said they might draw up the curtain from the window at the foot of the bed and open the blinds and she would see Then she asked for her opera glass and looked through it across the way up the street to missus Peterkin s door After she had looked through the glass she laid it down leaned her head back against the pillow for she was very tired and then said Why don t you unchain the horse from the horse post Elizabeth Eliza and the little boys looked at one another and then hurried back to the house and told their mother The horse was untied and they all went to ride THE PETERKINS AT HOME AT DINNER ANOTHER little incident occurred in the Peterkin family 
1050_134121_000002_000001	train-clean-360	This was at dinner time 
none	none	They sat down to a dish of boiled ham Now it was a peculiarity of the children of the family that half of them liked fat and half liked lean 
1050_134121_000003_000002	train-clean-360	mister Peterkin sat down to cut the ham 
none	none	But the ham turned out to be a very remarkable one The fat and the lean came in separate slices first one of lean than one of fat then two slices of lean and so on mister Peterkin began as usual by helping the children first according to their age Now Agamemnon who liked lean got a fat slice and Elizabeth Eliza who preferred fat had a lean slice Solomon John who could eat nothing but lean was helped to fat and so on 
1050_134121_000003_000008	train-clean-360	Nobody had what he could eat 
1050_134121_000004_000000	train-clean-360	It was a rule of the Peterkin family that no one should eat any of the vegetables without some of the meat so now although the children saw upon their plates apple sauce and squash and tomato and sweet potato and sour potato not one of them could eat a mouthful because not one was satisfied with the meat 
none	none	mister and missus Peterkin however liked both fat and lean and were making a very good meal when they looked up and saw the children all sitting eating nothing and looking dissatisfied into their plates What is the matter now said mister Peterkin But the children were taught not to speak at table Agamemnon however made a sign of disgust at his fat and Elizabeth Eliza at her lean and so on and they presently discovered what was the difficulty
1050_134121_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 What shall be done now said missus Peterkin 
none	none	They all sat and thought for a little while 
1050_134121_000009_000000	train-clean-360	At last said missus Peterkin rather uncertainly Suppose we ask the lady from Philadelphia what is best to be done 
1050_134121_000010_000000	train-clean-360	But mister Peterkin said he didn t like to go to her for everything let the children try and eat their dinner as it was 
1050_134121_000011_000000	train-clean-360	And they all tried but they couldn t 
1050_134121_000011_000001	train-clean-360	 Very well then said mister Peterkin let them go and ask the lady from Philadelphia 
1050_134121_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 All of us cried one of the little boys in the excitement of the moment 
1050_134121_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes said missus Peterkin only put on your india rubber boots And they hurried out of the house 
none	none	The lady from Philadelphia was just going in to her dinner but she kindly stopped in the entry to hear what the trouble was 
1050_134121_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Agamemnon and Elizabeth Eliza told her all the difficulty and the lady from Philadelphia said But why don t you give the slices of fat to those who like the fat and the slices of lean to those who like the lean 
none	none	They looked at one another Agamemnon looked at Elizabeth Eliza and Solomon John looked at the little boys
1050_134121_000015_000002	train-clean-360	 Why didn t we think of that said they and ran home to tell their mother 
none	none	WHY THE PETERKINS HAD A LATE DINNER THE trouble was in the dumb waiter 
1050_134121_000017_000001	train-clean-360	All had seated themselves at the dinner table and Amanda had gone to take out the dinner she had sent up from the kitchen on the dumb waiter 
1050_134121_000017_000002	train-clean-360	But something was the matter she could not pull it up 
1050_134121_000017_000003	train-clean-360	There was the dinner but she could not reach it 
1050_134121_000017_000004	train-clean-360	All the family in turn went and tried all pulled together in vain the dinner could not be stirred 
1050_134121_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 No dinner exclaimed Agamemnon 
none	none	I am quite hungry said Solomon John 
1050_134121_000020_000000	train-clean-360	At last mister Peterkin said I am not proud 
none	none	I am willing to dine in the kitchen This room was below the dining room 
1050_134121_000021_000001	train-clean-360	All consented to this 
1050_134121_000021_000002	train-clean-360	Each one went down taking a napkin 
none	none	The cook laid the kitchen table put on it her best table cloth and the family sat down 
1050_134121_000022_000001	train-clean-360	Amanda went to the dumb waiter for the dinner but she could not move it down 
none	none	The family were all in dismay There was the dinner half way between the kitchen and dining room and there were they all hungry to eat it
1050_134121_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 What is there for dinner asked mister Peterkin 
1050_134121_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Roast turkey said missus Peterkin 
none	none	mister Peterkin lifted his eyes to the ceiling
1050_134121_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Squash tomato potato and sweet potato missus Peterkin continued 
1050_134121_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Sweet potato exclaimed both the little boys 
1050_134121_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 I am very glad now that I did not have cranberry said missus Peterkin anxious to find a bright point 
1050_134121_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Let us sit down and think about it said mister Peterkin 
none	none	I have an idea said Agamemnon after a while
1050_134121_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Let us hear it said mister Peterkin 
none	none	Let each one speak his mind
1050_134121_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 The turkey said Agamemnon must be just above the kitchen door 
1050_134121_000033_000001	train-clean-360	If I had a ladder and an axe I could cut away the plastering and reach it 
1050_134121_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 That is a great idea said missus Peterkin 
1050_134121_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 If you think you could do it said mister Peterkin 
1050_134121_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Would it not be better to have a carpenter asked Elizabeth Eliza 
1050_134121_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 a carpenter 
none	none	asked Elizabeth Eliza
1050_134121_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 A carpenter might have a ladder and an axe and I think we have neither said missus Peterkin 
none	none	A carpenter 
1050_134121_000038_000001	train-clean-360	A carpenter exclaimed the rest 
1050_134121_000039_000000	train-clean-360	It was decided that mister Peterkin Solomon John and the little boys should go in search of a carpenter 
1050_134121_000040_000000	train-clean-360	Agamemnon proposed that meanwhile he should go and borrow a book for he had another idea 
1050_134121_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 This affair of the turkey he said reminds me of those buried cities that have been dug out Herculaneum for instance 
1050_134121_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh yes interrupted Elizabeth Eliza and Pompeii 
none	none	Yes said Agamemnon they found there pots and kettles 
1050_134121_000043_000001	train-clean-360	Now I should like to know how they did it and I mean to borrow a book and read 
1050_134121_000043_000002	train-clean-360	I think it was done with a pickaxe 
none	none	So the party set out 
1050_134121_000044_000001	train-clean-360	But when mister Peterkin reached the carpenter s shop there was no carpenter to be found there 
none	none	He must be at his house eating his dinner suggested Solomon John
1050_134121_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Happy man exclaimed mister Peterkin he has a dinner to eat 
1050_134121_000047_000000	train-clean-360	They went to the carpenter s house but found he had gone out of town for a day s job 
none	none	But his wife told them that he always came back at night to ring the nine o clock bell We must wait till then said mister Peterkin with an effort at cheerfulness At home he found Agamemnon reading his book and all sat down to hear of Herculaneum and Pompeii 
1050_134121_000050_000000	train-clean-360	Time passed on and the question arose about tea 
none	none	Would it do to have tea when they had had no dinner 
1050_134121_000050_000002	train-clean-360	A part of the family thought it would not do the rest wanted tea 
none	none	I suppose you remember the wise lady of Philadelphia who was here not long ago said mister Peterkin
1050_134121_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh yes said missus Peterkin 
1050_134121_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 Let us try to think what she would advise us said mister Peterkin 
1050_134121_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 I wish she were here said Elizabeth Eliza 
1050_134121_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 I think said mister Peterkin she would say let them that want tea have it the rest can go without 
1050_134121_000056_000000	train-clean-360	So they had tea and as it proved all sat down to it 
none	none	But not much was eaten as there had been no dinner When the nine o clock bell was heard Agamemnon Solomon John and the little boys rushed to the church and found the carpenter 
1050_134121_000058_000000	train-clean-360	They asked him to bring a ladder axes and pickaxe 
none	none	As he felt it might be a case of fire he brought also his fire buckets 
1050_134121_000059_000000	train-clean-360	When the matter was explained to him he went into the dining room looked into the dumb waiter untwisted a cord and arranged the weight and pulled up the dinner 
1050_134121_000060_000000	train-clean-360	There was a family shout 
1050_134121_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 The trouble was in the weight said the carpenter 
1050_134121_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 That is why it is called a dumb waiter Solomon John explained to the little boys 
1050_134121_000063_000000	train-clean-360	The dinner was put upon the table 
none	none	missus Peterkin frugally suggested that they might now keep it for the next day as to day was almost gone and they had had tea But nobody listened All sat down to the roast turkey and Amanda warmed over the vegetables Patient waiters are no losers said Agamemnon THE PETERKINS SUMMER JOURNEY IN fact it was their last summer s journey for it had been planned then but there had been so many difficulties it had been delayed The first trouble had been about trunks The family did not own a trunk suitable for travelling Agamemnon had his valise that he had used when he stayed a week at a time at the academy and a trunk had been bought for Elizabeth Eliza when she went to the seminary Solomon John and mister Peterkin each had his patent leather hand bag But all these were too small for the family And the little boys wanted to carry their kite missus Peterkin suggested her grandmother s trunk This was a hair trunk very large and capacious It would hold everything they would want to carry except what would go in Elizabeth Eliza s trunk or the valise and bags Everybody was delighted at this idea It was agreed that the next day the things should be brought into missus Peterkin s room for her to see if they could all be packed If we can get along said Elizabeth Eliza without having to ask advice I shall be glad Yes said mister Peterkin It is time now for people to be coming to ask advice of us The next morning missus Peterkin began by taking out the things that were already in the trunk Here were last year s winter things and not only these but old clothes that had been put away missus Peterkin s wedding dress the skirts the little boys used to wear before they put on jackets and trousers All day missus Peterkin worked over the trunk putting away the old things putting in the new She packed up all the clothes she could think of both summer and winter ones because you never can tell what sort of weather you will have Agamemnon fetched his books and Solomon John his spy glass There were her own and Elizabeth Eliza s best bonnets in a bandbox also Solomon John s hats for he had an old one and a new one He bought a new hat for fishing with a very wide brim and deep crown all of heavy straw Agamemnon brought down a large heavy dictionary and an atlas still larger This contained maps of all the countries in the world I have never had a chance to look at them he said but when one travels then is the time to study geography mister Peterkin wanted to take his turning lathe So missus Peterkin packed his tool chest It gave her some trouble for it came to her just as she had packed her summer dresses At first she thought it would help to smooth the dresses and placed it on top but she was forced to take all out and set it at the bottom This was not so much matter as she had not yet the right dresses to put in Both missus Peterkin and Elizabeth Eliza would need new dresses for this occasion The little boys hoops went in so did their india rubber boots in case it should not rain when they started They each had a hoe and shovel and some baskets that were packed missus Peterkin called in all the family on the evening of the second day to see how she had succeeded Everything was packed even the little boys kite lay smoothly on the top I like to see a thing so nicely done said mister Peterkin The next thing was to cord up the trunk and mister Peterkin tried to move it But neither he nor Agamemnon nor Solomon John could lift it alone or all together Here was a serious difficulty Solomon John tried to make light of it Expressmen could lift it Expressmen were used to such things But we did not plan expressing it said missus Peterkin in a discouraged tone We can take a carriage said Solomon John I am afraid the trunk would not go on the back of a carriage said missus Peterkin The hackman could not lift it either said mister Peterkin People do travel with a great deal of baggage said Elizabeth Eliza And with very large trunks said Agamemnon Still they are trunks that can be moved said mister Peterkin giving another try at the trunk in vain I am afraid we must give it up he said it would be such a trouble in going from place to place We would not mind if we got it to the place said Elizabeth Eliza But how to get it there mister Peterkin asked with a sigh This is our first obstacle said Agamemnon we must do our best to conquer it What is an obstacle asked the little boys It is the trunk said Solomon John Suppose we look out the word in the dictionary said Agamemnon taking the large volume from the trunk Ah here it is And he read OBSTACLE an impediment That is a worse word than the other said one of the little boys But listen to this and Agamemnon continued Impediment is something that entangles the feet obstacle something that stands in the way obstruction something that blocks up the passage hinderance something that holds back The trunk is all these said mister Peterkin gloomily It does not entangle the feet said Solomon John for it can t move I wish it could said the little boys together missus Peterkin spent a day or two in taking the things out of the trunk and putting them away At least she said this has given me some experience in packing And the little boys felt as if they had quite been a journey But the family did not like to give up their plan It was suggested that they might take the things out of the trunk and pack it at the station the little boys could go and come with the things But Elizabeth Eliza thought the place too public Gradually the old contents of the great trunk went back again to it At length a friend unexpectedly offered to lend mister Peterkin a good sized family trunk But it was late in the season and so the journey was put off from that summer But now the trunk was sent round to the house and a family consultation was held about packing it Many things would have to be left at home it was so much smaller than the grandmother s hair trunk But Agamemnon had been studying the atlas through the winter and felt familiar with the more important places so it would not be necessary to take it And mister Peterkin decided to leave his turning lathe at home and his tool chest Again missus Peterkin spent two days in accommodating the things With great care and discretion and by borrowing two more leather bags it could be accomplished Everything of importance could be packed except the little boys kite What should they do about that The little boys proposed carrying it in their hands but Solomon John and Elizabeth Eliza would not consent to this I do think it is one of the cases where we might ask the advice of the lady from Philadelphia said missus Peterkin at last She has come on here said Agamemnon and we have not been to see her this summer She may think we have been neglecting her suggested mister Peterkin The little boys begged to be allowed to go and ask her opinion about the kite They came back in high spirits She says we might leave this one at home and make a new kite when we get there they cried What a sensible idea exclaimed mister Peterkin and I may have leisure to help you We ll take plenty of newspapers said Solomon John And twine said the little boys And this matter was settled The question then was When should they go THE PETERKINS SNOWED UP missus PETERKIN awoke one morning to find a heavy snow storm raging The wind had flung the snow against the windows had heaped it up around the house and thrown it into huge white drifts over the fields covering hedges and fences missus Peterkin went from one window to the other to look out but nothing could be seen but the driving storm and the deep white snow Even mister Bromwick s house on the opposite side of the street was hidden by the swift falling flakes What shall I do about it thought missus Peterkin No roads cleared out Of course there ll be no butcher and no milkman The first thing to be done was to wake up all the family early for there was enough in the house for breakfast and there was no knowing when they would have anything more to eat It was best to secure the breakfast first So she went from one room to the other as soon as it was light waking the family and before long all were dressed and downstairs And then all went round the house to see what had happened All the water pipes that there were were frozen The milk was frozen They could open the door into the wood house but the wood house door into the yard was banked up with snow and the front door and the piazza door and the side door stuck Nobody could get in or out Meanwhile Amanda the cook had succeeded in making the kitchen fire but had discovered there was no furnace coal The furnace coal was to have come to day said missus Peterkin apologetically Nothing will come to day said mister Peterkin shivering But a fire could be made in a stove in the dining room All were glad to sit down to breakfast and hot coffee The little boys were much pleased to have ice cream for breakfast When we get a little warm said mister Peterkin we will consider what is to be done I am thankful I ordered the sausages yesterday said missus Peterkin I was to have had a leg of mutton to day Nothing will come to day said Agamemnon gloomily Are these sausages the last meat in the house asked mister Peterkin Yes said missus Peterkin The potatoes also were gone the barrel of apples empty and she had meant to order more flour that very day Then we are eating our last provisions said Solomon John helping himself to another sausage I almost wish we had stayed in bed said Agamemnon I thought it best to make sure of our breakfast first repeated missus Peterkin Shall we literally have nothing left to eat asked mister Peterkin There s the pig suggested Solomon John Yes happily the pigsty was at the end of the wood house and could be reached under cover But some of the family could not eat fresh pork We should have to corn part of him said Agamemnon My butcher has always told me said missus Peterkin that if I wanted a ham I must keep a pig Now we have the pig but have not the ham Perhaps we could corn one or two of his legs suggested one of the little boys We need not settle that now said mister Peterkin At least the pig will keep us from starving The little boys looked serious they were fond of their pig If we had only decided to keep a cow said missus Peterkin Alas yes said mister Peterkin one learns a great many things too late Then we might have had ice cream all the time exclaimed the little boys Indeed the little boys in spite of the prospect of starving were quite pleasantly excited at the idea of being snowed up and hurried through their breakfasts that they might go and try to shovel out a path from one of the doors I ought to know more about the water pipes said mister Peterkin Now I shut off the water last night in the bath room or else I forgot to and I ought to have shut it off in the cellar The little boys came back Such a wind at the front door they were going to try the side door Another thing I have learned to day said mister Peterkin is not to have all the doors on one side of the house because the storm blows the snow against all the doors Solomon John started up Let us see if we are blocked up on the east side of the house he exclaimed Of what use asked mister Peterkin since we have no door on the east side We could cut one said Solomon John Yes we could cut a door exclaimed Agamemnon But how can we tell whether there is any snow there asked Elizabeth Eliza for there is no window In fact the east side of the Peterkins house formed a blank wall The owner had originally planned a little block of semi detached houses He had completed only one very semi and very detached It is not necessary to see said Agamemnon profoundly of course if the storm blows against this side of the house the house itself must keep the snow from the other side Yes said Solomon John there must be a space clear of snow on the east side of the house and if we could open a way to that We could open a way to the butcher said mister Peterkin promptly Agamemnon went for his pick axe He had kept one in the house ever since the adventure of the dumb waiter What part of the wall had we better attack asked mister Peterkin missus Peterkin was alarmed What will mister Mudge the owner of the house think of it she exclaimed Have we a right to injure the wall of the house It is right to preserve ourselves from starving said mister Peterkin The drowning man must snatch at a straw It is better that he should find his house chopped a little when the thaw comes said Elizabeth Eliza than that he should find us lying about the house dead of hunger upon the floor missus Peterkin was partially convinced The little boys came in to warm their hands They had not succeeded in opening the side door and were planning trying to open the door from the wood house to the garden That would be of no use said missus Peterkin the butcher cannot get into the garden But we might shovel off the snow suggested one of the little boys and dig down to some of last year s onions Meanwhile mister Peterkin Agamemnon and Solomon John had been bringing together their carpenter s tools and Elizabeth Eliza proposed using a gouge if they would choose the right spot to begin The little boys were delighted with the plan and hastened to find one a little hatchet and the other a gimlet Even Amanda armed herself with a poker It would be better to begin on the ground floor said mister Peterkin Except that we may meet with a stone foundation said Solomon John If the wall is thinner upstairs said Agamemnon it will do as well to cut a window as a door and haul up anything the butcher may bring below in his cart Everybody began to pound a little on the wall to find a favorable place and there was a great deal of noise The little boys actually cut a bit out of the plastering with their hatchet and gimlet Solomon John confided to Elizabeth Eliza that it reminded him of stories of prisoners who cut themselves free through stone walls after days and days of secret labor missus Peterkin even had come with a pair of tongs in her hand She was interrupted by a voice behind her Here s your leg of mutton marm It was the butcher How had he got in Excuse me marm for coming in at the side door but the back gate is kinder blocked up You were making such a pounding I could not make anybody hear me knock at the side door But how did you make a path to the door asked mister Peterkin You must have been working at it a long time It must be near noon now I m about on regular time answered the butcher The town team has cleared out the high road and the wind has been down the last half hour The storm is over True enough The Peterkins had been so busy inside the house they had not noticed the ceasing of the storm outside And we were all up an hour earlier than usual said mister Peterkin when the butcher left He had not explained to the butcher why he had a pickaxe in his hand If we had lain abed till the usual time said Solomon John we should have been all right For here is the milkman said Elizabeth Eliza as a knock was now heard at the side door It is a good thing to learn said mister Peterkin not to get up any earlier than is necessary THE PETERKINS DECIDE TO KEEP A COW NOT that they were fond of drinking milk nor that they drank very much But for that reason mister Peterkin thought it would be well to have a cow to encourage the family to drink more as he felt it would be so healthy missus Peterkin recalled the troubles of the last cold winter and how near they came to starving when they were shut up in a severe snow storm and the water pipes burst and the milk was frozen If the cow shed could open out of the wood shed such trouble might be prevented Tony Larkin was to come over and milk the cow every morning and Agamemnon and Solomon John agreed to learn how to milk in case Tony should be snowed up or have the whooping cough in the course of the winter The little boys thought they knew how already But if they were to have three or four pailfuls of milk every day it was important to know where to keep it One way will be said missus Peterkin to use a great deal every day We will make butter That will be admirable thought mister Peterkin And custards suggested Solomon John And syllabub said Elizabeth Eliza And cocoa nut cakes exclaimed the little boys We don t need the milk for cocoa nut cakes said missus Peterkin The little boys thought they might have a cocoa nut tree instead of a cow You could have the milk from the cocoa nuts and it would be pleasant climbing the tree and you would not have to feed it Yes said mister Peterkin we shall have to feed the cow Where shall we pasture her asked Agamemnon Up on the hills up on the hills exclaimed the little boys where there are a great many bars to take down and huckleberry bushes mister Peterkin had been thinking of their own little lot behind the house But I don t know he said but the cow might eat off all the grass in one day and there would not be any left for to morrow unless the grass grew fast enough every night Agamemnon said it would depend upon the season In a rainy season the grass would come up very fast in a drought it might not grow at all I suppose said missus Peterkin that is the worst of having a cow there might be a drought mister Peterkin thought they might make some calculation from the quantity of grass in the lot Solomon John suggested that measurements might be made by seeing how much grass the Bromwicks cow opposite them eat up in a day The little boys agreed to go over and spend the day on the Bromwicks fence and take an observation The trouble would be said Elizabeth Eliza that cows walk about so and the Bromwicks yard is very large Now she would be eating in one place and then she would walk to another She would not be eating all the time a part of the time she would be chewing The little boys thought they should like nothing better than to have some sticks and keep the cow in one corner of the yard till the calculations were made But Elizabeth Eliza was afraid the Bromwicks would not like it Of course it would bring all the boys in the school about the place and very likely they would make the cow angry Agamemnon recalled that mister Bromwick once wanted to hire mister Peterkin s lot for his cow mister Peterkin started up That is true and of course mister Bromwick must have known there was feed enough for one cow And the reason you didn t let him have it said Solomon John was that Elizabeth Eliza was afraid of cows I did not like the idea said Elizabeth Eliza of their cow s looking at me over the top of the fence perhaps when I should be planting the sweet peas in the garden I hope our cow would be a quiet one I should not like her jumping over the fence into the flower beds mister Peterkin declared that he should buy a cow of the quietest kind I should think something might be done about covering her horns said missus Peterkin that seems the most dangerous part Perhaps they might be padded with cotton Elizabeth Eliza said cows were built so large and clumsy that if they came at you they could not help knocking you over The little boys would prefer having the pasture a great way off Half the fun of having a cow would be going up on the hills after her Agamemnon thought the feed was not so good on the hills The cow would like it ever so much better the little boys declared on account of the variety If she did not like the rocks and the bushes she could walk round and find the grassy places I am not sure said Elizabeth Eliza but it would be less dangerous to keep the cow in the lot behind the house because she would not be coming and going morning and night in that jerky way the Larkins cows come home They don t mind which gate they rush in at I should hate to have our cow dash into our front yard just as I was coming home of an afternoon That is true said mister Peterkin we can have the door of the cow house open directly into the pasture and save the coming and going The little boys were quite disappointed The cow would miss the exercise and they would lose a great pleasure Solomon John suggested that they might sit on the fence and watch the cow It was decided to keep the cow in their own pasture and as they were to put on an end kitchen it would be perfectly easy to build a dairy The cow proved a quiet one She was a little excited when all the family stood round at the first milking and watched her slowly walking into the shed Elizabeth Eliza had her scarlet sack dyed brown a fortnight before It was the one she did her gardening in and it might have infuriated the cow And she kept out of the garden the first day or two missus Peterkin and Elizabeth Eliza bought the best kind of milk pans of every size But there was a little disappointment about the taste of the milk The little boys liked it and drank large mugs of it Elizabeth Eliza said she could never learn to love milk warm from the cow though she would like to do her best to patronize the cow missus Peterkin was afraid Amanda did not under stand about taking care of the milk yet she had been down to overlook her and she was sure the pans and the closet were all clean Suppose we send a pitcher of cream over to the lady from Philadelphia to try said Elizabeth Eliza it will be a pretty attention before she goes It might be awkward if she didn t like it said Solomon John Perhaps something is the matter with the grass I gave the cow an apple to eat yesterday said one of the little boys remorsefully Elizabeth Eliza went over and missus Peterkin too and explained all to the lady from Philadelphia asking her to taste the milk The lady from Philadelphia tasted and said the truth was that the milk was sour I was afraid it was so said missus Peterkin but I didn t know what to expect from these new kinds of cows The lady from Philadelphia asked where the milk was kept In the new dairy answered Elizabeth Eliza Is that in a cool place asked the lady from Philadelphia Elizabeth Eliza explained it was close by the new kitchen Is it near the chimney inquired the lady from Philadelphia It is directly back of the chimney and the new kitchen range replied Elizabeth Eliza I suppose it is too hot Well well said missus Peterkin that is it Last winter the milk froze and now we have gone to the other extreme Where shall we put our dairy THE PETERKINS CHRISTMAS TREE EARLY in the autumn the Peterkins began to prepare for their Christmas tree Everything was done in great privacy as it was to be a surprise to the neighbors as well as to the rest of the family mister Peterkin had been up to mister Bromwick s wood lot and with his consent selected the tree Agamemnon went to look at it occasionally after dark and Solomon John made frequent visits to it mornings just after sunrise mister Peterkin drove Elizabeth Eliza and her mother that way and pointed furtively to it with his whip but none of them ever spoke of it aloud to each other It was suspected that the little boys had been to see it Wednesday and Saturday afternoons But they came home with their pockets full of chestnuts and said nothing about it At length mister Peterkin had it cut down and brought secretly into the Larkin s barn A week or two before Christmas a measurement was made of it with Elizabeth Eliza s yard measure To mister Peterkin s great dismay it was discovered that it was too high to stand in the back parlor This fact was brought out at a secret council of mister and missus Peterkin Elizabeth Eliza and Agamemnon Agamemnon suggested that it might be set up slanting but missus Peterkin was very sure it would make her dizzy and the candles would drip But a brilliant idea came to mister Peterkin He proposed that the ceiling of the parlor should be raised to make room for the top of the tree Elizabeth Eliza thought the space would need to be quite large It must not be like a small box or you could not see the tree Yes said mister Peterkin I should have the ceiling lifted all across the room the effect would be finer Elizabeth Eliza objected to having the whole ceiling raised because her room was over the back parlor and she would have no floor while the alteration was going on which would be very awkward Besides her room was not very high now and if the floor were raised perhaps she could not walk in it upright mister Peterkin explained that he didn t propose altering the whole ceiling but to life up a ridge across the room at the back part where the tree was to stand This would make a hump to be sure in Elizabeth Eliza s room but it would go across the whole room Elizabeth Eliza said she would not mind that It would be like the cuddy thing that comes up on the deck of a ship that you sit against only here you would not have the sea sickness She thought she should like it for a rarity She might use it for a divan missus Peterkin thought it would come in the worn place of the carpet and might be a convenience in making the carpet over Agamemnon was afraid there would be trouble in keeping the matter secret for it would be a long piece of work for a carpenter but mister Peterkin proposed having the carpenter for a day or two for a number of other jobs One of them was to make all the chairs in the house of the same height for missus Peterkin had nearly broken her spine by sitting down in a chair that she had supposed was her own rocking chair and it had proved to be two inches lower The little boys were now large enough to sit in any chair so a medium was fixed upon to satisfy all the family and the chairs were made uniformly of the same height On consulting the carpenter however he insisted that the tree could be cut off at the lower end to suit the height of the parlor and demurred at so great a change as altering the ceiling But mister Peterkin had set his mind upon the improvement and Elizabeth Eliza had cut her carpet in preparation for it So the folding doors into the back parlor were closed and for nearly a fortnight before Christmas there was great litter of fallen plastering and laths and chips and shavings and Elizabeth Eliza s carpet was taken up and the furniture had to be changed and one night she had to sleep at the Bromwicks for there was a long hole in her floor that might be dangerous All this delighted the little boys They could not understand what was going on Perhaps they suspected a Christmas tree but they did not know why a Christmas tree should have so many chips and were still more astonished at the hump that appeared in Elizabeth Eliza s room It must be a Christmas present or else the tree in a box Some aunts and uncles too arrived a day or two before Christmas with some small cousins These cousins occupied the attention of the little boys and there was a great deal of whispering and mystery behind doors and under the stairs and in the corners of the entry Solomon John was busy privately making some candles for the tree He had been collecting some bayberries as he understood they made very nice candles so that it would not be necessary to buy any The elders of the family never all went into the back parlor together and all tried not to see what was going on missus Peterkin would go in with Solomon John or mister Peterkin with Elizabeth Eliza or Elizabeth Eliza and Agamemnon and Solomon John The little boys and the small cousins were never allowed even to look inside the room Elizabeth Eliza meanwhile went into town a number of times She wanted to consult Amanda as to how much ice cream they should need and whether they could make it at home as they had cream and ice She was pretty busy in her own room the furniture had to be changed and the carpet altered The hump was higher than she expected There was danger of bumping her own head whenever she crossed it She had to nail some padding on the ceiling for fear of accidents The afternoon before Christmas Elizabeth Eliza Solomon John and their father collected in the back parlor for a council The carpenters had done their work and the tree stood at its full height at the back of the room the top stretching up into the space arranged for it All the chips and shavings were cleared away and it stood on a neat box But what were they to put upon the tree Solomon John had brought in his supply of candles but they proved to be very stringy and very few of them It was strange how many bayberries it took to make a few candles The little boys had helped him and he had gathered as much as a bushel of bayberries He had put them in water and skimmed off the wax according to the directions but there was so little wax Solomon John had given the little boys some of the bits sawed off from the legs of the chairs He had suggested that they should cover them with gilt paper to answer for gilt apples without telling them what they were for These apples a little blunt at the end and the candles were all they had for the tree After all her trips into town Elizabeth Eliza had forgotten to bring anything for it I thought of candies and sugar plums she said but I concluded if we made caramels ourselves we should not need them But then we have not made caramels The fact is that day my head was full of my carpet I had bumped it pretty badly too mister Peterkin wished he had taken instead of a fir tree an apple tree he had seen in October full of red fruit But the leaves would have fallen off by this time said Elizabeth Eliza And the apples too said Solomon John It is odd I should have forgotten that day I went in on purpose to get the things said Elizabeth Eliza musingly But I went from shop to shop and didn t know exactly what to get I saw a great many gilt things for Christmas trees but I knew the little boys were making the gilt apples there were plenty of candles in the shops but I knew Solomon John was making the candles mister Peterkin thought it was quite natural Solomon John wondered if it were too late for them to go into town now Elizabeth Eliza could not go in the next morning for there was to be a grand Christmas dinner and mister Peterkin could not be spared and Solomon John was sure he and Agamemnon would not know what to buy Besides they would want to try the candles to night mister Peterkin asked if the presents everybody had been preparing would not answer But Elizabeth Eliza knew they would be too heavy A gloom came over the room There was only a flickering gleam from one of Solomon John s candles that he had lighted by way of trial Solomon John again proposed going into town He lighted a match to examine the newspaper about the trains There were plenty of trains coming out at that hour but none going in except a very late one That would not leave time to do anything and come back We could go in Elizabeth Eliza and I said Solomon John but we should not have time to buy anything Agamemnon was summoned in missus Peterkin was entertaining the uncles and aunts in the front parlor Agamemnon wished there was time to study up something about electric lights If they could only have a calcium light Solomon John s candle sputtered and went out At this moment there was a loud knocking at the front door The little boys and the small cousins and the uncles and aunts and missus Peterkin hastened to see what was the matter The uncles and aunts thought somebody s house must be on fire The door was opened and there was a man white with flakes for it was beginning to snow and he was pulling in a large box missus Peterkin supposed it contained some of Elizabeth Eliza s purchases so she ordered it to be pushed into the back parlor and hastily called back her guests and the little boys into the other room The little boys and the small cousins were sure they had seen Santa Claus himself mister Peterkin lighted the gas The box was addressed to Elizabeth Eliza It was from the lady from Philadelphia She had gathered a hint from Elizabeth Eliza s letters that there was to be a Christmas tree and had filled this box with all that would be needed It was opened directly There was every kind of gilt hanging thing from gilt pea pods to butterflies on springs There were shining flags and lanterns and birdcages and nests with birds sitting on them baskets of fruit gilt apples and bunches of grapes and at the bottom of the whole a large box of candles and a box of Philadelphia bonbons Elizabeth Eliza and Solomon John could scarcely keep from screaming The little boys and the small cousins knocked on the folding doors to ask what was the matter Hastily mister Peterkin and the rest took out the things and hung them on the tree and put on the candles When all was done it looked so well that mister Peterkin exclaimed Let us light the candles now and send to invite all the neighbors to night and have the tree on Christmas Eve And so it was that the Peterkins had their Christmas tree the day before and on Christmas night could go and visit their neighbors missus PETERKIN S TEA PARTY TWAS important to have a tea party as they had all been invited by everybody the Bromwicks the Tremletts and the Gibbonses It would be such a good chance to pay off some of their old debts now that the lady from Philadelphia was back again and her two daughters who would be sure to make it all go off well But as soon as they began to make out the list they saw there were too many to have at once for there were but twelve cups and saucers in the best set There are seven of us to begin with said mister Peterkin We need not all drink tea said missus Peterkin I never do said Solomon John The little boys never did And we could have coffee too suggested Elizabeth Eliza That would take as many cups objected Agamemnon We could use the every day set for the coffee answered Elizabeth Eliza they are the right shape Besides she went on they would not all come mister and missus Bromwick for instance they never go out There are but six cups in the every day set said missus Peterkin The little boys said there were plenty of saucers and mister Peterkin agreed with Elizabeth Eliza that all would not come Old mister Jeffers never went out There are three of the Tremletts said Elizabeth Eliza they never go out together One of them if not two will be sure to have the headache Ann Maria Bromwick would come and the three Gibbons boys and their sister Juliana but the other sisters are out West and there is but one Osborne It really did seem safe to ask everybody They would be sorry after it was over that they had not asked more We have the cow said missus Peterkin so there will be as much cream and milk as we shall need And our own pig said Agamemnon I am glad we had it salted so we can have plenty of sandwiches I will buy a chest of tea exclaimed mister Peterkin I have been thinking of a chest for some time missus Peterkin thought a whole chest would not be needed it was as well to buy the tea and coffee by the pound But mister Peterkin determined on a chest of tea and a bag of coffee So they decided to give the invitations to all It might be a stormy evening and some would be prevented The lady from Philadelphia and her daughters accepted And it turned out a fair day and more came than were expected Ann Maria Bromwick had a friend staying with her and brought her over for the Bromwicks were opposite neighbors And the Tremletts had a niece and Mary Osborne an aunt that they took the liberty to bring The little boys were at the door to show in the guests and as each set came to the front gate they ran back to tell their mother that more were coming missus Peterkin had grown dizzy with counting those who had come and trying to calculate how many were to come and wondering why there were always more and never less and whether the cups would go round The three Tremletts all came with their niece They all had had their headaches the day before and were having that banged feeling you always have after a headache so they all sat at the same side of the room on the long sofa All the Jefferses came though they had sent uncertain answers Old mister Jeffers had to be helped in with his cane by mister Peterkin The Gibbons boys came and would stand just outside the parlor door And Juliana appeared afterward with the two other sisters unexpectedly home from the West Got home this morning they said And so glad to be in time to see everybody a little tired to be sure after forty eight hours in a sleeping car Forty eight repeated missus Peterkin and wondered if there were forty eight people and why they were all so glad to come and whether all could sit down Old mister and missus Bromwick came They thought it would not be neighborly to stay away They insisted on getting into the most uncomfortable seats Yet there seemed to be seats enough while the Gibbons boys preferred to stand But they never could sit round a tea table Elizabeth Eliza had thought they all might have room at the table and Solomon John and the little boys could help in the waiting It was a great moment when the lady from Philadelphia arrived with her daughters mister Peterkin was talking to mister Bromwick who was a little deaf The Gibbons boys retreated a little farther behind the parlor door missus Peterkin hastened forward to shake hands with the lady from Philadelphia saying Four Gibbons girls and Mary Osborne s aunt that makes nineteen and now It made no difference what she said for there was such a murmuring of talk that any words suited And the lady from Philadelphia wanted to be introduced to the Bromwicks It was delightful for the little boys They came to Elizabeth Eliza and asked Can t we go and ask more Can t we fetch the Larkins Oh dear no answered Elizabeth Eliza I can t even count them missus Peterkin found time to meet Elizabeth Eliza in the side entry to ask if there were going to be cups enough I have set Agamemnon in the front entry to count said Elizabeth Eliza putting her hand to her head The little boys came to say that the Maberlys were coming The Maberlys exclaimed Elizabeth Eliza I never asked them It is your father s doing cried missus Peterkin I do believe he asked everybody he saw And she hurried back to her guests What if father really has asked everybody Elizabeth Eliza said to herself pressing her head again with her hand There were the cow and the pig But if they all took tea or coffee or both the cups could not go round Agamemnon returned in the midst of her agony He had not been able to count the guests they moved about so they talked so and it would not look well to appear to count What shall we do exclaimed Elizabeth Eliza We are not a family for an emergency said Agamemnon What do you suppose they did in Philadelphia at the Exhibition when there were more people than cups and saucers asked Elizabeth Eliza Could not you go and inquire I know the lady from Philadelphia is talking about the Exhibition and telling how she stayed at home to receive friends And they must have had trouble there Could not you go in and ask just as if you wanted to know Agamemnon looked into the room but there were too many talking with the lady from Philadelphia If we could only look into some book he said the encyclopaedia or the dictionary they are such a help sometimes At this moment he thought of his Great Triumphs of Great Men that he was reading just now He had not reached the lives of the Stephensons or any of the men of modern times He might skip over to them he knew they were men for emergencies He ran up to his room and met Solomon John coming down with chairs That is a good thought said Agamemnon I will bring down more upstairs chairs No said Solomon John here are all that can come down the rest of the bedroom chairs match bureaus and they never will do Agamemnon kept on to his own room to consult his books If only he could invent something on the spur of the moment a set of bedroom furniture that in an emergency could be turned into parlor chairs It seemed an idea and he sat himself down to his table and pencils when he was interrupted by the little boys who came to tell him that Elizabeth Eliza wanted him The little boys had been busy thinking They proposed that the tea table with all the things on should be pushed into the front room where the company were and those could take cups who could find cups But Elizabeth Eliza feared it would not be safe to push so large a table it might upset and break what china they had Agamemnon came down to find her pouring out tea in the back room She called to him Agamemnon you must bring Mary Osborne to help and perhaps one of the Gibbons boys would carry round some of the cups And so she began to pour out and to send round the sandwiches and the tea and the coffee Let things go as far as they would The little boys took the sugar and cream As soon as they have done drinking bring back the cups and saucers to be washed she said to the Gibbons boys and the little boys This was an idea of Mary Osborne s But what was their surprise that the more they poured out the more cups they seemed to have Elizabeth Eliza took the coffee and Mary Osborne the tea Amanda brought fresh cups from the kitchen I can t understand it Elizabeth Eliza said to Amanda Do they come back to you round through the piazza Surely there are more cups than there were Her surprise was greater when some of them proved to be coffee cups that matched the set And they never had had coffee cups Solomon John came in at this moment breathless with triumph Solomon John Elizabeth Eliza exclaimed I cannot understand the cups It is my doing said Solomon John with an elevated air I went to the lady from Philadelphia in the midst of her talk What do you do in Philadelphia when you haven t enough cups Borrow of my neighbors she answered as quick as she could She must have guessed interrupted Elizabeth Eliza That may be said Solomon John But I whispered to Ann Maria Bromwick she was standing by and she took me straight over into their closet and old mister Bromwick bought this set just where we bought ours And they had a coffee set too You mean where our father and mother bought them We were not born said Elizabeth Eliza It is all the same said Solomon John They match exactly So they did and more and more came in Elizabeth Eliza exclaimed And Agamemnon says we are not a family for emergencies Ann Maria was very good about it said Solomon John and quick too And old missus Bromwick has kept all her set of two dozen coffee and tea cups Elizabeth Eliza was ready to faint with delight and relief She told the Gibbons boys by mistake instead of Agamemnon and the little boys She almost let fall the cups and saucers she took in her hand No trouble now She thought of the cow and she thought of the pig and she poured on No trouble except about the chairs She looked into the room all seemed to be sitting down even her mother No her father was standing talking to mister Jeffers But he was drinking coffee and the Gibbons boys were handing things around The daughters of the lady from Philadelphia were sitting on shawls on the edge of the window that opened upon the piazza It was a soft warm evening and some of the young people were on the piazza Everybody was talking and laughing except those who were listening mister Peterkin broke away to bring back his cup and another for more coffee It s a great success Elizabeth Eliza he whispered The coffee is admirable and plenty of cups We asked none too many I should not mind having a tea party every week Elizabeth Eliza sighed with relief as she filled his cup It was going off well There were cups enough but she was not sure she could live over another such hour of anxiety and what was to be done after tea THE PETERKINS TOO LATE FOR THE EXHIBITION Dramatis Personae Amanda friend of Elizabeth Eliza Amanda s mother girls of the graduating class missus Peterkin Elizabeth Eliza AMANDA coming in with a few graduates MOTHER the exhibition is over and I have brought the whole class home to the collation MOTHER The

in a horse AMANDA You are too foolish Julia They came in the carryall part But didn t you start in time missus PETERKIN It all comes from the carryall being so hard to turn I told mister Peterkin we should get into trouble with one of those carryalls that don t turn easy ELIZABETH ELIZA They turn easy enough in the stable so you can t tell missus PETERKIN Yes we started with the little boys and Solomon John on the back seat and Elizabeth Eliza on the front She was to drive and I was to see to the driving But the horse was not faced toward Boston MOTHER And you tipped over in turning round Oh what an accident AMANDA And the little boys where are they Are they killed ELIZABETH ELIZA The little boys are all safe We left them at the Pringles with Solomon John MOTHER But what did happen missus PETERKIN We started the wrong way MOTHER You lost your way after all ELIZABETH ELIZA No we knew the way well enough AMANDA It s as plain as a pikestaff missus PETERKIN No we had the horse faced in the wrong direction toward Providence ELIZABETH ELIZA And mother was afraid to have me turn and we kept on and on till we should reach a wide place missus PETERKIN I thought we should come to a road that would veer off to the right or left and bring us back to the right direction MOTHER Could not you all get out and turn the thing round missus PETERKIN Why no if it had broken down we should not have been in anything and could not have gone anywhere ELIZABETH ELIZA Yes I have always heard it was best to stay in the carriage whatever happens JULIA But nothing seemed to happen missus PETERKIN O yes

round That was just what we couldn t MOTHER You don t mean you kept on all the way to Providence ELIZABETH ELIZA O dear no We kept on and on till we met a man with a black hand bag black leather I should say JULIA He must have been a book agent missus PETERKIN I dare say he was his bag seemed heavy He set it on a stone MOTHER I dare say it was the same one that came here the other day He wanted me to buy the History of the Aborigines Brought up from Earliest Times to the Present Date in four volumes I told him I hadn t time to read so much He said that was no matter few did and it wasn t much worth it they bought books for the look of the thing AMANDA Now that was illiterate he never could have graduated I hope Elizabeth Eliza you had nothing to do with that man ELIZABETH ELIZA Very

exhibition and seeing you take the diploma Amanda I never got the diploma myself I came near it missus PETERKIN Somehow Elizabeth Eliza never succeeded I think there was partiality about the promotions ELIZABETH ELIZA I never was good about remembering things I studied well enough but when I came to say off my lesson I couldn t think what it was Yet I could have answered some of the other girls questions JULIA It s odd how the other girls always have the easiest questions ELIZABETH ELIZA I never could remember poetry There was only one thing I could repeat AMANDA Oh do let us have it now and then we ll recite to you some of our exhibition pieces ELIZABETH ELIZA I ll try missus PETERKIN Yes Elizabeth Eliza do what you can to help entertain Amanda s friends All stand looking at

JULIA I think you must have omitted something AMANDA She has left out ever so much MOTHER Perhaps it s as well to omit some for the ice cream has come and you must all come down AMANDA And here are the rest of the girls and let us all unite in a song Exeunt omnes singing THE PETERKINS CELEBRATE THE FOURTH OF JULY THE day began early A compact had been made with the little boys the evening before They were to be allowed to usher in the glorious day by the blowing of horns exactly at sunrise But they were to blow them for precisely five minutes only and no sound of the horns should be heard afterward till the family were downstairs It was thought that a peace might thus be bought by a short though crowded period of noise The morning came Even before the morning at half past three o clock a terrible blast of the horns aroused the whole family missus Peterkin clasped her hands to her head and exclaimed I am thankful the lady from Philadelphia is not here For she had been invited to stay a week but had declined to come before the Fourth of July as she was not well and her doctor had prescribed quiet And the number of the horns was most remarkable It was as though every cow in the place had arisen and was blowing through both her own horns How many little boys are there How many have we exclaimed mister Peterkin going over their names one by one mechanically thinking he would do it as he might count imaginary sheep jumping over a fence to put himself to sleep Alas the counting could not put him to sleep now in such a din And how unexpectedly long the five minutes seemed Elizabeth Eliza was to take out her watch and give the signal for the end of the five minutes and the ceasing of the horns Why did not the signal come Why did not Elizabeth Eliza stop them And certainly it was long before sunrise there was no dawn to be seen We will not try this plan again said missus Peterkin If we live to another Fourth added mister Peterkin hastening to the door to inquire into the state of affairs Alas Amanda by mistake had waked up the little boys an hour too early And by another mistake the little boys had invited three or four of their friends to spend the night with them missus Peterkin had given them permission to have the boys for the whole day and they understood the day as beginning when they went to bed the night before This accounted for the number of horns It would have been impossible to hear any explanation but the five minutes were over and the horns had ceased and there remained only the noise of a singular leaping of feet explained perhaps by a possible pillow fight that kept the family below partially awake until the bells and cannon made known the dawning of the glorious day the sunrise or the rising of the sons as mister Peterkin jocosely called it when they heard the little boys and their friends clattering down the stairs to begin the outside festivities They were bound first for the swamp for Elizabeth Eliza at the suggestion of the lady from Philadelphia had advised them to hang some flags around the pillars of the piazza Now the little boys knew of a place in the swamp where they had been in the habit of digging for flag root and where they might find plenty of flag flowers They did bring away all they could but they were a little out of bloom The boys were in the midst of nailing up all they had on the pillars of the piazza when the procession of the Antiques and Horribles passed along As the procession saw the festive arrangements on the piazza and the crowd of boys who cheered them loudly it stopped to salute the house with some especial strains of greeting Poor missus Peterkin They were directly under her windows In a few moments of quiet during the boys absence from the house on their visit to the swamp she had been trying to find out whether she had a sick headache or whether it was all the noise and she was just deciding it was the sick headache but was falling into a light slumber when the fresh noise outside began There were the imitations of the crowing of cocks and braying of donkeys and the sound of horns encored and increased by the cheers of the boys Then began the torpedoes and the Antiques and Horribles had Chinese crackers also And in despair of sleep the family came down to breakfast missus Peterkin had always been much afraid of fire works and had never allowed the boys to bring gunpowder into the house She was even afraid of torpedoes they looked so much like sugar plums she was sure some the children would swallow them and explode before anybody knew it She was very timid about other things She was not sure even about pea nuts Everybody exclaimed over this Surely there was no danger in pea nuts But missus Peterkin declared she had been very much alarmed at the Centennial Exhibition and in the crowded corners of the streets in Boston at the pea nut stands where they had machines to roast the pea nuts She did not think it was safe They might go off any time in the midst of a crowd of people too mister Peterkin thought there actually was no danger and he should be sorry to give up the pea nut He thought it an American institution something really belonging to the Fourth of July He even confessed to a quiet pleasure in crushing the empty shells with his feet on the sidewalks as he went along the streets Agamemnon thought it a simple joy In consideration however of the fact that they had had no real celebration of the Fourth the last year missus Peterkin had consented to give over the day this year to the amusement of the family as a Centennial celebration She would prepare herself for a terrible noise only she did not want any gunpowder brought into the house The little boys had begun by firing some torpedoes a few days beforehand that their mother might be used to the sound and had selected their horns some weeks before Solomon John had been very busy in inventing some fireworks As missus Peterkin objected to the use of gunpowder he found out from the dictionary what the different parts of gunpowder are saltpetre charcoal and sulphur Charcoal he discovered they had in the wood house saltpetre they would find in the cellar in the beef barrel and sulphur they could buy at the apothecary s He explained to his mother that these materials had never yet exploded in the house and she was quieted Agamemnon meanwhile remembered a recipe he had read somewhere for making a fulminating paste of iron filings and powder of brimstone He had written it down on a piece of paper in his pocket book But the iron filings must be finely powdered This they began upon a day or two before and the very afternoon before laid out some of the paste on the piazza Pin wheels and rockets were contributed by mister Peterkin for the evening According to a programme drawn up by Agamemnon and Solomon John the reading of the Declaration of Independence was to take place in the morning on the piazza under the flags The Bromwicks brought over their flag to hang over the door That is what the lady from Philadelphia meant explained Elizabeth Eliza She said the flags of our country said the little boys We thought she meant in the country Quite a company assembled but it seemed nobody had a copy of the Declaration of Independence Elizabeth Eliza said she could say one line if they each could add as much But it proved they all knew the same line that she did as they began When in the course of when in the course of when in the course of human when in the course of human events when in the course of human events it becomes when in the course of human events it becomes necessary when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people They could not get any farther Some of the party decided that one people was a good place to stop and the little boys sent off some fresh torpedoes in honor of the people But mister Peterkin was not satisfied He invited the assembled party to stay until sunset and meanwhile he would find a copy and torpedoes were to be saved to be fired off at the close of every sentence And now the noon bells rang and the noon bells ceased missus Peterkin wanted to ask everybody to dinner She should have some cold beef She had let Amanda go because it was the Fourth and everybody ought to be free that one day so she could not have much of a dinner But when she went to cut her beef she found Solomon had taken it to soak on account of the saltpetre for the fireworks Well they had a pig so she took a ham and the boys had bought tamarinds and buns and a cocoa nut So the company stayed on and when the Antiques and Horribles passed again they were treated to pea nuts and lemonade They sung patriotic songs they told stories they fired torpedoes they frightened the cats with them It was a warm afternoon the red poppies were out wide and the hot sun poured down on the alley ways in the garden There was a seething sound of a hot day in the buzzing of insects in the steaming heat that came up from the ground Some neighboring boys were firing a toy cannon Every time it went off missus Peterkin started and looked to see if one of the little boys was gone mister Peterkin had set out to find a copy of the Declaration Agamemnon had disappeared She had not a moment to decide about her headache She asked Ann Maria if she were not anxious about the fireworks and if rockets were not dangerous They went up but you were never sure where they came down And then came a fresh tumult All the fire engines in town rushed toward them clanging with bells men and boys yelling They were out for a practice and for a Fourth of July show missus Peterkin thought the house was on fire and so did some of the guests There was great rushing hither and thither Some thought they would better go home some thought they would better stay missus Peterkin hastened into the house to save herself or see what she could save Elizabeth Eliza followed her first proceeding to collect all the pokers and tongs she could find because they could be thrown out of the window without breaking She had read of people who had flung looking glasses out of the window by mistake in the excitement of the house being on fire and had carried the pokers and tongs carefully into the garden There was nothing like being prepared She had always determined to do the reverse So with calmness she told Solomon John to take down the looking glasses But she met with a difficulty there were no pokers and tongs as they did not use them They had no open fires missus Peterkin had been afraid of them So Elizabeth Eliza took all the pots and kettles up to the upper windows ready to be thrown out But where was missus Peterkin Solomon John found she had fled to the attic in terror He persuaded her to come down assuring her it was the most unsafe place but she insisted upon stopping to collect some bags of old pieces that nobody would think of saving from the general wreck she said unless she did Alas this was the result of fireworks on Fourth of July As they came downstairs they heard the voices of all the company declaring there was no fire the danger was past It was long before missus Peterkin could believe it They told her the fire company was only out for show and to celebrate the Fourth of July She thought it already too much celebrated Elizabeth Eliza s kettles and pans had come down through the windows with a crash that had only added to the festivities the little boys thought mister Peterkin had been roaming about all this time in search of a copy of the Declaration of Independence The public library was shut and he had to go from house to house but now as the sunset bells and cannon began he returned with a copy and read it to the pealing of the bells and sounding of the cannon Torpedoes and crackers were fired at every pause Some sweet marjoram pots tin cans filled with crackers which were lighted went off with great explosions At the most exciting moment near the close of the reading Agamemnon with an expression of terror pulled Solomon John aside I have suddenly remembered where I read about the fulminating paste we made It was in the preface to Woodstock and I have been round to borrow the book to read the directions over again because I was afraid about the paste going off READ THIS QUICKLY and tell me Where is the fulminating paste Solomon John was busy winding some covers of paper over a little parcel It contained chlorate of potash and sulphur mixed A friend had told him of the composition The more thicknesses of paper you put round it the louder it would go off You must pound it with a hammer Solomon John felt it must be perfectly safe as his mother had taken potash for a medicine He still held the parcel as he read from Agamemnon s book This paste when it has lain together about twenty six hours will of itself take fire and burn all the sulphur away with a blue flame and a bad smell Where is the paste repeated Solomon John in terror We made it just twenty six hours ago said Agamemnon We put it on the piazza exclaimed Solomon John rapidly recalling the facts and it is in front of our mother s feet He hastened to snatch the paste away before it should take fire flinging aside the packet in his hurry Agamemnon jumping upon the piazza at the same moment trod upon the paper parcel which exploded at once with the shock and he fell to the ground while at the same moment the paste fulminated into a blue flame directly in front of missus Peterkin It was a moment of great confusion There were cries and screams The bells were still ringing the cannon firing and mister Peterkin had just reached the closing words Our lives our fortunes and our sacred honor We are all blown up as I feared we should be missus Peterkin at length ventured to say finding herself in a lilac bush by the side of the piazza She scarcely dared to open her eyes to see the scattered limbs about her It was so with all Even Ann Maria Bromwick clutched a pillar of the piazza with closed eyes At length mister Peterkin said calmly Is anybody killed There was no reply Nobody could tell whether it was because everybody was killed or because they were too wounded to answer It was a great while before missus Peterkin ventured to move But the little boys soon shouted with joy and cheered the success of Solomon John s fireworks and hoped he had some more One of them had his face blackened by an unexpected cracker and Elizabeth Eliza s muslin dress was burned here and there But no one was hurt no one had lost any limbs though missus Peterkin was sure she had seen some flying in the air Nobody could understand how as she had kept her eyes firmly shut No greater accident had occurred than the singeing of the tip of Solomon John s nose But there was an unpleasant and terrible odor from the fulminating paste missus Peterkin was extricated from the lilac bush No one knew how she got there Indeed the thundering noise had stunned everybody It had roused the neighborhood even more than before Answering explosions came on every side and though the sunset light had not faded away the little boys hastened to send off rockets under cover of the confusion Solomon John s other fireworks would not go But all felt he had done enough missus Peterkin retreated into the parlor deciding she really did have a headache At times she had to come out when a rocket went off to see if it was one of the little boys She was exhausted by the adventures of the day and almost thought it could not have been worse if the boys had been allowed gunpowder The distracted lady was thankful there was likely to be but one Centennial Fourth in her lifetime and declared she should never more keep anything in the house as dangerous as saltpetred beef and she should never venture to take another spoonful of potash THE PETERKINS PICNIC THERE was some doubt about the weather Solomon John looked at the Probabilities there were to be areas of rain in the New England States Agamemnon thought if they could only know where the areas of rain were to be they might go to the others mister Peterkin proposed walking round the house in a procession to examine the sky As they returned they met Ann Maria Bromwick who was to go much surprised not to find them ready mister and missus Peterkin were to go in the carryall and take up the lady from Philadelphia and Ann Maria with the rest was to follow in a wagon and to stop for the daughters of the lady from Philadelphia The wagon arrived and so mister Peterkin had the horse put into the carryall A basket had been kept on the back piazza for some days where anybody could put anything that would be needed for the picnic as soon as it was thought of Agamemnon had already decided to take a thermometer somebody was always complaining of being too hot or too cold at a picnic and it would be a great convenience to see if she really were so He thought now he might take a barometer as Probabilities was so uncertain Then if it went down in a threatening way they could all come back The little boys had tied their kites to the basket They had never tried them at home it might be a good chance on the hills Solomon John had put in some fishing poles Elizabeth Eliza a book of poetry mister Peterkin did not like sitting on the ground and proposed taking two chairs one for himself and one for anybody else The little boys were perfectly happy they jumped in and out of the wagon a dozen times with new india rubber boots bought for the occasion Before they started missus Peterkin began to think she had already had enough of the picnic what with going and coming and trying to remember things So many mistakes were made The things that were to go in the wagon were put in the carryall and the things in the carryall had to be taken out for the wagon Elizabeth Eliza forgot her water proof and had to go back for her veil and mister Peterkin came near forgetting his umbrella missus Peterkin sat on the piazza and tried to think She felt as if she must have forgotten something she knew she must Why could not she think of it now before it was too late It seems hard any day to think what to have for dinner but how much easier now it would be to stay at home quietly and order the dinner and there was the butcher s cart But now they must think of everything At last she was put into the carryall and mister Peterkin in front to drive Twice they started and twice they found something was left behind the loaf of fresh brown bread on the back piazza and a basket of sandwiches on the front porch And just as the wagon was leaving the little boys shrieked The basket of things was left behind Everybody got out of the wagon Agamemnon went back into the house to see if anything else were left He looked into the closets he shut the front door and was so busy that he forgot to get into the wagon himself It started off and went down the street without him He was wondering what he should do if he were left behind why had they not thought to arrange a telegraph wire to the back wheel of the wagon so that he might have sent a message in such a case when the Bromwicks drove out of their yard in their buggy and took him in They joined the rest of the party at Tatham Corners where they were all to meet and consult where they were to go missus Peterkin called to Agamemnon as soon as he appeared She had been holding the barometer and the thermometer and they waggled so that it troubled her It was hard keeping the thermometer out of the sun which would make it so warm It really took away her pleasure holding the things Agamemnon decided to get into the carryall on the seat with his father and take the barometer and thermometer The consultation went on Should they go to Cherry Swamp or Lonetown Hill You had the view if you went to Lonetown Hill but maybe the drive to Cherry Swamp was prettier Somebody suggested asking the lady from Philadelphia as the picnic was got up for her But where was she I declare said mister Peterkin I forgot to stop for her The whole picnic there and no lady from Philadelphia It seemed the horse had twitched his head in a threatening manner as they passed the house and mister Peterkin had forgotten to stop and missus Peterkin had been so busy managing the thermometers that she had not noticed and the wagon had followed on behind missus Peterkin was in despair She knew they had forgotten something She did not like to have mister Peterkin make a short turn and it was getting late and what would the lady from Philadelphia think of it and had they not better give it all up But everybody said No and mister Peterkin said he could make a wide turn round the Lovejoy barn So they made the turn and took up the lady from Philadelphia and the wagon followed behind and took up their daughters for there was a driver in the wagon besides Solomon John Ann Maria Bromwick said it was so late by this time they might as well stop and have the picnic on the Common But the question was put again Where should they go The lady from Philadelphia decided for Strawberry Nook it sounded inviting There were no strawberries and there was no nook it was said but there was a good place to tie the horses missus Peterkin was feeling a little nervous for she did not know what the lady from Philadelphia would think of their having forgotten her and the more she tried to explain it the worse it seemed to make it She supposed they never did such things in Philadelphia she knew they had invited all the world to a party but she was sure she would never want to invite anybody again There was no fun about it till it was all over Such a mistake to have a party for a person and then go without her but she knew they would forget something She wished they had not called it their picnic There was another bother mister Peterkin stopped Was anything broke exclaimed missus Peterkin Was something forgotten asked the lady from Philadelphia No But mister Peterkin didn t know the way and here he was leading all the party and a long row of carriages following They stopped and it seemed nobody knew the way to Strawberry Nook unless it was the Gibbons boys who were far behind They were made to drive up and said that Strawberry Nook was in quite a different direction but they could bring the party round to it through the meadows The lady from Philadelphia thought they might stop anywhere such a pleasant day but mister Peterkin said they were started for Strawberry Nook and had better keep on So they kept on It proved to be an excellent place where they could tie the horses to a fence missus Peterkin did not like their all heading different ways it seemed as if any of them might come at her and tear up the fence especially as the little boys had their kites flapping round The Tremletts insisted upon the whole party going up the hill it was too damp below So the Gibbons boys and the little boys and Agamemnon and Solomon John and all the party had to carry everything up to the rocks The large basket of things was very heavy It had been difficult to lift it into the wagon and it was harder to take it out But with the help of the driver and mister Peterkin and old mister Bromwick it was got up the hill And at last all was arranged mister Peterkin was seated in his chair The other was offered to the lady from Philadelphia but she preferred the carriage cushions so did old mister Bromwick And the table cloth was spread for they did bring a table cloth and the baskets were opened and the picnic really began The pickles had tumbled into the butter and the spoons had been forgotten and the Tremletts basket had been left on their front door step But nobody seemed to mind Everybody was hungry and everything they ate seemed of the best The little boys were perfectly happy and ate of all the kinds of cake Two of the Tremletts would stand while they were eating because they were afraid of the ants and the spiders that seemed to be crawling round And Elizabeth Eliza had to keep poking with a fern leaf to drive the insects out of the plates The lady from Philadelphia was made comfortable with the cushions and shawls leaning against a rock missus Peterkin wondered if she forgot she had been forgotten John Osborne said it was time for conundrums and asked Why is a pastoral musical play better than the music we have here Because one is a grasshopper and the other is a grass opera Elizabeth Eliza said she knew a conundrum a very funny one one of her friends in Boston had told her It was Why is It began Why is something like no Why are they different It was something about an old woman or else it was something about a young one It was very funny if she could only think what it was about or whether it was alike or different The lady from Philadelphia was proposing they should guess Elizabeth Eliza s conundrum first the question and then the answer when one of the Tremletts came running down the hill and declared she had just discovered a very threatening cloud and she was sure it was going to rain down directly Everybody started up though no cloud was to be seen There was a great looking for umbrellas and water proofs Then it appeared that Elizabeth Eliza had left hers after all though she had gone back for it twice mister Peterkin knew he had not forgotten his umbrella because he had put the whole umbrella stand into the wagon and it had been brought up the hill but it proved to hold only the family canes There was a great cry for the emergency basket that had not been opened yet missus Peterkin explained how for days the family had been putting into it what might be needed as soon as anything was thought of Everybody stopped to see its contents It was carefully covered with newspapers First came out a backgammon board That would be useful said Ann Maria if we have to spend the afternoon in anybody s barn Next a pair of andirons What were they for In case of needing a fire in the woods explained Solomon John Then came a volume of the Encyclopaedia But it was the first volume Agamemnon now regretted and contained only A and a part of B and nothing about rain or showers Next a bag of pea nuts put in by the little boys and Elizabeth Eliza s book of poetry and a change of boots for mister Peterkin a small foot rug in case the ground should be damp some paint boxes of the little boys a box of fish hooks for Solomon John an ink bottle carefully done up in a great deal of newspaper which was fortunate as the ink was oozing out some old magazines and a blacking bottle and at the bottom a sun dial It was all very entertaining and there seemed to be something for every occasion but the present Old mister Bromwick did not wonder the basket was so heavy It was all so interesting that nobody but the Tremletts went down to the carriages The sun was shining brighter than ever and Ann Maria insisted on setting up the sun dial Certainly there was no danger of a shower and they might as well go on with the picnic But when Solomon John and Ann Maria had arranged the sun dial they asked everybody to look at their watches so that they might see if it was right And then came a great exclamation at the hour It was time they were all going home The lady from Philadelphia had been wrapping her shawl about her as she felt the sun was low But nobody had any idea it was so late Well they had left late and went back a great many times had stopped sometimes to consult and had been long on the road and it had taken a long time to fetch up the things so it was no wonder it was time to go away But it had been a delightful picnic after all THE PETERKINS CHARADES EVER since the picnic the Peterkins had been wanting to have something at their house in the way of entertainment The little boys wanted to get up a great Exposition to show to the people of the place But mister Peterkin thought it too great an effort to send to foreign countries for exhibits and it was given up There was however a new water trough needed on the town common and the ladies of the place thought it ought to be something handsome something more than a common trough and they ought to work for it Elizabeth Eliza had heard at Philadelphia how much women had done and she felt they ought to contribute to such a cause She had an idea but she would not speak of it at first not until after she had written to the lady from Philadelphia She had often thought in many cases if they had asked her advice first they might have saved trouble Still how could they ask advice before they themselves knew what they wanted It was very easy to ask advice but you must first know what to ask about And again Elizabeth Eliza felt you might have ideas but you could not always put them together There was this idea of the water trough and then this idea of getting some money for it So she began with writing to the lady from Philadelphia The little boys believed she spent enough for it in postage stamps before it all came out But it did come out at last that the Peterkins were to have some charades at their own house for the benefit of the needed water trough tickets sold only to especial friends Ann Maria Bromwick was to help act because she could bring some old bonnets and gowns that had been worn by an aged aunt years ago and which they had always kept Elizabeth Eliza said that Solomon John would have to be a Turk and they must borrow all the red things and cashmere scarfs in the place She knew people would be willing to lend things Agamemnon thought you ought to get in something about the Hindoos they were such an odd people Elizabeth Eliza said you must not have it too odd or people would not understand it and she did not want anything to frighten her mother She had one word suggested by the lady from Philadelphia in her letters the one that had Turk in it but they ought to have two words Oh yes Ann Maria said you must have two words if the people paid for their tickets they would want to get their money s worth Solomon John thought you might have Hindoos the little boys could color their faces brown to look like Hindoos You could have the first scene an Irishman catching a hen and then paying the water taxes for dues and then have the little boys for Hindoos A great many other words were talked of but nothing seemed to suit There was a curtain too to be thought of because the folding doors stuck when you tried to open and shut them Agamemnon said that the Pan Elocutionists had a curtain they would probably lend John Osborne and so it was decided to ask John Osborne to help If they had a curtain they ought to have a stage Solomon John said he was sure he had boards and nails enough and it would be easy to make a stage if John Osborne would help put it up All this talk was the day before the charades In the midst of it Ann Maria went over for her old bonnets and dresses and umbrellas and they spent the evening in trying on the various things such odd caps and remarkable bonnets Solomon John said they ought to have plenty of bandboxes if you only had bandboxes enough a charade was sure to go off well he had seen charades in Boston missus Peterkin said there were plenty in their attic and the little boys brought down piles of them and the back parlor was filled with costumes Ann Maria said she could bring over more things if she only knew what they were going to act Elizabeth Eliza told her to bring anything she had it would all come of use The morning came and the boards were collected for the stage Agamemnon and Solomon John gave themselves to the work and John Osborne helped zealously He said the Pan Elocutionists would lend a scene also There was a great clatter of bandboxes and piles of shawls in corners and such a piece of work in getting up the curtain In the midst of it came in the little boys shouting All the tickets are sold at ten cents each Seventy tickets sold exclaimed Agamemnon Seven dollars for the water trough said Elizabeth Eliza And we do not know yet what we are going to act exclaimed Ann Maria But everybody s attention had to be given to the scene that was going up in the background borrowed from the Pan Elocutionists It was magnificent and represented a forest Where are we going to put seventy people exclaimed missus Peterkin venturing dismayed into the heaps of shavings and boards and litter The little boys exclaimed that a large part of the audience consisted of boys who would not take up much room But how much clearing and sweeping and moving of chairs was necessary before all could be made ready It was late and some of the people had already come to secure good seats even before the actors had assembled What are we going to act asked Ann Maria I have been so torn with one thing and another said Elizabeth Eliza I haven t had time to think Haven t you the word yet asked John Osborne for the audience was flocking in and the seats were filling up rapidly I have got one word in my pocket said Elizabeth Eliza in the letter from the lady from Philadelphia She sent me the parts of the word Solomon John is to be a Turk but I don t yet understand the whole of the word You don t know the word and the people are all here said John Osborne impatiently Elizabeth Eliza exclaimed Ann Maria Solomon John says I m to be a Turkish slave and I ll have to wear a veil Do you know where the veils are You know I brought them over last night Elizabeth Eliza Solomon John wants you to send him the large cashmere scarf exclaimed one of the little boys coming in Elizabeth Eliza you must tell us what kind of faces to make up cried another of the boys And the audience were heard meanwhile taking the seats on the other side of the thin curtain You sit in front missus Bromwick you are a little hard of hearing sit where you can hear And let Julia Fitch come where she can see said another voice And we have not any words for them to hear or see exclaimed John Osborne behind the curtain Oh I wish we d never determined to have charades exclaimed Elizabeth Eliza Can t we return the money They are all here we must give them something said John Osborne heroically And Solomon John is almost dressed reported Ann Maria winding a veil around her head Why don t we take Solomon John s word Hindoos for the first said Agamemnon John Osborne agreed to go in the first hunting the hin or anything and one of the little boys took the part of the hen with the help of a feather duster The bell rang and the first scene began It was a great success John Osborne s Irish was perfect Nobody guessed the word for the hen crowed by mistake but it received great applause mister Peterkin came on in the second scene to receive the water rates and made a long speech on taxation He was interrupted by Ann Maria as an old woman in a huge bonnet She persisted in turning her back to the audience speaking so low nobody heard her and Elizabeth Eliza who appeared in a more remarkable bonnet was so alarmed she went directly back saying she had forgotten something But this was supposed to be the effect intended and it was loudly cheered Then came a long delay for the little boys brought out a number of their friends to be browned for Hindoos Ann Maria played on the piano till the scene was ready The curtain rose upon five brown boys done up in blankets and turbans I am thankful that is over said Elizabeth Eliza for now we can act my word Only I don t myself know the whole Never mind let us act it said John Osborne and the audience can guess the whole The first syllable must be the letter P said Elizabeth Eliza and we must have a school Agamemnon was master and the little boys and their friends went on as scholars All the boys talked and shouted at once acting their idea of a school by flinging pea nuts about and scoffing at the master They ll guess that to be row said John Osborne in despair they ll never guess P The next scene was gorgeous Solomon John as a Turk reclined on John Osborne s army blanket He had on a turban and a long beard and all the family shawls Ann Maria and Elizabeth Eliza were brought in to him veiled by the little boys in their Hindoo costumes This was considered the great scene of the evening though Elizabeth Eliza was sure she did not know what to do whether to kneel or sit down she did not know whether Turkish women did sit down and she could not help laughing whenever she looked at Solomon John He however kept his solemnity I suppose I need not say much he had said for I shall be the Turk who was dreaming of the hour But he did order the little boys to bring sherbet and when they brought it without ice insisted they must have their heads cut off and Ann Maria fainted and the scene closed What are we to do now asked John Osborne warming up to the occasion We must have an inn scene said Elizabeth Eliza consulting her letter two inns if we can We will have some travellers disgusted with one inn and going to another said John Osborne Now is the time for the bandboxes said Solomon John who since his Turk scene was over could give his attention to the rest of the charade Elizabeth Eliza and Ann Maria went on as rival hostesses trying to draw Solomon John Agamemnon and John Osborne into their several inns The little boys carried valises hand bags umbrellas and bandboxes Bandbox after bandbox appeared and when Agamemnon sat down upon his the applause was immense At last the curtain fell Now for the whole said John Osborne as he made his way off the stage over a heap of umbrellas I can t think why the lady from Philadelphia did not send me the whole said Elizabeth Eliza musing over the letter Listen they are guessing said John Osborne D ice box I don t wonder they get it wrong But we know it can t be that exclaimed Elizabeth Eliza in agony How can we act the whole if we don t know it ourselves Oh I see it said Ann Maria clapping her hands Get your whole family in for the last scene mister and missus Peterkin were summoned to the stage and formed the background standing on stools in front were Agamemnon and Solomon John leaving room for Elizabeth Eliza between a little in advance and in front of all half kneeling were the little boys in their india rubber boots The audience rose to an exclamation of delight The Peterkins P Turk Inns It was not until this moment that Elizabeth Eliza guessed the whole What a tableau exclaimed mister Bromwick the Peterkin family guessing their own charade THE PETERKINS ARE OBLIGED TO MOVE AGAMEMNON had long felt it an impropriety to live in a house that was called a semi detached house when there was no other semi to it It had always remained wholly detached as the owner had never built the other half missus Peterkin felt this was not a sufficient reason for undertaking the terrible process of a move to another house when they were fully satisfied with the one they were in But a more powerful reason forced them to go The track of a new railroad had to be carried directly through the place and a station was to be built on that very spot missus Peterkin so much dreaded moving that she questioned whether they could not continue to live in the upper part of the house and give up the lower part to the station They could then dine at the restaurant and it would be very convenient about travelling as there would be no danger of missing the train if one were sure of the direction But when the track was actually laid by the side of the house and the steam engine of the construction train puffed and screamed under the dining room windows and the engineer calmly looked in to see what the family had for dinner she felt indeed that they must move But where should they go It was difficult to find a house that satisfied the whole family One was too far off and looked into a tan pit another was too much in the middle of the town next door to a machine shop Elizabeth Eliza wanted a porch covered with vines that should face the sunset while mister Peterkin thought it would not be convenient to sit there looking towards the west in the late afternoon which was his only leisure time for the sun would shine in his face The little boys wanted a house with a great many doors so that they could go in and out often But mister Peterkin did not like so much slamming and felt there was more danger of burglars with so many doors Agamemnon wanted an observatory and Solomon John a shed for a workshop If he could have carpenters tools and a workbench he could build an observatory if it were wanted But it was necessary to decide upon something for they must leave their house directly So they were obliged to take mister Finch s at the Corners It satisfied none of the family The porch was a piazza and was opposite a barn There were three other doors too many to please mister Peterkin and not enough for the little boys There was no observatory and nothing to observe if there were one as the house was too low and some high trees shut out any view Elizabeth Eliza had hoped for a view but mister Peterkin con soled her by deciding it was more healthy to have to walk for a view and missus Peterkin agreed that they might get tired of the same every day And everybody was glad a selection was made and the little boys carried their india rubber boots the very first afternoon Elizabeth Eliza wanted to have some system in the moving and spent the evening in drawing up a plan It would be easy to arrange everything beforehand so that there should not be the confusion that her mother dreaded and the discomfort they had in their last move missus Peterkin shook her head she did not think it possible to move with any comfort Agamemnon said a great deal could be done with a list and a programme Elizabeth Eliza declared if all were well arranged a programme would make it perfectly easy They were to have new parlor carpets which could be put down in the new house the first thing Then the parlor furniture could be moved in and there would be two comfortable rooms in which mister and missus Peterkin could sit while the rest of the move went on Then the old parlor carpets could be taken up for the new dining room and the downstairs bedroom and the family could meanwhile dine at the old house mister Peterkin did not object to this though the distance was considerable as he felt exercise would be good for them all Elizabeth Eliza s programme then arranged that the dining room furniture should be moved the third day by which time one of the old parlor carpets would be down in the new dining room and they could still sleep in the old house Thus there would always be a quiet comfortable place in one house or the other Each night when mister Peterkin came home he would find some place for quiet thought and rest and each day there should be moved only the furniture needed for a certain room Great confusion would be avoided and nothing misplaced Elizabeth Eliza wrote these last words at the head of her programme Misplace nothing And Agamemnon made a copy of the programme for each member of the family THE PETERKINS ARE MOVED Page one hundred twenty six The first thing to be done was to buy the parlor carpets Elizabeth Eliza had already looked at some in Boston and the next morning she went by an early train with her father Agamemnon and Solomon John to decide upon them They got home about eleven o clock and when they reached the house were dismayed to find two furniture wagons in front of the gate already partly filled missus Peterkin was walking in and out of the open door a large book in one hand and a duster in the other and she came to meet them in an agony of anxiety What should they do The furniture carts had appeared soon after the rest had left for Boston and the men had insisted upon beginning to move the things In vain had she shown Elizabeth Eliza s programme in vain had she insisted they must take only the parlor furniture They had declared they must put the heavy pieces in the bottom of the cart and the lighter furniture on top So she had seen them go into every room in the house and select one piece of furniture after another without even looking at Elizabeth Eliza s programme she doubted if they could have read it if they had looked at it mister Peterkin had ordered the carters to come but he had no idea they would come so early and supposed it would take them a long time to fill the carts But they had taken the dining room sideboard first a heavy piece of furniture and all its contents were now on the dining room tables Then indeed they selected the parlor book case but had set every book on the floor The men had told missus Peterkin they would put the books in the bottom of the cart very much in the order they were taken from the shelves But by this time missus Peterkin was considering the carters as natural enemies and dared not trust them besides the books ought all to be dusted So she was now holding one of the volumes of Agamemnon s Encyclopaedia with difficulty in one hand while she was dusting it with the other Elizabeth Eliza was in dismay At this moment four men were bringing down a large chest of drawers from her father s room and they called to her to stand out of the way The parlors were a scene of confusion In dusting the books missus Peterkin neglected to restore them to the careful rows in which they were left by the men and they lay in hopeless masses in different parts of the room Elizabeth Eliza sunk in despair upon the end of a sofa It would have been better to buy the red and blue carpet said Solomon John Is not the carpet bought exclaimed missus Peterkin And then they were obliged to confess they had been unable to decide upon one and had come back to consult missus Peterkin What shall we do asked missus Peterkin Elizabeth Eliza rose from the sofa and went to the door saying I shall be back in a moment Agamemnon slowly passed round the room collecting the scattered volumes of his Encyclopaedia mister Peterkin offered a helping hand to a man lifting a wardrobe Elizabeth Eliza soon returned I did not like to go and ask her But I felt that I must in such an emergency I explained to her the whole matter and she thinks we should take the carpet at Makillan s Makillan s was a store in the village and the carpet was the only one all the family had liked without any doubt but they had supposed they might prefer one from Boston The moment was a critical one Solomon John was sent directly to Makillan s to order the carpet to be put down that very day But where should they dine where should they have their supper and where was mister Peterkin s quiet hour Elizabeth Eliza was frantic the dining room floor and table were covered with things It was decided that mister and missus Peterkin should dine at the Bromwicks who had been most neighborly in their offers and the rest should get something to eat at the baker s Agamemnon and Elizabeth Eliza hastened away to be ready to receive the carts at the other house and direct the furniture as they could After all there was something exhilarating in this opening of the new house and in deciding where things should go Gayly Elizabeth Eliza stepped down the front garden of the new home and across the piazza and to the door But it was locked and she had no keys Agamemnon did you bring the keys she exclaimed No he had not seen them since the morning when ah yes the little boys were allowed to go to the house for their india rubber boots as there was a threatening of rain Perhaps they had left some door unfastened perhaps they had put the keys under the door mat No each door each window was solidly closed and there was no mat I shall have to go to the school to see if they took the keys with them said Agamemnon or else go home to see if they left them there The school was in a different direction from the house and far at the other end of the town for mister Peterkin had not yet changed the boys school as he proposed to do after their move That will be the only way said Elizabeth Eliza for it had been arranged that the little boys should take their lunch to school and not come home at noon She sat down on the steps to wait but only for a moment for the carts soon appeared turning the corner What should be done with the furniture Of course the carters must wait for the keys as she should need them to set the furniture up in the right places But they could not stop for this They put it down upon the piazza on the steps in the garden and Elizabeth Eliza saw how incongruous it was There was something from every room in the house Even the large family chest which had proved too heavy for them to travel with had come down from the attic and stood against the front door And Solomon John appeared with the carpet woman and a boy with a wheelbarrow bringing the new carpet And all stood and waited Some opposite neighbors appeared to offer advice and look on and Elizabeth Eliza groaned inwardly that only the shabbiest of their furniture appeared to be standing full in view It seemed ages before Agamemnon returned and no wonder for he had been to the house then to the school then back to the house for one of the little boys had left the keys at home in the pocket of his clothes Meanwhile the carpet woman had waited and the boy with the wheelbarrow had waited and when they got in they found the parlor must be swept and cleaned So the carpet woman went off in dudgeon for she was sure there would not be time enough to do anything And one of the carts came again and in their hurry the men set the furniture down anywhere Elizabeth Eliza was hoping to make a little place in the dining room where they might have their supper and go home to sleep But she looked out and there were the carters bringing the bedsteads and proceeding to carry them upstairs In despair Elizabeth Eliza went back to the old house If she had been there she might have prevented this She found missus Peterkin in an agony about the entry oil cloth It had been made in the house and how could it be taken out of the house Agamemnon made measurements it certainly could not go out of the front door He suggested it might be left till the house was pulled down when it could easily be moved out of one side But Elizabeth Eliza reminded him that the whole house was to be moved without being taken apart Perhaps it could be cut in strips narrow enough to go out One of the men loading the remaining cart disposed of the question by coming in and rolling up the oil cloth and carrying it on on top of his wagon Elizabeth Eliza felt she must hurry back to the new house But what should they do no beds here no carpets there The dining room table and sideboard were at the other house the plates and forks and spoons here In vain she looked at her programme It was all reversed everything was misplaced mister Peterkin would suppose they were to eat here and sleep here and what had become of the little boys Meanwhile the man with the first cart had returned They fell to packing the dining room china They were up in the attic they were down in the cellar Even one suggested to take the tacks out of the parlor carpets as they should want to take them next missus Peterkin sunk upon a kitchen chair Oh I wish we had decided to stay and be moved in the house she exclaimed Solomon John urged his mother to go to the new house for mister Peterkin would be there for his quiet hour And when the carters at last appeared carrying the parlor carpets on their shoulders she sighed and said There is nothing left and meekly consented to be led away They reached the new house to find mister Peterkin sitting calmly in a rocking chair on the piazza watching the oxen coming into the opposite barn He was waiting for the keys which Solomon John had taken back with him The little boys were in a horse chestnut tree at the side of the house Agamemnon opened the door The passages were crowded with furniture the floors were strewn with books the bureau was upstairs that was to stand in a lower bedroom there was not a place to lay a table there was nothing to lay upon it for the knives and plates and spoons had not come and although the tables were there they were covered with chairs and boxes At this moment came a covered basket from the lady from Philadelphia It contained a choice supper and forks and spoons and at the same moment appeared a pot of hot tea from an opposite neighbor They placed all this on the back of a bookcase lying upset and sat around it Solomon John came rushing in from the gate The last load is coming We are all moved he exclaimed and the little boys joined in a chorus We are moved we are moved missus Peterkin looked sadly round the kitchen utensils were lying on the parlor lounge and an old family gun on Elizabeth Eliza s hat box The parlor clock stood on a barrel some coal scuttles had been placed on the parlor table a bust of Washington stood in the door way and the looking glasses leaned against the pillars of the piazza But they were moved missus Peterkin felt indeed that they were very much moved THE PETERKINS DECIDE TO LEARN THE LANGUAGES CERTAINLY now was the time to study the languages The Peterkins had moved into a new house far more convenient than their old one where they would have a place for everything and everything in its place Of course they would then have more time Elizabeth Eliza recalled the troubles of the old house how for a long time she was obliged to sit outside of the window upon the piazza when she wanted to play on her piano missus Peterkin reminded them of the difficulty about the table cloths The upper table cloth was kept in a trunk that had to stand in front of the door to the closet under the stairs But the under table cloth was kept in a drawer in the closet So whenever the cloths were changed the trunk had to be pushed away under some projecting shelves to make room for opening the closet door as the under table cloth must be taken out first then the trunk was pushed back to make room for it to be opened for the upper table cloth and after all it was necessary to push the trunk away again to open the closet door for the knife tray This always consumed a great deal of time Now that the china closet was large enough everything could find a place in it Agamemnon especially enjoyed the new library In the old house there was no separate room for books The dictionaries were kept upstairs which was very inconvenient and the volumes of the Encyclopaedia could not be together There was not room for all in one place So from A to P were to be found downstairs and from Q to Z were scattered in different rooms upstairs And the worst of it was you could never remember whether from A to P included P I always went upstairs after P said Agamemnon and then always found it downstairs or else it was the other way Of course now there were more conveniences for study With the books all in one room there would be no time wasted in looking for them mister Peterkin suggested they should each take a separate language If they went abroad this would prove a great convenience Elizabeth Eliza could talk French with the Parisians Agamemnon German with the Germans Solomon John Italian with the Italians missus Peterkin Spanish in Spain and perhaps he could himself master all the Eastern Languages and Russian missus Peterkin was uncertain about undertaking the Spanish but all the family felt very sure they should not go to Spain as Elizabeth Eliza dreaded the Inquisition and missus Peterkin felt more willing Still she had quite an objection to going abroad She had always said she would not go till a bridge was made across the Atlantic and she was sure it did not look like it now Agamemnon said there was no knowing There was something new every day and a bridge was surely not harder to invent than a telephone for they had bridges in the very earliest days Then came up the question of the teachers Probably these could be found in Boston If they could all come the same day three could be brought out in the carryall Agamemnon could go in for them and could learn a little on the way out and in mister Peterkin made some inquiries about the Oriental languages He was told that Sanscrit was at the root of all So he proposed they should all begin with Sanscrit They would thus require but one teacher and could branch out into the other languages afterward But the family preferred learning the separate languages Elizabeth Eliza already knew something of the French She had tried to talk it without much success at the Centennial Exhibition at one of the side stands But she found she had been talking with a Moorish gentleman who did not understand French mister Peterkin feared they might need more libraries if all the teachers came at the same hour but Agamemnon reminded him that they would be using different dictionaries And mister Peterkin thought something might be learned by having them all at once Each one might pick up something beside the language he was studying and it was a great thing to learn to talk a foreign language while others were talking about you missus Peterkin was afraid it would be like the Tower of Babel and hoped it was all right Agamemnon brought forward another difficulty Of course they ought to have foreign teachers who spoke only their native languages But in this case how could they engage them to come or explain to them about the carryall or arrange the proposed hours He did not understand how anybody ever began with a foreigner because he could not even tell him what he wanted Elizabeth Eliza thought a great deal might be done by signs and pantomime Solomon John and the little boys began to show how it might be done Elizabeth Eliza explained how langues meant both languages and tongues and they could point to their tongues For practice the little boys represented the foreign teachers talking in their different languages and Agamemnon and Solomon John went to invite them to come out and teach the family by a series of signs mister Peterkin thought their success was admirable and that they might almost go abroad without any study of the languages and trust to explaining themselves by signs Still as the bridge was not yet made it might be as well to wait and cultivate the languages missus Peterkin was afraid the foreign teachers might imagine they were invited out to lunch Solomon John had constantly pointed to his mouth as he opened it and shut it putting out his tongue and it looked a great deal more as if he were inviting them to eat than asking them to teach Agamemnon suggested that they might carry the separate dictionaries when they went to see the teachers and that would show that they meant lessons and not lunch missus Peterkin was not sure but she ought to prepare a lunch for them if they had come all that way but she certainly did not know what they were accustomed to eat mister Peterkin thought this would be a good thing to learn of the foreigners It would be a good preparation for going abroad and they might get used to the dishes before starting The little boys were delighted at the idea of having new things cooked Agamemnon had heard that beer soup was a favorite dish with the Germans and he would inquire how it was made in the first lesson Solomon John had heard they were all very fond of garlic and thought it would be a pretty attention to have some in the house the first day that they might be cheered by the odor Elizabeth Eliza wanted to surprise the lady from Philadelphia by her knowledge of French and hoped to begin on her lessons before the Philadelphia family arrived for their annual visit There were still some delays mister Peterkin was very anxious to obtain teachers who had been but a short time in this country He did not want to be tempted to talk any English with them He wanted the latest and freshest languages and at last came home one day with a list of brand new foreigners They decided to borrow the Bromwicks carryall to use beside their own for the first day and mister Peterkin and Agamemnon drove into town to bring all the teachers out One was a Russian gentleman travelling who came with no idea of giving lessons but perhaps he would consent to do so He could not yet speak English mister Peterkin had his card case and the cards of the several gentlemen who had recommended the different teachers and he went with Agamemnon from hotel to hotel collecting them He found them all very polite and ready to come after the explanation by signs agreed upon The dictionaries had been forgotten but Agamemnon had a directory which looked the same and seemed to satisfy the foreigners mister Peterkin was obliged to content himself with the Russian instead of one who could teach Sanscrit as there was no new teacher of that language lately arrived But there was an unexpected difficulty in getting the Russian gentleman into the same carriage with the teacher of Arabic for he was a Turk sitting with a fez on his head on the back seat They glared at each other and began to assail each other in every language they knew none of which mister Peterkin could understand It might be Russian it might be Arabic It was easy to understand that they would never consent to sit in the same carriage mister Peterkin was in despair he had forgotten about the Russian war What a mistake to have invited the Turk Quite a crowd collected on the sidewalk in front of the hotel But the French gentleman politely but stiffly invited the Russian to go with him in the first carryall Here was another difficulty For the German professor was quietly ensconced on the back seat As soon as the French gentleman put his foot on the step and saw him he addressed him in such forcible language that the German professor got out of the door the other side and came round on the sidewalk and took him by the collar Certainly the German and French gentlemen could not be put together and more crowd collected Agamemnon however had happily studied up the German word Herr and he applied it to the German inviting him by signs to take a seat in the other carryall The German consented to sit by the Turk as they neither of them could understand the other and at last they started mister Peterkin with the Italian by his side and the French and Russian teachers behind vociferating to each other in languages unknown to mister Peterkin while he feared they were not perfectly in harmony so he drove home as fast as possible Agamemnon had a silent party The Spaniard by his side was a little moody while the Turk and the German behind did not utter a word At last they reached the house and were greeted by missus Peterkin and Elizabeth Eliza missus Peterkin with her llama lace shawl over her shoulders as a tribute to the Spanish teacher mister Peterkin was careful to take his party in first and deposit them in a distant part of the library far from the Turk or the German even putting the Frenchman and Russian apart Solomon John found the Italian dictionary and seated himself by his Italian Agamemnon with the German dictionary by the German The little boys took their copy of the Arabian Nights to the Turk mister Peterkin attempted to explain to the Russian that he had no Russian dictionary as he had hoped to learn Sanscrit of him while missus Peterkin was trying to inform her teacher that she had no books in Spanish She got over all fears of the Inquisition he looked so sad and she tried to talk a little using English words but very slowly and altering the accent as far as she knew how The Spaniard bowed looked gravely interested and was very polite Elizabeth Eliza meanwhile was trying her grammar phrases with the Parisian She found it easier to talk French than to understand him But he understood perfectly her sentences She repeated one of her vocabularies and went on with J ai le livre As tu le pain L enfant a une poire He listened with great attention and replied slowly Suddenly she started after making out one of his sentences and went to her mother to whisper They have made the mistake you feared They think they are invited to lunch He has just been thanking me for our politeness in inviting them to dejeuner that means breakfast They have not had their breakfast exclaimed missus Peterkin looking at her Spaniard he does look hungry What shall we do Elizabeth Eliza was consulting her father What should they do How should they make them understand that they invited them to teach not lunch Elizabeth Eliza begged Agamemnon to look out apprendre in the dictionary It must mean to teach Alas they found it means both to teach and to learn What should they do The foreigners were now sitting silent in their different corners The Spaniard grew more and more sallow What if he should faint The Frenchman was rolling up each of his mustaches to a point as he gazed at the German What if the Russian should fight the Turk What if the German should be exasperated by the airs of the Parisian We must give them something to eat said mister Peterkin in a low tone It would calm them If I only knew what they were used to eating said missus Peterkin Solomon John suggested that none of them knew what the others were used to eating and they might bring in anything missus Peterkin hastened out with hospitable intents Amanda could make good coffee mister Peterkin had suggested some American dish Solomon John sent a little boy for some olives It was not long before the coffee came in and a dish of baked beans Next some olives and a loaf of bread and some boiled eggs and some bottles of beer The effect was astonishing Every man spoke his own tongue and fluently missus Peterkin poured out coffee for the Spaniard while he bowed to her They all liked beer they all liked olives The Frenchman was fluent about les moeurs Americaines Elizabeth Eliza supposed he alluded to their not having set any table The Turk smiled the Russian was voluble In the midst of the clang of the different languages just as mister Peterkin was again repeating under cover of the noise of many tongues How shall we make them understand that we want them to teach at this very moment the door was flung open and there came in the lady from Philadelphia that day arrived her first call of the season She started back in terror at the tumult of so many different languages The family with joy rushed to meet her All together they called upon her to explain for them Could she help them Could she tell the foreigners they wanted to take lessons Lessons They had no sooner uttered the word than their guests all started up with faces beaming with joy It was the one English word they all knew They had come to Boston to give lessons The Russian traveller had hoped to learn English in this way The thought pleased them more than the dejeuner Yes gladly would they give lessons The Turk smiled at the idea The first step was taken The teachers knew they were expected to teach MODERN IMPROVEMENTS AT THE PETERKINS AGAMEMNON felt that it became necessary for him to choose a profession It was important on account of the little boys If he should make a trial of several different professions he could find out which would be the most likely to be successful and it would then be easy to bring up the little boys in the right direction Elizabeth Eliza agreed with this She thought the family occasionally made mistakes and had come near disgracing themselves Now was their chance to avoid this in future by giving the little boys a proper education Solomon John was almost determined to become a doctor From earliest childhood he had practiced writing recipes on little slips of paper missus Peterkin to be sure was afraid of infection She could not bear the idea of his bringing one disease after the other into the family circle Solomon John too did not like sick people He thought he might manage it if he should not have to see his patients while they were sick If he could only visit them when they were recovering and when the danger of infection was over he would really enjoy making calls He should have a comfortable doctor s chaise and take one of the little boys to hold his horse while he went in and he thought he could get through the conversational part very well and feeling the pulse perhaps looking at the tongue He should take and read all the newspapers and so be thoroughly acquainted with the news of the day to talk of But he should not like to be waked up at night to visit mister Peterkin thought that would not be necessary He had seen signs on doors of Night Doctor and certainly it would be as convenient to have a sign of Not a Night Doctor Solomon John thought he might write his advice to those of his patients who were dangerously ill from whom there was danger of infection And then Elizabeth Eliza agreed that his prescriptions would probably be so satisfactory that they would keep his patients well not too well to do without a doctor but needing his recipes Agamemnon was delayed however in his choice of a profession by a desire he had to become a famous inventor If he could only invent something important and get out a patent he would make himself known all over the country If he could get out a patent he would be set up for life or at least as long as the patent lasted and it would be well to be sure to arrange it to last through his natural life Indeed he had gone so far as to make his invention It had been suggested by their trouble with a key in their late moving to their new house He had studied the matter over a great deal He looked it up in the Encyclopaedia and had spent a day or two in the Public Library in reading about Chubb s Lock and other patent locks But his plan was more simple It was this that all keys should be made alike He wondered it had not been thought of before but so it was Solomon John said with all inventions with Christopher Columbus and everybody Nobody knew the invention till it was invented and then it looked very simple With Agamemnon s plan you need have but one key that should fit everything It should be a medium sized key not too large to carry It ought to answer for a house door but you might open a portmanteau with it How much less danger there would be of losing one s keys if there were only one to lose missus Peterkin thought it would be inconvenient if their father were out and she wanted to open the jam closet for the little boys But Agamemnon explained that he did not mean there should be but one key in the family or in a town you might have as many as you pleased only they should all be alike Elizabeth Eliza felt it would be a great convenience they could keep the front door always locked yet she could open it with the key of her upper drawer that she was sure to have with her And missus Peterkin felt it might be a convenience if they had one on each story so that they need not go up and down for it mister Peterkin studied all the papers and advertisements to decide about the lawyer whom they should consult and at last one morning they went into town to visit a patent agent Elizabeth Eliza took the occasion to make a call upon the lady from Philadelphia but she came back hurriedly to her mother I have had a delightful call she said but perhaps I was wrong I could not help in conversation speaking of Agamemnon s proposed patent I ought not to have mentioned it as such things are kept profound secrets they say women always do tell things I suppose that is the reason But where is the harm asked missus Peterkin I m sure you can trust the lady from Philadelphia Elizabeth Eliza then explained that the lady from Philadelphia had questioned the plan a little when it was told her and had suggested that if everybody had the same key there would be no particular use in a lock Did you explain to her said missus Peterkin that we were not all to have the same keys I couldn t quite understand her said Elizabeth Eliza but she seemed to think that burglars and other people might come in if the keys were the same Agamemnon would not sell his patent to burglars said missus Peterkin indignantly But about other people said Elizabeth Eliza there is my upper drawer the little boys might open it at Christmas time and their presents in it And I am not sure that I could trust Amanda said missus Peterkin considering Both she and Elizabeth Eliza felt that mister Peterkin ought to know what the lady from Philadelphia had suggested Elizabeth Eliza then proposed going into town but it would take so long she might not reach them in time A telegram would be better and she ventured to suggest using the Telegraph Alarm For on moving into their new house they had discovered it was provided with all the modern improvements This had been a disappointment to missus Peterkin for she was afraid of them since their experience the last winter when their water pipes were frozen up She had been originally attracted to the house by an old pump at the side which had led her to believe there were no modern improvements It had pleased the little boys too They liked to pump the handle up and down and agreed to pump all the water needed and bring it into the house There was an old well with a picturesque well sweep in a corner by the barn missus Peterkin was frightened by this at first She was afraid the little boys would be falling in every day And they showed great fondness for pulling the bucket up and down It proved however that the well was dry There was no water in it so she had some moss thrown down and an old feather bed for safety and the old well was a favorite place of amusement The house it had proved was well furnished with bath rooms and set waters everywhere Water pipes and gas pipes all over the house and a hack telegraph and fire alarm with a little knob for each missus Peterkin was very anxious She feared the little boys would be summoning somebody all the time and it was decided to conceal from them the use of the knobs and the card of directions at the side was destroyed Agamemnon had made one of his first inventions to help this He had arranged a number of similar knobs to be put in rows in different parts of the house to appear as if they were intended for ornament and had added some to the original knobs missus Peterkin felt more secure and Agamemnon thought of taking out a patent for this invention It was therefore with some doubt that Elizabeth Eliza proposed sending a telegram to her father missus Peterkin however was pleased with the idea Solomon John was out and the little boys were at school and she herself would touch the knob while Elizabeth Eliza should write the telegram I think it is the fourth knob from the beginning she said looking at one of the rows of knobs Elizabeth Eliza was sure of this Agamemnon she believed had put three extra knobs at each end But which is the end and which is the beginning the top or the bottom missus Peterkin asked hopelessly Still she bravely selected a knob and Elizabeth Eliza hastened with her to look out for the messenger How soon should they see the telegraph boy They seemed to have scarcely reached the window when a terrible noise was heard and down the shady street the white horses of the fire brigade were seen rushing at a fatal speed It was a terrific moment I have touched the fire alarm missus Peterkin exclaimed Both rushed to open the front door in agony By this time the fire engines were approaching Do not be alarmed said the chief engineer the furniture shall be carefully covered and we will move all that is necessary Move again exclaimed missus Peterkin in agony Elizabeth Eliza strove to explain that she was only sending a telegram to her father who was in Boston It is not important said the head engineer the fire will all be out before it could reach him And he ran upstairs for the engines were beginning to play upon the roof missus Peterkin rushed to the knobs again hurriedly there was more necessity for summoning mister Peterkin home Write a telegram to your father she said to Elizabeth Eliza to come home directly That will take but three words said Elizabeth Eliza with presence of mind and we need ten I was just trying to make them out What has come now exclaimed missus Peterkin and they hurried again to the window to see a row of carriages coming down the street I must have touched the carriage knob cried missus Peterkin and I pushed it half a dozen times I felt so anxious Six hacks stood before the door All the village boys were assembling Even their own little boys had returned from school and were showing the firemen the way to the well Again missus Peterkin rushed to the knobs and a fearful sound arose She had touched the burglar alarm The former owner of the house who had a great fear of burglars had invented a machine of his own which he had connected with a knob A wire attached to the knob moved a spring that could put in motion a number of watchmen s rattles hidden under the eaves of the piazza All these were now set a going and their terrible din roused those of the neighborhood who had not before assembled around the house At this moment Elizabeth Eliza met the chief engineer You need not send for more help he said we have all the engines in town here and have stirred up all the towns in the neighborhood there s no use in springing any more alarms I can t find the fire yet but we have water pouring all over the house Elizabeth Eliza waved her telegram in the air We are only trying to send a telegram to my father and brother who are in town she endeavored to explain If it is necessary said the chief engineer you might send it down in one of the hackney carriages I see a number standing before the door We d better begin to move the heavier furniture and some of you women might fill the carriages with smaller things missus Peterkin was ready to fall into hysterics She controlled herself with a supreme power and hastened to touch another knob Elizabeth Eliza corrected her telegram and decided to take the advice of the chief engineer and went to the door to give her message to one of the hackmen when she saw a telegraph boy appear Her mother had touched the right knob It was the fourth from the beginning but the beginning was at the other end She went out to meet the boy when to her joy she saw behind him her father and Agamemnon She clutched her telegram and hurried toward them mister Peterkin was bewildered Was the house on fire If so where were the flames He saw the row of carriages Was there a funeral or a wedding Who was dead Who was to be married He seized the telegram that Elizabeth Eliza reached to him and read it aloud Come to us directly the house is NOT on fire The chief engineer was standing on the steps The house not on fire he exclaimed What are we all summoned for It is a mistake cried Elizabeth Eliza wringing her hands We touched the wrong knob we wanted the telegraph boy We touched all the wrong knobs exclaimed missus Peterkin from the house The chief engineer turned directly to give counter directions with a few exclamations of disgust as the bells of distant fire engines were heard approaching Solomon John appeared at this moment and proposed taking one of the carriages and going for a doctor for his mother for she was now nearly ready to fall into hysterics and Agamemnon thought to send a telegram down by the boy for the evening papers to announce that the Peterkins house had not been on fire The crisis of the commotion had reached its height The beds of flowers bordered with dark colored leaves were trodden down by the feet of the crowd that had assembled The chief engineer grew more and more indignant as he sent his men to order back the fire engines from the neighboring towns The collection of boys followed the procession as it went away The fire brigade hastily removed covers from some of the furniture restored the rest to their places and took away their ladders Many neighbors remained but mister Peterkin hastened into the house to attend to missus Peterkin Elizabeth Eliza took an opportunity to question her father before he went in as to the success of their visit to town We saw all the patent agents answered mister Peterkin in a hollow whisper Not one of them will touch the patent or have anything to do with it Elizabeth Eliza looked at Agamemnon as he walked silently into the house She would not now speak to him of the patent but she recalled some words of Solomon John When they were discussing the patent he had said that many an inventor had grown gray before his discovery was acknowledged by the public Others might reap the harvest but it came perhaps only when he was going to his grave Elizabeth Eliza looked at Agamemnon reverently and followed him silently into the house AGAMEMNON S CAREER THERE had apparently been some mistake in Agamemnon s education He had been to a number of colleges indeed but he had never completed his course in any one He had continually fallen into some difficulty with the authorities It was singular for he was of an inquiring mind and had always tried to find out what would be expected of him but had never hit upon the right thing Solomon John thought the trouble might be in what they called the elective system where you were to choose what study you might take This had always bewildered Agamemnon a good deal And how was a feller to tell Solomon John had asked whether he wanted to study a thing before he tried it It might turn out awful hard Agamemnon had always been fond of reading from his childhood up He was at his book all day long missus Peterkin had imagined he would come out a great scholar because she could never get him away from his books And so it was in his colleges he was always to be found in the library reading and reading But they were always the wrong books For instance the class were required to prepare themselves on the Spartan war This turned Agamemnon s attention to the Fenians and to study the subject he read up on Charles O Malley and Harry Lorrequer and some later novels of that sort which did not help him on the subject required yet took up all his time so that he found himself unfitted for anything else when the examinations came In consequence he was requested to leave Agamemnon always missed in his recitations for the same reason that Elizabeth Eliza did not get on in school because he was always asked the questions he did not know It seemed provoking if the professors had only asked something else But they always hit upon the very things he had not studied up missus Peterkin felt this was encouraging for Agamemnon knew the things they did not know in colleges In colleges they were willing to take for students only those who already knew certain things She thought Agamemnon might be a professor in a college for those students who didn t know those things I suppose these professors could not have known a great deal she added or they would not have asked you so many questions they would have told you something Agamemnon had left another college on account of a mistake he had made with some of his classmates They had taken a great deal of trouble to bring some wood from a distant wood pile to make a bonfire with under one of the professors windows Agamemnon had felt it would be a compliment to the professor It was with bonfires that heroes had been greeted on their return from successful wars In this way beacon lights had been kindled upon lofty heights that had inspired mariners seeking their homes after distant adventures As he plodded back and forward he imagined himself some hero of antiquity He was reading Plutarch s Lives with deep interest This had been recommended at a former college and he was now taking it up in the midst of his French course He fancied even that some future Plutarch was growing up in Lynn perhaps who would write of this night of suffering and glorify its heroes For himself he took a severe cold and suffered from chilblains in consequence of going back and forward through the snow carrying the wood But the flames of the bonfire caught the blinds of the professor s room and set fire to the building and came near burning up the whole institution Agamemnon regretted the result as much as his predecessor who gave him his name must have regretted that other bonfire on the shores of Aulis that deprived him of a daughter The result for Agamemnon was that he was requested to leave after having been in the institution but a few months He left another college in consequence of a misunderstanding about the hour for morning prayers He went every day regularly at ten o clock but found afterward that he should have gone at half past six This hour seemed to him and to missus Peterkin unseasonable at a time of year when the sun was not up and he would have been obliged to go to the expense of candles Agamemnon was always willing to try another college wherever he could be admitted He wanted to attain knowledge however it might be found But after going to five and leaving each before the year was out he gave it up He determined to lay out the money that would have been expended in a collegiate education in buying an Encyclopaedia the most complete that he could find and to spend his life studying it systematically He would not content himself with merely reading it but he would study into each subject as it came up and perfect himself in that subject By the time then that he had finished the Encyclopaedia he should have embraced all knowledge and have experienced much of it The family were much interested in this plan of making practice of every subject that came up He did not of course get on very fast in this way In the second column of the very first page he met with A as a note in music This led him to the study of music He bought a flute and took some lessons and attempted to accompany Elizabeth Eliza on the piano This of course distracted him from his work on the Encyclopaedia But he did not wish to return to A until he felt perfect in music This required a long time Then in this same paragraph a reference was made in it he was requested to see Keys It was necessary then to turn to Keys This was about the time the family were moving which we have mentioned when the difficult subject of keys came up that suggested to him his own simple invention and the hope of getting a patent for it This led him astray as inventions before have done with master minds so that he was drawn aside from his regular study The family however were perfectly satisfied with the career Agamemnon had chosen It would help them all in any path of life if he should master the Encyclopaedia in a thorough way mister Peterkin agreed it would in the end be not as expensive as a college course even if Agamemnon should buy all the different Encyclopaedias that appeared There would be no spreads involved no expense of receiving friends at entertainments in college he could live at home so that it would not be necessary to fit up another room as at college At all the times of his leaving he had sold out favorably to other occupants Solomon John s destiny was more uncertain He was looking forward to being a doctor some time but he had not decided whether to be allopathic or homeopathic or whether he could not better invent his own pills And he could not understand how to obtain his doctor s degree For a few weeks he acted as clerk in a druggist s store But he could serve only in the toothbrush and soap department because it was found he was not familiar enough with the Latin language to compound the drugs He agreed to spend his evenings in studying the Latin grammar but his course was interrupted by his being dismissed for treating the little boys too frequently to soda The little boys were going through the schools regularly The family had been much exercised with regard to their education Elizabeth Eliza felt that everything should be expected from them they ought to take advantage from the family mistakes Every new method that came up was tried upon the little boys They had been taught spelling by all the different systems and were just able to read when mister Peterkin learned that it was now considered best that children should not be taught to read till they were ten years old missus Peterkin was in despair Perhaps if their books were taken from them even then they might forget what they had learned But no the evil was done the brain had received certain impressions that could not be blurred over This was long ago however The little boys had since entered the public schools They went also to a gymnasium and a whittling school and joined a class in music and another in dancing they went to some afternoon lectures for children when there was no other school and belonged to a walking club Still mister Peterkin was dissatisfied by the slowness of their progress He visited the schools himself and found that they did not lead their classes It seemed to him a great deal of time was spent in things that were not instructive such as putting on and taking off their india rubber boots Elizabeth Eliza proposed that they should be taken from school and taught by Agamemnon from the Encyclopaedia The rest of the family might help in the education at all hours of the day Solomon John could take up the Latin grammar and she could give lessons in French The little boys were enchanted with the plan only they did not want to have the study hours all the time mister Peterkin however had a magnificent idea that they should make their life one grand Object Lesson They should begin at breakfast and study everything put upon the table the material of which it was made and where it came from In the study of the letter A Agamemnon had embraced the study of music and from one meal they might gain instruction enough for a day We shall have the assistance said mister Peterkin of Agamemnon with his Encyclopaedia Agamemnon modestly suggested that he had not yet got out of A and in their first breakfast everything would therefore have to begin with A That would not be impossible said mister Peterkin There is Amanda who will wait on table to start with We could have am and eggs suggested Solomon John missus Peterkin was distressed It was hard enough to think of anything for breakfast and impossible if it all had to begin with one letter Elizabeth Eliza thought it would not be necessary All they were to do was to ask questions as in examination papers and find their answers as they could They could still apply to the Encyclopaedia even if it were not in Agamemnon s alphabetical course mister Peterkin suggested a great variety One day they would study the botany of the breakfast table another day its natural history The study of butter would include that of the cow Even that of the butter dish would bring in geology The little boys were charmed at the idea of learning pottery from the cream jug and they were promised a potter s wheel directly You see my dear said mister Peterkin to his wife before many weeks we shall be drinking our milk from jugs made by our children Elizabeth Eliza hoped for a thorough study Yes said mister Peterkin we might begin with botany That would be near to Agamemnon alphabetically We ought to find out the botany of butter On what does the cow feed The little boys were eager to go out and see If she eats clover said mister Peterkin we shall expect the botany of clover The little boys insisted that they were to begin the next day that very evening they should go out and study the cow missus Peterkin sighed and decided she would order a simple breakfast The little boys took their note books and pencils and clambered upon the fence where they seated themselves in a row For there were three little boys So it was now supposed They were always coming in or going out and it had been difficult to count them and nobody was very sure how many there were There they sat however on the fence looking at the cow She looked at them with large eyes She won t eat they cried while we are looking at her So they turned about and pretended to look into the street and seated themselves that way turning their heads back from time to time to see the cow Now she is nibbling a clover No that is a bit of sorrel It s a whole handful of grass What kind of grass they exclaimed It was very hard sitting with their backs to the cow and pretending to the cow that they were looking into the street and yet to be looking at the cow all the time and finding out what she was eating and the upper rail of the fence was narrow and a little sharp It was very high too for some additional rails had been put on to prevent the cow from jumping into the garden or street Suddenly looking out into the hazy twilight Elizabeth Eliza saw six legs and six india rubber boots in the air and the little boys disappeared They are tossed by the cow The little boys are tossed by the cow missus Peterkin rushed for the window but fainted on the way Solomon John and Elizabeth Eliza were hurrying to the door but stopped not knowing what to do next missus Peterkin recovered herself with a supreme effort and sent them out to the rescue But what could they do The fence had been made so high to keep the cow out that nobody could get in The boy that did the milking had gone off with the key of the outer gate and perhaps with the key of the shed door Even if that were not locked before Agamemnon could get round by the wood shed and cow shed the little boys might be gored through and through Elizabeth Eliza ran to the neighbors Solomon John to the druggist s for plasters while Agamemnon made his way through the dining room to the wood shed and outer shed door mister Peterkin mounted the outside of the fence while missus Peterkin begged him not to put himself in danger He climbed high enough to view the scene He held to the corner post and reported what he saw They were not gored The cow was at the other end of the lot One of the little boys were lying in a bunch of dark leaves He was moving The cow glared but did not stir Another little boy was pulling his india rubber boots out of the mud The cow still looked at him Another was feeling the top of his head The cow began to crop the grass still looking at him Agamemnon had reached and opened the shed door The little boys were next seen running toward it A crowd of neighbors with pitchforks had returned meanwhile with Elizabeth Eliza Solomon John had brought four druggists But by the time they had reached the house the three little boys were safe in the arms of their mother This is too dangerous a form of education she cried I had rather they went to school No they bravely cried They were still willing to try the other way THE EDUCATIONAL BREAKFAST missus PETERKIN S nerves were so shaken by the excitement of the fall of the three little boys into the enclosure where the cow was kept that the educational breakfast was long postponed The little boys continued at school as before and the conversation dwelt as little as possible upon the subject of education missus Peterkin s spirits however gradually recovered The little boys were allowed to watch the cow at her feed A series of strings were arranged by Agamemnon and Solomon John by which the little boys could be pulled up if they should again fall down into the enclosure These were planned something like curtain cords and Solomon John frequently amused himself by pulling one of the little boys up or letting him down Some conversation did again fall upon the old difficulty of questions Elizabeth Eliza declared that it was not always necessary to answer that many who could did not answer questions the conductors of the railroads for instance who probably knew the names of all the stations on a road but were seldom able to tell them Yes said Agamemnon one might be a conductor without even knowing the names of the stations because you can t understand them when they do tell them I never know said Elizabeth Eliza whether it is ignorance in them or unwillingness that prevents them from telling you how soon one station is coming or how long you are to stop even if one asks ever so many times It would be useful if they would tell missus Peterkin thought this was carried too far in the horse cars in Boston The conductors had always left you as far as possible from the place where you wanted to stop but it seemed a little too much to have the aldermen take it up and put a notice in the cars ordering the conductors to stop at the farthest crossing missus Peterkin was indeed recovering her spirits She had been carrying on a brisk correspondence with Philadelphia that she had imparted to no one and at last she announced as its result that she was ready for a breakfast on educational principles A breakfast indeed when it appeared missus Peterkin had mistaken the alphabetical suggestion and had grasped the idea that the whole alphabet must be represented in one breakfast This therefore was the bill of fare Apple sauce Bread Butter Coffee Cream Doughnuts Eggs Fish balls Griddles Ham Ice on butter Jam Krout sour Lamb chops Morning Newspapers Oatmeal Pepper Quince marmalade Rolls Salt Tea Urn Veal pie Waffles Yeast biscuit mister Peterkin was proud and astonished Excellent he cried Every letter represented except Z missus Peterkin drew from her pocket a letter from the lady from Philadelphia She thought you would call it X cellent for X and she tells us she read that if you come with a zest you will bring the Z mister Peterkin was enchanted He only felt that he ought to invite the children in the primary schools to such a breakfast what a zest indeed it would give to the study of their letters It was decided to begin with Apple sauce How happy exclaimed mister Peterkin that this should come first of all A child might be brought up on apple sauce till he had mastered the first letter of the alphabet and could go on to the more involved subjects hidden in bread butter baked beans et cetera Agamemnon thought his father hardly knew how much was hidden in the apple There was all the story of William Tell and the Swiss independence The little boys were wild to act William Tell but missus Peterkin was afraid of the arrows missus Peterkin proposed they should begin by eating the apple sauce then discussing it first botanically next historically or perhaps first historically beginning with Adam and Eve and the first apple missus Peterkin feared the coffee would be getting cold and the griddles were waiting For herself she declared she felt more at home on the marmalade because the quinces came from grandfather s and she had seen them planted she remembered all about it and now the bush came up to the sitting room window She seemed to have heard him tell that the town of Quincy where the granite came from was named from them and she never quite recollected why except they were so hard as hard as stone and it took you almost the whole day to stew them and then you might as well set them on again mister Peterkin was glad to be reminded of the old place at grandfather s In order to know thoroughly about apples they ought to understand the making of cider Now they might some time drive up to grandfather s scarcely twelve miles away and see the cider made Why indeed should not the family go this very day up to grandfather s and continue the education of the breakfast Why not indeed exclaimed the little boys A day at grandfather s would give them the whole process of the apple from the orchard to the cider mill In this way they could widen the field of study even to follow in time the cup of coffee to Java It was suggested too that at grandfather s they might study the processes of maple syrup as involved in the griddle cakes Agamemnon pointed out the connection between the two subjects they were both the products of trees the apple tree and the maple mister Peterkin proposed that the lesson for the day should be considered the study of trees and on the way they could look at other trees Why not indeed go this very day There was no time like the present Their breakfast had been so copious they would scarcely be in a hurry for dinner and would therefore have the whole day before them missus Peterkin could put up the remains of the breakfast for luncheon But how should they go The carryall in spite of its name could hardly take the whole family though they might squeeze in six as the little boys did not take up much room Elizabeth Eliza suggested that she could spend the night at grandfather s Indeed she had been planning a visit there and would not object to staying some days This would make it easier about coming home but it did not settle the difficulty in getting there Why not Ride and Tie The little boys were fond of walking so was mister Peterkin and Agamemnon and Solomon John did not object to their turn missus Peterkin could sit in the carriage when it was waiting for the pedestrians to come up or she said she did not object to a little turn of walking mister Peterkin would start with Solomon John and the little boys before the rest and Agamemnon should drive his mother and Elizabeth Eliza to the first stopping place Then came up another question of Elizabeth Eliza s trunk If she stayed a few days she would need to carry something It might be hot and it might be cold Just as soon as she carried her thin things she would need her heaviest wraps You never could depend upon the weather Even Probabilities got you no farther than to day In an inspired moment Elizabeth Eliza bethought herself of the expressman She would send her trunk by the express and she left the table directly to go and pack it missus Peterkin busied herself with Amanda over the remains of the breakfast mister Peterkin and Agamemnon went to order the horse and the expressman and Solomon John and the little boys prepared themselves for a pedestrian excursion Elizabeth Eliza found it difficult to pack in a hurry there were so many things she might want and then again she might not She must put up her music because her grandfather had a piano and then she bethought herself of Agamemnon s flute and decided to pick out a volume or two of the Encyclopaedia But it was hard to decide all by herself whether to take G for griddle cakes or M for maple syrup or T for tree She would take as many as she could make room for She put up her work box and two extra work baskets and she must take some French books she had never yet found time to read This involved taking her French dictionary as she doubted if her grandfather had one She ought to put in a Botany if they were to study trees but she could not tell which so she would take all there were She might as well take all her dresses and it was no harm if one had too many wraps When she had her trunk packed she found it over full it was difficult to shut it She had heard Solomon John set out from the front door with his father and the little boys and Agamemnon was busy holding the horse at the side door so there was no use in calling for help She got upon the trunk she jumped upon it she sat down upon it and leaning over found she could lock it Yes it was really locked But on getting down from the trunk she found her dress had been caught in the lid she could not move away from it What was worse she was so fastened to the trunk that she could not lean forward far enough to turn the key back to unlock the trunk and release herself The lock had slipped easily but she could not now get hold of the key in the right way to turn it back She tried to pull her dress away No it was caught too firmly She called for help to her mother or Amanda to come and open the trunk But her door was shut Nobody near enough to hear She tried to pull the trunk toward the door to open it and make herself heard but it was so heavy that in her constrained position she could not stir it In her agony she would have been willing to have torn her dress but it was her travelling dress and too stout to tear She might cut it carefully Alas she had packed her scissors and her knife she had lent to the little boys the day before She called again What silence there was in the house Her voice seemed to echo through the room At length as she listened she heard the sound of wheels Was it the carriage rolling away from the side door Did she hear the front door shut She remembered then that Amanda was to have the day But she Elizabeth Eliza was to have spoken to Amanda to explain to her to wait for the expressman She was to have told her as she went downstairs But she had not been able to go downstairs And Amanda must have supposed that all the family had left and she too must have gone knowing of the expressman Yes she heard the wheels She heard the front door shut But could they have gone without her Then she recalled that she had proposed walking on a little way with Solomon John and her father to be picked up by missus Peterkin if she should have finished her packing in time Her mother must have supposed that she had done so that she had spoken to Amanda and started with the rest Well she would soon discover her mistake She would overtake the walking party and not finding Elizabeth Eliza would return for her Patience only was needed She had looked around for something to read but she had packed up all her books She had packed her knitting How quiet and still it was She tried to imagine where her mother would meet the rest of the family They were good walkers and they might have reached the two mile bridge But suppose they should stop for water beneath the arch of the bridge as they often did and the carryall pass over it without seeing them her mother would not know but she was with them And suppose her mother should decide to leave the horse at the place proposed for stopping and waiting for the first pedestrian party and herself walk on no one would be left to tell the rest when they should come up to the carryall They might go on so through the whole journey without meeting and she might not be missed till they should reach her grandfather s Horrible thought She would be left here alone all day The expressman would come but the expressman would go for he would not be able to get into the house She thought of the terrible story of Ginevra of the bride who was shut up in her trunk and forever She was shut up on hers and knew not when she should be released She had acted once in the ballad of the Mistletoe Bough She had been one of the guests who had sung Oh the Mistletoe Bough and had looked up at it and she had seen at the side scenes how the bride had laughingly stepped into the trunk But the trunk then was only a make believe of some boards in front of a sofa and this was a stern reality It would be late now before her family would reach her grandfather s Perhaps they would decide to spend the night Perhaps they would fancy she was coming by express She gave another tremendous effort to move the trunk toward the door In vain All was still Meanwhile missus Peterkin sat some time at the door wondering why Elizabeth Eliza did not come down mister Peterkin had started on with Solomon John and all the little boys Agamemnon had packed the things into the carriage a basket of lunch a change of shoes for mister Peterkin some extra wraps everything missus Peterkin could think of for the family comfort Still Elizabeth Eliza did not come I think she must have walked on with your father she said at last you had better get in Agamemnon now got in I should think she would have mentioned it she continued but we may as well start on and pick her up They started off I hope Elizabeth Eliza thought to speak to Amanda but we must ask her when we come up with her But they did not come up with Elizabeth Eliza At the turn beyond the village they found an envelope struck up in an inviting manner against a tree In this way they had agreed to leave missives for each other as they passed on This note informed them that the walking party was going to take the short cut across the meadows and would still be in front of them They saw the party at last just beyond the short cut but mister Peterkin was explaining the character of the oak tree to his children as they stood around a large specimen I suppose he is telling them that it is some kind of a Quercus said Agamemnon thoughtfully missus Peterkin thought mister Peterkin would scarcely use such an expression but she could see nothing of Elizabeth Eliza Some of the party however were behind the tree some were in front and Elizabeth Eliza might be behind the tree They were too far off to be shouted at missus Peterkin was calmed and went on to the stopping lace agreed upon which they reached before long This had been appointed near Farmer Gordon s barn that there might be somebody at hand whom they knew in case there should be any difficulty in untying the horse The plan had been that missus Peterkin should always sit in the carriage while the others should take turns for walking and Agamemnon tied the horse to a fence and left her comfortably arranged with her knitting Indeed she had risen so early to prepare for the alphabetical breakfast and had since been so tired with preparations that she was quite sleepy and would not object to a nape in the shade by the soothing sound of the buzzing of the flies But she called Agamemnon back as he started off for his solitary walk with a perplexing question Suppose the rest all should arrive how could they now be accommodated in the carryall It would be too much for the horse Why had Elizabeth Eliza gone with the rest without counting up Of course they must have expected that she missus Peterkin would walk on to the next stopping place She decided there was no way but for her to walk on When the rest passed her they might make a change So she put up knitting cheerfully It was a little joggly in the carriage she had already found for the horse was restless from the flies and she did not like being left alone She walked on then with Agamemnon It was very pleasant at first but the sun became hot and it was not long before she was fatigued When they reached a hay field she proposed going in to rest upon one of the hay cocks The largest and most shady was at the other end of the field and they were seated there when the carryall passed them in the road missus Peterkin waved parasol and hat and the party in the carryall returned their greetings but they were too far apart to hear each other missus Peterkin and Agamemnon slowly resumed their walk Well we shall find Elizabeth Eliza in the carryall she said and that will explain all But it took them an hour or two to reach the carryall with frequent stoppings for rest and when they reached it no one was in it A note was pinned up in the vehicle to say they had all walked on it was prime fun In this way the parties continued to dodge each other for missus Peterkin felt that she must walk on from the next station and the carryall missed her again while she and Agamemnon stopped in a house to rest and for a glass of water She reached the carryall to find again that no one was in it The party had passed on for the last station where it had been decided all should meet at the foot of grandfather s hill that they might all arrive at the house together missus Peterkin and Agamemnon looked out eagerly for the party all the way as Elizabeth Eliza must be tired by this time but missus Peterkin s last walk had been so slow that the other party was far in advance and reached the stopping place before them The little boys were all rowed out on the stone fence awaiting them full of delight at having reached grandfather s mister Peterkin came forward to meet them and at the same moment with missus Peterkin exclaimed Where is Elizabeth Eliza Each party looked eagerly at the other no Elizabeth Eliza was to be seen Where was she What was to be done Was she left behind missus Peterkin was convinced she must have somehow got to grandfather s They hurried up the hill Grandfather and all the family came out to greet them for they had been seen approaching There was great questioning but no Elizabeth Eliza It was sunset the view was wide and fine mister and missus Peterkin stood and looked out from the north to the south Was it too late to send back for Elizabeth Eliza Where was she Meanwhile the little boys had been informing the family of the object of their visit and while mister and missus Peterkin were looking up and down the road and Agamemnon and Solomon John were explaining to each other the details of their journeys they had discovered some facts We shall have to go back they exclaimed We are too late The maple syrup was all made last spring We are too early we shall have to stay two or three months the cider is not made till October The expedition was a failure They could study the making of neither maple syrup nor cider and Elizabeth Eliza was lost perhaps forever The sun went down and mister and missus Peterkin still stood to look up and down the road Elizabeth Eliza meanwhile had sat upon her trunk as it seemed for ages She recalled all the terrible stories of prisoners how they had watched the growth of flowers through cracks in the pavement She wondered how long she could live without eating How thankful she was for her abundant breakfast At length she heard the door bell But who could go to the door to answer it In vain did she make another effort to escape it was impossible How singular there were footsteps Some one was going to the door some one had opened it They must be burglars Well perhaps that was a better fate to be gagged by burglars and the neighbors informed than to be forever locked on her trunk The steps approached the door It opened and Amanda ushered in the expressman Amanda had not gone She had gathered while waiting at the breakfast table that there was to be an expressman whom she must receive Elizabeth Eliza explained the situation The expressman turned the key of her trunk and she was released What should she do next So long a time had elapsed she had given up all hope of her family returning for her But how could she reach them She hastily prevailed upon the expressman to take her along until she should come up with some of the family At least she would fall in with either the walking party or the carryall or she would meet them if they were on their return She mounted the seat with the expressman and slowly they took their way stopping for occasional parcels as they left the village But much to Elizabeth Eliza s dismay they turned off from the main road on leaving the village She remonstrated but the driver insisted he must go round by Millikin s to leave a bedstead They went round by Millikin s and then had further turns to make Elizabeth Eliza explained that in this way it would be impossible for her to find her parents and family and at last he proposed to take her all the way with her trunk She remembered with a shudder that when she had first asked about her trunk he had promised it should certainly be delivered the next morning Suppose they should have to be out all night Where did express carts spend the night She thought of herself in a lone wood in an express wagon She could hardly bring herself to ask before assenting when he should arrive He guessed he could bring up before night And so it happened that as mister and missus Peterkin in the late sunset were looking down the hill wondering what they should do about the lost Elizabeth Eliza they saw an express wagon approaching A female form sat upon the front seat She has decided to come by express said missus Peterkin It is it is Elizabeth Eliza THE PETERKINS AT THE CARNIVAL OF AUTHORS IN BOSTON THE Peterkins were in quite a muddle for them about the carnival of authors to be given in Boston As soon as it was announced their interests were excited and they determined that all the family should go But they conceived a wrong idea of the entertainment as they supposed that every one must go in costume Elizabeth Eliza thought their lessons in the foreign languages would help them much in conversing in character As the carnival was announced early Solomon John thought there would be time to read up everything written by all the authors in order to be acquainted with the characters they introduced missus Peterkin did not wish to begin too early upon the reading for she was sure she should forget all that the different authors had written before the day came But Elizabeth Eliza declared that she should hardly have time enough as it was to be acquainted with all the authors She had given up her French lessons after taking six for want of time and had indeed concluded she had learned in them all she should need to know of that language She could repeat one or two pages of phrases and she was astonished to find how much she could understand already of what the French teacher said to her and he assured her that when she went to Paris she could at least ask the price of gloves or of some other things she would need and he taught her too how to pronounce garcon in calling for more Agamemnon thought that different members of the family might make themselves familiar with different authors the little boys were already acquainted with Mother Goose mister Peterkin had read the Pickwick Papers and Solomon John had actually seen mister Longfellow getting into a horse car Elizabeth Eliza suggested that they might ask the Turk to give lectures upon the Arabian Nights Everybody else was planning something of the sort to raise funds for some purpose and she was sure they ought not to be behindhand missus Peterkin approved of this It would be excellent if they could raise funds enough to pay for their own tickets to the carnival then they could go every night Elizabeth Eliza was uncertain She thought it was usual to use the funds for some object mister Peterkin said that if they gained funds enough they might arrange a booth of their own and sit in it and take the carnival comfortably But Agamemnon reminded him that none of the family were authors and only authors had booths Solomon John indeed had once started upon writing a book but he was not able to think of anything to put in it and nothing had occurred to him yet mister Peterkin urged him to make one more effort If his book could come out before the carnival he could go as an author and might have a booth of his own and take his family But Agamemnon declared it would take years to become an author You might indeed publish something but you had to make sure that it would be read missus Peterkin on the other hand was certain that libraries were filled with books that never were read yet authors had written them For herself she had not read half the books in their own library And she was glad there was to be a Carnival of Authors that she might know who they were mister Peterkin did not understand why they called them a Carnival but he supposed they should find out when they went to it missus Peterkin still felt uncertain about costumes She proposed looking over the old trunks in the garret They would find some suitable dresses there and these would suggest what characters they should take Elizabeth Eliza was pleased with this thought She remembered an old turban of white mull muslin in an old bandbox and why should not her mother wear it missus Peterkin supposed that she should then go as her own grandmother Agamemnon did not approve of this Turbans are now worn in the East and missus Peterkin could go in some Eastern character Solomon John thought she might be Cleopatra and this was determined on Among the treasures found were some old bonnets of large size with waving plumes Elizabeth Eliza decided upon the largest of these She was tempted to appear as missus Columbus as Solomon John was to take the character of Christopher Columbus but he was planning to enter upon the stage in a boat and Elizabeth Eliza was a little afraid of sea sickness as he had arranged to be a great while finding the shore Solomon John had been led to take this character by discovering a coal hod that would answer for a helmet then as Christopher Columbus was born in Genoa he could use the phrases in Italian he had lately learned of his teacher As the day approached the family had their costumes prepared mister Peterkin decided to be Peter the Great It seemed to him a happy thought for the few words of Russian he had learned would come in play and he was quite sure that his own family name made him kin to that of the great Czar He studied up the life in the Encyclopaedia and decided to take the costume of a ship builder He visited the navy yard and some of the docks but none of them gave him the true idea of dress for ship building in Holland or saint Petersburg But he found a picture of Peter the Great representing him in a broad brimmed hat So he assumed one that he found at a costumer s and with Elizabeth Eliza s black waterproof was satisfied with his own appearance Elizabeth Eliza wondered if she could not go with her father in some Russian character She would have to lay aside her large bonnet but she had seen pictures of Russian ladies with fur muffs on their heads and she might wear her own muff missus Peterkin as Cleopatra wore the turban with a little row of false curls in front and a white embroidered muslin shawl crossed over her black silk dress The little boys thought she looked much like the picture of their great grandmother But doubtless Cleopatra resembled this picture as it was all so long ago so the rest of the family decided Agamemnon determined to go as Noah The costume as represented in one of the little boys arks was simple His father s red lined dressing gown turned inside out permitted it easily Elizabeth Eliza was now anxious to be missus Shem and make a long dress of yellow flannel and appear with Agamemnon and the little boys For the little boys were to represent two doves and a raven There were feather dusters enough in the family for their costumes which would be then complete with their india rubber boots Solomon John carried out in detail his idea of Christopher Columbus He had a number of eggs boiled hard to take in his pocket proposing to repeat through the evening the scene of setting the egg on its end He gave up the plan of a boat as it must be difficult to carry one into town so he contented himself by practising the motion of landing by stepping up on a chair But what scene could Elizabeth Eliza carry out If they had an ark as missus Shem she might crawl in and out of the roof constantly if it were not too high But mister Peterkin thought it as difficult to take an ark into town as Solomon John s boat The evening came But with all their preparations they got to the hall late The entrance was filled with a crowd of people and as they stopped at the cloakroom to leave their wraps they found themselves entangled with a number of people in costume coming out from a dressing room below mister Peterkin was much encouraged They were thus joining the performers The band was playing the Wedding March as they went upstairs to a door of the hall which opened upon one side of the stage Here a procession was marching up the steps of the stage all in costume and entering behind the scenes We are just in the right time whispered mister Peterkin to his family they are going upon the stage we must fall into line The little boys had their feather dusters ready Some words from one of the managers made Peterkin understand the situation We are going to be introduced to mister Dickens he said I thought he was dead exclaimed missus Peterkin trembling Authors live forever said Agamemnon in her ear At this moment they were ushered upon the stage The stage manager glared at them as he awaited their names for introduction while they came up all unannounced a part of the programme not expected But he uttered the words upon his lips Great Expectations and the Peterkin family swept across the stage with the rest mister Peterkin costumed as Peter the Great missus Peterkin as Cleopatra Agamemnon as Noah Solomon John as Christopher Columbus Elizabeth Eliza in yellow flannel as missus Shem with a large old fashioned bonnet on her head as missus Columbus and the little boys behind as two doves and a raven Across the stage in face of all the assembled people then following the rest down the stairs on the other side in among the audience they went but into an audience not dressed in costume There were Ann Maria Bromwick and the Osbornes all the neighbors all as natural as though they were walking the streets at home though Ann Maria did wear white gloves I had no idea you were to appear in character said Ann Maria to Elizabeth Eliza to what booth do you belong We are no particular author said mister Peterkin Ah I see a sort of varieties booth said mister Osborne What is your character asked Ann Maria of Elizabeth Eliza I have not quite decided said Elizabeth Eliza I thought I should find out after I came here The marshal called us Great Expectations missus Peterkin was at the summit of bliss I have shaken hands with Dickens she exclaimed But she looked round to ask the little boys if they too had shaken hands with the great man but not a little boy could she find They had been swept off in Mother Goose s train which had lingered on the steps to see the Dickens reception with which the procession of characters in costume had closed At this moment they were dancing round the barberry bush in a corner of the balcony in Mother Goose s quarters their feather dusters gayly waving in the air But missus Peterkin far below could not see this and consoled herself with the thought they should all meet on the stage in the grand closing tableau She was bewildered by the crowds which swept her hither and thither At last she found herself in the Whittier Booth and sat a long time calmly there As Cleopatra she seemed out of place but as her own grandmother she answered well with its New England scenery Solomon John wandered about landing in America whenever he found a chance to enter a booth Once before an admiring audience he set up his egg in the centre of the Goethe Booth which had been deserted by its committee for the larger stage Agamemnon frequently stood in the background of scenes in the Arabian Nights It was with difficulty that the family could be repressed from going on the stage whenever the bugle sounded for the different groups represented there Elizabeth Eliza came near appearing in the Dream of Fair Women at its most culminating point mister Peterkin found himself with the Cricket on the Hearth in the Dickens Booth He explained that he was Peter the Great but always in the Russian language which was never understood Elizabeth Eliza found herself in turn in all the booths Every manager was puzzled by her appearance and would send her to some other and she passed along always trying to explain that she had not yet decided upon her character mister Peterkin came and took Cleopatra from the Whittier Booth I cannot understand he said why none of our friends are dressed in costume and why we are I rather like it said Elizabeth Eliza though I should be better pleased if I could form a group with some one The strains of the minuet began missus Peterkin was anxious to join the performers It was the dance of her youth But she was delayed by one of the managers on the steps that led to the stage I cannot understand this company he said distractedly They cannot find their booth said another That is the case said mister Peterkin relieved to have it stated Perhaps you had better pass into the corridor said a polite marshal They did this and walking across found themselves in the refreshment room This is the booth for us said mister Peterkin Indeed it is said missus Peterkin sinking into a chair exhausted At this moment two doves and a raven appeared the little boys who had been dancing eagerly in Mother Goose s establishment and now came down for ice cream I hardly know how to sit down said Elizabeth Eliza for I am sure missus Shem never could Still as I do not know if I am missus Shem I will venture it Happily seats were to be found for all and they were soon arranged in a row calmly eating ice cream I think the truth is said mister Peterkin that we represent historical people and we ought to have been fictitious characters in books That is I observe what the others are We shall know better another time If we only ever get home said missus Peterkin I shall not wish to come again It seems like being on the stage sitting in a booth and it is so bewildering Elizabeth Eliza not knowing who she is and going round and round in this way I am afraid we shall never reach home said Agamemnon who had been silent for some time we may have to spend the night here I find I have lost our checks for our clothes in the cloak room Spend the night in a booth in Cleopatra s turban exclaimed missus Peterkin We should like to come every night cried the little boys But to spend the night repeated missus Peterkin I conclude the Carnival keeps up all night said mister Peterkin But never to recover our cloaks said missus Peterkin could not the little boys look round for the checks on the floors She began to enumerate the many valuable things that they might never see again She had worn her large fur cape of stone marten her grandmother s that Elizabeth Eliza had been urging her to have made into a foot rug Now how she wished she had And there were mister Peterkin s new overshoes and Agamemnon had brought an umbrella and the little boys had their mittens Their india rubber boots fortunately they had on in the character of birds But Solomon John had worn a fur cap and Elizabeth Eliza a muff Should they lose all these valuables entirely and go home in the cold without them No it would be better to wait till everybody had gone and then look carefully over the floors for the checks if only the little boys could know where Agamemnon had been they were willing to look mister Peterkin was not sure as they would have time to reach the train Still they would need something to wear and he could not tell the time He had not brought his watch It was a Waltham watch and he thought it would not be in character for Peter the Great to wear it At this moment the strains of Home Sweet Home were heard from the band and people were seen preparing to go All can go home but we must stay said missus Peterkin gloomily as the well known strains floated in from the larger hall A number of marshals came to the refreshment room looked at them whispered to each other as the Peterkins sat in a row Can we do anything for you asked one at last Would you not like to go He seemed eager they should leave the room mister Peterkin explained that they could not go as they had lost the checks for their wraps and hoped to find their checks on the floor when everybody was gone The marshal asked if they could not describe what they had worn in which case the loss of the checks was not so important as the crowds had now almost left and it would not be difficult to identify their wraps missus Peterkin eagerly declared she could describe every article It was astonishing how the marshals hurried them through the quickly deserted corridors how gladly they recovered their garments missus Peterkin indeed was disturbed by the eagerness of the marshals she feared they had some pretext for getting the family out of the hall missus Peterkin was one of those who never consent to be forced to anything She would not be compelled to go home even with strains of music She whispered her suspicions to mister Peterkin but Agamemnon came hastily up to announce the time which he had learned from the clock in the large hall They must leave directly if they wished to catch the latest train as there was barely time to reach it Then indeed was missus Peterkin ready to leave If they should miss the train If she should have to pass the night in the streets in her turban She was the first to lead the way and panting the family followed her just in time to take the train as it was leaving the station The excitement was not yet over They found in the train many of their friends and neighbors returning also from the Carnival so they had many questions put to them which they were unable to answer Still missus Peterkin s turban was much admired and indeed the whole appearance of the family so that they felt themselves much repaid for their exertions But more adventures awaited them They left the train with their friends but as missus Peterkin and Elizabeth Eliza were very tired they walked very slowly and Solomon John and the little boys were sent on with the pass key to open the door They soon returned with the startling intelligence that it was not the right key and they could not get in It was mister Peterkin s office key he had taken it by mistake or he might have dropped the house key in the cloak room of the Carnival Must we go back sighed missus Peterkin in an exhausted voice More than ever did Elizabeth Eliza regret that Agamemnon s invention in keys had failed to secure a patent It was impossible to get into the house for Amanda had been allowed to go and spend the night with a friend so there was no use in ringing though the little boys had tried it We can return to the station said mister Peterkin the rooms will be warm on account of the midnight train We can at least think what we shall do next At the station was one of their neighbors proposing to take the New York midnight train for it was now after eleven and the train went through at half past I saw lights at the locksmith s over the way as I passed he said why do not you send over to the young man there He can get your door open for you I never would spend the night here Solomon John went over to the young man who agreed to go up to the house as soon as he had closed the shop fit a key and open the door and come back to them on his way home Solomon John came back to the station for it was now cold and windy in the deserted streets The family made themselves as comfortable as possible by the stove sending Solomon John out occasionally to look for the young man But somehow Solomon John missed him the lights were out in the locksmith s shop so he followed along to the house hoping to find him there But he was not there He came back to report Perhaps the young man had opened the door and gone on home Solomon John and Agamemnon went back together but they could not get in Where was the young man He had lately come to town and nobody knew where he lived for on the return of Solomon John and Agamemnon it had been proposed to go to the house of the young man The night was wearing on The midnight train had come and gone The passengers who came and went looked with wonder at missus Peterkin nodding in her turban as she sat by the stove on a corner of a long bench At last the station master had to leave for a short rest He felt obliged to lock up the station but he promised to return at an early hour to release them Of what use said Elizabeth Eliza if we cannot even then get into our own house mister Peterkin thought the matter appeared bad if the locksmith had left town He feared the young man might have gone in and helped himself to spoons and left Only they should have seen him if he had taken the midnight train Solomon John thought he appeared honest mister Peterkin only ventured to whisper his suspicions as he did not wish to arouse missus Peterkin who still was nodding in the corner of the long bench Morning did come at last The family decided to go to their home perhaps by some effort in the early daylight they might make an entrance On the way they met with the night policeman returning from his beat He stopped when he saw the family Ah that accounts he said you were all out last night and the burglars took occasion to make a raid on your house I caught a lively young man in the very act box of tools in his hand If I had been a minute late he would have made his way in The family then tried to interrupt to explain Where is he exclaimed mister Peterkin Safe in the lock up answered the policeman But he is the locksmith interrupted Solomon John We have no key said Elizabeth Eliza if you have locked up the locksmith we can never get in The policeman looked from one to the other smiling slightly when he understood the case The locksmith he exclaimed he is a new fellow and I did not recognize him and arrested him Very well I will go and let him out that he may let you in and he hurried away surprising the Peterkin family with what seemed like insulting screams of laughter It seems to me a more serious case than it appears to him said mister Peterkin missus Peterkin did not understand it at all Had burglars entered the house Did the policeman say they had taken spoons And why did he appear so pleased She was sure the old silver teapot was locked up in the closet of their room Slowly the family walked towards the house and almost as soon as they the policeman appeared with the released locksmith and a few boys from the street who happened to be out early The locksmith was not in very good humor and took ill the jokes of the policeman mister Peterkin fearing he might not consent to open the door pressed into his hand a large sum of money The door flew open the family could go in Amanda arrived at the same moment There was hope of breakfast missus Peterkin staggered towards the stairs I shall never go to another carnival she exclaimed THE PETERKINS AT THE FARM YES at last they had reached the seaside after much talking and deliberation and summer after summer the journey had been constantly postponed But here they were at last at the Old Farm so called where seaside attractions had been praised in all the advertisements And here they were to meet the Sylvesters who knew all about the place cousins of Ann Maria Bromwick Elizabeth Eliza was astonished not to find them there though she had not expected Ann Maria to join them till the very next day Their preparations had been so elaborate that at one time the whole thing had seemed hopeless yet here they all were Their trunks to be sure had not arrived but the wagon was to be sent back for them and wonderful to tell they had all their hand baggage safe Agamemnon had brought his Portable Electrical Machine and Apparatus and the volumes of the Encyclopaedia that might tell him how to manage it and Solomon John had his photograph camera The little boys had used their india rubber boots as portmanteaux filling them to the brim and carrying one in each hand a very convenient way for travelling they considered it but they found on arriving when they wanted to put their boots directly on for exploration round the house that it was somewhat inconvenient to have to begin to unpack directly and scarcely room enough could be found for all the contents in the small chamber allotted to them There was no room in the house for the electrical machine and camera Elizabeth Eliza thought the other boarders were afraid of the machine going off so an out house was found for them where Agamemnon and Solomon John could arrange them missus Peterkin was much pleased with the old fashioned porch and low studded rooms though the sleeping rooms seemed a little stuffy at first mister Peterkin was delighted with the admirable order in which the farm was evidently kept From the first moment he arrived he gave himself to examining the well stocked stables and barns and the fields and vegetable gardens which were shown to him by a highly intelligent person a mister Atwood who devoted himself to explaining to mister Peterkin all the details of methods in the farming The rest of the family were disturbed at being so far from the sea when they found it would take nearly all the afternoon to reach the beach The advertisements had surely stated that the Old Farm was directly on the shore and that sea bathing would be exceedingly convenient which was hardly the case if it took you an hour and a half to walk to it mister Peterkin declared there were always such discrepancies between the advertisements of seaside places and the actual facts but he was more than satisfied with the farm part and was glad to remain and admire it while the rest of the family went to find the beach starting off in a wagon large enough to accommodate them Agamemnon driving the one horse Solomon John had depended upon taking the photographs of the family in a row on the beach but he decided not to take his camera out the first afternoon This was well as the sun was already setting when they reached the beach If this wagon were not so shaky said missus Peterkin we might drive over every morning for our bath The road is very straight and I suppose Agamemnon can turn on the beach We should have to spend the whole day about it said Solomon John in a discouraged tone unless we can have a quicker horse Perhaps we should prefer that said Elizabeth Eliza a little gloomily to staying at the house She had been a little disturbed to find there were not more elegant and fashionable looking boarders at the farm and she was disappointed that the Sylvesters had not arrived who would understand the ways of the place Yet again she was somewhat relieved for if their trunks did not come till the next day as was feared she should have nothing but her travelling dress to wear which would certainly answer for to night She had been busy all the early summer in preparing her dresses for this very watering place and as far as appeared she would hardly need them and was disappointed to have no chance to display them But of course when the Sylvesters and Ann Maria came all would be different but they would surely be wasted on the two old ladies she had seen and on the old men who had lounged about the porch there surely was not a gentleman among them Agamemnon assured her she could not tell at the seaside as gentlemen wore their exercise dress and took a pride in going around in shocking hats and flannel suits Doubtless they would be dressed for dinner on their return On their arrival they had been shown to a room to have their meals by themselves and could not decide whether they were eating dinner or lunch There was a variety of meat vegetables and pie that might come under either name but mister and missus Peterkin were well pleased I had no idea we should have really farm fare missus Peterkin said I have not drunk such a tumbler of milk since I was young Elizabeth Eliza concluded they ought not to judge from a first meal as evidently their arrival had not been fully prepared for in spite of the numerous letters that had been exchanged The little boys were however perfectly satisfied from the moment of their arrival and one of them had stayed at the farm declining to go to the beach as he wished to admire the pigs cows and horses and all the way over to the beach the other little boys were hopping in and out of the wagon which never went too fast to pick long mullein stalks for whips to urge on the reluctant horse with or to gather huckleberries with which they were rejoiced to find the fields were filled although as yet the berries were very green They wanted to stay longer on the beach when they finally reached it but missus Peterkin and Elizabeth Eliza insisted upon turning directly back as it was not fair to be late to dinner the very first night On the whole the party came back cheerful yet hungry They found the same old men in the same costume standing against the porch A little seedy I should say said Solomon John Smoking pipes said Agamemnon I believe that is the latest style The smell of their tobacco is not very agreeable missus Peterkin was forced to say There seemed the same uncertainty on their arrival as to where they were to be put and as to their meals Elizabeth Eliza tried to get into conversation with the old ladies who were wandering in and out of a small sitting room But one of them was very deaf and the other seemed to be a foreigner She discovered from a moderately tidy maid by the name of Martha who seemed a sort of factotum that there were other ladies in their rooms too much of invalids to appear Regular bed ridden Martha had described them which Elizabeth Eliza did not consider respectful mister Peterkin appeared coming down the slope of the hill behind the house very cheerful He had made the tour of the farm and found it in admirable order Elizabeth Eliza felt it time to ask Martha about the next meal and ventured to call it supper as a sort of compromise between dinner and tea If dinner were expected she might offend by taking it for granted that it was to be tea and if they were unused to a late dinner they might be disturbed if they had only provided a tea So she asked what was the usual hour for supper and was surprised when Martha replied The lady must say nodding to missus Peterkin She can have it just when she wants and just what she wants This was an unexpected courtesy Elizabeth Eliza asked when the others had their supper Oh they took it a long time ago Martha answered If the lady will go out into the kitchen she can tell what she wants Bring us in what you have said mister Peterkin himself quite hungry If you could cook us a fresh slice of beefsteak that would be well Perhaps some eggs murmured missus Peterkin Scrambled cried one of the little boys Fried potatoes would not be bad suggested Agamemnon Couldn t we have some onions asked the little boy who had stayed at home and had noticed the odor of onions when the others had their supper A pie would come in well said Solomon John And some stewed cherries said the other little boy Martha fell to laying the table and the family was much pleased when in the course of time all the dishes they had recommended appeared Their appetites were admirable and they pronounced the food the same This is true Arab hospitality said mister Peterkin as he cut his juicy beefsteak I know it said Elizabeth Eliza whose spirits began to rise We have not even seen the host and hostess She would indeed have been glad to find some one to tell her when the Sylvesters were expected and why they had not arrived Her room was in the wing far from that of mister and missus Peterkin and near the aged deaf and foreign ladies and she was kept awake for some time by perplexed thoughts She was sure the lady from Philadelphia under such circumstances would have written to somebody But ought she to write to Ann Maria or the Sylvesters And if she did write which had she better write to She fully determined to write the first thing in the morning to both parties But how should she address her letters Would there be any use in sending to the Sylvesters usual address which she knew well by this time merely to say they had not come Of course the Sylvesters would know they had not come It would be the same with Ann Maria She might indeed inclose her letters to their several postmasters Postmasters were always so obliging and always knew where people were going to and where to send their letters She might at least write two letters to say that they the Peterkins had arrived and were disappointed not to find the Sylvesters And she could add that their trunks had not arrived and perhaps their friends might look out for them on their way It really seemed a good plan to write Yet another question came up as to how she would get her letters to the post office as she had already learned it was at quite a distance and in a different direction from the station where they were to send the next day for their trunks She went over and over these same questions kept awake by the coughing and talking of her neighbors the other side of the thin partition She was scarcely sorry to be aroused from her uncomfortable sleep by the morning sounds of guinea hens peacocks and every other kind of fowl missus Peterkin expressed her satisfaction at the early breakfast and declared she was delighted with such genuine farm sounds They passed the day much as the afternoon before reaching the beach only in time to turn round to come back for their dinner which was appointed at noon missus Peterkin was quite satisfied Such a straight road and the beach such a safe place to turn round upon Elizabeth Eliza was not so well pleased A wagon had been sent to the station for their trunks which could not be found they were probably left at the Boston station or mister Atwood suggested might have been switched off upon one of the White Mountain trains There was no use to write any letters as there was no way to send them Elizabeth Eliza now almost hoped the Sylvesters would not come for what should she do if the trunks did not come and all her new dresses On her way over to the beach she had been thinking what she should do with her new foulard and cream colored surah if the Sylvesters did not come and if their time was spent in only driving to the beach and back But now she would prefer that the Sylvesters would not come till the dresses and the trunks did All she could find out from inquiry on returning was that another lot was expected on Saturday The next day she suggested Suppose we take our dinner with us to the beach and spend the day The Sylvesters and Ann Maria then would find them on the beach where her travelling dress would be quite appropriate I am a little tired she added of going back and forward over the same road but when the rest come we can vary it The plan was agreed to but mister Peterkin and the little boys remained to go over the farm again They had an excellent picnic on the beach under the shadow of a ledge of sand They were just putting up their things when they saw a party of people approaching from the other end of the beach I am glad to see some pleasant looking people at last said Elizabeth Eliza and they all turned to walk toward them As the other party drew near she recognized Ann Maria Bromwick And with her were the Sylvesters so they proved to be for she had never seen them before What you have come in our absence exclaimed Elizabeth Eliza And we have been wondering what had become of you cried Ann Maria I thought you would be at the farm before us said Elizabeth Eliza to mister Sylvester to whom she was introduced We have been looking for you at the farm he was saying to her But we are at the farm said Elizabeth Eliza And so are we said Ann Maria We have been there two days said missus Peterkin And so have we at the Old Farm just at the end of the beach said Ann Maria Our farm is old enough said Solomon John Whereabouts are you asked mister Sylvester Elizabeth Eliza pointed to the road they had come A smile came over mister Sylvester s face he knew the country well You mean the farm house behind the hill at the end of the road he asked The Peterkins all nodded affirmatively Ann Maria could not restrain herself as broad smiles came over the faces of all the party Why that is the Poor house she exclaimed The town farm mister Sylvester explained deprecatingly The Peterkins were silent for a while The Sylvesters tried not to laugh There certainly were some disagreeable old men and women there said Elizabeth Eliza at last But we have surely been made very comfortable missus Peterkin declared A very simple mistake said mister Sylvester continuing his amusement Your trunks arrived all right at the Old Farm two days ago Let us go back directly said Elizabeth Eliza As directly as our horse will allow said Agamemnon mister Sylvester helped them into the wagon Your rooms are awaiting you he said Why not come with us We want to find mister Peterkin before we do anything else said missus Peterkin They rode back in silence till Elizabeth Eliza said Do you suppose they took us for paupers We have not seen any they said Solomon John except mister Atwood At the entrance of the farm yard mister Peterkin met them I have been looking for you he said I have just made a discovery We have made it too said Elizabeth Eliza we are in the poor house How did you find it out missus Peterkin asked of mister Peterkin mister Atwood came to me puzzled with a telegram that had been brought to him from the station which he ought to have got two days ago It came from a mister Peters whom they were expecting here this week with his wife and boys to take charge of the establishment He telegraphed to say he cannot come till Friday Now mister Atwood had supposed we were the Peterses whom he had sent for the day we arrived not having received this telegram Oh I see I see said missus Peterkin and we did get into a muddle at the station mister Atwood met them at the porch I beg pardon he said I hope you have found it comfortable here and shall be glad to have you stay till mister Peters family comes At this moment wheels were heard mister Sylvester had arrived with an open wagon to take the Peterkins to the Old Farm Martha was waiting within the door and said to Elizabeth Eliza Beg pardon miss for thinking you was one of the inmates and putting you in that room We thought it so kind of missus Peters to take you off every day with the other gentlemen that looked so wandering Elizabeth Eliza did not know whether to laugh or to cry mister Peterkin and the little boys decided to stay at the farm till Friday But Agamemnon and Solomon John preferred to leave with mister Sylvester and to take their electrical machine and camera when they came for mister Peterkin missus Peterkin was tempted to stay another night to be wakened once more by the guinea hens But Elizabeth Eliza bore her off There was not much packing to be done She shouted good by into the ears of the deaf old lady and waved her hand to the foreign one and glad to bid farewell to the old men with their pipes leaning against the porch This time she said it is not our trunks that were lost But we as a family said missus Peterkin End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Peterkin Papers by Lucretia P Hale END OF
