you First because the only really noble motive I had in writing it was the hope that you would enjoy it Second because I owe you a book in return for The Man Who Was Thursday Third because I said I would when I unfolded the plan of it to you surrounded by Frenchmen two years ago Fourth because I remember the past I have been thinking again to day of those astonishing times when neither of us ever looked at a newspaper when we were purely happy in the boundless consumption of paper pencils tea and our elders patience when we embraced the most severe literature and ourselves produced such light reading as was necessary when in the words of Canada s poet we studied the works of nature also those little frogs when in short we were extremely young For the sake of that age I offer you this

seems to matter how should the world we know judge wisely When the scheming indomitable brain of Sigsbee Manderson was scattered by a shot from an unknown hand that world lost nothing worth a single tear it gained something memorable in a harsh reminder of the vanity of such wealth as this dead man had piled up without making one loyal friend to mourn him without doing an act that could help his memory to the least honor But when the news of his end came it seemed to those living in the great vortices of business as if the earth too shuddered under a blow In all the lurid commercial history of his country there had been no figure that had so imposed itself upon the mind of the trading world He had a niche apart in its temples Financial giants strong to direct and augment the forces of capital and taking an approved toll in millions for so doing had existed before but in the case of Manderson there had been this singularity that a pale halo of piratical romance a thing especially dear to the hearts of his countrymen had remained incongruously about his head through the years when he stood in every eye as the unquestioned guardian of stability the stamper out of manipulated crises the foe of the raiding chieftains that infest the borders of Wall Street The fortune left by his grandfather who had been one of those chieftains on the smaller scale of his day had descended to him with accretion through his father who during a long life had quietly continued to lend money and never had margined a stock Manderson who had at no time known what it was to be without large sums to his hand should have been altogether of that newer American plutocracy which is steadied by the tradition and habit of great wealth But it was not so While his nurture and education had taught him European ideas of a rich man s proper external circumstance while they had rooted in him an instinct for quiet magnificence the larger costliness which does not shriek of itself with a thousand tongues there had been handed on to him nevertheless much of the Forty Niner and financial buccaneer his forbear During that first period of his business career which had been called his early bad manner he had been little more than a gambler of genius his hand against every man s an infant prodigy who brought to the enthralling pursuit of speculation a brain better endowed than any opposed to it At saint Helena it was laid down that war is une belle occupation and so the young Manderson had found the multitudinous and complicated dog fight of the Stock Exchange of New York Then came his change At his father s death when Manderson was thirty years old some new revelation of the power and the glory of the god he served seemed to have come upon him With the sudden elastic adaptability of his nation he turned to steady labor in his father s banking business closing his ears to the sound of the battles of the Street In a few years he came to control all the activity of the great firm whose unimpeached conservatism safety and financial weight lifted it like a cliff above the angry sea of the markets All mistrust founded on the performances of his youth had vanished He was quite plainly a different man How the change came about none could with authority say but there was a story of certain last words spoken by his father whom alone he had respected and perhaps loved He began to tower above the financial situation Soon his name was current in the bourses of the world One who spoke the name of Manderson called up a vision of all that was broad based and firm in the vast wealth of the United States He planned great combinations of capital drew together and centralized industries of continental scope financed with unerring judgment the large designs of state or of private enterprise Many a time when he took hold to smash a strike or to federate the ownership of some great field of labor he sent ruin upon a multitude of tiny homes and if miners or steel workers or cattlemen defied him and invoked disorder he could be more lawless and ruthless than they But this was done in the pursuit of legitimate business ends Tens of thousands of the poor might curse his name but the financier and the speculator execrated him no more He stretched a hand to protect or to manipulate the power of wealth in every corner of the country Forcible cold and unerring in all he did he ministered to the national lust for magnitude and a grateful country surnamed him the Colossus But there was an aspect of Manderson in this later period that lay long unknown and unsuspected save by a few his secretaries and lieutenants and certain of the associates of his bygone hurling time This little circle knew that Manderson the pillar of sound business and stability in the markets had his hours of nostalgia for the lively times when the Street had trembled at his name It was said one of them as if Blackbeard had settled down as a decent merchant in Bristol on the spoils of the Main Now and then the pirate would glare suddenly out the knife in his teeth and the sulphur matches sputtering in his hat band During such spasms of reversion to type a score of tempestuous raids upon the market had been planned on paper in the inner room of the offices of Manderson Colefax and Company But they were never carried out Blackbeard would quell the mutiny of his old self within him and go soberly down to his counting house humming a stave or two of Spanish Ladies perhaps under his breath Manderson would allow himself the harmless satisfaction as soon as the time for action had gone by of pointing out to some Rupert of the markets how a coup worth a million to the depredator might have been made Seems to me he would say almost wistfully the Street is getting to be a mighty dull place since I quit By slow degrees this amiable weakness of the Colossus became known to the business world which exulted greatly in the knowledge At the news of his death panic went through the markets like a hurricane for it came at a luckless time Prices tottered and crashed like towers in an earthquake For two days Wall Street was a clamorous inferno of pale despair All over the United States wherever speculation had its devotees went a waft of ruin a plague of suicide In Europe also not a few took with their own hands lives that had become pitiably linked to the destiny of a financier whom most of them had never seen In Paris a well known banker walked quietly out of the Bourse and fell dead upon the broad steps among the raving crowd of Jews a phial crushed in his hand In Frankfort one leaped from the Cathedral top leaving a redder stain where he struck the red tower Men stabbed and shot and strangled themselves drank death or breathed it as the air because in a lonely corner of England the life had departed from one cold heart vowed to the service of greed The blow could not have fallen at a more disastrous moment It came when Wall Street was in a condition of suppressed scare Suppressed because for a week past the great interests known to act with or to be actually controlled by the Colossus had been desperately combating the effects of the sudden arrest of Lucas Hahn and the exposure of his plundering of the Hahn banks This bombshell in its turn had fallen at a time when the market had been boosted beyond its real strength In the language of the place a slump was due Reports from the corn lands had not been good and there had been two or three railway statements which had been expected to be much better than they were But at whatever point in the vast area of speculation the shudder of the threatened break had been felt the Manderson crowd had stepped in and held the market up All through the week the speculator s mind as shallow as it is quick witted as sentimental as greedy had seen in this the hand of the giant stretched out in protection from afar Manderson said the newspapers in chorus was in hourly communication with his lieutenants in the Street One journal was able to give in round figures the sum spent on cabling between New York and Marlstone in the past twenty four hours it told how a small staff of expert operators had been sent down by the Post Office authorities to Marlstone to deal with the flood of messages Another revealed that Manderson on the first news of the Hahn crash had arranged to abandon his holiday and return home by the Lusitania but that he soon had the situation so well in hand that he had determined to remain where he was All this was falsehood more or less consciously elaborated by the finance editors consciously initiated and encouraged by the shrewd business men of the Manderson group who knew that nothing could better help their plans than this illusion of hero worship knew also that no word had come from Manderson in answer to their messages and that Howard B Jeffrey of Steel and Iron fame was the true organizer of victory So they fought down apprehension through four feverish days and minds grew calmer On Saturday though the ground beneath the feet of mister Jeffrey yet rumbled now and then with AEtna mutterings of disquiet he deemed his task almost done The market was firm and slowly advancing Wall Street turned to its sleep of Sunday worn out but thankfully at peace In the first trading hour of Monday a hideous rumor flew round the sixty acres of the financial district It came into being as the lightning comes a blink that seems to begin nowhere though it is to be suspected that it was first whispered over the telephone together with an urgent selling order by some employee in the cable service In five minutes the dull noise of the curbstone market in Broad Street had leaped to a high note of frantic interrogation From within the hive of the Exchange itself could be heard a droning hubbub of fear and men rushed hatless in and out Was it true asked every man and every man replied with trembling lips that it was a lie put out by some unscrupulous short interest seeking to cover itself In another quarter of an hour news came of a sudden and ruinous collapse of Yankees in London at the close of the Stock Exchange day It was enough New York had still four hours trading in front of her The strategy of pointing to Manderson as the savior and warden of the market had recoiled upon its authors with annihilating force and Jeffrey his ear at his private telephone listened to the tale of disaster with a set jaw The new Napoleon had lost his Marengo He saw the whole financial landscape sliding and falling into chaos before him In half an hour the news of the finding of Manderson s body with the inevitable rumor that it was suicide was printing in a dozen newspaper offices but before a copy reached Wall Street the tornado of the panic was in full fury and Howard B Jeffrey and his collaborators were whirled away like leaves before its breath All this sprang out of nothing Nothing in the texture of the general life had changed The corn had not ceased to ripen in the sun The rivers bore their barges and gave power to a myriad engines The flocks fattened on the pastures the herds were unnumbered Men labored everywhere in the various servitudes to which they were born and chafed not more than usual in their bonds Bellona tossed and murmured as ever yet still slept her uneasy sleep To all mankind save a million or two of half crazed gamblers blind to all reality the death of Manderson meant nothing the life and work of the world went on Weeks before he died strong hands had been in control of every wire in the huge network of commerce and industry that he had supervised Before his corpse was buried his countrymen had made a strange discovery that the existence of the potent engine of monopoly that went by the name of Sigsbee Manderson had not been a condition of even material prosperity The panic blew itself out in two days the pieces were picked up the bankrupts withdrew out of sight the market recovered a normal tone While the brief delirium was yet subsiding there broke out a domestic scandal in England that suddenly fixed the attention of two continents Next morning the Chicago Limited was wrecked and the same day a notable politician was shot down in cold blood by his wife s brother in the streets of New Orleans Within a week of its arising the Manderson story to the trained sense of editors throughout the Union was cold The tide of American visitors pouring through Europe made eddies round the memorial or statue of many a man who had died in poverty and never thought of their most famous plutocrat Like the poet who died in Rome so young and poor a hundred years ago he was buried far away from his own land but for all the men and women of Manderson s people who flock round the tomb of Keats in the cemetery under the Monte Testaccio there is not one nor ever will be to stand in reverence by the rich man s grave beside the little church of Marlstone CHAPTER I KNOCKING THE TOWN ENDWAYS In the only comfortably furnished room in the offices of the Record the telephone on Sir James Molloy s table buzzed Sir James made a motion with his pen and mister Silver his secretary left his work and came over to the instrument Who is that he said Who I can t hear you Oh it s mister Bunner is it Yes but I know but he s fearfully busy this afternoon Can t you Oh really Well in that case just hold on will you He placed the receiver before Sir James It s Calvin Bunner Sigsbee Manderson s right hand man he said concisely He insists on speaking to you personally Says it is the gravest piece of news He is talking from the house down by Bishopsbridge so it will be necessary to speak clearly Sir James looked at the telephone not affectionately and took up the receiver Well he said in his strong voice and listened Yes he said The next moment mister Silver eagerly watching him saw a look of amazement and horror Good God murmured Sir James Clutching the instrument he slowly rose to his feet still bending ear intently At intervals he repeated Yes Presently as he listened he glanced at the clock and spoke quickly to mister Silver over the top of the transmitter Go and hunt up Figgis and young Williams Hurry mister Silver darted from the room The great journalist was a tall strong clever Irishman of fifty swart and black mustached a man of untiring business energy well known in the world which he understood very thoroughly and played upon with the half cynical competence of his race Yet was he without a touch of the charlatan he made no mysteries and no pretenses of knowledge and he saw instantly through these in others In his handsome well bred well dressed appearance there was something a little sinister when anger or intense occupation put its imprint about his eyes and brow but when his generous nature was under no restraint he was the most cordial of men He was managing director of the company which owned that most powerful morning paper the Record and also that most indispensable evening paper the Sun which had its offices on the other side of the street He was moreover editor in chief of the Record to which he had in the course of years attached the most variously capable personnel in the country It was a maxim of his that where you could not get gifts you must do the best you could with solid merit and he employed a great deal of both He was respected by his staff as few are respected in a profession not favorable to the growth of the sentiment of reverence You re sure that s all asked Sir James after a few minutes of earnest listening and questioning And how long has this been known Yes of course the police are but the servants Surely it s all over the place down there by now Well we ll have a try Look here Bunner I m infinitely obliged to you about this I owe you a good turn You know I mean what I say Come and see me the first day you get to town All right that s understood Now I must act on your news Good by Sir James hung up the receiver and seized a railway time table from the rack before him After a rapid consultation of this oracle he flung it down with a forcible word as mister Silver hurried into the room followed by a hard featured man with spectacles and a youth with an alert eye I want you to jot down some facts Figgis said Sir James banishing all signs of agitation and speaking with a rapid calmness When you have them put them into shape just as quick you can for a special edition of the Sun The hard featured man nodded and glanced at the clock which pointed to a few minutes past three he pulled out a notebook and drew a chair up to the big writing table Silver Sir James went on go and tell Jones to wire our local correspondent very urgently to drop everything and get down to Marlstone at once He is not to say why in the telegram There must not be an unnecessary word about this news until the Sun is on the streets with it you all understand Williams cut across the way and tell mister Anthony to hold himself ready for a two column opening that will knock the town endways Just tell him that he must take all measures and precautions for a scoop Say that Figgis will be over in five minutes with the facts and that he had better let him write up the story in his private room As you go ask Miss Morgan to see me here at once and tell the telephone people to see if they can get mister Trent on the wire for me After seeing mister Anthony return here and stand by The alert eyed young man vanished like a spirit Sir James turned instantly to mister Figgis whose pencil was poised over the paper Sigsbee Manderson has been murdered he began quickly and clearly pacing the floor with his hands behind him mister Figgis scratched down a line of shorthand with as much emotion as if he had been told that the day was fine the pose of his craft He and his wife and two secretaries have been for the past fortnight at the house called White Gables at Marlstone near Bishopsbridge He bought it four years ago He and missus Manderson have since spent a part of each summer there Last night he went to bed about half past eleven just as usual No one knows when he got up and left the house He was not missed until this morning About ten o clock his body was found by a gardener It was lying by a shed in the grounds He was shot in the head through the left eye Death must have been instantaneous The body was not robbed but there were marks on the wrists which pointed to a struggle having taken place doctor Stock of Marlstone was at once sent for and will conduct the post mortem examination The police from Bishopsbridge who were soon on the spot are reticent but it is believed that they are quite without a clue to the identity of the murderer There you are Figgis mister Anthony is expecting you Now I must telephone him and arrange things mister Figgis looked up One of the ablest detectives at Scotland Yard he suggested has been put in charge of the case It s a safe statement If you like said Sir James And missus Manderson Was she there Yes What about her Prostrated by the shock hinted the reporter and sees nobody Human interest I wouldn t put that in mister Figgis said a quiet voice It belonged to Miss Morgan a pale graceful woman who had silently made her appearance while the dictation was going on I have seen missus Manderson she proceeded turning to Sir James She looks quite healthy and intelligent Has her husband been murdered I don t think the shock would prostrate her She is more likely to be doing all she can to help the police Something in your own style then Miss Morgan he said with a momentary smile Her imperturbable efficiency was an office proverb Cut it out Figgis Off you go Now madam I expect you know what I want Our Manderson biography happens to be well up to date replied Miss Morgan drooping her dark eye lashes as she considered the position I was looking over it only a few months ago It is practically ready for to morrow s paper I should think the Sun had better use the sketch of his life they had about two years ago when he went to Berlin and settled the potash difficulty I remember it was a very good sketch and they won t be able to carry much more than that As for our paper of course we have a great quantity of cuttings mostly rubbish The sub editors shall have them as soon as they come in Then we have two very good portraits that are our own property the best is a drawing mister Trent made when they were both on the same ship somewhere It is better than any of the photographs but you say the public prefers a bad photograph to a good drawing I will send them down to you at once and you can choose As far as I can see the Record is well ahead of the situation except that you will not be able to get a special man down there in time to be of any use for to morrow s paper Sir James sighed deeply What are we good for anyhow he inquired dejectedly of mister Silver who had returned to his desk She even knows Bradshaw by heart Miss Morgan adjusted her cuffs with an air of patience Is there anything else she asked as the telephone bell rang Yes one thing replied Sir James as he took up the receiver I want you to make a bad mistake some time Miss Morgan an everlasting bloomer just to put us in countenance She permitted herself the fraction of what would have been a charming smile as she went out Anthony asked Sir James and was at once deep in consultation with the editor on the other side of the road He seldom entered the Sun building in person the atmosphere of an evening paper he would say was all very well if you liked that kind of thing mister Anthony the Murat of Fleet Street who delighted in riding the whirlwind and fighting a tumultuous battle against time would say the same of a morning paper It was some five minutes later that a uniformed boy came in to say that mister Trent was on the wire Sir James abruptly closed his talk with mister Anthony They can put him through at once he said to the boy Hullo he cried into the telephone after a few moments A voice in the instrument replied Hullo be blowed What do you want This is Molloy said Sir James I know it is the voice said This is Trent He is in the middle of painting a picture and he has been interrupted at a critical moment Well I hope it s something important that s all Trent said Sir James impressively it is important I want you to do some work for us Some play you mean replied the voice Believe me I don t want a holiday The working fit is very strong I am doing some really decent things Why can t you leave a man alone Something very serious has happened What Sigsbee Manderson has been murdered shot through the brain and they don t know who has done it They found the body this morning It happened at his place near Bishopsbridge Sir James proceeded to tell his hearer briefly and clearly the facts that he had communicated to mister Figgis What do you think of it he ended A considering grunt was the only answer Come now urged Sir James Tempter You will go down There was a brief pause Are you there said Sir James Look here Molloy the voice broke out querulously the thing may be a case for me or it may not We can t possibly tell It may be a mystery it may be as simple as bread and cheese The body not being robbed looks interesting but he may have been outed by some wretched tramp whom he found sleeping in the grounds and tried to kick out It s the sort of thing he would do Such a murderer might easily have sense enough to know that to leave the money and valuables was the safest thing I tell you frankly I wouldn t have a hand in hanging a poor devil who had let daylight into a man like Sig Manderson as a measure of social protest Sir James smiled at the telephone a smile of success Come my boy you re getting feeble Admit you want to go and have a look at the case You know you do If it s anything you don t want to handle you re free to drop it By the bye where are you I am blown along a wandering wind replied the voice irresolutely and hollow hollow hollow all delight Can you get here within an hour persisted Sir James I suppose I can the voice grumbled How much time have I Good man Well there s time enough that s just the worst of it I ve got to depend on our local correspondent for to night The only good train of the day went half an hour ago The next is a slow one leaving Paddington at midnight You could have the Buster if you like Sir James referred to a very fast motor car of his but you wouldn t get down in time to do anything to night And I d miss my sleep No thanks The train for me I am quite fond of railway traveling you know I have a gift for it I am the stoker and the stoked I am the song the porter sings What s that you say It doesn t matter said the voice sadly I say it continued will your people look out a hotel near the scene of action and telegraph for a room At once said Sir James Come here as soon as you can He replaced the receiver As he turned to his papers again a shrill outcry burst forth in the street below He walked to the open window A band of excited boys was rushing down the steps of the Sun building and up the narrow thoroughfare toward Fleet Street Each carried a bundle of newspapers and a large broadsheet with the simple legend MURDER OF SIGSBEE MANDERSON Sir James smiled and rattled the money in his pockets cheerfully It makes a good bill he observed to mister Silver who stood at his elbow Such was Manderson s epitaph CHAPTER II BREAKFAST At about eight o clock in the morning of the following day mister Nathaniel Burton Cupples stood on the veranda of the hotel at Marlstone He was thinking about breakfast In his case the colloquialism must be taken literally he really was thinking about breakfast as he thought about every conscious act of his life when time allowed deliberation He reflected that on the preceding day the excitement and activity following upon the discovery of the corpse had disorganized his appetite and led to his taking considerably less nourishment than usual This morning he was very hungry having already been up and about for an hour and he decided to allow himself a third piece of toast and an additional egg the rest as usual The remaining deficit must be made up at luncheon but that could be gone into later So much being determined mister Cupples applied himself to the enjoyment of the view for a few minutes before ordering his meal With a connoisseur s eye he explored the beauty of the rugged coast where a great pierced rock rose from a glassy sea and the ordered loveliness of the vast tilted levels of pasture and tillage and woodland that sloped gently up from the cliffs toward the distant moor mister Cupples delighted in landscape He was a man of middle height and spare figure nearly sixty years old by constitution rather delicate in health but wiry and active for his age A sparse and straggling beard and mustache did not conceal a thin but kindly mouth his eyes were keen and pleasant his sharp nose and narrow jaw gave him very much the air of a priest and this impression was helped by his commonplace dark clothes and soft black hat He was a man of unusually conscientious industrious and orderly mind with little imagination His father s household had been used to recruit its domestic establishment by means of advertisements in which it was truthfully described as a serious family From that fortress of gloom he had escaped with two saintly gifts somehow unspoiled an inexhaustible kindness of heart and a capacity for innocent gaiety which owed nothing to humor In an earlier day and with a clerical training he might have risen to the scarlet hat He was in fact a highly regarded member of the London Positivist Society a retired banker a widower without children His austere but not unhappy life was spent largely among books and in museums his profound and patiently accumulated knowledge of a number of curiously disconnected subjects which had stirred his interest at different times had given him a place in the quiet half lit world of professors and curators and devotees of research at their amiable unconvivial dinner parties he was most himself His favorite author was Montaigne Just as mister Cupples was finishing his meal at a little table on the veranda a big motor car turned into the drive before the hotel Who is this he inquired of the waiter Id is der manager said the young man listlessly He have been to meed a gendleman by der train The car drew up and the porter hurried from the entrance mister Cupples uttered an exclamation of pleasure as a long loosely built man much younger than himself stepped from the car and mounted the veranda flinging his hat on a chair His high boned Quixotic face wore a pleasant smile his rough tweed clothes his hair and short mustache were tolerably untidy Cupples by all that s miraculous cried the man pouncing upon mister Cupples before he could rise and seizing his outstretched hand in a hard grip My luck is serving me to day the newcomer went on spasmodically This is the second slice within an hour How are you my best of friends And why are you here Why sit saint thou by that ruined breakfast Dost thou its former pride recall or ponder how it passed away I am glad to see you I was half expecting you Trent mister Cupples replied his face wreathed in smiles You are looking splendid my dear fellow I will tell you all about it But you cannot have had your own breakfast yet Will you have it at my table here Rather said the man An enormous great breakfast too with refined conversation and tears of recognition never dry Will you get young Siegfried to lay a place for me while I go and wash I sha n t be three minutes He disappeared into the hotel and mister Cupples after a moment s thought went to the telephone in the porter s office He returned to find his friend already seated pouring out tea and showing an unaffected interest in the choice of food I expect this to be a hard day for me he said with the curious jerky utterance which seemed to be his habit I sha n t eat again till the evening very likely You guess why I m here don t you Undoubtedly said mister Cupples You have come down to write about the murder That is rather a colorless way of stating it Trent replied as he dissected a sole I should prefer to put it that I have come down in the character of avenger of blood to hunt down the guilty and vindicate the honor of society That is my line of business Families waited on at their private residences I say Cupples I have made a good beginning already Wait a bit and I ll tell you There was a silence during which the newcomer ate swiftly and abstractedly while mister Cupples looked on happily Your manager here said the tall man at last is a fellow of remarkable judgment He is an admirer of mine He knows more about my best cases than I do myself The Record wired last night to say I was coming and when I got out of the train at seven o clock this morning there he was waiting for me with a motor car the size of a haystack He is beside himself with joy at having me here It is fame He drank a cup of tea and continued Almost his first words were to ask me if I would like to see the body of the murdered man if so he thought he could manage it for me He is as keen as a razor The body lies in doctor Stock s surgery you know down in the village exactly as it was when found It s to be post mortem d this morning by the way so I was only just in time Well he ran me down here to the doctor s giving me full particulars about the case all the way I was pretty well au fait by the time we arrived I suppose the manager of a place like this has some sort of a pull with the doctor Anyhow he made no difficulties nor did the constable on duty though he was careful to insist on my not giving him away in the paper I saw the body before it was removed remarked mister Cupples I should not have said there was anything remarkable about it except that the shot in the eye had scarcely disfigured the face at all and caused scarcely any effusion of blood apparently The wrists were scratched and bruised I expect that with your trained faculties you were able to remark other details of a suggestive nature Other details certainly but I don t know that they suggest anything They are merely odd Take the wrists for instance How is it you could see bruises and scratches on them I dare say you saw something of Manderson down here before the murder Certainly mister Cupples said Well did you ever see his wrists mister Cupples reflected No Now you raise the point I am reminded that when I interviewed Manderson here he was wearing stiff cuffs coming well down over his hands He always did said Trent My friend the manager says so I pointed out to him the fact you didn t observe that there were no cuffs visible and that they had indeed been dragged up inside the coat sleeves as yours would be if you hurried into a coat without pulling your cuffs down That was why you saw his wrists Well I call that suggestive observed mister Cupples mildly You might infer perhaps that when he got up he hurried over his dressing Yes but did he The manager said just what you say He was always a bit of a swell in his dress he told me and he drew the inference that when Manderson got up in that mysterious way before the house was stirring and went out into the grounds he was in a great hurry Look at his shoes he said to me mister Manderson was always specially neat about his foot wear But those shoe laces were tied in a hurry I agreed And he left his false teeth in his room said the manager Doesn t that prove he was flustered and hurried I allowed that it looked like it But I said Look here if he was so very much pressed why did he part his hair so carefully That parting is a work of art Why did he put on so much for he had on a complete out fit of underclothing studs in his shirt sock suspenders a watch and chain money and keys and things in his pockets That s what I said to the manager He couldn t find an explanation Can you mister Cupples considered Those facts might suggest that he was hurried only at the end of his dressing Coat and shoes would come last But not false teeth You ask anybody who wears them And besides I m told he hadn t washed at all on getting up which in a neat man looks like his being in a violent hurry from the beginning And here s another thing One of his waistcoat pockets was lined with wash leather for the reception of his gold watch But he had put his watch into the pocket on the other side Anybody who has settled habits can see how odd that is The fact is there are signs of great agitation and haste and there are signs of exactly the opposite For the present I am not guessing I must reconnoiter the ground first if I can manage to get the right side of the people of the house Trent applied himself again to his breakfast mister Cupples smiled at him benevolently That is precisely the point he said on which I can be of some assistance to you Trent glanced up in surprise I told you I half expected you I will explain the situation missus Manderson who is my niece What Trent laid down his knife and fork Cupples you are jesting with me I am perfectly serious Trent really returned mister Cupples earnestly Her father John Peter Domecq was my wife s brother I never mentioned my niece or her marriage to you before I suppose To tell the truth it has always been a painful subject to me and I have avoided discussing it with anybody To return to what I was about to say last night when I was over at the house by the way you can see it from here You passed it in the car He indicated a red roof among poplars some three hundred yards away the only building in sight that stood separate from the tiny village in the gap below them Certainly I did said Trent The manager told me all about it among other things as he drove me in from Bishopsbridge Other people here have heard of you and your performances mister Cupples went on As I was saying when I was over there last night mister Bunner who is one of Manderson s two secretaries expressed a hope that the Record would send you down to deal with the case as the police seemed quite at a loss He mentioned one or two of your past successes and Mabel my niece was interested when I told her afterwards She is bearing up wonderfully well Trent she has remarkable fortitude of character She said she remembered reading your articles about the Abinger case She has a great horror of the newspaper side of this sad business and she had entreated me to do anything I could to keep journalists away from the place I m sure you can understand her feeling Trent it isn t really any reflection on that profession But she said you appeared to have great powers as a detective and she would not stand in the way of anything that might clear up the crime Then I told her you were a personal friend of mine and gave you a good character for tact and consideration of others feelings and it ended in her saying that if you should come she would like you to be helped in every way Trent leaned across the table and shook mister Cupples by the hand in silence mister Cupples much delighted with the way things were turning out resumed I spoke to my niece on the telephone only just now and she is glad you are here She asks me to say that you may make any inquiries you like and she puts the house and grounds at your disposal She had rather not see you herself she is keeping to her own sitting room She has already been interviewed by a detective officer who is there and feels unequal to any more She adds that she does not believe she could say anything that would be of the smallest use The two secretaries and Martin the butler who is a most intelligent man could tell you all you want to know she thinks Trent finished his breakfast with a thoughtful brow He filled a pipe slowly and seated himself on the rail of the veranda Cupples he said quietly is there anything about this business that you know and would rather not tell me mister Cupples gave a slight start and turned an astonished gaze on the questioner What do you mean he said I mean about the Mandersons Look here shall I tell you a thing that strikes me about this affair at the very beginning Here s a man suddenly and violently killed and nobody s heart seems to be broken about it to say the least The manager of this hotel spoke to me about him as coolly as if he d never set eyes on him though I understand they ve been neighbors every summer for some years Then you talk about the thing in the coldest of blood And missus Manderson well you won t mind my saying that I have heard of women being more cut up about their husbands being murdered than she seems to be Is there something in this Cupples or is it my fancy Was there something queer about Manderson I traveled on the same boat with him once but never spoke to him I only know his public character which was repulsive enough You see this may have a bearing on the case that s the only reason why I ask mister Cupples took time for thought He fingered his sparse beard and looked out over the sea At last he turned to Trent I see no reason he said why I shouldn t tell you as between ourselves my dear fellow I need not say that this must not be referred to however distantly The truth is that nobody really liked Manderson and I think those who were nearest to him liked him least Why the other interjected Most people found a difficulty in explaining why In trying to account to myself for my own sensations I could only put it that one felt in the man a complete absence of the sympathetic faculty There was nothing outwardly repellent about him He was not ill mannered or vicious or dull indeed he could be remarkably interesting But I received the impression that there could be no human creature whom he would not sacrifice in the pursuit of his schemes in his task of imposing himself and his will upon the world Perhaps that was fanciful but I think not altogether so However the point is that Mabel I am sorry to say was very unhappy I am nearly twice your age my dear boy though you always so kindly try to make me feel as if we were contemporaries I am getting to be an old man and a great many people have been good enough to confide their matrimonial troubles to me but I never knew another case like my niece s and her husband s I have known her since she was a baby Trent and I know you understand I think that I do not employ that word lightly I know that she is as amiable and honorable a woman to say nothing of her other good gifts as any man could wish But Manderson for some time past had made her miserable What did he do asked Trent as mister Cupples paused When I put that question to Mabel her words were that he seemed to nurse a perpetual grievance He maintained a distance between them and he would say nothing I don t know how it began or what was behind it and all she would tell me on that point was that he had no cause in the world for his attitude I think she knew what was in his mind whatever it was but she is full of pride This seems to have gone on for months At last a week ago she wrote to me I am the only near relative she has Her mother died when she was a child and after John Peter died I was something like a father to her until she married that was five years ago She asked me to come and help her and I came at once That is why I am here now mister Cupples paused and drank some tea Trent smoked and stared out at the hot June landscape I would not go to White Gables mister Cupples resumed You know my views I think upon the economic constitution of society and the proper relationship of the capitalist to the employee and you know no doubt what use that person made of his vast economic power upon several very notorious occasions I refer especially to the trouble in the Pennsylvania coal fields three years ago I regarded him apart from all personal dislike in the light of a criminal and a disgrace to society I came to this hotel and I saw my niece here She told me what I have more briefly told you She said that the worry and the humiliation of it and the strain of trying to keep up appearances before the world were telling upon her and she asked for my advice I said I thought she should face him and demand an explanation of his way of treating her But she would not do that She had always taken the line of affecting not to notice the change in his demeanor and nothing I knew would persuade her to admit to him that she was injured once pride had led her into that course Life is quite full my dear Trent said mister Cupples with a sigh of these obstinate silences and cultivated misunderstandings Did she love him Trent inquired abruptly mister Cupples did not reply at once Had she any love left for him Trent amended mister Cupples played with his teaspoon I am bound to say he answered slowly that I think not But you must not misunderstand the woman Trent No power on earth would have persuaded her to admit that to any one even to herself perhaps so long as she considered herself bound to him And I gather that apart from this mysterious sulking of late he had always been considerate and generous You were saying that she refused to have it out with him She did replied mister Cupples And I knew by experience that it was quite useless to attempt to move a Domecq where the sense of dignity was involved So I thought it over carefully and next day I watched my opportunity and met Manderson as he passed by this hotel I asked him to favor me with a few minutes conversation and he stepped inside the gate down there We had held no communication of any kind since my niece s marriage but he remembered me of course I put the matter to him at once and quite definitely I told him what Mabel had confided to me I said that I would neither approve nor condemn her action in bringing me into the business but that she was suffering and I considered it my right to ask how he could justify himself in placing her in such a position And how did he take that said Trent smiling secretly at the landscape The picture of this mildest of men calling the formidable Manderson to account pleased him Not very well mister Cupples replied sadly In fact far from well I can tell you almost exactly what he said it wasn t much He said See here Cupples you don t want to butt in My wife can look after herself I ve found that out along with other things He was perfectly quiet you know he was said never to lose control of himself though there was a light in his eyes that would have frightened a man who was in the wrong I dare say But I had been thoroughly roused by his last remark and the tone of it which I cannot reproduce You see said mister Cupples simply I love my niece She is the only child that there has been in our in my house Moreover my wife brought her up as a girl and any reflection on Mabel I could not help feeling in the heat of the moment as an indirect reflection upon one who is gone You turned upon him suggested Trent in a low tone You asked him to explain his words That is precisely what I did said mister Cupples For a moment he only stared at me and I could see a vein on his forehead swelling an unpleasant sight Then he said quite quietly This thing has gone far enough I guess and turned to go Did he mean your interview Trent asked thoughtfully From the words alone you would think so mister Cupples answered But the way in which he uttered them gave me a strange and very apprehensive feeling I received the impression that the man had formed some sinister resolve But I regret to say I had lost the power of dispassionate thought I fell into a great rage mister Cupples tone was mildly apologetic and said a number of foolish things I reminded him that the law allowed a measure of freedom to wives who received intolerable treatment I made some utterly irrelevant references to his public record and expressed the view that such men as he were unfit to live I said these things and others as ill considered under the eyes and very possibly within earshot of half a dozen persons sitting on this veranda I noticed them in spite of my agitation looking at me as I walked up to the hotel again after relieving my mind for it undoubtedly did relieve it sighed mister Cupples lying back in his chair And Manderson Did he say no more Not a word He listened to me with his eyes on my face as quiet as before When I stopped he smiled very slightly and at once turned away and strolled through the gate making for White Gables And this happened On the Sunday morning Then I suppose you never saw him alive again No said mister Cupples Or rather yes once It was later in the day on the golf course But I did not speak to him And next morning he was found dead The two regarded each other in silence for a few moments A party of guests who had been bathing came up the steps and seated themselves with much chattering at a table near them The waiter approached mister Cupples rose and taking Trent s arm led him to a long tennis lawn at the side of the hotel I have a reason for telling you all this began mister Cupples as they paced slowly up and down Trust you for that rejoined Trent carefully filling his pipe again He lit it smoked a little and then said I ll try and guess what your reason is if you like mister Cupples face of solemnity relaxed into a slight smile He said nothing You thought it possible said Trent meditatively may I say you thought it practically certain that I should find out for myself that there had been something deeper than a mere conjugal tiff between the Mandersons You thought that my unwholesome imagination would begin at once to play with the idea of missus Manderson having something to do with the crime Rather than that I should lose myself in barren speculations about this you decided to tell me exactly how matters stood and incidentally to impress upon me who know how excellent your judgment is your opinion of your niece Is that about right It is perfectly right Listen to me my dear fellow said mister Cupples earnestly laying his hand on the other s arm I am going to be very frank I am extremely glad that Manderson is dead I believe him to have done nothing but harm in the world as an economic factor I know that he was making a desert of the life of one who was like my own child to me But I am under an intolerable dread of Mabel being involved in suspicion with regard to the murder It is horrible to me to think of her delicacy and goodness being in contact if only for a time with the brutalities of the law She is not fitted for it It would mark her deeply Many young women of twenty five in these days could face such an ordeal I suppose I have observed a sort of imitative hardness about the products of the higher education of women to day which would carry them through anything perhaps I am not prepared to say it is a bad thing in the conditions of feminine life prevailing at present Mabel however is not like that She is as unlike that as she is unlike the simpering misses that used to surround me as a child She has plenty of brains she is full of character her mind and her tastes are cultivated but it is all mixed up mister Cupples waved his hands in a vague gesture with ideals of refinement and reservation and womanly mystery I fear she is not a child of the age You never knew my wife Trent Mabel is my wife s child The younger man bowed his head They paced the length of the lawn before he asked gently Why did she marry him I don t know said mister Cupples briefly Admired him I suppose suggested Trent mister Cupples shrugged his shoulders I have been told that a woman will usually be more or less attracted by the most successful man in her circle Of course we cannot realize how a wilful dominating personality like his would influence a girl whose affections were not bestowed elsewhere especially if he laid himself out to win her It is probably an overwhelming thing to be courted by a man whose name is known all over the world She had heard of him of course as a financial great power and she had no idea she had lived mostly among people of artistic or literary propensities how much soulless inhumanity that might involve For all I know she has no adequate idea of it to this day When I first heard of the affair the mischief was done and I knew better than to interpose my unsought opinions She was of age and there was absolutely nothing against him from the conventional point of view Then I dare say his immense wealth would cast a spell over almost any woman Mabel had some hundreds a year of her own just enough perhaps to let her realize what millions really meant But all this is conjecture She certainly had not wanted to marry some scores of young fellows who to my knowledge had asked her and though I don t believe and never did believe that she really loved this man of forty five she certainly did want to marry him But if you ask me why I can only say I don t know Trent nodded and after a few more paces looked at his watch You ve interested me so much he said that I had quite forgotten my main business I mustn t waste my morning I am going down the road to White Gables at once and I dare say I shall be poking about there until mid day If you can meet me then Cupples I should like to talk over anything I find out with you unless something detains me I am going for a walk this morning mister Cupples replied I meant to have luncheon at a little inn near the golf course the Three Tuns You had better join me there It s further along the road about a quarter of a mile beyond White Gables You can just see the roof between those two trees The food they give one there is very plain but good So long as they have a cask of beer said Trent they are all right We will have bread and cheese and oh may Heaven our simple lives prevent from luxury s contagion weak and vile Till then good by He strode off to recover his hat from the veranda waved it to mister Cupples and was gone The old gentleman seating himself in a deck chair on the lawn clasped his hands behind his head and gazed up into the speckless blue sky He is a dear fellow he murmured The best of fellows And a terribly acute fellow Dear me How curious it all is CHAPTER III HANDCUFFS IN THE AIR A painter and the son of a painter Philip Trent had while yet in his twenties achieved some reputation within the world of English art Moreover his pictures sold An original forcible talent and a habit of leisurely but continuous working broken by fits of strong creative enthusiasm were at the bottom of it His father s name had helped a patrimony large enough to relieve him of the perilous imputation of being a struggling man had certainly not hindered But his best aid to success had been an unconscious power of getting himself liked Good spirits and a lively humorous fancy will always be popular Trent joined to these a genuine interest in others that gained him something deeper than popularity His judgment of persons was penetrating but its process was internal no one felt on good behavior with a man who seemed always to be enjoying himself Whether he was in a mood for floods of nonsense or applying himself vigorously to a task his face seldom lost its expression of contained vivacity Apart from a sound knowledge of his art and its history his culture was large and loose dominated by a love of poetry At thirty two he had not yet passed the age of laughter and adventure His rise to a celebrity a hundred times greater than his proper work had won for him came of a momentary impulse One day he had taken up a newspaper to find it chiefly concerned with a crime of a sort curiously rare in our country a murder done in a railway train The circumstances were puzzling two persons were under arrest upon suspicion Trent to whom an interest in such affairs was a new sensation heard the thing discussed among his friends and set himself in a purposeless mood to read up the accounts given in several journals He became intrigued his imagination began to work in a manner strange to him upon facts an excitement took hold of him such as he had only known before in his bursts of art inspiration or of personal adventure At the end of the day he wrote and despatched a long letter to the editor of the Record which he chose only because it had contained the fullest and most intelligent version of the facts In this letter he did very much what Poe had done in the case of the murder of Mary Rogers With nothing but the newspapers to guide him he drew attention to the significance of certain apparently negligible facts and ranged the evidence in such a manner as to throw grave suspicion upon a man who had presented himself as a witness Sir James Molloy had printed this letter in leaded type The same evening he was able to announce in the Sun the arrest and full confession of the incriminated man Sir James who knew all the worlds of London had lost no time in making Trent s acquaintance The two men got on well for Trent possessed some secret of native tact which had the effect of almost abolishing differences of age between himself and others The great rotary presses in the basement of the Record building had filled him with a new enthusiasm he had painted there and Sir James had bought at sight what he called a machinery scape in the manner of Heinrich Kley Then a few months later came the affair known as the Ilkley mystery Sir James had invited Trent to an emollient dinner and thereafter offered him what seemed to the young man a fantastically large sum for his temporary services as special representative of the Record at Ilkley You could do it the editor had urged You can write good stuff and you know how to talk to people and I can teach you all the technicalities of a reporter s job in half an hour And you have a head for a mystery you have imagination and cool judgment along with it Think how it would feel if you pulled it off Trent had admitted that it would be rather a lark he had smoked frowned and at last convinced himself that the only thing that held him back was fear of an unfamiliar task To react against fear had become a fixed moral habit with him and he had accepted Sir James s offer He had pulled it off For the second time he had given the authorities a start and a beating and his name was on all tongues He withdrew and painted pictures He felt no leaning towards journalism and Sir James who knew a good deal about art honorably refrained as other editors did not from tempting him with a good salary But in the course of a few years he had applied to him perhaps thirty times for his services in the unraveling of similar problems at home and abroad Sometimes Trent busy with work that held him had refused sometimes he had been forestalled in the discovery of the truth But the result of his irregular connection with the Record had been to make his name one of the best known in England It was characteristic of him that his name was almost the only detail of his personality known to the public He had imposed absolute silence about himself upon the Molloy papers and the others were not going to advertise one of Sir James s men The Manderson case he told himself as he walked rapidly up the sloping road to White Gables might turn out to be terribly simple Cupples was a wise old boy but it was probably impossible for him to have an impartial opinion about his niece Yet it was true that the manager of the hotel who had spoken of her beauty in terms that aroused his attention had spoken even more emphatically of her goodness Not an artist in words the manager had yet conveyed a very definite idea to Trent s mind There isn t a child about here that don t brighten up at the sound of her voice he had said nor yet a grown up for the matter of that Everybody used to look forward to her coming over in the summer I don t mean that she s one of those women that are all kind heart and nothing else There s backbone with it if you know what I mean pluck any amount of go There s nobody in Marlstone that isn t sorry for the lady in her trouble not but what some of us may think she s lucky at the last of it Trent wanted very much to meet missus Manderson He could see now beyond a spacious lawn and shrubbery the front of the two storied house of dull red brick with the pair of great gables from which it had its name He had had but a glimpse of it from the car that morning A modern house he saw perhaps ten years old The place was beautifully kept with that air of opulent peace that clothes even the smallest houses of the well to do in an English country side Before it beyond the road the rich meadow land ran down to the edge of the cliffs behind it a woody landscape stretched away across a broad vale to the moors That such a place could be the scene of a crime of violence seemed fantastic it lay so quiet and well ordered so eloquent of disciplined service and gentle living Yet there beyond the house and near the hedge that rose between the garden and the hot white road stood the gardener s tool shed by which the body had been found lying tumbled against the wooden wall Trent walked past the gate of the drive and along the road until he was opposite this shed Some forty yards further along the road turned sharply away from the house to run between thick plantations and just before this turn the grounds of the house ended with a small white gate at the angle of the boundary hedge He approached this gate which was plainly for the use of gardeners and the service of the establishment it swung easily on its hinges and he passed slowly up a path that led towards the back of the house between the outer hedge and a tall wall of rhododendrons Through a gap in this wall a track led him to the little neatly built erection of wood which stood among trees that faced a corner of the front The body had lain on the side away from the house a servant he thought looking out of the nearer windows in the earlier hours of the day before might have glanced unseeing at the hut as she wondered what it could be like to be as rich as Manderson He examined the place carefully and ransacked the hut within but he could note no more than the trodden appearance of the uncut grass where the body had lain Crouching low with keen eyes and feeling fingers he searched the ground minutely over a wide area but the search was fruitless It was interrupted by the sound the first he had heard from the house of the closing of the front door Trent unbent his long legs and stepped to the edge of the drive A man was walking quickly away from the house in the direction of the great gate At the noise of a footstep on the gravel the man wheeled with nervous swiftness and looked earnestly at Trent The sudden sight of his face was almost terrible so white and worn it was Yet it was a young man s face There was not a wrinkle about the haggard blue eyes for all their tale of strain and desperate fatigue As the two approached each other Trent noted with admiration the man s breadth of shoulder and lithe strong figure In his carriage inelastic as weariness had made it in his handsome regular features in his short smooth yellow hair and in his voice as he addressed Trent the influence of a special sort of training was confessed Oxford was your playground I think my young friend said Trent to himself If you are mister Trent said the young man pleasantly you are expected mister Cupples phoned from the hotel My name is Marlowe You were secretary to mister Manderson I believe said Trent He was much inclined to like young mister Marlowe Though he seemed so near a physical break down he gave out none the less that air of clean living and inward health that is the peculiar glory of his social type at his years But there was something in the tired eyes that was a challenge to Trent s penetration an habitual expression as he took it to be of meditating and weighing things not present to their sight It was a look too intelligent too steady and purposeful to be called dreamy Trent thought he had seen such a look before somewhere He went on to say It is a terrible business for all of you I fear it has upset you completely mister Marlowe A little limp that s all replied the young man wearily I was driving the car all Sunday night and most of yesterday and I didn t sleep last night after hearing the news who would But I have an appointment now mister Trent down at the doctor s arranging about the inquest I expect it ll be to morrow If you will go up to the house and ask for mister Bunner you ll find him expecting you he will tell you all about things and show you round He s the other secretary an American and the best of fellows he ll look after you There s a detective here by the way Inspector Murch from Scotland Yard He came yesterday Murch Trent exclaimed But he and I are old friends How under the sun did he get here so soon I have no idea mister Marlowe answered But he was here last evening before I got back from Southampton interviewing everybody and he s been about here since eight this morning He s in the library now that s where the open French window is that you see at the end of the house there Perhaps you would like to step down there and talk about things I think I will said Trent mister Marlowe nodded and went on his way The thick turf of the lawn round which the drive took its circular sweep made Trent s footsteps as noiseless as a cat s In a few moments he was looking in through the open leaves of the window at the southward end of the house considering with a smile a very broad back and a bent head covered with short grizzled hair The man within was stooping over a number of papers laid out on the table Twas ever thus said Trent in a melancholy tone at the first sound of which the man within turned round with startling swiftness From childhood s hour I ve seen my fondest hopes decay I did think I was ahead of Scotland Yard this time and now here is the largest officer in the entire Metropolitan force already occupying the position The detective smiled grimly and came to the window I was expecting you mister Trent he said This is the sort of case that you like Since my tastes were being considered Trent replied stepping into the room I wish they had followed up the idea by keeping my hated rival out of the business You have got a long start too I know all about it His eyes began to wander round the room How did you manage it You are a quick mover I know the dun deer s hide on fleeter foot was never tied but I don t see how you got here in time to be at work yesterday evening Has Scotland Yard secretly started an aviation corps Or is it in league with the infernal powers In either case the Home Secretary should be called upon to make a statement It s simpler than that said mister Murch with professional stolidity I happened to be on leave with the Missus at Halvey which is only twelve mile or so along the coast As soon as our people there heard of the murder they told me I wired to the Chief and was put in charge of the case at once I bicycled over yesterday evening and have been at it since then Arising out of that reply said Trent inattentively how is missus Inspector Murch Never better thank you answered the inspector and frequently speaks of you and the games you used to have with our kids But you ll excuse me saying mister Trent that you needn t trouble to talk your nonsense to me while you re using your eyes I know your ways by now I understand you ve fallen on your feet as usual and have the lady s permission to go over the place and make inquiries Such is the fact said Trent I am going to cut you out again Inspector I owe you one for beating me over the Abinger case you old fox But if you really mean that you re not inclined for the social amenities just now let us leave compliments and talk business He stepped to the table glanced through the papers arranged there in order and then turned to the open roll top desk He looked into the drawers swiftly I see this has been cleared out Well now inspector I suppose we play the game as before Trent had found himself on several occasions in the past thrown into the company of Inspector Murch who stood high in the councils of the Criminal Investigation Department He was a quiet tactful and very shrewd officer a man of great courage with a vivid history in connection with the more dangerous class of criminals His humanity was as broad as his frame which was large even for a policeman Trent and he through some obscure working of sympathy had appreciated one another from the beginning and had formed one of those curious friendships with which it was the younger man s delight to adorn his experience The inspector would talk more freely to him than to any one under the rose and they would discuss details and possibilities of every case to their mutual enlightenment There were necessarily rules and limits It was understood between them that Trent made no journalistic use of any point that could only have come to him from an official source Each of them moreover for the honor and prestige of the institution he represented openly reserved the right to withhold from the other any discovery or inspiration that might come to him which he considered vital to the solution of the difficulty Trent had insisted on carefully formulating these principles of what he called detective sportsmanship mister Murch who loved a contest and who only stood to gain by his association with the keen intelligence of the other entered very heartily into the game In these strivings for the credit of the press and of the police victory sometimes attended the experience and method of the officer sometimes the quicker brain and livelier imagination of Trent his gift of instinctively recognizing the significant through all disguises The inspector then replied to Trent s last words with cordial agreement Leaning on either side of the French window with the deep peace and hazy splendor of the summer landscape before them they reviewed the case Trent had taken out a thin notebook and as they talked he began to make with light sure touches a rough sketch plan of the room It was a thing he did habitually on such occasions and often quite idly but now and then the habit had served him to good purpose This was a large light apartment at the corner of the house with generous window space in two walls A broad table stood in the middle As one entered by the window the roll top desk stood just to the left of it against the wall The inner door was in the wall to the left at the farther end of the room and was faced by a broad window divided into openings of the casement type A beautifully carved old corner cupboard rose high against the wall beyond the door and another cupboard filled a recess beside the fireplace Some colored prints of Harunobu with which Trent promised himself a better acquaintance hung on what little wall space was unoccupied by books These had a very uninspiring appearance of having been bought by the yard and never taken from their shelves Bound with a sober luxury the great English novelists essayists historians and poets stood ranged like an army struck dead in its ranks There were a few chairs made like the cupboard and table of old carved oak a modern arm chair and a swivel office chair before the desk The room looked costly but very bare Almost the only portable objects were a great porcelain bowl of a wonderful blue on the table a clock and some cigar boxes on the mantel shelf and a movable telephone standard on the top of the desk Seen the body inquired the inspector Trent nodded And the place where it lay he said First impressions of this case rather puzzle me said the inspector From what I heard at Halvey I guessed it might be common robbery and murder by some tramp though such a thing is very far from common in these parts But as soon as I began my inquiries I came on some curious points which by this time I dare say you ve noted for yourself The man is shot in his own grounds quite near the house to begin with Yet there s not the slightest trace of any attempt at burglary And the body wasn t robbed In fact it would be as plain a case of suicide as you could wish to see if it wasn t for certain facts Here s another thing for a month or so past they tell me Manderson had been in a queer state of mind I expect you know already that he and his wife had some trouble between them The servants had noticed a change in his manner to her for a long time and for the past week he had scarcely spoken to her They say he was a changed man moody and silent whether on account of that or something else The lady s maid says he looked as if something was going to arrive It s always easy to remember that people looked like that after something has happened to them Still that s what they say There you are again then suicide Now why wasn t it suicide mister Trent The facts so far as I know them are really all against it Trent replied sitting on the threshold of the window and clasping his knees First of course no weapon is to be found I ve searched and you ve searched and there s no trace of any firearm anywhere within a stone s throw of where the body lay Second the marks on the wrists flesh scratches and bruises which we can only assume to have been done in a struggle with somebody Third who ever heard of anybody shooting himself in the eye Then I heard from the manager of the hotel here another fact which strikes me as the most curious detail in this affair Manderson had dressed himself fully before going out there but he forgot his false teeth Now how could a suicide who dressed himself to make a decent appearance as a corpse forget his teeth That last argument hadn t struck me admitted mister Murch There s something in it But on the strength of the other points which had occurred to me I am not considering suicide I have been looking about for ideas in this house this morning I expect you were thinking of doing the same That is so It is a case for ideas it seems to me Come Murch let us make an effort let us bend our spirits to a temper of general suspicion Let us suspect everybody in the house to begin with Listen I will tell you whom I suspect I suspect missus Manderson of course I also suspect both the secretaries I hear there are two and I hardly know which of them I regard as more thoroughly open to suspicion I suspect the butler and the lady s maid I suspect the other domestics and especially do I suspect the boot boy By the way what domestics are there I have more than enough suspicion to go round whatever the size of the establishment but as a matter of curiosity I should like to know All very well to laugh replied the inspector but at the first stage of affairs it s the only safe principle and you know that as well as I do mister Trent However I ve seen enough of the people here last night and to day to put a few of them out of my mind for the present at least You will form your own conclusions As for the establishment there s the butler and lady s maid cook and three other maids one a young girl One chauffeur who s away with a broken wrist No boy What about the gardener You say nothing about that shadowy and sinister figure the gardener You are keeping him in the background Murch Out with him The garden is attended to by a man in the village who comes twice a week I ve talked to him He was here last on Friday Then I suspect him all the more said Trent And now as to the house itself What I propose to do to begin with is to sniff about a little in this room where I am told Manderson spent a great deal of his time and in his bedroom especially the bedroom But since we re in this room let s start here You seem to be at the same stage of the inquiry Perhaps you ve done the bedroom already The inspector nodded I ve been through Manderson s and his wife s Nothing to be got there I think Very simple and bare no signs of any sort that I could see Seems to have insisted on the simple life does Manderson Never employed a valet The room s almost like a cell except for the clothes and shoes You ll find it all exactly as I found it and they tell me that s exactly as Manderson left it at we don t know what o clock yesterday morning Opens into missus Manderson s bedroom not much of the cell about that I can tell you I should say the lady was as fond of pretty things as most But she cleared out of it on the morning of the discovery told the maid she could never sleep in a room opening into her murdered husband s room Very natural feeling in a woman mister Trent She s camping out so to say in one of the spare bedrooms now Come my friend Trent was saying to himself as he made a few notes in his little book Have you got your eye on missus Manderson Or haven t you I know that colorless tone of the inspectorial voice I wish I had seen her Either you ve got something against her and you don t want me to get hold of it or else you ve made up your mind she s innocent but have no objection to my wasting my time over her Well it s all in the game which begins to look extremely interesting as we go on To mister Murch he said aloud Well I ll draw the bedroom later on What about this They call it the library said the inspector Manderson used to do his writing and that in here passed most of the time he spent indoors here Since he and his wife ceased to hit it off together he had taken to spending his evenings alone and when at this house he always spent em in here He was last seen alive as far as the servants are concerned in this room Trent rose and glanced again through the papers set out on the table Business letters and documents mostly said mister Murch Reports prospectuses and that A few letters on private matters nothing in them that I can see The American secretary Bunner his name is and a queerer card I never saw turned he s been through this desk with me this morning He had got it into his head that Manderson had been receiving threatening letters and that the murder was the outcome of that But there s no trace of any such thing and we looked at every blessed paper The only unusual things we found were some packets of bank notes to a very considerable amount and a couple of little bags of unset diamonds I asked mister Bunner to put them in a safer place It appears that Manderson had begun buying diamonds lately as a speculation it was a new game to him the secretary said and it seemed to amuse him What about these secretaries Trent inquired I met one called Marlowe just now outside a nice looking chap with singular eyes unquestionably English The other it seems is an American What did Manderson want with an English secretary mister Marlowe explained to me how that was The American was his right hand business man one of his office staff who never left him mister Marlowe had nothing to do with Manderson s business as a financier knew nothing of it His job was to look after Manderson s horses and motors and yacht and sporting arrangements and that make himself generally useful as you might say He had the spending of a lot of money I should think The other was confined entirely to the office affairs and I dare say he had his hands full As for his being English it was just a fad of Manderson s to have an English secretary He d had several before mister Marlowe He showed his taste observed Trent It might be more than interesting don t you think to be minister to the pleasures of a modern plutocrat with a large P Only they say that Manderson s were exclusively of an innocent kind Certainly Marlowe gives me the impression that he would be weak in the part of Petronius But to return to the matter in hand He looked at his notes You said just now that he was last seen alive here so far as the servants were concerned That meant He had a conversation with his wife on going to bed But for that the man servant Martin by name last saw him in this room I had his story last night and very glad he was to tell it An affair like this is meat and drink to the servants of the house Trent considered for some moments gazing through the open window over the sun flooded slopes Would it bore you to hear what he has to say again he asked at length For reply mister Murch rang the bell A spare clean shaven middle aged man having the servant s manner in its most distinguished form answered it This is mister Trent who is authorized by missus Manderson to go over the house and make inquiries explained the detective He would like to hear your story Martin bowed distantly He recognized Trent for a gentleman Time would show whether he was what Martin called a gentleman in every sense of the word I observed you approaching the house sir said Martin with impassive courtesy He spoke with a slow and measured utterance My instructions are to assist you in every possible way Should you wish me to recall the circumstances of Sunday night Please said Trent with ponderous gravity Martin s style was making clamorous appeal to his sense of comedy He banished with an effort all vivacity of expression from his face I last saw mister Manderson No not that yet Trent checked him quietly Tell me all you saw of him that evening after dinner say Try to recollect every little detail After dinner sir yes I remember that after dinner mister Manderson and mister Marlowe walked up and down the path through the orchard talking If you ask me for details it struck me they were talking about something important because I heard mister Manderson say something when they came in through the back entrance He said as near as I can remember If Harris is there every minute is of importance You want to start right away And not a word to a soul mister Marlowe answered Very well I will just change out of these clothes and then I m ready or words to that effect I heard this plainly as they passed the window of my pantry Then mister Marlowe went up to his bedroom and mister Manderson entered the library and rang for me He handed me some letters for the postman in the morning and directed me to sit up as mister Marlowe had persuaded him to go for a drive in the car by moonlight That was curious remarked Trent I thought so sir But I recollected what I had heard about not a word to a soul and I concluded that this about a moonlight drive was intended to mislead What time was this It would be about ten sir I should say After speaking to me mister Manderson waited until mister Marlowe had come down and brought round the car He then went into the drawing room where missus Manderson was Did that strike you as curious Martin looked down his nose If you ask me the question sir he said with reserve I had not known him enter that room since we came here this year He preferred to sit in the library in the evenings That evening he only remained with missus Manderson for a few minutes Then he and mister Marlowe started immediately You saw them start Yes sir They took the direction of Bishopsbridge And you saw mister Manderson again later After an hour or thereabouts sir in the library That would have been about a quarter past eleven I should say I had noticed eleven striking from the church I may say I am peculiarly quick of hearing sir mister Manderson had rung the bell for you I suppose Yes And what passed when you answered it mister Manderson had put out the decanter of whisky and a syphon and glass sir from the cupboard where he kept them Trent held up his hand While we are on that point Martin I want to ask you plainly did mister Manderson drink very much You understand this is not impertinent curiosity on my part I want you to tell me because it may possibly help in the clearing up of this case Perfectly sir replied Martin gravely I have no hesitation in telling you what I have already told the inspector mister Manderson was considering his position in life a remarkably abstemious man In my four years of service with him I never knew anything of an alcoholic nature pass his lips except a glass or two of wine at dinner very rarely a little at luncheon and from time to time a whisky and soda before going to bed He never seemed to form a habit of it Often I used to find his glass in the morning with only a little soda water in it sometimes he would have been having whisky with it but never much He never was particular about his drinks ordinary soda was what he preferred though I had ventured to suggest some of the natural minerals having personally acquired a taste for them in my previous service He used to keep them in the cupboard here because he had a great dislike of being waited on more than was necessary It was an understood thing that I never came near him after dinner unless sent for And when he sent for anything he liked it brought quick and to be left alone again at once He hated to be asked if he required anything more Amazingly simple in his tastes sir mister Manderson was Very well and he rang for you that night about a quarter past eleven Now can you remember exactly what he said I think I can tell you with some approach to accuracy sir It was not much First he asked me if mister Bunner had gone to bed and I replied that he had been gone up some time He then said that he wanted someone to sit up until twelve thirty in case an important message should come by telephone and that mister Marlowe having gone to Southampton for him in the motor he wished me to do this and that I was to take down the message if it came and not disturb him He also ordered a fresh syphon of soda water I believe that was all sir You noticed nothing unusual about him I suppose No sir nothing unusual When I answered the ring he was seated at the desk listening at the telephone waiting for a number as I supposed He gave his orders and went on listening at the same time When I returned with the syphon he was engaged in conversation over the wire Do you remember anything of what he was saying Very little sir it was something about somebody being at some hotel of no interest to me I was only in the room just time enough to place the syphon on the table and withdraw As I closed the door he was saying You re sure he isn t in the hotel or words to that effect And that was the last you saw and heard of him alive No sir A little later at half past eleven when I had settled down in my pantry with the door ajar and a book to pass the time I heard mister Manderson go upstairs to bed I immediately went to close the library window and slipped the lock of the front door I did not hear anything more Trent considered I suppose you didn t doze at all he said tentatively while you were sitting up waiting for the telephone message Oh no sir I am always very wakeful about that time I m a bad sleeper especially in the neighborhood of the sea and I generally read in bed until somewhere about midnight And did any message come No sir No And I suppose you sleep with your window open these warm nights It is never closed at night sir Trent added a last note then he looked thoughtfully through those he had taken He rose and paced up and down the room for some moments with a downcast eye At length he paused opposite Martin It all seems perfectly ordinary and simple he said I just want to get a few details clear You went to shut the windows in the library before going to bed Which windows The French window sir It had been open all day The windows opposite the door were seldom opened And what about the curtains I am wondering whether anyone outside the house could have seen into the room Easily sir I should say if he had got into the grounds on that side The curtains were never drawn in the hot weather mister Manderson would often sit right in the doorway at nights smoking and looking out into the darkness But nobody could have seen him who had any business to be there I see And now tell me this Your hearing is very acute you say and you heard mister Manderson enter the house when he came in after dinner from the garden Did you hear him re enter it after returning from the motor drive Martin paused Now you mention it sir I remember that I did not His ringing the bell in this room was the first I knew of his being back I should have heard him come in if he had come in by the front I should have heard the door go But he must have come in by the window The man reflected for a moment then added As a general rule mister Manderson would come in by the front hang up his hat and coat in the hall and pass down the hall into the study It seems likely to me that he was in a great hurry to use the telephone and so went straight across the lawn to the window he was like that sir when there was anything important to be done He had on his hat now I remember and had thrown his great coat over the end of the table He gave his order very sharp too as he always did when busy A very precipitate man indeed was mister Manderson a hustler as they say Ah He appeared to be busy But didn t you say just now that you noticed nothing unusual about him A melancholy smile flitted momentarily over Martin s face That observation shows that you did not know mister Manderson sir if you will pardon my saying so His being like that was nothing unusual quite the contrary It took me long enough to get used to it Either he would be sitting quite still and smoking a cigar thinking or reading or else he would be writing dictating and sending off wires all at the same time till it almost made one dizzy to see it sometimes for an hour or more at a stretch As for being in a hurry over a telephone message I may say it wasn t in him to be anything else Trent turned to the inspector who met his eye with a look of answering intelligence Not sorry to show his understanding of the line of inquiry opened by Trent mister Murch for the first time put a question Then you left him telephoning by the open window with the lights on and the drinks on the table is that it That is so mister Murch The delicacy of the change in Martin s manner when called upon to answer the detective momentarily distracted Trent s appreciative mind But the big man s next question brought it back to the problem at once About those drinks You say mister Manderson often took no whisky before going to bed Did he have any that night I could not say The room was put to rights in the morning by one of the maids and the glass washed I presume as usual I know that the decanter was nearly full that evening I had refilled it a few days before and I glanced at it when I brought the fresh syphon just out of habit to make sure there was a decent looking amount The inspector went to the tall corner cupboard and opened it He took out a decanter of cut glass and set it on the table before Martin Was it fuller than that he asked quietly That s how I found it this morning The decanter was more than half empty For the first time Martin s self possession wavered He took up the decanter quickly tilted it before his eyes and then stared amazedly at the others He said slowly There s not much short of half a bottle gone out of this since I last set eyes on it and that was Sunday night Nobody in the house I suppose suggested Trent discreetly Out of the question replied Martin briefly Then he added I beg pardon sir but this is a most extraordinary thing to me Such a thing never happened in all my experience of mister Manderson As for the women servants they never touch anything I can answer for it and as for me when I want a drink I can help myself without going to the decanters He took up the decanter again and aimlessly renewed his observation of the contents while the inspector eyed him with a look of serene satisfaction as a master contemplates his handiwork Trent turned to a fresh page of his notebook and tapped it thoughtfully with his pencil Then he looked up and said I suppose mister Manderson had dressed for dinner that night Certainly sir He had on a suit with a dress jacket what he used to refer to as a Tuxedo which he usually wore when dining at home or informally And he was dressed like that when you saw him last All but the jacket sir When he spent the evening in the library as usually happened he would change it for an old shooting jacket after dinner a light colored tweed a little too loud in pattern for English tastes perhaps He had it on when I saw him last It used to hang in this cupboard here Martin opened the door of it as he spoke along with mister Manderson s fishing rods and such things so that he could slip it on after dinner without going upstairs Leaving the dinner jacket in the cupboard Yes sir The housemaid used to take it upstairs in the morning In the morning Trent repeated slowly And now that we are speaking of the morning will you tell me exactly what you know about that I understand that mister Manderson was not missed until the body was found about ten o clock That is so sir mister Manderson would never be called or have anything brought to him in the morning He occupied a separate bedroom Usually he would get up about eight and go round to the bathroom and he would come down some time before nine But often he would sleep till nine or ten o clock missus Manderson was always called at seven The maid would take in tea to her Yesterday morning missus Manderson took breakfast about eight in her sitting room as usual and everyone supposed that mister Manderson was still in bed and asleep when Evans came rushing up to the house with the shocking intelligence I see said Trent And now another thing You say you slipped the lock of the front door before going to bed Was that all the locking up you did To the front door sir yes I slipped the lock No more is considered necessary in these parts But I had locked both the doors at the back and seen to the fastenings of all the windows on the ground floor In the morning everything was as I had left it As you had left it Now here is another point the last I think Were the clothes in which the body was found the clothes that mister Manderson would naturally have worn that day Martin rubbed his chin You remind me how surprised I was when I first set eyes on the body sir At first I couldn t make out what was unusual about the clothes and then I saw what it was The collar was a shape of collar mister Manderson never wore except with evening dress Then I found that he had put on all the same things that he had worn the night before large fronted shirt and all except just the coat and waistcoat and trousers and the brown shoes and blue tie As for the suit it was one of half a dozen he might have worn But for him to have simply put on all the rest just because they were there instead of getting out the kind of shirt and things he always wore by day well sir it was unprecedented It shows like some other things what a hurry he must have been in when getting up Of course said Trent Well I think that s all I wanted to know You have put everything with admirable clearness Martin If we want to ask any more questions later on I suppose you will be somewhere about I shall be at your disposal sir Martin bowed and went out quietly Trent flung himself into the arm chair and exhaled a long breath Martin is a great creature he said He is far far better than a play There is none like him none nor will be when our summers have deceased Straight too not an atom of harm in dear old Martin Do you know Murch you are wrong in suspecting that man I never said a word about suspecting him The inspector was taken aback You know mister Trent he would never have told his story like that if he thought I suspected him I dare say he doesn t think so He is a wonderful creature a great artist but in spite of that he is not at all a sensitive type It has never occurred to his mind that you Murch could suspect him Martin the complete the accomplished But I know it You must understand inspector that I have made a special study of the psychology of officers of the law It is a grossly neglected branch of knowledge They are far more interesting than criminals and not nearly so easy All the time I was questioning him I saw handcuffs in your eye Your lips were mutely framing the syllables of those tremendous words It is my duty to tell you that anything you now say will be taken down and used in evidence against you Your manner would have deceived most men but it could not deceive me mister Murch laughed heartily Trent s nonsense never made any sort of impression on his mind but he took it as a mark of esteem which indeed it was so it never failed to please him Well mister Trent he said you re perfectly right There s no point in denying it I have got my eye on him Not that there s anything definite but you know as well as I do how often servants are mixed up in affairs of this kind and this man is such a very quiet customer You remember the case of Lord William Russell s valet who went in as usual in the morning to draw up the blinds in his master s bedroom as quiet and starchy as you please a few hours after he had murdered him in his bed I ve talked to all the women of the house and I don t believe there s a morsel of harm in one of them But Martin s not so easy set aside I don t like his manner I believe he s hiding something If so I shall find it out Cease said Trent Drain not to its dregs the urn of bitter prophecy Let us get back to facts Have you as a matter of evidence anything at all to bring against Martin s story as he has told it to us Nothing whatever at present As for his suggestion that Manderson came in by way of the window after leaving Marlowe and the car that s right enough I should say I questioned the servant who swept the room next morning and she tells me there were gravelly marks near the window on this plain drugget that goes round the carpet And there s a footprint in this soft new gravel just outside The inspector took a folding rule from his pocket and with it pointed out the traces One of the patent shoes Manderson was wearing that night exactly fits that print you ll find them he added on the top shelf in the bedroom near the window end the only patents in the row The girl who polished them in the morning picked them out for me Trent bent down and studied the faint marks keenly Good he said You have covered a lot of ground Murch I must say That was excellent about the whisky you made your point finely I felt inclined to shout Encore It s a thing that I shall have to think over I thought you might have fitted it in already said mister Murch Come mister Trent we re only at the beginning of our inquiries but what do you say to this for a preliminary theory There s a plan of burglary say a couple of men in it and Martin squared They know where the plate is and all about the handy little bits of stuff in the drawing room and elsewhere They watch the house see Manderson off to bed Martin comes to shut the window and leaves it ajar accidentally on purpose They wait till Martin goes to bed at twelve thirty then they just walk into the library and begin to sample the whisky first thing Now suppose Manderson isn t asleep and suppose they make a noise opening the window or however it might be He hears it thinks of burglars gets up very quietly to see if anything s wrong creeps down on them perhaps just as they re getting ready for work They cut and run he chases them down to the shed and collars one there s a fight one of them loses his temper and his head and makes a swinging job of it Now mister Trent pick that to pieces Very well said Trent Just to oblige you Murch especially as I know you don t believe a word of it First no traces of any kind left by your burglar or burglars and the window found fastened in the morning according to Martin Not much force in that I allow Next nobody in the house hears anything of this stampede through the library nor hears any shout from Manderson either inside the house or outside Next Manderson goes down without a word to anybody though Bunner and Martin are both at hand Next did you ever hear in your long experience of a householder getting up in the night to pounce on burglars who dressed himself fully with underclothing shirt collar and tie trousers waistcoat and coat socks and hard leather shoes and who gave the finishing touches to a somewhat dandified toilet by doing his hair and putting on his watch and chain Personally I call that over dressing the part The only decorative detail he seems to have forgotten is his teeth The inspector leaned forward thinking his large hands clasped before him No he said at last Of course there s no help in that theory I rather expect we have some way to go before we find out why a man gets up before the servants are awake dresses himself fully and is murdered within sight of his house early enough to be cold and stiff by ten in the morning Trent shook his head We can t build anything on that last consideration I ve gone into the subject with people who know I shouldn t wonder he added if the traditional notions about loss of temperature and rigor after death had occasionally brought an innocent man to the gallows or near it doctor Stock has them all I feel sure most general practitioners of the older generation have That doctor Stock will make an ass of himself at the inquest is almost as certain as that to morrow s sun will rise I ve seen him He will say the body must have been dead about so long because of the degree of coldness and rigor mortis I can see him nosing it all out in some text book that was out of date when he was a student Listen Murch and I will tell you some facts which will be a great hindrance to you in your professional career There are many things that may hasten or retard the cooling of the body This one was lying in the long dewy grass on the shady side of the shed As for rigidity if Manderson died in a struggle or laboring under sudden emotion his corpse might stiffen practically instantaneously there are dozens of cases noted particularly in cases of injury to the skull like this one On the other hand the stiffening might not have begun until eight or ten hours after death You can t hang anybody on rigor mortis nowadays inspector much as you may resent the limitation No what we can say is this If he had been shot after the hour at which the world begins to get up and go about its business it would have been heard and very likely seen too In fact we must reason to begin with at any rate on the assumption that he wasn t shot at a time when people might be awake it isn t done in these parts Put that time at six thirty A M Manderson went up to bed at eleven P M and Martin sat up till twelve thirty Assuming that he went to sleep at once on turning in that leaves us something like six hours for the crime to be committed in and that is a long time But whenever it took place I wish you would suggest a reason why Manderson who was a fairly late riser was up and dressed at or before six thirty and why neither Martin who sleeps lightly nor Bunner nor his wife heard him moving about or letting himself out of the house He must have been careful He must have crept about like a cat Do you feel as I do Murch about all this that it is very very strange and baffling That s how it looks agreed the inspector And now said Trent rising to his feet I ll leave you to your meditations and take a look at the bedrooms Perhaps the explanation of all this will suddenly burst upon you while I am poking about up there But concluded Trent in a voice of sudden exasperation turning round in the doorway if you can tell me at any time how under the sun a man who put on all those clothes could forget to put in his teeth you may kick me from here to the nearest lunatic asylum and hand me over as an incipient dement CHAPTER IV POKING ABOUT There are moments in life as one might think when that which is within us busy about its secret affair lets escape into consciousness some hint of a fortunate thing ordained Who does not know what it is to feel at times a wave of unaccountable persuasion that it is about to go well with him not the feverish confidence of men in danger of a blow from fate not the persistent illusion of the optimist but an unsought conviction springing up like a bird from the heather that success is at hand in some great or little thing The general suddenly knows at dawn that the day will bring him victory the man on the green suddenly knows that he will put down the long putt As Trent mounted the stairway outside the library door he seemed to rise into certainty of achievement A host of guesses and inferences swarmed apparently unsorted through his mind a few secret observations that he had made and which he felt must have significance still stood unrelated to any plausible theory of the crime yet as he went up he seemed to know indubitably that light was going to appear The bedrooms lay on either side of a broad carpeted passage lighted by a tall end window It went the length of the house until it ran at right angles into a narrower passage out of which the servants rooms opened Martin s room was the exception it opened out of a small landing halfway to the upper floor As Trent passed it he glanced within A little square room clean and commonplace In going up the rest of the stairway he stepped with elaborate precaution against noise hugging the wall closely and placing each foot with care but a series of very audible creaks marked his passage He knew that Manderson s room was the first on the right hand when the bedroom floor was reached and he went to it at once He tried the latch and the lock which worked normally and examined the wards of the key Then he turned to the room It was a small apartment strangely bare The plutocrat s toilet appointments were of the simplest All remained just as it had been on the morning of the ghastly discovery in the grounds The sheets and blankets of the unmade bed lay tumbled over a narrow wooden bedstead and the sun shone brightly through the window upon them It gleamed too upon the gold parts of the delicate work of dentistry that lay in water in a shallow bowl of glass placed on a small plain table by the bedside On this also stood a wrought iron candlestick Some clothing lay untidily over one of the two rush bottomed chairs Various objects on the top of a chest of drawers which had been used as a dressing table lay in such disorder as a hurried man might make toilet articles a book of flies an empty pocket book with a burst strap a pocket compass and other trifles Trent looked them over with a questioning eye He noted also that the occupant of the room had neither washed nor shaved With his finger he turned over the dental plate in the bowl and frowned again at its incomprehensible presence The emptiness and disarray of the little room flooded by the sunbeams were producing in Trent a sense of gruesomeness His fancy called up a picture of a haggard man dressing himself in careful silence by the first light of dawn glancing constantly at the inner door behind which his wife slept his eyes full of some terror Trent shivered and to fix his mind again on actualities opened two tall cupboards in the wall on either side of the bed They contained clothing a large choice of which had evidently been one of the very few conditions of comfort for the man who had slept there In the matter of shoes also Manderson had allowed himself the advantage of wealth An extraordinary number of these treed and carefully kept was ranged on two long low shelves against the wall Trent himself an amateur of good shoe leather now turned to them and glanced over the collection with an appreciative eye It was to be seen that Manderson had been inclined to pride himself on a rather small and well formed foot The shoes were of a distinctive shape narrow and round toed beautifully made all were evidently from the same last Suddenly his eyes narrowed themselves over a pair of patent leather shoes on the upper shelf These were the shoes of which the inspector had already described the position to him the shoes worn by Manderson the night before his death They were a well worn pair he saw at once he saw too that they had been very recently polished Something about the uppers of these shoes had seized his attention He bent lower and frowned over them comparing what he saw with the appearance of the neighboring shoes Then he took them up and examined the line of juncture of the uppers with the soles As he did this Trent began unconsciously to whistle faintly and with great precision an air which Inspector Murch if he had been present would have recognized Most men who have the habit of self control have also some involuntary trick which tells those who know them that they are suppressing excitement The inspector had noted that when Trent had picked up a strong scent he whistled faintly a certain melodious passage though the inspector could not have told you that it was in fact the opening movement of Mendelssohn s Lied ohne Woerter in A major He turned the shoes over made some measurements with a marked tape and looked minutely at the bottoms On each in the angle between the heel and the instep he detected a faint trace of red gravel Trent placed the shoes on the floor and walked with his hands behind him to the window out of which still faintly whistling he gazed with eyes that saw nothing Once his lips opened to emit mechanically the Englishman s expletive of sudden enlightenment At length he turned to the shelves again and swiftly but carefully examined every one of the shoes there This done he took up the garments from the chair looked them over closely and replaced them He turned to the wardrobe cupboards again and hunted through them carefully The litter on the dressing table now engaged his attention for the second time Then he sat down on the empty chair took his head in his hands and remained in that attitude staring at the carpet for some minutes He rose at last and opened the inner door leading to missus Manderson s room It was evident at a glance that the big room had been hurriedly put down from its place as the lady s bower All the array of objects that belong to a woman s dressing table had been removed on bed and chairs and smaller tables there were no garments or hats bags or boxes no trace remained of the obstinate conspiracy of gloves and veils handkerchiefs and ribbons to break the captivity of the drawer The room was like an unoccupied guest chamber Yet in every detail of furniture and decoration it spoke of an unconventional but exacting taste Trent as his expert eye noted the various perfection of color and form amid which the ill mated lady dreamed her dreams and thought her loneliest thoughts knew that she had at least the resources of an artistic nature His interest in this unknown personality grew stronger and his brows came down heavily as he thought of the burdens laid upon it and of the deed of which the history was now shaping itself with more and more of substance before his busy mind He went first to the tall French window in the middle of the wall that faced the door and opening it stepped out upon a small balcony with an iron railing He looked down on a broad stretch of lawn that began immediately beneath him separated from the house wall only by a narrow flower bed and stretched away with an abrupt dip at the farther end toward the orchard The other window opened with a sash above the garden entrance to the library In the further inside corner of the room was a second door giving upon the passage the door by which the maid was wont to come in and her mistress to go out in the morning Trent seated on the bed quickly sketched in his notebook a plan of the room and its neighbor The bed stood in the angle between the communicating door and the sash window its head against the wall dividing the room from Manderson s Trent stared at the pillows then he lay down with deliberation on the bed and looked through the open door into the adjoining room This observation taken he rose again and proceeded to note on his plan that on either side of the bed was a small table with a cover Upon that farthest from the door was a graceful electric lamp standard of copper connected by a free wire with the wall Trent looked at it thoughtfully then at the switches connected with the other lights in the room They were as usual on the wall just within the door and some way out of his reach as he sat on the bed He rose and satisfied himself that the lights were all in order Then he turned on his heel walked quickly into Manderson s room and rang the bell I want your help again Martin he said as the butler presented himself upright and impassive in the doorway I want you to prevail upon missus Manderson s maid to grant me an interview Certainly sir said Martin What sort of a woman is she Has she her wits about her She s French sir replied Martin succinctly adding after a pause She has not been with us long sir but I have formed the impression that the young woman knows as much of the world as is good for her since you ask me You think butter might possibly melt in her mouth do you said Trent Well I am not afraid I want to put some questions to her I will send her up immediately sir The butler withdrew and Trent wandered round the little room with his hands at his back Sooner than he had expected a small neat figure in black appeared quietly before him The lady s maid with her large brown eyes had taken favorable notice of Trent from a window when he had crossed the lawn and had been hoping desperately that the resolver of mysteries whose reputation was as great below stairs as elsewhere would send for her For one thing she felt the need to make a scene her nerves were overwrought But her scenes were at a discount with the other domestics and as for mister Murch he had chilled her into self control with his official manner Trent her glimpse of him had told her had not the air of a policeman and at a distance he had appeared sympathetique As she entered the room however instinct decided for her that any approach to coquetry would be a mistake if she sought to make a good impression at the beginning It was with an air of amiable candor then that she said Monsieur desire to speak with me She added helpfully I am called Celestine Naturally said Trent with businesslike calm Now what I want you to tell me Celestine is this when you took tea to your mistress yesterday morning at seven o clock was the door between the two bedrooms this door here open Celestine became intensely animated in an instant Oh yes she said using her favorite English idiom The door was open as always monsieur and I shut it as always But it is necessary to explain Listen When I enter the room of madame from the other door in there ah but if monsieur will give himself the pain to enter the other room all explains itself She tripped across to the door and urged Trent before her into the larger bedroom with a hand on his arm See I enter the room with the tea like this I approach the bed Before I come quite near the bed here is the door to my right hand open always so But monsieur can perceive that I see nothing in the room of Monsieur Manderson The door opens to the bed not to me who approach from down there I shut it without seeing in It is the order Yesterday it was as ordinary I see nothing of the next room Madame sleep like an angel she see nothing I shut the door I place the plateau I open the curtains I prepare the toilette I retire voila Celestine paused for breath and spread her hands abroad Trent who had followed her movements and gesticulations with deepening gravity nodded his head I see exactly how it was now he said Thank you Celestine So mister Manderson was supposed to be still in his room while your mistress was getting up and dressing and having breakfast in her boudoir Oui monsieur Nobody missed him in fact remarked Trent Well Celestine I am very much obliged to you He re opened the door to the outer bedroom It is nothing monsieur said Celestine as she crossed the small room I hope that monsieur will catch the assassin of Monsieur Manderson But I not regret him too much she added with sudden and amazing violence turning round with her hand on the knob of the outer door She set her teeth with an audible sound and the color rose in her small dark face English departed from her Je ne le regrette pas du tout du tout she cried with a flood of words Madame ah je me jetterais au feu pour madame une femme si charmante si adorable Mais un homme comme monsieur maussade boudeur impassible Ah non de ma vie J en avais pardessus la tete de monsieur Ah vrai Est ce insupportable tout de meme qu il existe des types comme ca Je vous jure que Finissez ce chahut Celestine Trent broke in sharply Celestine s tirade had brought back the memory of his student days in Paris with a rush En voila une scene C est rasant vous savez Faut rentrer ca mademoiselle Du reste c est bien imprudent croyez moi Hang it have some common sense If the inspector downstairs heard you saying that kind of thing you would get into trouble And don t wave your fists about so much you might hit something You seem he went on more pleasantly as Celestine grew calmer under his authoritative eye to be even more glad than other people that mister Manderson is out of the way I could almost suspect Celestine that mister Manderson did not take as much notice of you as you thought necessary and right A peine s il m avait regarde Celestine answered simply Ca c est un comble observed Trent You are a nice young woman for a small tea party I don t think A star upon your birthday burned whose fierce serene red pulseless planet never yearned in heaven Celestine Mademoiselle I am busy Bon jour You certainly are a beauty Celestine took this as a scarcely expected compliment The surprise restored her balance With a sudden flash of her eyes and teeth at Trent over her shoulder the lady s maid opened the door and swiftly disappeared Trent left alone in the little bedroom relieved his mind with two forcible descriptive terms in Celestine s language and turned to his problem He took the pair of shoes which he had already examined and placed them on one of the two chairs in the room then seated himself on the other opposite to this With his hands in his pockets he sat with eyes fixed upon those two dumb witnesses Now and then he whistled almost inaudibly a few bars It was very still in the room A subdued twittering came from the trees through the open window From time to time a breeze rustled in the leaves of the thick creeper about the sill But the man in the room his face grown hard and somber now with his thoughts never moved So he sat for the space of half an hour Then he rose quickly to his feet He replaced the shoes on their shelf with care and stepped out upon the landing Two bedroom doors faced him on the other side of the passage He opened that which was immediately opposite and entered a bedroom by no means austerely tidy Some sticks and fishing rods stood confusedly in one corner a pile of books in another The housemaid s hand had failed to give a look of order to the jumble of heterogeneous objects left on the dressing table and the mantel shelf pipes pen knives pencils keys golf balls old letters photographs small boxes tins and bottles Two fine etchings and some water color sketches hung on the walls leaning against the end of the wardrobe unhung were a few framed engravings A row of shoes and boots was ranged beneath the window Trent crossed the room and studied them intently then he measured some of them with his tape whistling very softly This done he sat on the side of the bed and his eyes roamed gloomily about the room The photographs on the mantel shelf attracted him presently He rose and examined one representing Marlowe and Manderson on horseback Two others were views of famous peaks in the Alps There was a faded print of three youths one of them unmistakably his acquaintance of the haggard blue eyes clothed in tatterdemalion soldier s gear of the sixteenth century Another was a portrait of a majestic old lady slightly resembling Marlowe Trent mechanically taking a cigarette from an open box on the mantel shelf lit it and stared at the photographs Next he turned his attention to a flat leathern case that lay by the cigarette box It opened easily A small and light revolver of beautiful workmanship was disclosed with a score or so of loose cartridges On the stock were engraved the initials J M A step was heard on the stairs and as Trent opened the breech and peered into the barrel of the weapon Inspector Murch appeared at the open door of the room I was wondering he began then stopped as he saw what the other was about His intelligent eyes opened slightly Whose is the revolver mister Trent he asked in a conversational tone Evidently it belongs to the occupant of the room mister Marlowe replied Trent with similar lightness pointing to the initials I found this lying about on the mantel piece It seems a handy little pistol to me and it has been very carefully cleaned I should say since the last time it was used But I know little about firearms Well I know a good deal rejoined the inspector quietly taking the revolver from Trent s outstretched hand It s a bit of a specialty with me is firearms as I think you know mister Trent But it don t require an expert to tell one thing He replaced the revolver in its case on the mantel shelf took out one of the cartridges and laid it on the spacious palm of one hand then taking a small object from his waistcoat pocket he laid it beside the cartridge It was a little leaden bullet slightly battered about the nose and having upon it some bright new scratches Is that the one Trent murmured as he bent over the inspector s hand That s him replied mister Murch Lodged in the bone at the back of the skull doctor Stock got it out within the last hour and handed it to the local officer who has just sent it on to me These bright scratches you see were made by the doctor s instruments These other marks were made by the rifling of the barrel a barrel like this one He tapped the revolver Same make same caliber With the pistol in its case between them Trent and the inspector looked into each other s eyes for some moments Trent was the first to speak This mystery is all wrong he observed It is insanity The symptoms of mania are very marked Let us see how we stand We were not in any doubt I believe about Manderson having despatched Marlowe in the car to Southampton or about Marlowe having gone returning late last night many hours after the murder was committed There is no doubt whatever about all that said mister Murch with a slight emphasis on the verb And now pursued Trent we are invited by this polished and insinuating firearm to believe the following line of propositions that Marlowe never went to Southampton that he returned to the house in the night that he somehow without waking missus Manderson or anybody else got Manderson to get up dress himself and go out into the grounds that he then and there shot the said Manderson with his incriminating pistol that he carefully cleaned the said pistol returned to the house and again without disturbing any one replaced it in its case in a favorable position to be found by the officers of the law that he then withdrew and spent the rest of the day in hiding with a large motor car and that he turned up feigning ignorance of the whole affair at what time was it A little after nine P M The inspector still stared moodily at Trent As you say mister Trent that is the first theory suggested by this find and it seems wild enough at least it would do if it didn t fall to pieces at the very start When the murder was done Marlowe must have been fifty to a hundred miles away He did go to Southampton How do you know I questioned him last night and took down his story He arrived in Southampton about six thirty on the Monday morning Come off exclaimed Trent bitterly What do I care about his story What do you care about his story I want to know how you know he went to Southampton mister Murch chuckled I thought I should take a rise out of you mister Trent he said Well there s no harm in telling you After I arrived yesterday evening as soon as I had got the outlines of the story from missus Manderson and the servants the first thing I did was to go to the telegraph office and wire to our people in Southampton Manderson had told his wife when he went to bed that he had changed his mind and sent Marlowe to Southampton to get some important information from someone who was crossing by the next day s boat It seemed right enough but you see Marlowe was the only one of the household who wasn t under my hand so to speak he didn t return in the car until later in the evening so before thinking the matter out any further I wired to Southampton making certain inquiries Early this morning I got this reply He handed a series of telegraph slips to Trent who read Person answering description in motor answering description arrived Bedford Hotel here six thirty this morning gave name Marlowe left car hotel garage told attendant car belonged Manderson had bath and breakfast went out heard of later at docks inquiring for passenger name Harris on Havre boat inquired repeatedly until boat left at noon next heard of at hotel where he lunched about one fifteen left soon afterwards in car company s agents inform berth was booked name Harris last week but Harris did not travel by boat Burke Inspector Simple and satisfactory observed mister Murch as Trent after twice reading the message returned it to him His own story corroborated in every particular He told me he hung about the dock for half an hour or so on the chance of Harris turning up late then strolled back lunched and decided to return at once He sent a wire to Manderson Harris not turned up missed boat returning Marlowe which was duly delivered here in the afternoon and placed among the dead man s letters He motored back at a good rate and arrived dog tired When he heard of Manderson s death from Martin he nearly fainted What with that and the being without sleep for so long he was rather a wreck when I came to interview him last night but he was perfectly coherent Trent picked up the revolver and twirled the cylinder idly for a few moments It was unlucky for Manderson that Marlowe left his pistol and cartridges about so carelessly he remarked at length as he put it back in the case It was throwing temptation in somebody s way don t you think mister Murch shook his head There isn t really much to lay hold of about the revolver when you come to think That particular make of revolver is common enough in England It was introduced from the States Half the people who buy a revolver to day for self defense or mischief provide themselves with that make of that caliber It is very reliable and easily carried in the hip pocket There must be thousands of them in the possession of crooks and honest men For instance continued the inspector with an air of unconcern Manderson himself had one the double of this I found it in one of the top drawers of the desk downstairs and it s in my overcoat pocket now Aha so you were going to keep that little detail to yourself I was said the inspector but as you ve found one revolver you may as well know about the other As I say neither of them may do us any good The people in the house Both men started and the inspector checked his speech abruptly as the half closed door of the bedroom was slowly pushed open and a man stood in the doorway His eyes turned from the pistol in its open case to the faces of Trent and the inspector They who had not heard a sound to herald this entrance simultaneously looked at his long narrow feet He wore rubber soled tennis shoes You must be mister Bunner said Trent CHAPTER V mister BUNNER ON THE CASE Calvin C Bunner at your service amended the newcomer with a touch of punctilio as he removed an unlighted cigar from his mouth He was used to finding Englishmen slow and ceremonious with strangers and Trent s quick remark plainly disconcerted him a little You are mister Trent I expect he went on missus Manderson was telling me a while ago Captain good morning mister Murch acknowledged the greeting with a nod I was coming up to my room and I heard a strange voice in here so I thought I would take a look in mister Bunner laughed easily You thought I might have been eavesdropping perhaps he said No sir I heard a word or two about a pistol this one I guess and that s all mister Bunner was a thin rather short young man with a shaven pale bony almost girlish face and large dark intelligent eyes His waving dark hair was parted in the middle His lips usually occupied with a cigar in its absence were always half open with a curious expression as of permanent eagerness By smoking or chewing a cigar this expression was banished and mister Bunner then looked the consummately cool and sagacious Yankee that he was Born in Connecticut he had gone into a broker s office on leaving college and had attracted the notice of Manderson whose business with his firm he had often handled The Colossus had watched him for some time and at length offered him the post of private secretary mister Bunner was a pattern business man trustworthy long headed methodical and accurate Manderson could have found many men with those virtues but he engaged mister Bunner because he was also swift and secret and had besides a singular natural instinct in regard to the movements of the stock market Trent and the American measured one another coolly with their eyes Both appeared satisfied with what they saw I was having it explained to me said Trent pleasantly that my discovery of a pistol that might have shot Manderson does not amount to very much I am told it is a favorite weapon among your people and has become quite popular over here mister Bunner stretched out a bony hand and took the pistol from its case Yes sir he said handling it with an air of familiarity the captain is right This is what we call out home a Little Arthur and I dare say there are duplicates of it in a hundred thousand hip pockets this minute I consider it too light in the hand myself mister Bunner went on mechanically feeling under the tail of his jacket and producing an ugly looking weapon Feel of that now mister Trent it s loaded by the way Now this Little Arthur Marlowe bought it just before we came over this year to please the old man Manderson said it was ridiculous for a man to be without a pistol in the twentieth century So he went out and bought what they offered him I guess never consulted me Not but what it s a good gun mister Bunner conceded squinting along the sights Marlowe was poor with it at first but I ve coached him some in the last month or so and he s practised until he is pretty good But he never could get the habit of carrying it around Why it s as natural to me as wearing my pants I have carried one for some years now because there was always likely to be somebody laying for Manderson And now mister Bunner concluded sadly they got him when I wasn t around Well gentlemen you must excuse me I am going in to Bishopsbridge There is a lot to do these days and I have to send off a bunch of cables big enough to choke a cow I must be off too said Trent I have an appointment at the Three Tuns inn Let me give you a lift in the automobile said mister Bunner cordially I go right by that joint Say Cap are you coming my way too No Then come along mister Trent and help me get out the car The chauffeur is out of action and we have to do most everything ourselves except clean the dirt off her Still tirelessly talking in his measured drawl mister Bunner led Trent downstairs and through the house to the garage at the back It stood at a little distance from the house and made a cool retreat from the blaze of the mid day sun mister Bunner seemed to be in no hurry to get out the car He offered Trent a cigar which was accepted and for the first time lit his own Then he seated himself on the foot board of the car his thin hands clasped between his knees and looked keenly at the other See here mister Trent he said after a few moments There are some things I can tell you that may be useful to you I know your record You are a smart man and I like dealing with smart men I don t know if I have that detective sized up right but he strikes me as a mutt I would answer any questions he had the gumption to ask me I have done so in fact but I don t feel encouraged to give him any notions of mine without his asking See Trent nodded That is a feeling many people have in the presence of our police he said It s the official manner I suppose But let me tell you Murch is anything but what you think He is one of the shrewdest officers in Europe He is not very quick with his mind but he is very sure And his experience is immense My forte is imagination but I assure you in police work experience outweighs it by a great deal Outweighs nothing replied mister Bunner crisply This is no ordinary case mister Trent I will tell you one reason why I believe the old man knew there was something coming to him Another thing I believe it was something he thought he couldn t dodge Trent pulled a crate opposite to mister Bunner s place on the foot board and seated himself This sounds like business he said Tell me your ideas I say what I do because of the change in the old man s manner this last few weeks I dare say you have heard mister Trent that he was a man who always kept himself well in hand That was so I have always considered him the coolest and hardest head in business That man s calm was just deadly I never saw anything to beat it And I knew Manderson as nobody else did I was with him in the work he really lived for I guess I knew him a heap better than his wife did poor woman I knew him better than Marlowe could he never saw Manderson in his office when there was a big thing on I knew him better than any of his friends Had he any friends interjected Trent mister Bunner glanced at him sharply Somebody has been putting you next I see that he remarked No properly speaking I should say not He had many acquaintances among the big men people he saw most every day they would even go yachting or hunting together But I don t believe there ever was a man that Manderson opened a corner of his heart to But what I was going to say was this some months ago the old man began to get like I never knew him before gloomy and sullen just as if he was everlastingly brooding over something bad something that he couldn t fix This went on without any break it was the same down town as it was up home he acted just as if there was something lying heavy on his mind But it wasn t until a few weeks back that his self restraint began to go and let me tell you this mister Trent the American laid his bony claw on the other s knee I m the only man that knows it With everyone else he would be just morose and dull but when he was alone with me in his office or anywhere where we would be working together if the least little thing went wrong by George he would fly off the handle to beat the Dutch In this library here I have seen him open a letter with something that didn t just suit him in it and he would rip around and carry on like an Indian saying he wished he had the man that wrote it here he wouldn t do a thing to him and so on till it was just pitiful I never saw such a change And here s another thing For a week before he died Manderson neglected his work for the first time in my experience He wouldn t answer a letter or a cable though things looked like going all to pieces over there I supposed that this anxiety of his whatever it was had got onto his nerves till they were worn out Once I advised him to see a doctor and he told me to go to hell But nobody saw this side of him but me If he was having one of these rages in the library here for example and missus Manderson would come into the room he would be all calm and cold again in an instant And you put this down to some secret anxiety a fear that somebody had designs on his life asked Trent The American nodded I suppose Trent resumed you had considered the idea of there being something wrong with his mind a break down from overstrain say That is the first thought that your account suggests to me Besides it is what is always happening to your big business men in America isn t it That is the impression one gets from the newspapers Don t let them slip you any of that bunk said mister Bunner earnestly It s only the ones who have got rich too quick and can t make good who go crazy Think of all our really big men the men anywhere near Manderson s size did you ever hear of any one of them losing his senses They don t do it believe me I know they say every man has his loco point mister Bunner added reflectively but that doesn t mean genuine sure enough craziness it just means some personal eccentricity in a man like hating cats or my own weakness of not being able to touch any kind of fish food Well what was Manderson s He was full of them the old man There was his objection to all the unnecessary fuss and luxury that wealthy people don t kick at much as a general rule He didn t have any use for expensive trifles and ornaments He wouldn t have anybody do little things for him he hated to have servants tag around after him unless he wanted them And although Manderson was as careful about his clothes as any man I ever knew and his shoes well sir the amount of money he spent on shoes was sinful in spite of that I tell you he never had a valet He never liked to have anybody touch him All his life nobody ever shaved him I ve heard something of that Trent remarked Why was it do you think Well mister Bunner answered slowly it was the Manderson habit of mind I guess a sort of temper of general suspicion and jealousy They say his father and grandfather were just the same Like a dog with a bone you know acting as if all the rest of creation was laying for a chance to steal it He didn t really think the barber would start in to saw his head off he just felt there was a possibility that he might and he was taking no risks Then again in business he was always convinced that somebody else was after his bone which was true enough a good deal of the time but not all the time The consequence of that was that the old man was the most cautious and secret worker in the world of finance and that had a lot to do with his success too But that doesn t amount to being a lunatic mister Trent not by a long way You ask me if Manderson was losing his mind before he died I say I believe he was just worn out with worrying over something and was losing his nerve Trent smoked thoughtfully He wondered how much mister Bunner knew of the domestic difficulty in his chief s household and decided to put out a feeler I understood that he had trouble with his wife Sure replied mister Bunner But do you suppose a thing like that was going to upset Sig Manderson that way No sir He was a sight too big a man to be all broken up by any worry of that kind Trent looked half incredulously into the eyes of the young man But behind all their shrewdness and intensity he saw a massive innocence mister Bunner really believed a serious breach between husband and wife to be a minor source of trouble for a big man What was the trouble between them Trent inquired You can search me mister Bunner replied briefly He puffed at his cigar Marlowe and I have often talked about it and we could never make out a solution I had a notion at first said mister Bunner in a lower voice leaning forward that the old man was disappointed and vexed because he had expected a child but Marlowe told me that the disappointment on that score was the other way around likely as not His idea was all right I guess he gathered it from something said by missus Manderson s French maid Trent looked up at him quickly Celestine he said and his thought was So that was what she was getting at mister Bunner misunderstood his glance Don t you think I m giving a man away mister Trent he said Marlowe isn t that kind Celestine just took a fancy to him because he talks French like a native and she would always be holding him up for a gossip French servants are quite unlike English that way And servant or no servant added mister Bunner with emphasis I don t see how a woman could mention such a subject to a man But the French beat me He shook his head slowly But to come back to what you were telling me just now Trent said You believe that Manderson was going in terror of his life for some time Who should threaten it I am quite in the dark Terror I don t know replied mister Bunner meditatively Anxiety if you like or suspense that s rather my idea of it The old man was hard to terrify anyway and more than that he wasn t taking any precautions he was actually avoiding them It looked more like he was asking for a quick finish supposing there s any truth in my idea Why he would sit in that library window nights looking out into the dark with his white shirt just a target for anybody s gun As for who should threaten his life well sir said mister Bunner with a faint smile it s certain you have not lived in the States To take the Pennsylvania coal hold up alone there were thirty thousand men with women and children to keep who would have jumped at the chance of drilling a hole through the man who fixed it so that they must starve or give in to his terms Thirty thousand of the toughest aliens in the country mister Trent There s a type of desperado you find in that kind of push who has been known to lay for a man for years and kill him when he had forgotten what he did They have been known to dynamite a man in Idaho who had done them dirt in New Jersey ten years before Do you suppose the Atlantic is going to stop them It takes some sand I tell you to be a big business man in our country No sir the old man knew had always known that there was a whole crowd of dangerous men scattered up and down the States who had it in for him My belief is that he had somehow got to know that some of them were definitely after him at last What licks me altogether is why he should have just laid himself open to them the way he did why he never tried to dodge but walked right down into the garden yesterday morning to be shot at mister Bunner ceased to speak and for a little while both men sat with wrinkled brows faint blue vapors rising from their cigars Then Trent rose Your theory is quite fresh to me he said It s perfectly rational and it s only a question of whether it fits all the facts I mustn t give away what I m doing for my newspaper mister Bunner but I will say this I have already satisfied myself that this was a premeditated crime and an extraordinarily cunning one at that I m deeply obliged to you We must talk it over again He looked at his watch I have been expected for some time by my friend Shall we make a move Two o clock said mister Bunner consulting his own as he got up from the foot board Ten A M in little old New York You don t know Wall Street mister Trent Let s you and I hope we never see anything nearer hell than what s loose in the Street this minute CHAPTER VI THE LADY IN BLACK The sea broke raging upon the foot of the cliff under a good breeze the sun flooded the land with life from a dappled blue sky In this perfection of English weather Trent who had slept ill went down before eight o clock to a pool among the rocks the direction of which had been given him and dived deep into clear water Between vast gray boulders he swam out to the tossing open forced himself some little way against a coast wise current and then returned to his refuge battered and refreshed Ten minutes later he was scaling the cliff again and his mind cleared for the moment of a heavy disgust for the affair he had in hand was turning over his plans for the morning It was the day of the inquest the day after his arrival in the place He had carried matters not much farther after parting with the American on the road to Bishopsbridge In the afternoon he had walked from the inn into the town accompanied by mister Cupples and had there made certain purchases at a chemist s shop conferred privately for some time with a photographer sent off a reply paid telegram and made an inquiry at the telephone exchange He had said but little about the case to mister Cupples who seemed incurious on his side and nothing at all about the results of his investigation or the steps he was about to take After their return from Bishopsbridge Trent had written a long dispatch for the Record and sent it to be telegraphed by the proud hands of the paper s local representative This morning as he scaled the cliff he told himself that he had never taken up a case he liked so little or which absorbed him so much The more he contemplated it in the golden sunshine of this new day the more evil and the more challenging it appeared All that he suspected and all that he almost knew had occupied his questing brain for hours to the exclusion of sleep and in this glorious light and air though washed in body and spirit by the fierce purity of the sea he only saw the more clearly the darkness of the guilt in which he believed and was more bitterly repelled by the motive at which he guessed But now at least his zeal was awake again and the sense of the hunt quickened He would neither slacken nor spare here need be no compunction In the course of the day he hoped his net would be complete He had work to do in the morning and with very vivid expectancy though not much serious hope he awaited the answer to the telegram which he had shot into the sky as it were the day before The path back to the hotel wound for some way along the top of the cliff and on nearing a spot he had marked from the sea level where the face had fallen away long ago he approached the edge and looked down hoping to follow with his eyes the most delicately beautiful of all the movements of water the wash of a light sea over broken rock But no rock was there A few feet below him a broad ledge stood out a rough platform as large as a great room thickly grown with wiry grass and walled in steeply on three sides There close to the verge where the cliff at last dropped sheer a woman was sitting her arms about her drawn up knees her eyes fixed on the trailing smoke of a distant liner her face full of some dream This woman seemed to Trent whose training had taught him to live in his eyes to make the most beautiful picture he had ever seen Her face of Southern pallor touched by the kiss of the wind with color on the cheek presented to him a profile of delicate regularity in which there was nothing hard nevertheless the black brows bending down toward the point where they almost met gave her in repose a look of something like severity strangely redeemed by the open curves of the mouth Trent said to himself that the absurdity or otherwise of a lover writing sonnets to his mistress s eyebrow depended after all on the quality of the eyebrow Her nose was of the straight and fine sort exquisitely escaping the perdition of too much length Her hat lay pinned to the grass beside her and the lively breeze played with her thick dark hair blowing backward the two broad bandeaux that should have covered much of her forehead and agitating a hundred tiny curls from the mass gathered at the nape Everything about this lady was black from her shoes of suede to the hat that she had discarded lusterless black covered her to her bare throat All she wore was fine and well put on Dreamy and delicate of spirit as her looks declared her it was very plain that she was long practised as only a woman grown can be in dressing well the oldest of the arts and had her touch of primal joy in the excellence of the body that was so admirably curved now in the attitude of embraced knees With the suggestion of French taste in her clothes she made a very modern figure seated there until one looked at her face and saw the glow and triumph of all vigorous beings that ever faced sun and wind and sea together in the prime of the year One saw too a womanhood unmixed and vigorous unconsciously sure of itself Trent who had halted only for a moment in the surprise of seeing the woman in black had passed by on the cliff above her perceiving and feeling as he went the things set down At all times his keen vision and active brain took in and tasted details with an easy swiftness that was marvelous to men of slower chemistry the need to stare he held was evidence of blindness Now the feeling of beauty was awakened and exultant and doubled the power of his sense In these instants a picture was printed on his memory that would never pass away As he went by unheard on the turf the woman still alone with her thoughts suddenly moved She unclasped her long hands from about her knees stretched her limbs and body with feline grace then slowly raised her head and extended her arms with open curving fingers as if to gather to her all the glory and overwhelming sanity of the morning This was a gesture not to be mistaken it was a gesture of freedom the movement of a soul s resolution to be to possess to go forward perhaps to enjoy So he saw her for an instant as he passed and he did not turn He knew suddenly who the woman must be and it was as if a curtain of gloom were drawn between him and the splendor of the day You were planning to go to White Gables before the inquest I think remarked Trent to mister Cupples as they finished their breakfast You ought to be off if you are to get back to the court in time I have something to attend to there myself so we might walk up together I will just go and get my camera By all means mister Cupples answered and they set off at once in the ever growing warmth of the morning The roof of White Gables a surly patch of dull red against the dark trees seemed to harmonize with Trent s mood he felt heavy sinister and troubled If a blow must fall that might strike down that creature radiant of beauty and life whom he had seen that morning he did not wish it to come from his hand An exaggerated chivalry had lived in him since the first teachings of his mother but at this moment the horror of bruising anything so lovely was almost as much the artist s revulsion as the gentleman s On the other hand was the hunt to end in nothing The quality of the affair was such that the thought of forbearance was an agony There never was such a case and he alone he was confident held the truth of it under his hand At least he determined that day should show whether what he believed was a delusion He would trample his compunction underfoot until he was quite sure that there was any call for it That same morning he would know As they entered at the gate of the drive they saw Marlowe and the American standing in talk before the front door In the shadow of the porch was the lady in black She saw them and came gravely forward over the lawn moving as Trent had known that she would move erect and balanced stepping lightly When she welcomed him on mister Cupples presentation her eyes of golden flecked brown observed him kindly In her pale composure worn as the mask of distress there was no trace of the emotion that had seemed a halo about her head on the ledge of the cliff She spoke the appropriate commonplace in a low and even voice After a few words to mister Cupples she turned her eyes on Trent again I hope you will succeed she said earnestly Do you think you will succeed He made his mind up as the words left her lips He said I believe I shall do so missus Manderson When I have the case sufficiently complete I shall ask you to let me see you and tell you about it It may be necessary to consult you before the facts are published She looked puzzled and distress showed for an instant in her eyes If it is necessary of course you shall do so she said On the brink of his next speech Trent hesitated He remembered that the lady had not wished to repeat to him the story already given to the inspector or to be questioned at all He was not unconscious that he desired to hear her voice and watch her face a little longer if it might be but the matter he had to mention really troubled his mind it was a queer thing that fitted nowhere into the pattern within whose corners he had by this time brought the other queer things in the case It was very possible that she could explain it away in a breath it was unlikely that any one else could He summoned his resolution You have been so kind he said in allowing me access to the house and every opportunity of studying the case that I am going to ask leave to put a question or two to yourself nothing that you would rather not answer I think May I She glanced at him wearily It would be stupid of me to refuse Ask your questions mister Trent It s only this said Trent hurriedly We know that your husband lately drew an unusually large sum of ready money from his London bankers and was keeping it here It is here now in fact Have you any idea why he should have done that She opened her eyes in astonishment I cannot imagine she said I did not know he had done so I am very much surprised to hear it Why is it surprising I thought my husband had very little money in the house On Sunday night just before he went out in the motor he came into the drawing room where I was sitting He seemed to be irritated about something and asked me at once if I had any notes or gold I could let him have until next day I was surprised at that because he was never without money he made it a rule to carry a hundred pounds or so about him always in a note case I unlocked my escritoire and gave him all I had by me It was nearly thirty pounds And he did not tell you why he wanted it No He put it in his pocket and then said that mister Marlowe had persuaded him to go for a run in the motor by moonlight and he thought it might help him to sleep He had been sleeping badly as perhaps you know Then he went off with mister Marlowe I thought it odd he should need money on Sunday night but I soon forgot about it I never remembered it again until now It was curious certainly said Trent staring into the distance mister Cupples began to speak to his niece of the arrangements for the inquest and Trent moved away to where Marlowe was pacing slowly upon the lawn The young man seemed relieved to talk about the coming business of the day Though he still seemed tired out and nervous he showed himself not without a quiet humor in describing the pomposities of the local police and the portentous airs of doctor Stock Trent turned the conversation gradually toward the problem of the crime and all Marlowe s gravity returned Bunner has told me what he thinks he said when Trent referred to the American s theory I don t find myself convinced by it because it doesn t really explain some of the oddest facts But I have lived long enough in the United States to know that such a stroke of revenge done in a secret melodramatic way is not an unlikely thing It is quite a characteristic feature of certain sections of the labor movement there Americans have a taste and a talent for that sort of business Do you know Huckleberry Finn Do I know my own name exclaimed Trent Well I think the most American thing in that great American epic is Tom Sawyer s elaboration of an extremely difficult and romantic scheme taking days to carry out for securing the escape of the nigger Jim which could have been managed quite easily in twenty minutes You know how fond they are of lodges and brotherhoods Every college club has its secret signs and handgrips You ve heard of the Know Nothing movement in politics I dare say and the Ku Klux Klan Then look at Brigham Young s penny dreadful tyranny in Utah with real blood The founders of the Mormon state were of the purest Yankee stock in America and you know what they did It s all part of the same mental tendency Americans make fun of it among themselves For my part I take it very seriously It can have a very hideous side to it certainly said Trent when you get it in connection with crime Or with vice Or even mere luxury But I have a sort of sneaking respect for the determination to make life interesting and lively in spite of civilization To return to the matter in hand however has it struck you as a possibility that Manderson s mind was affected to some extent by this menace that Bunner believes in For instance it was rather an extraordinary thing to send you posting off like that in the middle of the night About ten o clock to be exact replied Marlowe Though mind you if he d actually roused me out of my bed at midnight I shouldn t have been very much surprised It all chimes in with what we ve just been saying Manderson wasn t mad in the least but he had a strong streak of the national taste for dramatic proceedings he was rather fond of his well earned reputation for unexpected strokes and for going for his object with ruthless directness through every opposing consideration He had decided suddenly that he wanted to have word from this man Harris Who is Harris interjected Trent Nobody knows Even Bunner never heard of him and can t imagine what the business in hand was All I know is that when I went up to London last week to attend to various things I booked a deck cabin at Manderson s request for a mister George Harris on the boat that sailed on Monday It seems that Manderson suddenly found he wanted news from Harris which presumably was of a character too secret for the telegraph and there was no train that served so I was sent off as you know Trent looked round to make sure that they were not overheard then faced the other gravely There is one thing I may tell you he said quietly that I don t think you know Martin the butler caught a few words at the end of your conversation with Manderson in the orchard before you started with him in the car He heard him say If Harris is there every moment is of importance Now mister Marlowe you know my business here I am sent to make inquiries and you mustn t take offense I want to ask you if in the face of that sentence you will repeat that you know nothing of what the business was Marlowe shook his head I know nothing indeed I m not easily offended and your question is quite fair What passed during that conversation I have already told the detective Manderson plainly said to me that he could not tell me what it was all about He simply wanted me to find Harris tell him that he desired to know how matters stood and bring back a letter or message from him Harris I was further told might not turn up If he did every moment was of importance And now you know as much as I do That talk took place before he told his wife that you were taking him for a moonlight run Why did he conceal your errand in that way I wonder The young man made a gesture of helplessness Why I can guess no better than you Why muttered Trent as if to himself gazing on the ground did he conceal it from missus Manderson He looked up at Marlowe And from Martin the other amended coolly He was told the same thing With a sudden movement of his head Trent seemed to dismiss the subject He drew from his breast pocket a letter case and thence extracted two small leaves of clean fresh paper Just look at these two slips mister Marlowe he said Did you ever see them before Have you any idea where they come from he added as Marlowe took one in each hand and examined them curiously They seem to have been cut with a knife or scissors from a small diary for this year from the October pages Marlowe observed looking them over on both sides I see no writing of any kind on them Nobody here has any such diary so far as I know What about them There may be nothing in it Trent said dubiously Any one in the house of course might have such a diary without your having seen it But I didn t much expect you would be able to identify the leaves in fact I should have been surprised if you had He stopped speaking as missus Manderson came towards them My uncle thinks we should be going now she said I think I will walk on with mister Bunner mister Cupples said as he joined them There are certain business matters that must be disposed of as soon as possible Will you come on with these two gentlemen Mabel We will wait for you before we reach the place Trent turned to her missus Manderson will excuse me I hope he said I really came up this morning in order to look about me here for some indications I thought I might possibly find I had not thought of attending the the court just yet She looked at him with eyes of perfect candor Of course mister Trent Please do exactly as you wish We are all relying upon you If you will wait a few moments mister Marlowe I shall be ready She entered the house Her uncle and the American had already strolled towards the gate Trent looked into the eyes of his companion That is a wonderful woman he said in a lowered voice You say so without knowing her replied Marlowe in a similar tone She is more than that Trent said nothing to this He stared out over the fields towards the sea In the silence a noise of hobnailed haste rose on the still air A little distance down the road a boy appeared trotting towards them from the direction of the hotel In his hand was the orange envelope unmistakable afar off of a telegram Trent watched him with a carefully indifferent eye as he met and passed the two others Then he turned to Marlowe Apropos of nothing in particular he said were you at Oxford Yes said the young man Why do you ask I just wondered if I was right in my guess It s one of the things you can very often tell about a man isn t it I suppose so Marlowe admitted Well each of us is marked in one way or another perhaps I should have said you were an artist if I hadn t known it Why Does my hair want cutting Oh no It s only that you look at things and people as I ve seen artists do with an eye that moves steadily from detail to detail rather looking them over than looking at them The boy came up panting Telegram for you sir he said to Trent Just come sir Trent tore open the envelop with an apology and his eyes lighted up so visibly as he read the slip that Marlowe s tired face softened in a smile It must be good news he murmured half to himself Trent turned on him a glance in which nothing could be read Not exactly news he said It only tells me that another little guess of mine was a good one CHAPTER VII THE INQUEST The coroner who fully realized that for that one day of his life as a provincial solicitor he was living in the gaze of the world had resolved to be worthy of the fleeting eminence He was a large man of jovial temper with a strong interest in the dramatic aspects of his work and the news of Manderson s mysterious death within his jurisdiction had made him the happiest coroner in England 
5789_70653_000012_000002	train-clean-100	A respectable capacity for marshaling facts was fortified in him by a copiousness of impressive language that made juries as clay in his hands and sometimes disguised a doubtful interpretation of the rules of evidence 
none	none	The court was held in a long unfurnished room lately built onto the hotel and intended to serve as a ball room or concert hall A regiment of reporters was entrenched in the front seats and those who were to be called on to give evidence occupied chairs to one side of the table behind which the coroner sat while the jury in double row with plastered hair and a spurious ease of manner flanked him on the other side An undistinguished public filled the rest of the space and listened in an awed silence to the opening solemnities The newspaper men well used to these muttered among themselves Those of them who knew Trent by sight assured the rest that he was not in the court The identity of the dead man was proved by his wife the first witness called from whom the coroner after some inquiry into the health and circumstances of the deceased proceeded to draw an account of the last occasion on which she had seen her husband alive missus Manderson was taken through her evidence by the coroner with the sympathy which every man felt for that dark figure of grief She lifted her thick veil before beginning to speak and the extreme paleness and unbroken composure of the lady produced a singular impression 
5789_70653_000014_000003	train-clean-100	This was not an impression of hardness 
none	none	Interesting femininity was the first thing to be felt in her presence She was not even enigmatic It was only clear that the force of a powerful character was at work to master the emotions of her situation Once or twice as she spoke she touched her eyes with her handkerchief but her voice was low and clear to the end 
5789_70653_000015_000000	train-clean-100	Her husband she said had come up to his bedroom about his usual hour for retiring on the Sunday night 
none	none	His room was really a dressing room attached to her own bedroom communicating with it by a door which was usually kept open during the night Both dressing room and bedroom were entered by other doors giving on the passage Her husband had always had a preference for the greatest simplicity in his bedroom arrangements and liked to sleep in a small room She had not been awake when he came up but had been half aroused as usually happened when the light was switched on in her husband s room 
5789_70653_000015_000005	train-clean-100	She had spoken to him 
none	none	She had no clear recollection of what she had said as she had been very drowsy at the time but she had remembered that he had been out for a moonlight run in the car and she believed she had asked whether he had had a good run and what time it was She had asked what the time was because she felt as if she had only been a very short time asleep and she had expected her husband to be out very late In answer to her question he had told her it was half past eleven and had gone on to say that he had changed his mind about going for a run
5789_70653_000016_000000	train-clean-100	 Did he say why the coroner asked 
5789_70653_000017_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes replied the lady he did explain why 
none	none	I remember very well what he said because she stopped with a little appearance of confusion
5789_70653_000018_000000	train-clean-100	 Because the coroner insisted gently 
none	none	Because my husband was not as a rule communicative about his business affairs answered the witness raising her chin with a faint touch of defiance He did not did not think they would interest me and as a rule referred to them as little as possible That is why I was rather surprised when he told me that he had sent mister Marlowe to Southampton to bring back some important information from a man who was leaving for Paris by the next day s boat He said that mister Marlowe could do it quite easily if he had no accident He said that he had started in the car and then walked back home a mile or so and felt all the better for it Did he say any more Nothing as well as I remember the witness said I was very sleepy and I dropped off again in a few moments I just remember my husband turning his light out and that is all I never saw him again alive And you heard nothing in the night No I never woke until my maid brought my tea in the morning at seven o clock She closed the door leading to my husband s room as she always did and I supposed him to be still there He always needed a great deal of sleep He sometimes slept until quite late in the morning I had breakfast in my sitting room It was about ten when I heard that my husband s body had been found The witness dropped her head and silently waited for her dismissal 
5789_70653_000024_000000	train-clean-100	But it was not to be yet 
none	none	missus Manderson The coroner s voice was sympathetic but it had a hint of firmness in it now The question I am going to put to you must in these sad circumstances be a painful one but it is my duty to ask it Is it the fact that your relations with your late husband had not been for some time past relations of mutual affection and confidence 
5789_70653_000025_000002	train-clean-100	Is it the fact that there was an estrangement between you 
none	none	The lady drew herself up again and faced her questioner the color rising in her cheeks If that question is necessary she said with cold distinctness I will answer it so that there shall be no misunderstanding During the last few months of my husband s life his attitude towards me had given me great anxiety and sorrow 
5789_70653_000026_000003	train-clean-100	He had changed towards me he had become very reserved and seemed mistrustful I saw much less of him than before he seemed to prefer to be alone 
none	none	I can give no explanation at all of the change I tried to work against it I did all I could with justice to my own dignity as I thought Something was between us I did not know what and he never told me My own obstinate pride prevented me from asking what it was in so many words I only made a point of being to him exactly as I had always been so far as he would allow me I suppose I shall never know now what it was The witness whose voice had trembled in spite of her self control over the last few sentences drew down her veil when she had said this and stood erect and quiet One of the jury asked a question not without obvious hesitation Then was there never anything of the nature of what they call Words between you and your husband ma am Never The word was colorlessly spoken but everyone felt that a crass misunderstanding of the possibilities of conduct in the case of a person like missus Manderson had been visited with some severity Did she know the coroner asked of any other matter which might have been preying upon her husband s mind recently missus Manderson knew of none whatever The coroner intimated that her ordeal was at an end and the veiled lady made her way to the door The general attention which followed her for a few moments was now eagerly directed upon Martin whom the coroner had proceeded to call It was at this moment that Trent appeared at the doorway and edged his way into the great room But he did not look at Martin He was observing the well balanced figure that came quickly toward him along an opening path in the crowd and his eye was gloomy He started as he stood aside from the door with a slight bow to hear missus Manderson address him by name in a low voice He followed her a pace or two into the hall I wanted to ask you she said in a voice now weak and oddly broken if you would give me your arm a part of the way to the house I could not see my uncle near the door and I suddenly felt rather faint I shall be better in the air No no I cannot stay here please mister Trent she said as he began to make an obvious suggestion I must go to the house Her hand tightened momentarily on his arm as if for all her weakness she could drag him from the place then again she leaned heavily upon it and with that support and with bent head she walked slowly from the hotel and along the oak shaded path toward White Gables Trent went in silence his thoughts whirling dancing insanely to a chorus of Fool fool All that he alone knew all that he guessed and suspected of this affair rushed through his brain in a rout but the touch of her unnerved hand upon his arm never for an instant left his consciousness filling him with an exaltation that enraged and bewildered him He was still cursing himself furiously behind the mask of conventional solicitude that he turned to the lady when he had attended her to the house and seen her sink upon a couch in the morning room Raising her veil she thanked him gravely and frankly with a look of sincere gratitude in her eyes She was much better now she said and a cup of tea would work a miracle upon her She hoped she had not taken him away from anything important 
5789_70653_000033_000005	train-clean-100	She was ashamed of herself she thought she could go through with it but she had not expected those last questions 
none	none	I am glad you did not hear me she said when he explained But of course you will read it all in the reports 
5789_70653_000033_000008	train-clean-100	It shook me so to have to speak of that she added simply and to keep from making an exhibition of myself took it out of me 
none	none	And all those staring men by the door Thank you again for helping me when I asked you I thought I might she ended queerly with a little tired smile and Trent took himself away his hand still quivering from the cool touch of her fingers CHAPTER VIII A HOT SCENT Come in called Trent mister Cupples entered his sitting room at the hotel It was the early evening of the day on which the coroner s jury without leaving the box had pronounced the expected denunciation of a person or persons unknown Trent with a hasty glance upward continued his intent study of what lay in a photographic dish of enameled metal which he moved slowly about in the light of the window He looked very pale and his movements were nervous Sit on the sofa he advised The chairs are a job lot bought at the sale after the suppression of the Holy Inquisition in Spain This is a pretty good negative he went on holding it up to the light with his head at the angle of discriminating judgment Washed enough now I think Let us leave it to dry and get rid of all this mess mister Cupples as the other busily cleared the table of a confusion of basins dishes racks boxes and bottles picked up first one and then another of the objects and studied them with innocent curiosity That is called hypo eliminator said Trent as mister Cupples uncorked and smelled at one of the bottles Very useful when you re in a hurry with a negative I shouldn t drink it though all the same It eliminates sodium hypophosphite but I shouldn t wonder if it would eliminate human beings too He found a place for the last of the litter on the crowded mantel shelf and came to sit before mister Cupples on the table The great thing about a hotel sitting room is that its beauty does not distract the mind from work It is no place for the May fly pleasures of a mind at ease Have you ever been in this room before Cupples I have hundreds of times It has pursued me all over England for years I should feel lost without it if in some fantastic far off hotel they were to give me some other sitting room Look at this table cover there is the ink I spilled on it when I had this room in Halifax I burnt that hole in the carpet when I had it in Ipswich But I see they have mended the glass over the picture of Silent Sympathy which I threw a boot at in Banbury I do all my best work here This afternoon for instance since the inquest I have finished several excellent negatives There is a very good dark room downstairs The inquest that reminds me said mister Cupples who knew that this sort of talk in Trent meant the excitement of action and was wondering what he could be about I came in to thank you my dear fellow for looking after Mabel this morning I had no idea she was going to feel ill after leaving the box she seemed quite unmoved and really she is a woman of such extraordinary self command I thought I could leave her to her own devices and hear out the evidence which I thought it important I should do It was a very fortunate thing she found a friend to assist her and she is most grateful She is quite herself again now Trent with his hands in his pockets and a slight frown on his brow made no reply to this I tell you what he said after a short pause I was just getting to the really interesting part of the job when you came in Come would you like to see a little bit of high class police work It s the very same kind of work that old Murch ought to be doing at this moment Perhaps he is but I hope to glory he isn t He sprang off the table and disappeared into his bedroom Presently he came out with a large drawing board on which a number of heterogeneous objects was ranged First I must introduce you to these little things he said setting them out on the table Here is a big ivory paper knife here are two leaves cut out of a diary my own diary here is a bottle containing dentifrice here is a little case of polished walnut Some of these things have to be put back where they belong in somebody s bedroom at White Gables before night That s the sort of man I am nothing stops me I borrowed them this very morning when everyone was down at the inquest and I dare say some people would think it rather an odd proceeding if they knew Now there remains one object on the board Can you tell me without touching it what it is Certainly I can said mister Cupples peering at it with great interest It is an ordinary glass bowl It looks like a finger bowl I see nothing odd about it he added after some moments of close scrutiny That replied Trent is exactly where the fun comes in Now take this little fat bottle Cupples and pull out the cork Do you recognize that powder inside it You have swallowed pounds of it in your time I expect They give it to babies Gray powder is its ordinary name mercury and chalk It is great stuff Now while I hold the basin side ways over this sheet of paper I want you to pour a little powder out of the bottle over this part of the bowl just here Perfect Sir Edward Henry himself could not have handled the powder better You have done this before Cupples I can see You are an old hand I really am not said mister Cupples seriously as Trent returned the fallen powder to the bottle I assure you it is all a complete mystery to me What did I do then I brush the powdered part of the bowl lightly with this camel hair brush Now look at it again You saw nothing odd about it before Do you see anything now mister Cupples peered again How curious he said Yes there are two large gray finger marks on the bowl They were not there before I am Hawkshaw the detective observed Trent Would it interest you to hear a short lecture on the subject of glass finger bowls When you take one up with your hand you leave traces upon it usually practically invisible which may remain for days or months You leave the marks of your fingers The human hand even when quite clean is never quite dry and sometimes in moments of great anxiety for instance Cupples it is very moist It leaves a mark on any cold smooth surface it may touch That bowl was moved by somebody with a rather moist hand quite lately He sprinkled the powder again Here on the other side you see is the thumb mark very good impressions all of them He spoke without raising his voice but mister Cupples could perceive that he was ablaze with excitement as he stared at the faint gray marks This one should be the index finger I need not tell a man of your knowledge of the world that the pattern of it is a single spiral whorl with deltas symmetrically disposed This the print of the second finger is a simple loop with a staple core and fifteen counts I know there are fifteen because I have just the same two prints on this negative which I have examined in detail Look he held one of the negatives up to the light of the declining sun and demonstrated with a pencil point You can see they re the same You see the bifurcation of that ridge There it is in the other You see that little scar near the center There it is in the other There are a score of ridge characteristics on which an expert would swear in the witness box that the marks on that bowl and the marks I have photographed on this negative were made by the same hand And where did you photograph them What does it all mean asked mister Cupples wide eyed I found them on the inside of the left hand leaf of the front window in missus Manderson s bedroom As I could not bring the window with me I photographed them sticking a bit of black paper on the other side of the glass for the purpose The bowl comes from Manderson s room It is the bowl in which his false teeth were placed at night I could bring that away so I did But those cannot be Mabel s finger marks I should think not said Trent with decision They are twice the size of any print missus Manderson could make Then they must be her husband s Perhaps they are Now shall we see if we can match them once more I believe we can Whistling faintly and very white in the face Trent opened another small squat bottle containing a dense black powder Lamp black he explained Hold a bit of paper in your hand for a second or two and this little chap will show you the pattern of your fingers He carefully took up with a pair of tweezers one of the leaves cut from his diary and held it out for the other to examine No marks appeared on the leaf He tilted some of the powder out upon one surface of the paper then turning it over upon the other then shook the leaf gently to rid it of the loose powder He held it out to mister Cupples in silence On one side of the paper appeared unmistakably clearly printed in black the same two finger prints that he had already seen on the bowl and on the photographic plate He took up the bowl and compared them Trent turned the paper over and on the other side was a bold black replica of the thumb mark that was printed in gray on the glass in his hand Same man you see Trent said with a short laugh I felt that it must be so and now I know He walked to the window and looked out Now I know he repeated in a low voice as if to himself His tone was bitter mister Cupples understanding nothing stared at his motionless back for a few moments I am still completely in the dark he ventured presently I have often heard of this finger print business and wondered how the police went to work about it It is of extraordinary interest to me but upon my life I cannot see how in this case Manderson s finger prints are going I am very sorry Cupples Trent broke in upon his meditative speech with a swift return to the table When I began this investigation I meant to take you with me every step of the way You mustn t think I have any doubts about your discretion if I say now that I must hold my tongue about the whole thing at least for a time I will tell you this I have come upon a fact that looks too much like having terrible consequences if it is discovered by any one else He looked at the other with a hard and darkened face and struck the table with his hand It is terrible for me here and now Up to this moment I was hoping against hope that I was wrong about the fact I may still be wrong in the surmise that I base upon that fact There is only one way of finding out that is open to me and I must nerve myself to take it He smiled suddenly at mister Cupples face of consternation All right I m not going to be tragic any more and I ll tell you all about it when I can Look here I m not half through my game with the powder bottles yet He drew one of the defamed chairs to the table and sat down to test the broad ivory blade of the paper knife mister Cupples swallowing his amazement bent forward in an attitude of deep interest and handed Trent the bottle of lamp black CHAPTER IX THE WIFE OF DIVES missus Manderson stood at the window of her sitting room at White Gables gazing out upon a wavering landscape of fine rain and mist The weather had broken as it seldom does in that part in June White wreathings drifted up the fields from the sullen sea the sky was an unbroken gray deadness shedding pin point moisture that was now and then blown against the panes with a crepitation of despair The lady looked out on the dim and chilling prospect with a woeful face It was a bad day for a woman bereaved alone and without a purpose in life There was a knock and she called Come in drawing herself up with an unconscious gesture that always came when she realized that the weariness of the world had been gaining upon her spirit mister Trent had called the maid said he apologized for coming at such an early hour but hoped that missus Manderson would see him on a matter of urgent importance missus Manderson would see mister Trent She walked to a mirror looked into the olive face she saw reflected there shook her head at herself with the flicker of a grimace and turned to the door as Trent was shown in His appearance she noted was changed He had the jaded look of the sleepless and a new and reserved expression in which her quick sensibilities felt something not propitious took the place of his half smile of fixed good humor May I come to the point at once he said when she had given him her hand There is a train I ought to catch at Bishopsbridge at twelve o clock but I cannot go until I have settled this thing which concerns you only missus Manderson I have been working half the night and thinking the rest and I know now what I ought to do You look wretchedly tired she said kindly Won t you sit down this is a very restful chair Of course it is about this terrible business and your work as correspondent Please ask me anything you think I can properly tell you mister Trent I know that you won t make it worse for me than you can help in doing your duty here If you say you must see me about something I know it must be because as you say you ought to do it missus Manderson said Trent slowly measuring his words I won t make it worse for you than I can help But I am bound to make it bad for you only between ourselves I hope As to whether you can properly tell me what I shall ask you you will decide that but I tell you this on my word of honor I shall ask you only as much as will decide me whether to publish or to withhold certain grave things that I have found out about your husband s death things not suspected by any one else nor I think likely to be so What I have discovered what I believe that I have practically proved will be a great shock to you in any case But it may be worse for you than that and if you give me reason to think it would be so then I shall destroy this manuscript he laid a long envelop on the small table beside him and nothing of what it has to tell shall ever be printed It consists I may tell you of a short private note to my editor followed by a long despatch for publication in the Record Now you may refuse to say anything to me If you do refuse my duty to my employers as I see it is to take this up to London with me to day and leave it with my editor to be dealt with at his discretion My view is you understand that I am not entitled to suppress it on the strength of a mere possibility that presents itself to my imagination But if I gather from you and I can gather it from no other person that there is substance in that imaginary possibility I speak of then I have only one thing to do as a gentleman and as one who he hesitated for a phrase wishes you well I shall suppress that despatch of mine In some directions I decline to assist the police Have you followed me so far he asked with a touch of anxiety in his careful coldness for her face but for its pallor gave no sign as she regarded him her hands clasped before her and her shoulders drawn back in a pose of rigid calm She looked precisely as she had looked at the inquest I understand quite well said missus Manderson in a low voice She drew a deep breath and went on I don t know what dreadful thing you have found out or what the possibility that has occurred to you can be but it was good it was honorable of you to come to me about it Now will you please tell me I cannot do that Trent replied The secret is my newspaper s if it is not yours If I find it is yours you shall have my manuscript to read and destroy Believe me he broke out with something of his old warmth I detest such mystery making from the bottom of my soul but it is not I who have made this mystery This is the most painful hour of my life and you make it worse by not treating me like a hound The first thing I ask you to tell me he reverted with an effort to his colorless tone is this is it true as you stated at the inquest that you had no idea at all of the reason why your late husband had changed his attitude toward you and become mistrustful and reserved during the last few months of his life missus Manderson s dark brows lifted and her eyes flamed she quickly rose from her chair Trent got up at the same moment and took his envelop from the table his manner said that he perceived the interview to be at an end But she held up a hand and there was color in her cheeks and quick breathing in her voice as she said Do you know what you ask mister Trent You ask me if I perjured myself I do he answered unmoved and he added after a pause You knew already that I had not come here to preserve the polite fictions missus Manderson The theory that no reputable person being on oath could withhold a part of the truth under any circumstances is a polite fiction He still stood as awaiting dismissal but she was silent She walked to the window and he stood miserably watching the slight movement of her shoulders until it subsided Then with face averted looking out on the dismal weather she spoke at last clearly mister Trent she said you inspire confidence in people and I feel that things which I don t want known or talked about are safe with you And I know you must have a very serious reason for doing what you are doing though I don t know what it is I suppose it would be assisting justice in some way if I told you the truth about what you asked me just now To understand that truth you ought to know about what went before I mean about my marriage After all a good many people could tell you as well as I can that it was not a very successful union I was only twenty I admired his force and courage and certainty he was the only strong man I had ever known But it did not take me long to find out that he cared for his business more than for me and I think I found out even sooner that I had been deceiving myself and blinding myself promising myself impossible things and wilfully misunderstanding my own feelings because I was dazzled by the idea of having more money to spend than an English girl ever dreams of I have been despising myself for that for five years My husband s feeling for me well I cannot speak of that what I want to say is that along with it there had always been a belief of his that I was the sort of woman to take a great place in society and that I should throw myself into it with enjoyment and become a sort of personage and do him great credit that was his idea and the idea remained with him after other delusions had gone I was a part of his ambition That was his really bitter disappointment that I failed him as a social success I think he was too shrewd not to have known in his heart that such a man as he was twenty years older than I with great business responsibilities that filled every hour of his life and caring for nothing else he must have felt that there was a risk of great unhappiness in marrying the sort of girl I was brought up to music and books and unpractical ideas always enjoying myself in my own way But he had really reckoned on me as a wife who would do the honors of his position in the world and I found I couldn t missus Manderson had talked herself into a more emotional mood than she had yet shown to Trent Her words flowed freely and her voice had begun to ring and give play to a natural expressiveness that must hitherto have been dulled he thought by the shock and self restraint of the past few days Now she turned swiftly from the window and faced him as she went on her beautiful face flushed and animated her eyes gleaming her hands moving in slight emphatic gestures as she surrendered herself to the impulse of giving speech to things long pent up The people she said Oh those people Can you imagine what it must be for any one who has lived in a world where there was always creative work in the background work with some dignity about it men and women with professions or arts to follow with ideals and things to believe in and quarrel about some of them wealthy some of them quite poor can you think what it means to step out of that into another world where you have to be very rich shamefully rich to exist at all where money is the only thing that counts and the first thing in everybody s thoughts where the men who make the millions are so jaded by the work that sport is the only thing they can occupy themselves with when they have any leisure and the men who don t have to work are even duller than the men who do and vicious as well and the women live for display and silly amusements and silly immoralities do you know how awful that life is Of course I know there are clever people and people of taste in that set but they re swamped and spoiled and it s the same thing in the end empty empty Oh I suppose I m exaggerating and I did make friends and have some happy times but that s how I feel after it all The seasons in New York and London How I hated them And our house parties and cruises in the yacht and the rest the same people the same emptiness And you see don t you that my husband couldn t have an idea of all this His life was never empty He did not live it in society and when he was in society he had always his business plans and difficulties to occupy his mind He hadn t a suspicion of what I felt and I never let him know I couldn t it wouldn t have been fair I felt I must do something to justify myself as his wife sharing his position and fortune and the only thing I could do was to try and try to live up to his idea about my social qualities I did try I acted my best And it became harder year by year I never was what they call a popular hostess how could I be I was a failure but I went on trying I used to steal holidays now and then I used to feel as if I was not doing my part of a bargain it sounds horrid to put it like that I know but it was so when I took one of my old school friends who couldn t afford to travel away to Italy for a month or two and we went about cheaply all by ourselves and were quite happy or when I went and made a long stay in London with some quiet people who had known me all my life and we all lived just as in the old days when we had to think twice about seats at the theater and told each other about cheap dress makers Those and a few other expeditions of the same sort were my best times after I was married and they helped me to go through with it the rest of the time But I felt my husband would have hated to know how much I enjoyed every hour of those returns to the old life And in the end in spite of everything I could do he came to know He could see through anything I think once his attention was turned to it He had always been able to see that I was not fulfilling his idea of me as a figure in the social world and I suppose he thought it was my misfortune rather than my fault But the moment he began to see in spite of my pretending that I wasn t playing my part with any spirit he knew the whole story he divined how I loathed and was weary of the luxury and the brilliancy and the masses of money just because of the people who lived among them who were made so by them I suppose It happened last year I don t know just how or when It may have been suggested to him by some woman for they all understood of course He said nothing to me and I think he tried not to change in his manner to me at first but such things hurt and it was working in both of us I knew that he knew After a time we were just being polite and considerate to each other Before he found me out we had been on a footing of how can I express it to you of intelligent companionship I might say We talked without restraint of many things of the kind we could agree or disagree about without its going very deep if you understand And then that came to an end I felt that the only possible basis of our living in each other s company was going under my feet And at last it was gone It had been like that she ended simply for months before he died She sank into the corner of a sofa by the window as though relaxing her body after an effort For a few moments both were silent Trent was hastily sorting out a tangle of impressions He was amazed at the frankness of missus Manderson s story He was amazed at the vigorous expressiveness in her telling of it In this vivid being carried away by an impulse to speak talking with her whole personality he had seen the real woman in a temper of activity as he had already seen the real woman by chance in a temper of reverie and unguarded emotion In both she was very unlike the pale self disciplined creature of majesty that she had been to the world With that amazement of his went something like terror of her dark beauty which excitement kindled into an appearance scarcely mortal in his eyes Incongruously there rushed into his mind occupied as it was with the affair of the moment a little knot of ideas she was unique not because of her beauty but because of its being united with intensity of nature in England all the very beautiful women were placid all the fiery women seemed to have burnt up the best of their beauty that was why no beautiful woman had ever cast this sort of spell on him before when it was a question of wit in women he had preferred the brighter flame to the duller without much regarding the lamp All this is very disputable said his reason and instinct answered Yes except that I am under a spell and a deeper instinct cried out Away with it He forced his mind back to her story and found growing swiftly in him an irrepressible conviction It was all very fine but it would not do I feel as if I had led you into saying more than you meant to say or than I wanted to learn he said slowly But there is one brutal question which is the whole point of my inquiry He braced his frame like one preparing for a plunge into cold waters missus Manderson will you assure me that your husband s change toward you had nothing to do with John Marlowe And what he had dreaded came Oh she cried with a sound of anguish her face thrown up and open hands stretched out as if for pity and then the hands covered the burning face and she flung herself aside among the cushions at her elbow so that he saw nothing but her heavy crown of black hair and her body moving with sobs that stabbed his heart and a foot turned inward gracefully in an abandonment of misery Like a tall tower suddenly breaking apart she had fallen in ruins helplessly weeping Trent stood up his face white and calm With a senseless particularity he placed his envelop exactly in the center of the little polished table He walked to the door closed it noiselessly as he went out and in a few minutes was tramping through the rain out of sight of White Gables going nowhere seeing nothing his soul shaken in the fierce effort to kill and trample the raving impulse that had seized him in the presence of her shame that clamored to him to drag himself before her feet to pray for pardon to pour out words he knew not what words but he knew that they had been straining at his lips to wreck his self respect forever and hopelessly defeat even the crazy purpose that had almost possessed him by drowning her wretchedness in disgust by babbling with the tongue of infatuation to a woman with a husband not yet buried to a woman who loved another man Such was the magic of her tears quickening in a moment the thing which as his heart had known he must not let come to life For Philip Trent was a young man younger in nature even than his years and a way of life that kept his edge keen and his spirit volcanic had prepared him very ill for the meeting that comes once in the early manhood of most of us usually as in his case he told himself harshly to no purpose but the testing of virtue and the power of the will CHAPTER X HITHERTO UNPUBLISHED Being the report which was not sent to the Record Marlstone June sixteenth My Dear Molloy This is in case I don t find you at your office I have found out who killed Manderson as this despatch will show That was my problem yours is to decide what use to make of it It definitely charges an unsuspected person with having a hand in the crime and practically accuses him of being the murderer so I don t suppose you will publish it before his arrest and I believe it is illegal to do so afterwards until he has been tried and found guilty You may decide to publish it then and you may find it possible to make some use or other before then of the facts I have given That is your affair Meanwhile will you communicate with Scotland Yard and let them see what I have written I have done with the Manderson mystery and I wish to God I had never touched it Here follows my despatch P T I begin this my third and probably my final despatch to the Record upon the Manderson murder with conflicting feelings I have a strong sense of relief because in my two previous despatches I was obliged in the interests of justice to withhold facts ascertained by me which would if published then have put a certain person upon his guard and possibly have led to his escape for he is a man of no common boldness and resource Those facts I shall now set forth But I have I confess no liking for the story of treachery and perverted cleverness which I have to tell It leaves an evil taste in the mouth a savor of something revolting in the deeper puzzle of motive underlying the puzzle of the crime itself which I believe I have solved It will be remembered that in my first despatch I described the situation as I found it on reaching this place early on Tuesday morning I told how the body was found and in what state dwelt upon the complete mystery surrounding the crime and mentioned one or two local theories about it gave some account of the dead man s domestic surroundings and furnished a somewhat detailed description of his movements on the evening before his death I gave too a little fact which may or may not have seemed irrelevant that a quantity of whisky much larger than Manderson habitually drank at night had disappeared from his private decanter since the last time he was seen alive On the following day the day of the inquest I wired little more than an abstract of the proceedings in the coroner s court of which a verbatim report was made at my request by other representatives of the Record and it will be remembered that the police evidence showed that two revolvers with either of which the crime might have been committed had been found one in Manderson s bureau and the other in the room of the secretary Marlowe but that no importance could be attached to this as the weapons were of an extremely popular make I write these lines in the last hours of the same day and I have now completed an investigation which has led me directly to the man who must be called upon to clear himself of the guilt of the death of Manderson Apart from the central mystery of Manderson s having arisen long before his usual hour to go out and meet his death there were two minor points of oddity about this affair which I suppose must have occurred to thousands of those who have read the accounts in the newspapers points apparent from the very beginning The first of these was that whereas the body was found at a spot not thirty yards from the house all the people of the house declared that they had heard no cry or other noise in the night Manderson had not been gagged the marks on his wrists pointed to a struggle with his assailant and there had been at least one pistol shot I say at least one because it is the fact that in murders with firearms especially if there has been a struggle the criminal commonly misses his victim at least once This odd fact seemed all the more odd to me when I learned that Martin the butler was a bad sleeper very keen of hearing and that his bedroom with the window open faced almost directly toward the shed by which the body was found The second odd little fact that was apparent from the outset was Manderson s leaving his dental plate by the bedside It appeared that he had risen and dressed himself fully down to his necktie and watch and chain and had gone out of doors without remembering to put in this plate which he had carried in his mouth every day for years and which contained all the visible teeth of the upper jaw It had evidently not been a case of frantic hurry and even if it had been he would have been more likely to forget almost anything than this denture Any one who wears such a removable plate will agree that the putting it in on rising is a matter of second nature Speaking as well as eating to say nothing of appearances depend upon it Neither of these queer details however seemed to lead to anything at the moment They only awakened in me a suspicion of something lurking in the shadows something that lent more mystery to the already mysterious question how and why and through whom Manderson met his end With this much of preamble I come at once to the discovery which in the first few hours of my investigation set me upon the path which so much ingenuity had been directed to concealing I have already described Manderson s bedroom the rigorous simplicity of its furnishings contrasted so strangely with the multitude of clothes and shoes and the manner of its communication with missus Manderson s room On the upper of the two long shelves on which the shoes were ranged I found where I had been told I should find them the pair of patent leather shoes which Manderson had worn on the evening before his death I had glanced over the row not with any idea of their giving me a clue but merely because it happens that I am a judge of shoes and all these shoes were of the very best workmanship But my attention was at once caught by a little peculiarity in this particular pair They were the lightest kind of lace up dress shoes very thin in the sole without toe caps and beautifully made like all the rest These shoes were old and well worn but being carefully polished and fitted as all the shoes were upon their trees they looked neat enough What caught my eye was a slight splitting of the leather in that part of the upper known as the vamp a splitting at the point where the two laced parts of the shoe rise from the upper It is at this point that the strain comes when a tight shoe of this sort is forced upon the foot and it is usually guarded with a strong stitching across the bottom of the opening In both the shoes I was examining this stitching had parted and the leather below had given way The splitting was a tiny affair in each case not an eighth of an inch long and the torn edges having come together again on the removal of the strain there was nothing that a person who was not something of a connoisseur of shoe leather would have noticed Even less noticeable and indeed not to be seen at all unless one were looking for it was a slight straining of the stitches uniting the upper to the sole At the toe and on the outer side of each shoe this stitching had been dragged until it was visible on a close inspection of the joining These indications of course could mean only one thing The shoes had been worn by someone for whom they were too small Now it was clear at a glance that Manderson was always thoroughly well shod and careful perhaps a little vain of his small and narrow feet Not one of the other shoes in the collection as I soon ascertained bore similar marks they had not belonged to a man who squeezed himself into tight shoe leather Someone who was not Manderson had worn these shoes and worn them recently the edges of the tears were quite fresh The possibility of someone having worn them since Manderson s death was not worth considering the body had only been found about twenty six hours when I was examining the shoes besides why should any one wear them The possibility of someone having borrowed Manderson s shoes and spoiled them for him while he was alive seemed about as negligible With others to choose from he would not have worn these Besides the only men in the place were the butler and the two secretaries But I do not say that I gave those possibilities even as much consideration as they deserved for my thoughts were running away with me and I have always found it good policy in cases of this sort to let them have their heads Ever since I had got out of the train at Marlstone early that morning I had been steeped in details of the Manderson affair the thing had not once been out of my head Suddenly the moment had come when the daemon wakes and begins to range Let me put it less fancifully After all it is a detail of psychology familiar enough to all whose business or inclination brings them in contact with difficult affairs of any sort Swiftly and spontaneously when chance or effort puts one in possession of the key fact in any system of baffling circumstances one s ideas seem to rush to group themselves anew in relation to that fact so that they are suddenly rearranged almost before one has consciously grasped the significance of the key fact itself In the present instance my brain had scarcely formulated within itself the thought Somebody who was not Manderson has been wearing those shoes when there flew into my mind a flock of ideas all of the same character and all bearing upon this new notion It was unheard of for Manderson to drink much whisky at night It was very unlike him to be untidily dressed as the body was when found the cuffs dragged up inside the sleeves the shoes unevenly laced very unlike him not to wash when he rose and to put on last night s evening shirt and collar and underclothing very unlike him to have his watch in the waistcoat pocket that was not lined with leather for its reception In my first despatch I mentioned all these points but neither I nor any one else saw anything significant in them when examining the body It was very strange in the existing domestic situation that Manderson should be communicative to his wife about his doings especially at the time of his going to bed when he seldom spoke to her at all It was extraordinary that Manderson should leave his bedroom without his false teeth All these thoughts as I say came flocking into my mind together drawn from various parts of my memory of the morning s inquiries and observations They had all presented themselves in far less time than it takes to read them as set down here as I was turning over the shoes confirming my own certainty on the main point And yet when I confronted the definite idea that had sprung up suddenly and unsupported before me It was not Manderson who was in the house that night it seemed a stark absurdity at the first formulating It was certainly Manderson who had dined at the house and gone out with Marlowe in the car People had seen him at close quarters But was it he who returned at ten That question too seemed absurd enough But I could not set it aside It seemed to me as if a faint light was beginning to creep over the whole expanse of my mind as it does over land at dawn and that presently the sun would be rising I set myself to think over one by one the points that had just occurred to me so as to make out if possible why any man masquerading as Manderson should have done these things that Manderson would not have done I had not to cast about very long for the motive a man might have in forcing his feet into Manderson s narrow shoes The examination of footmarks is very well understood by the police But not only was the man concerned to leave no footmarks of his own He was concerned to leave Manderson s if any his whole plan if my guess was right must have been directed to producing the belief that Manderson was in the place that night Moreover his plan did not turn upon leaving footmarks He meant to leave the shoes themselves and he did so The maidservant had found them outside the bedroom door as Manderson always left his shoes and had polished them replacing them on the shoe shelves later in the morning after the body had been found When I came to consider in this new light the leaving of the false teeth an explanation of what had seemed the maddest part of the affair broke upon me at once A dental plate is not inseparable from its owner If my guess was right the unknown had brought the denture to the house with him and left it in the bedroom with the same object as he had in leaving the shoes to make it impossible that any one should doubt that Manderson had been in the house and had gone to bed there This of course led me to the inference that Manderson was dead before the false Manderson came to the house and other things confirmed this For instance the clothing to which I now turned in my review of the position if my guess was right the unknown in Manderson s shoes had certainly had possession of Manderson s trousers waistcoat and shooting jacket They were there before my eyes in the bedroom and Martin had seen the jacket which nobody could have mistaken upon the man who sat at the telephone in the library It was now quite plain if my guess was right that this unmistakable garment was a cardinal feature of the unknown s plan He knew that Martin would take him for Manderson at the first glance And there my thinking was interrupted by the realization of a thing that had escaped me before So strong had been the influence of the unquestioned assumption that it was Manderson who was present that night that neither I nor so far as I know any one else had noted the point Martin had not seen the man s face nor had missus Manderson missus Manderson judging by her evidence at the inquest of which as I have said I had a full report made by the Record stenographers in court had not seen the man at all She hardly could have done as I shall show presently She had merely spoken with him as she lay half asleep resuming a conversation which she had had with her living husband about an hour before Martin I perceived could only have seen the man s back as he sat crouching over the telephone no doubt a characteristic pose was imitated there And the man had worn his hat Manderson s broad brimmed hat There is too much character in the back of a head and neck The unknown in fact supposing him to have been of about Manderson s build had had no need for any disguise apart from the jacket and the hat and his powers of mimicry I paused there to contemplate the coolness and ingenuity of the man The thing I now began to see was so safe and easy provided that his mimicry was good enough and that his nerve held Those two points assured only some wholly unlikely accident could unmask him To come back to my puzzling out of the matter as I sat in the dead man s bedroom with the tell tale shoes before me the reason for the entrance by the window instead of by the front door will already have occurred to any one reading this Entering by the door the man would almost certainly have been heard by the sharp eared Martin in his pantry just across the hall he might have met him face to face Then there was the problem of the whisky I had not attached much importance to it whisky will sometimes vanish in very queer ways in a household of eight or nine persons but it had seemed strange that it should go in that way on that evening Martin had been plainly quite dumfounded by the fact It seemed to me now that many a man fresh as this man in all likelihood was from a bloody business from the unclothing of a corpse and with a desperate part still to play would turn to that decanter as to a friend No doubt he had a drink before sending for Martin after making that trick with ease and success he probably drank more But he had known when to stop The worst part of the enterprise was before him the business clearly of such vital importance to him for whatever reason of shutting himself in Manderson s room and preparing a mass of convincing evidence of its having been occupied by Manderson and this with the risk very slight as no doubt he understood but how unnerving of the woman on the other side of the half open door awaking and somehow discovering him True if he kept out of her limited field of vision from the bed she could only see him by getting up and going to the door I found that to a person lying in her bed which stood with its head to the wall a little beyond the door nothing was visible through the doorway but one of the cupboards by Manderson s bed head Moreover since this man knew the ways of the household he would think it most likely that missus Manderson was asleep Another point with him I guessed might have been the estrangement between the husband and wife which they had tried to cloak by keeping up among other things their usual practice of sleeping in connected rooms but which was well known to all who had anything to do with them He would hope from this that if missus Manderson heard him she would take no notice of the supposed presence of her husband So pursuing my hypothesis I followed the unknown up to the bedroom and saw him setting about his work And it was with a catch in my own breath that I thought of the hideous shock with which he must have heard the sound of all others he was dreading most the drowsy voice from the adjoining room What missus Manderson actually said she was unable to recollect at the inquest She thinks she asked her supposed husband whether he had had a good run in the car And now what does the unknown do Here I think we come to a supremely significant point Not only does he standing rigid there as I picture him before the dressing table listening to the sound of his own leaping heart not only does he answer the lady in the voice of Manderson he volunteers an explanatory statement He tells her that he has on a sudden inspiration sent Marlowe in the car to Southampton that he has sent him to bring back some important information from a man leaving for Paris by the steamboat that morning Why these details from a man who had long been uncommunicative to his wife and that upon a point scarcely likely to interest her Why these details about Marlowe Having taken my story so far I now put forward the following definite propositions that between a time somewhere about ten when the car started and a time somewhere about eleven Manderson was shot probably at a considerable distance from the house as no shot was heard that the body was brought back left by the shed and stripped of its outer clothing while the car was left in hiding somewhere at hand that at some time round about eleven o clock a man who was not Manderson wearing Manderson s shoes hat and jacket entered the library by the garden window that he had with him Manderson s black trousers waistcoat and motor coat the denture taken from Manderson s mouth and the weapon with which he had been murdered that he concealed these rang the bell for the butler and sat down at the telephone with his hat on and his back to the door that he was occupied with the telephone all the time Martin was in the room that on going up to the bedroom floor he quietly entered Marlowe s room and placed the revolver with which the crime had been committed Marlowe s revolver in the case on the mantel piece from which it had been taken and that he then went to Manderson s room placed Manderson s shoes outside the door threw Manderson s garments on a chair placed the denture in the bowl by the bedside and selected a suit of clothes a pair of shoes and a tie from those in the bedroom Here I will pause in my statement of this man s proceedings to go into a question for which the way is now sufficiently prepared Who was the false Manderson Reviewing what was known to me or might almost with certainty be surmised about that person I set down the following five conclusions one He had been in close relations with the dead man In his acting before Martin and his speaking to missus Manderson he had made no mistake two He was of a build not unlike Manderson s especially as to height and breadth of shoulder which mainly determine the character of the back of a seated figure when the head is concealed and the body loosely clothed But his feet were larger though not greatly larger than Manderson s three He had considerable aptitude for mimicry and acting probably some experience too four He had a minute acquaintance with the ways of the Manderson household five He was under a vital necessity of creating the belief that Manderson was alive and in that house until some time after midnight on the Sunday night So much I took as either certain or next door to it It was as far as I could see And it was far enough I proceed to give in an order corresponding with the numbered paragraphs above such relevant facts as I was able to obtain about mister John Marlowe from himself and other sources one He had been Manderson s private secretary upon a footing of great intimacy for nearly three years two The two men were nearly of the same height about five feet eleven inches both were powerfully built and heavy in the shoulder Marlowe who was the younger by some twenty years was slighter about the body though Manderson was a man in good physical condition Marlowe s shoes of which I examined several pairs were roughly about one shoemaker s size longer and broader than Manderson s three In the afternoon of the first day of my investigation after arriving at the results already detailed I sent a telegram to a personal friend a fellow of a college at Oxford whom I knew to be interested in theatrical matters in these terms Please wire John Marlowe s record in connection with acting at Oxford some time past decade very urgent and confidential My friend replied in the following telegram which reached me next morning the morning of the inquest Marlowe was member O U D S for three years and president nineteen played Bardolph Cleon and Mercutio excelled in character acting and imitations in great demand at smokers was hero of some historic hoaxes I had been led to send the telegram which brought this very helpful answer by seeing on the mantel shelf in Marlowe s bedroom a photograph of himself and two others in the costume of Falstaff s three followers with an inscription from The Merry Wives and by noting that it bore the imprint of an Oxford firm of photographers four During his connection with Manderson Marlowe had lived as one of the family No other person apart from the servants had his opportunities for knowing the domestic life of the Mandersons in detail five I ascertained beyond doubt that Marlowe arrived at a hotel in Southampton on the Monday morning at six thirty and there proceeded to carry out the commission which according to his story and to the statement made to missus Manderson in the bedroom by the false Manderson had been entrusted to him by his employer He had then returned in the car to Marlstone where he had shown great amazement and horror at the news of the murder These I say are the relevant facts about Marlowe We must now examine fact number five as set out above in connection with conclusion number five about the false Manderson I would first draw attention to one important fact The only person who professed to have heard Manderson mention Southampton at all before he started in the car was Marlowe His story confirmed to some extent by what the butler overheard was that the journey was all arranged in a private talk before they set out and he could not say when I put the question to him why Manderson should have concealed his intentions by giving out that he was going with Marlowe for a moonlight drive This point however attracted no attention Marlowe had an absolutely air tight alibi in his presence at Southampton by six thirty nobody thought of him in connection with a murder which must have been committed after twelve thirty the hour at which Martin the butler had gone to bed But it was the Manderson who came back from the drive who went out of his way to mention Southampton openly to two persons He even went so far as to ring up a hotel at Southampton and ask questions which bore out Marlowe s story of his errand This was the call he was busy with when Martin was in the library Now let us consider the alibi If Manderson was in the house that night and if he did not leave it until some time after twelve thirty Marlowe could not by any possibility have had a direct hand in the murder It is a question of the distance between Marlstone and Southampton If he had left Marlstone in the car at the hour when he is supposed to have done so between ten and ten thirty with a message from Manderson the run would be quite an easy one to do in the time But it would be physically impossible for the car a fifteen horse power four cylinder Northumberland an average medium power car to get to Southampton by half past six unless it left Marlstone by midnight at latest Motorists who will examine the road map and make the calculations required as I did in Manderson s library that day will agree that on the facts as they appeared there was absolutely no case against Marlowe But even if they were not as they appeared if Manderson was dead by eleven o clock and if at about that time Marlowe impersonated him at White Gables if Marlowe retired to Manderson s bedroom how can all this be reconciled with his appearance next morning at Southampton He had to get out of the house unseen and unheard and away in the car by midnight And Martin the sharp eared Martin was sitting up until twelve thirty in his pantry with the door open listening for the telephone bell Practically he was standing sentry over the foot of the staircase the only staircase leading down from the bedroom floor With this difficulty we arrive at the last and crucial phase of my investigation Having the foregoing points clearly in mind I spent the rest of the day before the inquest in talking to various persons and in going over my story testing it link by link I could only find the one weakness which seemed to be involved in Martin s sitting up until twelve thirty and since his having been instructed to do so was certainly a part of the plan meant to clinch the alibi for Marlowe I knew there must be an explanation somewhere If I could not find that explanation my theory was valueless I must be able to show that at the time Martin went up to bed the man who had shut himself in Manderson s bedroom might have been many miles away on the road to Southampton I had however a pretty good idea already as perhaps the reader of these lines has by this time if I have made myself clear of how the escape of the false Manderson before midnight had been contrived But I did not want what I was now about to do to be known If I had chanced to be discovered at work there would have been no concealing the direction of my suspicions I resolved not to test them on this point until the next day during the opening proceedings at the inquest This was to be held I knew at the hotel and I reckoned upon having White Gables to myself so far as the principal inmates were concerned So in fact it happened By the time the proceedings at the hotel had begun I was hard at work at White Gables I had a camera with me I made search on principles well known to and commonly practised by the police and often enough by myself for certain indications Without describing my search I may say at once that I found and was able to photograph two fresh finger prints very large and distinct on the polished front of the right hand top drawer of the chest of drawers in Manderson s bedroom five more among a number of smaller and less recent impressions made by other hands on the glasses of the French window in missus Manderson s room a window which always stood open at night with a curtain before it and three more upon the glass bowl in which Manderson s dental plate had been found lying I took the bowl with me from White Gables I took also a few articles which I selected from Marlowe s bedroom as bearing the most distinct of the innumerable finger prints which are always to be found upon toilet articles in daily use I already had in my possession made upon leaves cut from my pocket diary some excellent finger prints of Marlowe s which he had made in my presence without knowing it I had shown him the leaves asking if he recognized them and the few seconds during which he had held them in his fingers had sufficed to leave impressions which I was afterward able to bring out By six o clock in the evening two hours after the jury had brought in their verdict against a person or persons unknown I had completed my work and was in a position to state that two of the five large prints made on the window glasses and the three on the bowl were made by the left hand of Marlowe that the remaining three on the window and the two on the drawer were made by his right hand By eight o clock I had made at the establishment of mister H T Copper photographer of Bishopsbridge and with his assistance a dozen enlarged prints of the finger marks of Marlowe clearly showing the identity of those which he unknowingly made in my presence and those left upon articles in his bedroom with those found by me as I have described and thus establishing the facts that Marlowe was recently in Manderson s bedroom where he had in the ordinary way no business and in missus Manderson s room where he had still less I hope it may be possible to reproduce these prints for publication with this despatch At nine o clock I was back in my room at the hotel and sitting down to begin this manuscript I had my story complete I bring it to a close by advancing these further propositions that on the night of the murder the impersonator of Manderson being in Manderson s bedroom told missus Manderson as he had already told Martin that Marlowe was at that moment on his way to Southampton that having made his dispositions in the room he switched off the light and lay in the bed in his clothes that he waited until he was assured that missus Manderson was asleep that he then arose and stealthily crossed missus Manderson s bedroom in his stocking feet having under his arm the bundle of clothing and shoes for the body that he stepped behind the curtain pushing the doors of the window a little further open with his hands strode over the iron railing of the balcony and let himself down until only a drop of a few feet separated him from the soft turf of the lawn All this might very well have been accomplished within half an hour of his entering Manderson s bedroom which according to Martin he did at about half past eleven What followed your readers and the authorities may conjecture for themselves The corpse was found next morning clothed rather untidily Marlowe in the car appeared at Southampton by half past six I bring this manuscript to an end in my sitting room at the hotel at Marlstone It is four o clock in the morning I leave for London by the noon train from Bishopsbridge By this evening these pages will be in your hands and I ask you to communicate the substance of them to the Criminal Investigation Department PHILIP TRENT CHAPTER XI EVIL DAYS I am returning the check you sent for what I did on the Manderson case Trent wrote to Sir James Molloy from Munich whither he had gone immediately after handing in at the Record office a brief despatch bringing his work on the case to an unexciting close What I sent you wasn t worth one tenth of the amount but I should have no scruple about pocketing it if I hadn t taken a fancy never mind why not to touch any money at all for this business I should like you if there is no objection to pay for the stuff at your ordinary space rate and hand the money to some charity which does not devote itself to bullying people if you know of any such I have come to this place to see some old friends and arrange my ideas and the idea that comes out upper most is that for a little while I want some employment with activity in it I find I can t paint at all I couldn t paint a fence Will you try me as your Own Correspondent somewhere If you can find me a good adventure I will send you good accounts After that I could settle down and work Sir James sent him instructions by telegram to proceed at once to Kurland and Livonia where Citizen Browning was abroad again and town and country side blazed in revolt It was a roving commission and for two months Trent followed his luck It served him not less well than usual He was the only correspondent who saw General Dragilew killed in the street at Volmar by a girl of eighteen He saw burnings lynchings fusillades hangings each day his soul sickened afresh at the imbecilities born of misrule Many nights he lay down in danger Many days he went fasting But there was never an evening or a morning when he did not see the face of the woman whom he hopelessly loved He discovered in himself an unhappy pride at the lasting force of this infatuation It interested him as a phenomenon it amazed and enlightened him Such a thing had not visited him before it confirmed so much that he had found dubious in the recorded experience of men It was not that at thirty two he could pretend to ignorance of this world of emotion About his knowledge let it be enough to say that what he had learned had come unpursued and unpurchased and was without intolerable memories broken to the realities of sex he was still troubled by its inscrutable history he went through life full of a strange respect for certain feminine weakness and a very simple terror of certain feminine strength He had held to a rather lukewarm faith that something remained in him to be called forth and that the voice that should call would be heard in its own time if ever and not through any seeking But he had not thought of the possibility that if this proved true some day the truth might come in a sinister shape The two things that had taken him utterly by surprise in the matter of his feeling towards Mabel Manderson were the insane suddenness of its uprising in full strength and its extravagant hopelessness Before it came he had been much disposed to laugh at the permanence of unrequited passion as a generous boyish delusion He knew now that he had been wrong and he was living bitterly in the knowledge Before the eye of his fancy the woman always came just as she was when he had first had sight of her with the gesture which he had surprised as he walked past unseen on the edge of the cliff that great gesture of passionate joy in her new liberty which had told him more plainly than speech that her widowhood was a release from torment and had confirmed with terrible force the suspicion active in his mind before that it was her passport to happiness with a man whom she loved He could not with certainty name to himself the moment when he had first suspected that it might be so The seed of the thought must have been sown he believed at his first meeting with Marlowe his mind would have noted automatically that such evident strength and grace with the sort of looks and manners that the tall young man possessed might go far with any woman of unfixed affections And the connection of this with what mister Cupples had told him of the Mandersons married life must have formed itself in the unconscious depths of his mind Certainly it had presented itself as an already established thing when he began after satisfying himself of the identity of the murderer to cast about for the motive of the crime Motive motive How desperately he had sought for another turning his back upon that grim thought that Marlowe obsessed by passion like himself and privy perhaps to maddening truths about the wife s unhappiness had taken a leaf the guiltiest from the book of Bothwell But in all his investigations at the time in all his broodings on the matter afterwards he had been able to discover nothing else that could prompt Marlowe to such a deed nothing but that temptation the whole strength of which he could not know but which if it had existed must have pressed urgently upon a bold spirit in which scruple had been somehow paralyzed If he could trust his senses at all the young man was neither insane nor by nature evil But that could not clear him Murder for a woman s sake he thought was not a rare crime Heaven knew If the modern feebleness of impulse in the comfortable classes and their respect for the modern apparatus of detection had made it rare among them it was yet far from impossible it only needed a man of equal daring and intelligence his soul drugged with the vapors of an intoxicating intrigue to plan and perform such a deed A thousand times with a heart full of anguish he had sought to reason away the dread that Mabel Manderson had known too much of what had been intended against her husband s life That she knew all the truth after the thing was done he could not doubt her unforgettable collapse in his presence when the question about Marlowe was suddenly and bluntly put had swept away his last hope that there was no love between the pair and had seemed to him moreover to speak of dread of discovery In any case she knew the truth after reading what he had left with her and it was certain that no public suspicion had been cast upon Marlowe since She had destroyed his manuscript then and taken him at his word to keep the secret that threatened her lover s life But it was the monstrous thought that she might have known murder was brewing and guiltily kept silence that haunted Trent s mind She might have suspected have guessed something was it conceivable that she was aware of the whole plot that she connived He could never forget that his first suspicion of Marlowe s motive in the crime had been roused by the fact that his escape was made through the lady s room At that time when he had not yet seen her he had been ready enough to entertain the idea of her equal guilt and her cooeperation He had figured to himself some passionate hysterique merciless as a tiger in her hate and her love a zealous abettor perhaps even the ruling spirit in the crime Then he had seen her had spoken with her had helped her in her weakness and such suspicions since their first meeting had seemed the vilest of infamy He had seen her eyes and her mouth he had breathed the woman s atmosphere Trent was one of those who fancy they can scent true wickedness in the air In her presence he had felt an inward certainty of her ultimate goodness of heart and it was nothing against this that she had abandoned herself a moment that day on the cliff to the sentiment of relief at the ending of her bondage of her years of starved sympathy and unquickened motherhood That she had turned to Marlowe in her destitution he believed that she had any knowledge of his deadly purpose he did not believe And yet morning and evening the sickening doubts returned and he recalled again that it was almost in her very presence that Marlowe had made his preparations in the bedroom of the murdered man that it was from the window of her own chamber that he had escaped from the house Had he forgotten his cunning and taken the risk of telling her then Or had he as Trent thought more likely still played his part with her then and stolen off while she slept He did not think she had known of the masquerade when she gave evidence at the inquest it read like honest evidence Or the question would never be silenced though he scorned it had she lain expecting the footstep in the room and the whisper that should tell her it was done Among the foul possibilities of human nature was it possible that black ruthlessness and black deceit as well were hidden behind that good and straight and gentle seeming These thoughts would scarcely leave him when he was alone Trent served Sir James well earning his pay for six months and then returned to Paris where he went to work again with a better heart His powers had returned to him and he began to live more happily than he had expected among a tribe of strangely assorted friends French English and American artists poets journalists policemen hotel keepers soldiers lawyers business men and others His old faculty of sympathetic interest in his fellows won for him just as in his student days privileges seldom extended to the Briton He enjoyed again the rare experience of being taken into the bosom of a Frenchman s family He was admitted to the momentous confidence of les jeunes and found them as sure that they had surprised the secrets of art and life as the departed jeunes of ten years before had been One morning in June as he descended the slope of the Rue des Martyrs he saw approaching a figure that he remembered He glanced quickly round for the thought of meeting mister Bunner again was unacceptable For some time he had recognized that his wound was healing under the spell of creative work he thought less often of the woman he loved and with less pain He would not have the memory of those three days re opened But the straight and narrow thoroughfare offered no refuge and the American saw him almost at once His unforced geniality made Trent ashamed for he had liked the man They sat long over a meal and mister Bunner talked Trent listened to him now that he was in for it with genuine pleasure now and then contributing a question or remark Besides liking his companion he enjoyed his conversation for its own sake mister Bunner was it appeared resident in Paris as the chief Continental agent of the Manderson firm and fully satisfied with his position and prospects He discoursed on these for some twenty minutes This subject at length exhausted he went on to tell Trent who confessed that he had been away from England for a year that Marlowe had shortly after the death of Manderson entered his father s business which was now again in a flourishing state and had already come to be virtually in control of it They had kept up their intimacy and were even now planning a holiday for the summer mister Bunner spoke with generous admiration of his friend s talent for affairs Jack Marlowe has a natural big head he declared and if he had more experience I wouldn t want to have him up against me He would put a crimp in me every time As the American s talk flowed on Trent listened with growing surprise and anxiety It became more and more plain that something was very wrong in his theory of the situation there was no mention of its central figure Presently mister Bunner mentioned that Marlowe was engaged to be married to an Irish girl whose charms he celebrated with native enthusiasm Trent clasped his hands savagely together beneath the table What could have happened His ideas were sliding and shifting At last he forced himself to put a direct question mister Bunner was not very fully informed He knew that missus Manderson had left England immediately after the settlement of her husband s affairs and had lived for some time in Italy She had returned not long ago to London where she had decided not to live in the house in Mayfair and had bought a smaller one in the Hampstead neighborhood also he understood one somewhere in the country She was said to go but little into society And all the good hard dollars just waiting for someone to spraddle them around said mister Bunner with a note of pathos in his voice Why she has money to burn money to feed to the birds and nothing doing The old man left her more than half his wad And think of the figure she might make in the world She is beautiful and she is the best woman I ever met too But she couldn t ever seem to get the habit of spending money the way it ought to be spent His words now became a soliloquy Trent s thoughts were occupying all his attention He pleaded business soon and the two men parted with cordiality Half an hour later Trent was in his studio swiftly and mechanically cleaning up He wanted to know what had happened somehow he must find out He could never approach herself he knew he would never bring back to her the shame of that last encounter with him it was scarcely likely that he would even set eyes on her But he must know Cupples was in London Marlowe was there And anyhow he was sick of Paris Such thoughts came and went and below them all strained the fibers of an unseen cord that dragged mercilessly at his heart and that he cursed bitterly in the moments when he could not deny to himself that it was there The folly the useless pitiable folly of it In twenty four hours his feeble roots in Paris had been torn out He was looking over a leaden sea at the shining fortress wall of the Dover cliffs But though he had instinctively picked out the lines of a set purpose from among the welter of promptings in his mind he found it delayed at the very outset He had decided that he must first see mister Cupples who would be in a position to tell him much more than the American knew But mister Cupples was away on his travels not expected to come back for a month and Trent had no reasonable excuse for hastening his return Marlowe he would not confront until he had tried at least to reconnoiter the position He constrained himself not to commit the crowning folly of seeking out missus Manderson s house in Hampstead he could not enter it and the thought of the possibility of being seen by her lurking in its neighborhood brought the blood to his face He stayed at a hotel took a studio and while he awaited mister Cupples return attempted vainly to lose himself in work At the end of a week he had an idea that he acted upon with eager precipitancy She had let fall some word at their last meeting of a taste for music Trent went that evening and thenceforward regularly to the opera He might see her and if in spite of his caution she caught sight of him they could be blind to each other s presence anybody might happen to go to the opera So he went alone each evening passing as quickly as he might through the people in the vestibule and each evening he came away knowing that she had not been in the house It was a habit that yielded him a sort of satisfaction along with the guilty excitement of his search for he too loved music and nothing gave him so much peace while its magic endured One night as he entered hurrying through the brilliant crowd he felt a touch on his arm Flooded with an incredible certainty at the touch he turned It was she so much more radiant in the absence of grief and anxiety in the fact that she was smiling and in the allurement of evening dress that he could not speak She too breathed a little quickly and there was a light of daring in her eyes and cheeks as she greeted him Her words were few I wouldn t miss a note of Tristan she said nor must you Come and see me in the interval She gave him the number of the box CHAPTER XII ERUPTION The following two months were a period in Trent s life that he has never since remembered without shuddering He met missus Manderson half a dozen times and each time her cool friendliness a nicely calculated mean between mere acquaintance and the first stage of intimacy baffled and maddened him At the opera he had found her to his further amazement with a certain missus Wallace a frisky matron whom he had known from childhood missus Manderson it appeared on her return from Italy had somehow wandered into circles to which he belonged by nurture and disposition It came she said of her having pitched her tent in their hunting grounds several of his friends were near neighbors He had a dim but horrid recollection of having been on that occasion unlike himself ill at ease burning in the face talking with idiot loquacity of his adventures in the Baltic provinces and finding from time to time that he was addressing himself exclusively to missus Wallace The other lady when he joined them had completely lost the slight appearance of agitation with which she had stopped him in the vestibule She had spoken pleasantly to him of her travels of her settlement in London and of people whom they both knew During the last half of the opera which he had stayed in the box to hear he had been conscious of nothing as he sat behind them but the angle of her cheek and the mass of her hair the lines of her shoulder and arm her hand upon the cushion The black hair had seemed at last a forest immeasurable pathless and enchanted luring him to a fatal adventure At the end he had been pale and subdued parting with them rather formally The next time he saw her it was at a country house where both were guests and the subsequent times he had had himself in hand He had matched her manner and had acquitted himself he thought decently considering considering that he lived in an agony of bewilderment and remorse and longing He could make nothing absolutely nothing of her attitude That she had read his manuscript and understood the suspicion indicated in his last question to her at White Gables was beyond the possibility of doubt Then how could she treat him thus amiably and frankly as she treated all the world of men who had done her no injury For it had become clear to his intuitive sense for all the absence of any shade of differentiation in her outward manner that an injury had been done and that she had felt it Several times on the rare and brief occasions when they had talked apart he had warning from the same sense that she was approaching this subject and each time he had turned the conversation with the ingenuity born of fear Two resolutions he made The first was that when he had completed a commissioned work which tied him to London he would go away and stay away The strain was too great He no longer burned to know the truth he wanted nothing to confirm his fixed internal conviction by faith that he had blundered that he had misread the situation misinterpreted her tears written himself down a slanderous fool He speculated no more on Marlowe s motive in the killing of Manderson mister Cupples returned to London and Trent asked him nothing He knew now that he had been right in those words Trent remembered them for the emphasis with which they were spoken So long as she considered herself bound to him no power on earth could have persuaded her He met missus Manderson at dinner at her uncle s large and tomb like house in Bloomsbury and there he conversed most of the evening with a professor of archaeology from Berlin His other resolution was that he would not be with her alone But when a few days after she wrote asking him to come and see her on the following afternoon he made no attempt to excuse himself This was a formal challenge While she celebrated the rites of tea and for some little time thereafter she joined with such natural ease in his slightly fevered conversation on matters of the day that he began to hope she had changed what he could not doubt had been her resolve to corner him and speak to him gravely She was to all appearances careless now smiling so that he recalled not for the first time since that night at the opera what was written long ago of a Princess of Brunswick Her mouth has ten thousand charms that touch the soul She made a tour of the beautiful room where she had received him singling out this treasure or that from the spoils of a hundred bric a brac shops laughing over her quests discoveries and bargainings And when he asked if she would delight him again with a favorite piece of his which he had heard her play at another house she consented at once She played with a perfection of execution and feeling that moved him now as it had moved him before You are a musician born he said quietly when she had finished and the last tremor of the music had passed away I knew that before I first heard you play I have played a great deal ever since I can remember It has been a great comfort to me she said simply and half turned to him smiling When did you first detect music in me Oh of course I was at the opera But that wouldn t prove much would it No he said abstractedly his sense still busy with the music that had just ended I think I knew it the first time I saw you Then understanding of his own words came to him and turned him rigid For the first time the past had been invoked There was a short silence missus Manderson looked at Trent then hastily looked away Color began to rise in her cheeks and she pursed her lips as if for whistling Then with a defiant gesture of the shoulders which he remembered she rose suddenly from the piano and placed herself in a chair opposite to him That speech of yours will do as well as anything she began slowly looking at the point of her shoe to bring us to what I wanted to say I asked you here to day on purpose mister Trent because I couldn t bear it any longer Ever since the day you left me at White Gables I have been saying to myself that it didn t matter what you thought of me in that affair that you were certainly not the kind of man to speak to others of what you believed about me after what you had told me of your reasons for suppressing your manuscript I asked myself how it could matter But all the time of course I knew it did matter It mattered horribly Because what you thought was not true She raised her eyes and met his gaze calmly Trent with a completely expressionless face returned her look Since I began to know you he said I have ceased to think it Thank you said missus Manderson and blushed suddenly and deeply Then playing with a glove she added But I want you to know what was true I did not know if I should ever see you again she went on in a lower voice but I felt that if I did I must speak to you about this I thought it would not be hard to do so because you seemed to me an understanding person and besides a woman who has been married isn t expected to have the same sort of difficulty as a young girl in speaking about such things when it is necessary And then we did meet again and I discovered that it was very difficult indeed You made it difficult How he asked quietly I don t know said the lady But yes I do know It was just because you treated me exactly as if you had never thought or imagined anything of that sort about me I had always supposed that if I saw you again you would turn on me that hard horrible sort of look you had when you asked me that last question do you remember at White Gables Instead of that you were just like any other acquaintance You were just she hesitated and spread her hands nice You know After that first time at the opera when I spoke to you I went home positively wondering if you had really recognized me I mean I thought you might have recognized my face without remembering who it was A short laugh broke from Trent in spite of himself but he said nothing She smiled deprecatingly Well I couldn t remember if you had spoken my name and I thought it might be so But the next time at the Wallaces you did speak it so I knew and a dozen times during those few days I almost brought myself to tell you but never quite I began to feel that you wouldn t let me that you would slip away from the subject if I approached it Wasn t I right Tell me please He nodded But why He remained silent Well she said I will finish what I had to say and then you will tell me I hope why you had to make it so hard When I began to understand that you wouldn t let me talk of the matter to you it made me more determined than ever I suppose you didn t realize that I would insist on speaking even if you were quite discouraging I dare say I couldn t have done it if I had been guilty as you thought You walked into my parlor to day never thinking I should dare Well now you see missus Manderson had lost all her air of hesitancy She had as she was wont to say talked herself enthusiastic and in the ardor of her purpose to annihilate the misunderstanding that had troubled her so long she felt herself mistress of the situation I am going to tell you the story of the mistake you made she continued as Trent his hands clasped between his knees still looked at her enigmatically You will have to believe it mister Trent it is so utterly true to life with its confusions and hidden things and cross purposes and perfectly natural mistakes that nobody thinks twice about taking for facts Please understand that I don t blame you in the least and never did for jumping to the conclusion you did You knew that I had no love for my husband and you knew what that so often means You knew before I told you I expect that he had taken up an injured attitude towards me and I was silly enough to try and explain it away I gave you the explanation of it that I had given myself at first before I realized the wretched truth I told you he was disappointed in me because I couldn t take a brilliant lead in society Well that was true He was so But I could see you weren t convinced You had guessed what it took me much longer to see because I knew how irrational it was Yes my husband was jealous of John Marlowe you had divined that Then I behaved like a fool when you let me see you had divined it it was such a blow you understand when I had supposed all the humiliation and strain was at an end and that his delusion had died with him You practically asked me if my husband s secretary was not my lover mister Trent I have to say it because I want you to understand why I broke down and made a scene You took that for a confession you thought I was guilty of that and I think you even thought I might be a party to the crime that I had consented That did hurt me but perhaps you couldn t have thought anything else I don t know Trent who had not hitherto taken his eyes from her face hung his head at the words He did not raise it again as she continued But really it was simple shock and distress that made me give way and the memory of all the misery that mad suspicion had meant to me And when I pulled myself together again you had gone She rose and went to an escritoire beside the window unlocked a drawer and drew out a long sealed envelop This is the manuscript you left with me she said I have read it through again and again I have always wondered as everybody does at your cleverness in things of this kind A faintly mischievous smile flashed upon her face and was gone I thought it was splendid mister Trent I almost forgot that the story was my own I was so interested And I want to say now while I have this in my hand how much I thank you for your generous chivalrous act in sacrificing this triumph of yours rather than put a woman s reputation in peril If all had been as you supposed the facts must have come out when the police took up the case you put in their hands Believe me I understood just what you had done and I never ceased to be grateful even when I felt most crushed by your suspicion As she spoke her thanks her voice shook a little and her eyes were bright Trent perceived nothing of this His head was still bent He did not seem to hear She put the envelop into his hand as it lay open palm upwards on his knee There was a touch of gentleness about the act which made him look up Can you he began slowly She raised her hand as she stood before him No mister Trent let me finish before you say anything It is such an unspeakable relief to me to have broken the ice at last and I want to end the story while I am still feeling the triumph of beginning it She sank down into the sofa from which she had first risen I am telling you a thing that nobody else knows Everybody knew I suppose that something had come between us though I did everything in my power to hide it But I don t think any one in the world ever guessed what my husband s notion was People who know me don t think that sort of thing about me I believe And his fancy was so ridiculously opposed to the facts I will tell you what the situation was mister Marlowe and I had been friendly enough since he came to us For all his cleverness my husband said he had a keener brain than any man he knew I looked upon him as practically a boy You know I am a little older than he is and he had a sort of amiable lack of ambition that made me feel it the more One day my husband asked me what I thought was the best thing about Marlowe and not thinking much about it I said His manners He surprised me very much by looking black at that and after a silence he said Yes Marlowe is a gentleman that s so not looking at me Nothing was ever said about that again until about a year ago when I found that mister Marlowe had done what I always expected and hoped he would do fallen desperately in love with an American girl But to my disgust he had picked out the most worthless girl I do believe of all those whom we used to meet She was the daughter of wealthy parents and she did as she liked with them very beautiful well educated very good at games what they call a woman athlete and caring for nothing on earth but her own amusement She was one of the most unprincipled flirts I ever knew and quite the cleverest Everyone knew it and mister Marlowe must have heard it but she made a complete fool of him brain and all I don t know how she managed it but I can imagine She liked him of course but it was quite plain to me that she was playing with him The whole affair was so idiotic I became perfectly furious One day I asked him to row me in a boat on the lake all this happened at our house by Lake George We had never been alone together for any length of time before In the boat I talked to him I was very kind about it I think and he took it admirably but he didn t believe me a bit He had the impudence to tell me that I misunderstood Alice s nature When I hinted at his prospects I knew he had scarcely anything of his own he said that if she loved him he could make himself a position in the world I dare say that was true with his abilities and his friends he is rather well connected you know as well as popular But his enlightenment came very soon after that My husband helped me out of the boat when we came back He joked with mister Marlowe about something I remember for through all that followed he never once changed in his manner to him and that was one reason why I took so long to realize what he thought about him and myself But to me he was reserved and silent that evening not angry He was always perfectly cold and expressionless to me after he took this idea into his head After dinner he only spoke to me once mister Marlowe was telling him about some horse he had bought for the farm in Kentucky and my husband looked at me and said Marlowe may be a gentleman but he seldom quits loser in a horse trade I was surprised at that but at that time and even on the next occasion when he found us together I didn t understand what was in his mind That next time was the morning when mister Marlowe received a sweet little note from the girl asking for his congratulations on her engagement It was in our New York house He looked so wretched at breakfast that I thought he was ill and afterwards I went to the room where he worked and asked what was the matter He didn t say anything but just handed me the note and turned away to the window I was very glad that was all over but terribly sorry for him too of course I don t remember what I said but I remember putting my hand on his arm as he stood there staring out on the garden and just then my husband appeared at the open door with some papers He just glanced at us and then turned and walked quietly back to his study I thought he might have heard what I was saying to comfort mister Marlowe and that it was rather nice of him to slip away mister Marlowe neither saw nor heard him My husband left the house that morning for the West while I was out Even then I did not understand He used often to go off suddenly like that if some business project called him It was not until he returned a week later that I grasped the situation He was looking white and strange and as soon as he saw me he asked me where mister Marlowe was Somehow the tone of his question told me everything in a flash I almost gasped I was wild with indignation You know mister Trent I don t think I should have minded at all if any one had thought me capable of openly breaking with my husband and leaving him for somebody else I dare say I might have done that But that coarse suspicion a man whom he trusted and the notion of concealment It made me see scarlet Every shred of pride in me was strung up till I quivered and I swore to myself on the spot that I would never show by any word or sign that I was conscious of his having such a thought about me I would behave exactly as I always had behaved I determined and that I did up to the very last Though I knew that a wall had been made between us now that could never be broken down even if he asked my pardon and obtained it I never once closed the door between our rooms at night And so it went on I never could go through such a time again My husband showed silent and cold politeness to me always when we were alone and that was only when it was unavoidable He never once alluded to what was in his mind but I felt it and he knew that I felt it Both of us were stubborn in our different attitudes To mister Marlowe he was more friendly if anything than before heaven only knows why I fancied he was planning some sort of revenge but that was only a fancy Certainly mister Marlowe never knew what was suspected of him He and I remained good friends though we never spoke of anything intimate after that disappointment of his but I made a point of seeing no less of him than I had always done Then we came over to England and to White Gables and after that followed my husband s dreadful end She threw out her right hand in a gesture of finality You know about the rest so much more than any other man she added and glanced up at him with a quaint expression Trent wondered at that look But the wonder was only a passing shadow on his thought Inwardly his whole being was possessed by thankfulness All the vivacity had returned to his face Long before missus Manderson ended her story he had recognized the certainty of its truth as from the first days of their renewed acquaintance he had doubted the story that his imagination had built up at White Gables upon foundations that seemed so good to him He said I don t know how to begin the apologies I have to make There are no words to tell you how ashamed and disgraced I feel when I realize what a crude cock sure blundering at a conclusion my suspicion was Yes I suspected you I had almost forgotten that I was ever such a fool Almost not quite Sometimes when I have been alone I have remembered that folly and poured contempt on it I have tried to imagine what the facts were I have tried to excuse myself She interrupted him quickly What nonsense Do be sensible mister Trent You had only seen me on two occasions in your life before you came to me with your solution of the mystery Again the quaint expression came and was gone If you talk of folly it really is folly for a man like you to pretend to a woman like me that I had innocence written all over me in large letters so large that you couldn t believe very strong evidence against me after seeing me twice missus Manderson laughed and her laugh carried him away with it He knew well by this time that sudden rush of cascading notes of mirth the perfect expression of enjoyment he had many times tried to amuse her merely for his delight in the sound of it And now it s all over and you know and we ll never speak of it any more I hope not Trent said in sincere relief If you re resolved to be so kind as this about it I am not high principled enough to insist on your blasting me with your lightnings And now missus Manderson I had better go Changing the subject after this would be like playing puss in the corner after an earthquake He rose to his feet You are right she said But no Wait There is another thing part of the same subject and we ought to pick up all the pieces now while we are about it Please sit down She took the envelop containing Trent s manuscript despatch from the table where he had laid it I want to speak about this His brows bent and he looked at her questioningly So do I if you do he said slowly I want very much to know one thing Tell me Since my reason for suppressing that information was all a fantasy why did you never make any use of it When I began to realize that I had been wrong about you I explained your silence to myself by saying that you could not bring yourself to do a thing that would put a rope round a man s neck whatever he might have done I can quite understand that feeling Was that what it was Another possibility I thought of was that you knew of something that was by way of justifying or excusing Marlowe s act Or I thought you might have a simple horror quite apart from humanitarian scruples of appearing publicly in connection with a murder trial Many important witnesses in such cases have to be practically forced into giving their evidence They feel there is defilement even in the shadow of the scaffold missus Manderson tapped her lips with the envelop without quite concealing a smile You didn t think of another possibility I suppose mister Trent she said No He looked puzzled I mean the possibility of your having been wrong about mister Marlowe as well as about me No no you needn t tell me that the chain of evidence is complete I know it is But evidence of what Of mister Marlowe having impersonated my husband that night and having escaped by way of my window and built up an alibi I have read your despatch again and again mister Trent and I don t see that those things can be doubted Trent gazed at her with narrowed eyes He said nothing to fill the brief pause that followed missus Manderson smoothed her skirt with a preoccupied air as one collecting her ideas I did not make any use of the facts found out by you she slowly said at last because it seemed to me very likely that they would be fatal to mister Marlowe I agree with you Trent remarked in a colorless tone And pursued missus Manderson looking up at him with a mild reasonableness in her eyes as I knew that he was innocent I was not going to expose him to that risk There was another little pause Trent rubbed his chin with an affectation of turning over the idea Inwardly he was telling himself somewhat feebly that this was very right and proper that it was quite feminine and that he liked her to be feminine It was permitted to her more than permitted to set her loyal belief in the character of a friend above the clearest demonstrations of the intellect Nevertheless it chafed him He would have had her declaration of faith a little less positive in form It was too irrational to say she knew In fact he put it to himself bluntly it was quite unlike her If to be unreasonable when reason led to the unpleasant was a specially feminine trait and if missus Manderson had it she was accustomed to wrap it up better than any woman he had known You suggest he said at length that Marlowe constructed an alibi for himself by means which only a desperate man would have attempted to clear himself of a crime he did not commit Did he tell you he was innocent She uttered a little laugh of impatience So you think he has been talking me round No that is not so I am merely sure he did not do it Ah I see you think that absurd But see how unreasonable you are mister Trent Just now you were explaining to me quite sincerely that it was foolishness in you to have had a certain suspicion of me Trent started in his chair She glanced at him and went on Now I know a great deal more about mister Marlowe than you know about me even now I saw him constantly for several years I don t pretend to know all about him but I do know that he is incapable of a crime of bloodshed The idea of his planning a murder is as unthinkable to me as the idea of your picking a poor woman s pocket mister Trent I can imagine you killing a man you know if the man deserved it and had an equal chance of killing you I could kill a person myself in some circumstances But mister Marlowe was incapable of doing it I don t care what the provocation might be He had a temper that nothing could shake and he looked upon human nature with a sort of cold magnanimity that would find excuses for absolutely anything It wasn t a pose you could see it was a part of him He never put it forward but it was there always It was quite irritating at times He really loathed and hated physical violence He was a very strange man in some ways mister Trent He gave one a feeling that he might do unexpected things do you know that feeling one has about some people What part he really played in the events of that night I have never been able to guess But nobody who knew anything about him could possibly believe in his deliberately taking a man s life Again the movement of her head expressed finality and she leaned back in the sofa calmly regarding him Then said Trent who had followed this with earnest attention we are forced back on two other possibilities which I had not thought worth much consideration until this moment Accepting what you say he might still conceivably have killed in self defense or he might have done so by accident The lady nodded Of course I thought of those two explanations when I read your manuscript And I suppose you felt as I did myself that in either of those cases the natural thing and obviously the safest thing for him to do was to make a public statement of the truth instead of setting up a series of deceptions which would certainly stamp him as guilty in the eyes of the law if anything went wrong with them Yes she said wearily I thought over all that until my head ached And I thought somebody else might have done it and that he was somehow screening the guilty person But that seemed wild I could see no light in the mystery and after a while I simply let it alone All I was clear about was that mister Marlowe was not a murderer and that if I told what you had found out the judge and jury would probably think he was I promised myself that I would speak to you about it if we should meet again and now I ve kept my promise Trent his chin resting on his hand was staring at the carpet The excitement of the hunt for the truth was steadily rising in him He had not in his own mind accepted missus Manderson s account of Marlowe s character as unquestionable But she had spoken forcibly he could by no means set it aside and his theory was much shaken There is only one thing for it he said looking up I must see Marlowe It worries me too much to have the thing left like this I will get at the truth Can you tell me he broke off how he behaved after the day I left White Gables I never saw him after that said missus Manderson simply For some days after you went away I was ill and didn t go out of my room When I was about again he had left and was in London settling things with the lawyers He did not come down to the funeral Immediately after that I went abroad After some weeks a letter from him reached me saying he had concluded his business and given the solicitors all the assistance in his power He thanked me very nicely for what he called all my kindness and said good by There was nothing in it about his plans for the future and I thought it particularly strange that he said not a word about my husband s death I didn t answer Knowing what I knew I couldn t In those days I shuddered whenever I thought of that masquerade in the night Rather than face him I was ready to go on in ignorance of what had really happened I never wanted to see or hear of him again Then you don t know what has become of him No but I dare say Uncle Burton mister Cupples you know could tell you Some time ago he told me that he had met mister Marlowe in London and had some talk with him I changed the conversation She paused and smiled with a trace of mischief I rather wonder what you supposed had happened to mister Marlowe after you withdrew from the scene of the drama that you had put together so much to your satisfaction Trent flushed Do you really want to know he said I ask you she retorted quietly You ask me to humiliate myself again missus Manderson Very well I will tell you what I thought I should most likely find when I returned to London this year that you had married Marlowe and gone to live abroad She heard him with unmoved composure We certainly couldn t have lived very comfortably in England on his money and mine she observed thoughtfully He had practically nothing then He stared at her gaped she told him some time afterwards At the moment she laughed with a little embarrassment Dear me mister Trent Have I said anything dreadful You surely must know I thought everybody understood by now I m sure I ve had to explain it often enough if I marry again I lose everything that my husband left me The effect of this speech upon Trent was curious For an instant his face was flooded with the emotion of surprise As this passed away he gradually drew himself together as he sat into a tense attitude He looked she thought as she saw his knuckles grow white on the arms of the chair like a man prepared for pain under the hand of the surgeon But all he said in a voice lower than his usual tone was I had no idea of it It is so she said calmly trifling with a ring on her finger Really mister Trent it is not such a very unusual thing I think I am glad of it For one thing it has secured me at least since it became generally known from a good many attentions of a kind that a woman in my position has to put up with as a rule No doubt he said gravely And the other kind She looked at him questioningly Ah she laughed The other kind trouble me even less I have not yet met a man silly enough to want to marry a widow with a selfish disposition and luxurious habits and tastes and nothing but the little my father left me She shook her head slowly and something in the gesture shattered the last remnants of Trent s self possession Haven t you by God he exclaimed rising with a violent movement and advancing a step towards her Then I am going to show you that human passion is not always stifled by the smell of money I am going to end the business my business I am going to tell you what I dare say scores of better men have wanted to tell you but couldn t summon up what I have summoned up the infernal cheek to do it They were afraid of making fools of themselves I am not You have accustomed me to the feeling this afternoon He laughed aloud in his rush of words and spread out his hands Look at me It is the sight of the century It is the one who says he loves you and would ask you to give up very great wealth to stand at his side She was hiding her face in her hands He heard her say brokenly Please don t speak in that way He answered It will make a great difference to me if you will allow me to say all I have to say before I leave you Perhaps it is in bad taste but I will risk that I want to relieve my soul it needs open confession This is the truth You have troubled me ever since the first time I saw you and you did not know it as you sat under the edge of the cliff at Marlstone and held out your arms to the sea It was only your beauty that filled my mind then As I passed by you it seemed as if all the life in the place were crying out a song about you in the wind and the sunshine And the song stayed in my ears but even your beauty would be no more than an empty memory to me by now if that had been all It was when I led you from the hotel there to your house with your hand on my arm that what was it that happened I only knew that your stronger magic had struck home and that I never should forget that day whatever the love of my life should be Till that day I had admired as I should admire the loveliness of a still lake but that day I felt the spell of the divinity of the lake And next morning the waters were troubled and she rose the morning when I came to you with my questions tired out with doubts that were as bitter as pain and when I saw you without your pale sweet mask of composure when I saw you moved and glowing with your eyes and your hands alive and when you made me understand that for such a creature as you there had been emptiness and the mere waste of yourself for so long Madness rose in me then and my spirit was clamoring to say what I say at last now that life would never seem a full thing again because you could not love me that I was taken forever in the nets of your black hair and by the incantation of your voice Oh stop she cried suddenly throwing back her head her face flaming and her hands clutching the cushions beside her She spoke fast and disjointedly her breath coming quick You shall not talk me into forgetting common sense What does all this mean Oh I do not recognize you at all you seem another man We are not children have you forgotten that You speak like a boy in love for the first time It is foolish unreal I know that if you do not I will not hear it What has happened to you She was half sobbing How can these sentimentalities come from a man like you Where is your self restraint Gone exclaimed Trent with an abrupt laugh It has got right away I am going after it in a minute He looked gravely down into her eyes I don t care so much now I never could declare myself to you under the cloud of your great fortune It was too great There s nothing creditable in that feeling as I look at it as a matter of simple fact it was a form of cowardice fear of what you would think and very likely say fear of the world s comment too I suppose But the cloud being rolled away I have spoken and I don t care so much I can face things with a quiet mind now that I have told you the truth in its own terms You may call it sentimentality or any other nickname you like It is quite true that it was not intended for a scientific statement Since it annoys you let it be extinguished But please believe that it was serious to me if it was comedy to you I have said that I love you and honor you and would hold you dearest of all the world Now give me leave to go But she held out her hands to him CHAPTER XIII WRITING A LETTER If you insist Trent said I suppose you will have your way But I had much rather write it when I am not with you However if I must bring me a tablet whiter than a star or hand of hymning angel Don t underestimate the sacrifice I am making I never felt less like correspondence in my life She rewarded him What shall I say he inquired his pen hovering over the paper Shall I compare him to a summer s day What shall I say Say what you want to say she suggested helpfully He shook his head What I want to say what I have been wanting for the past twenty four hours to say to every man woman and child I met is Mabel and I are betrothed and joy is borne on burning wheels But that wouldn t be a very good opening for a letter of strictly formal not to say sinister character I have got as far as Dear mister Marlowe What comes next I am sending you a manuscript which I thought you might like to see she prompted as she came to his chair before the escritoire Something of that kind Please try I want to see what you write and I want it to go to him at once You see I would be contented enough to leave things as they are but you say you must get at the truth and if you must I want it to be as soon as possible Do it now you know you can if you will and I ll send it off the moment it is ready Don t you ever feel that the longing to get the worrying letter into the post and off your hands so that you can t recall it if you would and it s no use fussing any more about it I will do as you wish he said and turned to the paper which he dated as from his hotel missus Manderson looked down at his bent head with a gentle light in her eyes and made as if to place a smoothing hand upon his rather untidy crop of hair But she did not touch it Going in silence to the piano she began to play very softly It was ten minutes before Trent spoke At last I am his faithfully Do you want to see it She ran across the twilight room and turned on a reading lamp beside the escritoire Then leaning on his shoulder she read what follows Dear mister Marlowe You will perhaps remember that we met under unhappy circumstances in June of last year at Marlstone On that occasion it was my duty as representing a newspaper to make an independent investigation of the circumstances of the death of the late Sigsbee Manderson I did so and I arrived at certain conclusions You may learn from the enclosed manuscript which was originally written as a despatch for my newspaper what those conclusions were For reasons which it is not necessary to state I decided at the last moment not to make them public or to communicate them to you and they are known to only two persons beside myself At this point missus Manderson raised her eyes quickly from the letter Her dark brows were drawn together Two persons she said with a note of inquiry Your uncle is the other I sought him out last night and told him the whole story Have you anything against it I always felt uneasy at keeping it from him as I did because I had led him to expect I should tell him all I discovered and my silence looked like mystery making Now that it is to be cleared up finally and there is no question of shielding you I wanted him to know everything He is a very shrewd adviser too in a way of his own and I should like to have him with me when I see Marlowe I have a feeling that two heads will be better than one on my side of the interview She sighed Yes of course uncle ought to know the truth I hope there is nobody else at all She pressed his hand I so much want all that horror buried buried deep I am very happy now dear but I shall be happier still when you have satisfied that curious mind of yours and found out everything and stamped down the earth upon it all She continued her reading Quite recently however the letter went on facts have come to my knowledge which have led me to change my decision I do not mean that I shall publish what I discovered but that I have determined to approach you and ask you for a private statement If you have anything to say which would place the matter in another light I can imagine no reason why you should withhold it I expect then to hear from you when and where I may call upon you unless you would prefer the interview to take place at my hotel In either case I desire that mister Cupples whom you will remember and who has read the enclosed document should be present also Faithfully yours PHILIP TRENT What a very stiff letter she said Now I am sure you couldn t have made it any stiffer in your own rooms Trent slipped the letter and enclosure into a long envelop This thing mustn t run any risk of going wrong It would be best to send a special messenger with orders to deliver it into his own hands If he s away it oughtn t to be left She nodded I can arrange that Wait here for a little When missus Manderson returned he was hunting through the music cabinet She sank on the carpet beside him in a wave of dark brown skirts Tell me something Philip she said If it is among the few things that I know When you saw uncle last night did you tell him about about us I did not he answered I remembered you had said nothing about telling any one It is for you isn t it to decide whether we take the world into our confidence at once or later on Then will you tell him She looked down at her clasped hands I wish you to tell him Perhaps if you think you will guess why There that is settled She lifted her eyes again to his and for a time there was silence between them He leaned back at length in the deep chair What a world he said Mabel will you play something on the piano that expresses mere joy the genuine article nothing feverish or like thorns under a pot but joy that has decided in favor of the universe It s a mood that can t last altogether so we had better get all we can out of it She went to the instrument and struck a few chords while she thought Then she began to work with all her soul at the theme in the last movement of the Ninth Symphony which is like the sound of the opening of the gates of Paradise CHAPTER XIV DOUBLE CUNNING An old oaken desk with a deep body stood by the window in a room that overlooked saint James s Park from a height The room was large furnished and decorated in the mode by someone who had brought taste to the work but the hand of the bachelor lay heavy upon it John Marlowe unlocked the desk and drew a long stout envelop from the back of the well I understand he said to mister Cupples that you have read this I read it for the first time two days ago replied mister Cupples who seated on a sofa was peering about the room with a benignant face We have discussed it fully Marlowe turned to Trent There is your manuscript he said laying the envelop on the table I have gone over it three times I do not believe there is another man who could have got at as much of the truth as you have set down there Trent ignored the compliment He sat by the table gazing stonily at the fire his long legs twisted beneath his chair You mean of course he said drawing the envelop towards him that there is more of the truth to be disclosed now We are ready to hear you as soon as you like I expect it will be a long story and the longer the better so far as I am concerned I want to understand thoroughly What we should both like I think is some preliminary account of Manderson and your relations with him It seemed to me from the first that the character of the dead man must be somehow an element in the business You were right Marlowe answered grimly He crossed the room and seated himself on a corner of the tall cushion topped fender I will begin as you suggest I ought to tell you beforehand said Trent looking him in the eyes that although I am here to listen to you I have not as yet any reason to doubt the conclusions I have stated here He tapped the envelop It is a defense that you will be putting forward you understand that Perfectly Marlowe was cool and in complete possession of himself a man different indeed from the worn out nervous being Trent remembered at Marlstone a year and a half ago His tall lithe figure was held with the perfection of muscular tone His brow was candid his blue eyes were clear though they still had as he paused collecting his ideas the look that had troubled Trent at their first meeting Only the lines of his mouth showed that he knew himself in a position of difficulty and meant to face it Sigsbee Manderson was not a man of normal mind Marlowe began in his quiet voice Most of the very rich men I met with in America had become so by virtue of abnormal greed or abnormal industry or abnormal personal force or abnormal luck None of them had remarkable intellects Manderson delighted too in heaping up wealth he worked incessantly at it he was a man of dominant will he had quite his share of luck but what made him singular was his brain power In his own country they would perhaps tell you that it was his ruthlessness in pursuit of his aims that was his most striking characteristic but there are hundreds of them who would have carried out his plans with just as little consideration for others if they could have formed the plans I used to think that his strain of Indian blood remote as it was might have something to do with the cunning and pitilessness of the man Strangely enough the existence of that strain was unknown to anyone but himself and me It was when he asked me to apply my taste for genealogical work to his own obscure family history that I made the discovery that he had in him a share of the blood of the Iroquois chief Montour and his French wife a terrible woman who ruled the savage politics of the tribes of the Wilderness two hundred years ago The Mandersons were active in the fur trade on the Pennsylvania border in those days and more than one of them married Indian women Other Indian blood than Montour s may have descended to Manderson for all I can say through previous and subsequent unions some of the wives antecedents were quite untraceable and there were so many generations of pioneering before the whole country was brought under civilization Manderson was thunderstruck at what I told him and was anxious to conceal it from every soul Of course I never gave it away while he lived and I don t think he supposed I would but I have thought since that his mind took a turn against me from that time onward It happened about a year before his death Had Manderson asked mister Cupples so unexpectedly that the other started any definable religious attitude Marlowe considered a moment None that I ever heard of he said Worship and prayer were quite unknown to him so far as I could see and I never heard him mention religion I should doubt if he had any real sense of God at all or if he was capable of knowing God through the emotions But I understood that as a child he had had a religious up bringing with a strong moral side to it His private life was in the usual limited sense blameless He was almost ascetic in his habits except as to smoking I lived with him five years without ever knowing him to tell a direct verbal falsehood constantly as he used to practise deceit in other forms Can you understand the soul of a man who never hesitated to take steps that would have the effect of hoodwinking people who would use every trick of the markets to mislead and who was at the same time scrupulous never to utter a direct lie on the most insignificant matter Manderson was like that and he was not the only one I suppose you might compare the state of mind to that of a soldier who is personally a truthful man but who will stick at nothing to deceive the enemy The rules of the game allow it and the same may be said of business as many business men regard it Only with them it is always war time It is a sad world observed mister Cupples As you say Marlowe agreed Now I was saying that one could always take Manderson s word if he gave it in a definite form The first time I ever heard him utter a downright lie was on the night he died and hearing it I believe saved me from being hanged as his murderer Marlowe stared at the light above his head and Trent moved impatiently in his chair Before we come to that he said will you tell us exactly on what footing you were with Manderson during the years you were with him We were on very good terms from beginning to end answered Marlowe Nothing like friendship he was not a man for making friends but the best of terms as between a trusted employee and his chief I went to him as private secretary just after getting my degree at Oxford For a long time I liked the position greatly When one is attached to an active American plutocrat in the prime of life one need not have many dull moments Besides it made me independent My father had some serious business reverses about that time and I was glad to be able to do without an allowance from him At the end of the first year Manderson doubled my salary It s big money he said but I guess I don t lose You see by that time I was doing a great deal more than accompany him on horseback in the morning and play chess in the evening which was mainly what he had required I was attending to his houses his farm in Ohio his shooting in Maine his horses his cars and his yacht I had become a walking railway guide and an expert cigar buyer I was always learning something Well now you understand what my position was in regard to Manderson during the last few years of my connection with him It was a happy life for me on the whole I was busy my work was varied and interesting I had time to amuse myself too and money to spend At one time I made a fool of myself about a girl and that was not a happy time but it taught me to understand the great goodness of missus Manderson Marlowe inclined his head to mister Cupples as he said this She may choose to tell you about it As for her husband he had never varied in his attitude towards me in spite of the change that came over him in the last months of his life as you know He treated me well and generously in his unsympathetic way and I never had a feeling that he was less than satisfied with his bargain that was the sort of footing we lived upon And it was that continuance of his attitude right up to the end that made the revelation so shocking when I was suddenly shown on the night on which he met his end the depth of crazy hatred of myself that was in Manderson s soul The eyes of Trent and mister Cupples met for an instant You never suspected that he hated you before that time asked Trent and mister Cupples asked at the same moment To what did you attribute it I never guessed until that night answered Marlowe that he had the smallest ill feeling toward me How long it had existed I do not know I cannot imagine why it was there I was forced to think when I considered the thing in those awful days after his death that it was a case of a madman s delusion that he believed me to be plotting against him as they so often do Some such insane conviction must have been at the root of it But who can sound the abysses of a lunatic s fancy Can you imagine the state of mind in which a man dooms himself to death with the object of delivering someone he hates to the hangman mister Cupples moved sharply in his chair You say Manderson was responsible for his own death he asked Trent glanced at him with an eye of impatience and resumed his intent watch upon the face of Marlowe In the relief of speech it was now less pale and drawn I do say so Marlowe answered concisely and looked his questioner in the face mister Cupples nodded Before we proceed to the elucidation of your statement observed the old gentleman in the tone of one discussing a point of abstract science it may be remarked that the state of mind which you attribute to Manderson Suppose we have the story first Trent interrupted gently laying a hand on mister Cupples arm You were telling us he went on turning to Marlowe how things stood between you and Manderson Now will you tell us the facts of what happened that night Marlowe flushed at the barely perceptible emphasis which Trent laid upon the word facts He drew himself up Bunner and myself dined with mister and missus Manderson that Sunday evening he began speaking carefully It was just like other dinners at which the four of us had been together Manderson was taciturn and gloomy as we had latterly been accustomed to see him We others kept a conversation going We rose from the table I suppose about nine missus Manderson went to the drawing room and Bunner went up to the hotel to see an acquaintance Manderson asked me to come into the orchard behind the house saying he wished to have a talk We paced up and down the pathway there out of earshot from the house and Manderson as he smoked his cigar spoke to me in his cool deliberate way He had never seemed more sane or more well disposed to me He said he wanted me to do him an important service There was a big thing on It was a secret affair Bunner knew nothing of it and the less I knew the better He wanted me to do exactly as he directed and not bother my head about reasons This I may say was quite characteristic of Manderson s method of going to work If at times he required a man to be a mere tool in his hand he would tell him so He had used me in the same kind of way a dozen times I assured him he could rely on me and said I was ready Right now he asked I said of course I was He nodded and said I tell you his words as well as I can recollect them Well attend to this There is a man in England now who is in this thing with me He was to have left to morrow for Paris by the noon boat from Southampton to Havre His name is George Harris at least that s the name he is going by Do you remember that name Yes I said when I went up to London a week ago you asked me to book a cabin in that name on the boat that goes to morrow I gave you the ticket Here it is he said producing it from his pocket Now Manderson said to me poking his cigar butt at me with each sentence in a way he used to have George Harris cannot leave England to morrow I find I shall want him where he is And I want Bunner where he is But somebody has got to go by that boat and take certain papers to Paris Or else my plan is going to fall to pieces Will you go I said Certainly I am here to obey orders He bit his cigar and said That s all right but these are not just ordinary orders not the kind of thing one can ask of a man in the ordinary way of his duty to an employer The point is this The deal I am busy with is one in which neither myself nor any one known to be connected with me must appear as yet That is vital But these people I am up against know your face as well as they know mine If my secretary is known in certain quarters to have crossed to Paris at this time and to have interviewed certain people and that would be known as soon as it happened then the game is up He threw away his cigar end and looked at me questioningly I didn t like it much but I liked failing Manderson at a pinch still less I spoke lightly I said I supposed I should have to conceal my identity and I would do my best I told him I used to be pretty good at make up He nodded in approval He said That s good I judged you would not let me down Then he gave me my instructions You take the car right now and start for Southampton there s no train that will fit in You ll be driving all night Barring accidents you ought to get there by six in the morning But whenever you arrive drive straight to the Grand Hotel and ask for George Harris If he s there tell him you are to go over instead of him and ask him to telephone me here It is very important he should know that at the earliest moment possible But if he isn t there that means he has got the instructions I wired to day and hasn t gone to Southampton In that case you don t want to trouble about him any more but just wait for the boat You can leave the car at a garage under a fancy name mine must not be given See about changing your appearance I don t care how so you do it well Travel by the boat as George Harris Let on to be anything you like but be careful and don t talk much to anybody When you arrive take a room at the Hotel saint Petersburg You will receive a note or message there addressed to George Harris telling you where to take the wallet I shall give you The wallet is locked and you want to take good care of it Have you got all that clear I repeated the instructions I asked if I should return from Paris after handing over the wallet As soon as you like he said And mind this whatever happens don t communicate with me at any stage of the journey If you don t get the message in Paris at once just wait until you do days if necessary But not a line of any sort to me Understand Now get ready as quick as you can I ll go with you in the car a little way Hurry That is so far as I can remember the exact substance of what Manderson said to me that night I went to my room changed into day clothes and hastily threw a few necessaries into a kit bag My mind was in a whirl not so much at the nature of the business as at the suddenness of it I think I remember telling you the last time we met he turned to Trent that Manderson had rather a fondness for doing things in a story book style Other things being equal he delighted in a bit of mystification and melodrama and I told myself that this was Manderson all over I hurried downstairs with my bag and rejoined him in the library He handed me a stout leather letter case about eight inches by six fastened with a strap with a lock on it I could just squeeze it into my side pocket Then I went to get out the car from the garage behind the house As I was bringing it round to the front a disconcerting thought struck me I remembered that I had only a few shillings in my pocket For some time past I had been keeping myself very short of cash and for this reason which I tell you because it is a vital point as you will see in a minute I was living temporarily on borrowed money I had always been careless about money while I was with Manderson and being a gregarious animal I had made many friends most of them belonging to a New York set that had little to do but get rid of the large incomes given them by their parents Still I was very well paid and I was too busy even to attempt to go very far with them in that amusing occupation I was still well on the right side of the ledger until I began merely out of curiosity to play at speculation It s a very old story particularly in Wall Street I thought it was easy I was lucky at first I would always be prudent and so on Then came the day when I went out of my depth In one week I was separated from my roll as Bunner expressed it when I told him and I owed money too I had had my lesson Now in this pass I went to Manderson and told him what I had done and how I stood He heard me with a very grim smile and then with the nearest approach to sympathy I had ever found in him he advanced me a sum on account of my salary that would clear me Don t play the markets any more was all he said Now on that Sunday night Manderson knew that I was practically without any money in the world He knew that Bunner knew it too He may have known that I had even borrowed a little more from Bunner for pocket money until my next check was due which owing to my anticipation of my salary would not have been a large one Bear this knowledge of Manderson s in mind As soon as I had brought the car round I went into the library and stated the difficulty to Manderson What followed gave me slight as it was my first impression of something odd being afoot As soon as I mentioned the word expenses his hand went mechanically to his left hip pocket where he always kept a little case containing notes to the value of about a hundred pounds in our money This was such a rooted habit in him that I was astonished to see him check the movement suddenly Then to my greater amazement he swore viciously under his breath I had never heard him do this before but Bunner had told me that of late he had often shown irritation in this way when they were alone Has he mislaid his note case was the question that flashed through my mind But it seemed to me that it could not affect his plan at all and I will tell you why The week before when I had gone up to London to carry out various commissions including the booking of a berth for mister George Harris I had drawn a thousand pounds for Manderson from his bankers and all at his request in notes of small amounts I did not know what this unusually large sum in cash was for but I did know that the packets of notes were in his locked desk in the library or had been earlier in the day when I had seen him fingering them as he sat at the desk But instead of turning to the desk Manderson stood looking at me There was fury in his face and it was a strange sight to see him gradually master it until his eyes grew cold again Wait in the car he said slowly I will get some money We both went out and as I was getting into my overcoat in the hall I saw him enter the drawing room which you remember was on the other side of the entrance hall I stepped out onto the lawn before the house and smoked a cigarette pacing up and down I was asking myself again and again where that thousand pounds was whether it was in the drawing room and if so why Presently as I passed one of the drawing room windows I noticed missus Manderson s shadow on the thin silk curtain She was standing at her escritoire The window was open and as I passed I heard her say I have not quite thirty pounds here Will that be enough I did not hear the answer but next moment Manderson s shadow was mingled with hers and I heard the chink of money Then as he stood by the window and as I was moving away these words of his came to my ears and these at least I can repeat exactly for astonishment stamped them on my memory I m going out now Marlowe has persuaded me to go for a moonlight run in the car He is very urgent about it He says it will help me to sleep and I guess he is right I have told you that in the course of four years I had never once heard Manderson utter a direct lie about anything great or small I believed that I understood the man s queer skin deep morality and I could have sworn that if he was firmly pressed with a question that could not be evaded he would either refuse to answer or tell the truth But what had I just heard No answer to any question A voluntary statement precise in terms that was utterly false The unimaginable had happened It was almost as if one s dearest friend in a moment of closest sympathy had suddenly struck one in the face The blood rushed to my head and I stood still on the grass I stood there until I heard his step at the front door and then I pulled myself together and stepped quickly to the car He handed me a banker s paper bag with gold and notes in it There s more than you ll want there he said and I pocketed it mechanically For a minute or so I stood discussing with Manderson it was by one of those tours de force of which one s mind is capable under great excitement certain points about the route of the long drive before me I had made the run several times by day and I believe I spoke quite calmly and naturally about it But while I spoke my mind was seething in a flood of suddenly born suspicion and fear I did not know what I feared I simply felt fear somehow I did not know how connected with Manderson My soul once opened to it fear rushed in like an assaulting army I felt I knew that something was altogether wrong and sinister and I felt myself to be the object of it Yet Manderson was surely no enemy of mine Then my thoughts reached out wildly for an answer to the question why he had told that lie And all the time the blood hammered in my ears Where is that money Reason struggled hard to set up the suggestion that the two things were not necessarily connected The instinct of a man in danger would not listen to it As we started and the car took the curve into the road it was merely the unconscious part of me that steered and controlled it and that made occasional empty remarks as we slid along in the moonlight Within me was a confusion and vague alarm that was far worse than any definite terror I ever felt About a mile from the house you remember one passed on one s left a gate on the other side of which was the golf course There Manderson said he would get down and I stopped the car You ve got it all clear he asked With a sort of wrench I forced myself to remember and repeat the directions given me That s O K he said Good by then Stay with that wallet Those were the last words I heard him speak as the car moved gently away from him Marlowe rose from his chair and pressed his hands to his eyes He was flushed with the excitement of his own narrative and there was in his look a horror of recollection that held both the listeners silent He shook himself with a movement like a dog s and then his hands behind him stood erect before the fire as he continued his tale I expect you both know what the back reflector of a motor car is Trent nodded quickly his face alive with anticipation but mister Cupples who cherished a mild but obstinate prejudice against motor cars readily confessed to ignorance It is a small round or more often rectangular mirror Marlowe explained rigged out from the right side of the screen in front of the driver and adjusted in such a way that he can see without turning round if anything is coming up behind to pass him It is quite an ordinary appliance and there was one on this car As the car moved on and Manderson ceased speaking behind me I saw in that mirror a thing that I wish I could forget Marlowe was silent for a moment staring at the wall before him Manderson s face he said in a low tone He was standing in the road looking after me only a few yards behind and the moonlight was full on his face The mirror happened to catch it for an instant Physical habit is a wonderful thing I did not shift hand or foot on the controlling mechanism of the car Indeed I dare say it steadied me against the shock to have myself braced to the business of driving You have read in books I dare say of hell looking out of a man s eyes but perhaps you don t know what a good metaphor that is If I had not known Manderson was there I should not have recognized the face It was that of a madman distorted hideous in the imbecility of hate the teeth bared in a simian grin of ferocity and triumph the eyes In the little mirror I had this glimpse of the face alone I saw nothing of whatever gesture there may have been as that writhing white mask glared after me And I saw it only for a flash The car went on gathering speed and as it went my brain suddenly purged of the vapors of doubt and perplexity was as busy as the throbbing engine before my feet I knew You say something in that manuscript of yours mister Trent about the swift automatic way in which one s ideas arrange themselves about some new illuminating thought It is quite true The awful intensity of ill will that had flamed after me from those straining eyeballs had poured over my mind like a search light I was thinking quite clearly now and almost coldly for I knew what at least I knew whom I had to fear and instinct warned me that it was not a time to give room to the emotions that were fighting to possess me The man hated me insanely That incredible fact I suddenly knew But the face had told me it would have told anybody more than that It was a face of hatred gratified it proclaimed some damnable triumph It had gloated over me driving away to my fate This too was plain to me And to what fate I stopped the car It had gone about two hundred and fifty yards and a sharp bend of the road hid the spot where I had set Manderson down I lay back in the seat and thought it out Something was to happen to me In Paris Probably why else should I be sent there with money and a ticket But why Paris That puzzled me for I had no melodramatic ideas about Paris I put the point aside for a moment I turned to the other things that had roused my attention that evening The lie about my persuading him to go for a moonlight run What was the intention of that Manderson I said to myself will be returning without me while I am on my way to Southampton What will he tell them about me How account for his returning alone and without the car As I asked myself that sinister question there rushed into my mind the last of my difficulties Where are the thousand pounds And in the same instant came the answer The thousand pounds are in my pocket I got up and stepped from the car My knees trembled and I felt very sick I saw the plot now as I thought The whole of the story about the papers and the necessity of their being taken to Paris was a blind With Manderson s money about me of which he would declare I had robbed him I was to all appearance attempting to escape from England with every precaution that guilt could suggest He would communicate with the police at once and would know how to put them on my track I should be arrested in Paris if I got so far living under a false name after having left the car under a false name disguised myself and traveled in a cabin which I had booked in advance also under a false name It would be plainly the crime of a man without money and for some reason desperately in want of it As for my account of the affair it would be too preposterous As this ghastly array of incriminating circumstances rose up before me I dragged the stout letter case from my pocket In the intensity of the moment I never entertained the faintest doubt that I was right and that the money was there It would easily hold the packets of notes But as I felt it and weighed it in my hands it seemed to me there must be more than this It was too bulky What more was to be laid to my charge After all a thousand pounds was not much to tempt a man like myself to run the risk of penal servitude In this new agitation scarcely knowing what I did I caught the surrounding strap in my fingers just above the fastening and tore the staple out of the lock These locks you know are pretty flimsy as a rule Here Marlowe paused and walked to the oaken desk before the window Opening a drawer full of miscellaneous objects he took out a box of odd keys and selected a small one distinguished by a piece of pink tape He handed it to Trent I keep that by me as a sort of morbid memento It is the key to the lock I smashed I might have saved myself the trouble if I had known that this key was at that moment in the left hand side pocket of my overcoat Manderson must have slipped it in either while the coat was hanging in the hall or while he sat at my side in the car I might not have found the tiny thing there for weeks as a matter of fact I did find it two days after Manderson was dead but a police search would have found it in five minutes And then I I with the case and its contents in my pocket my false name and my sham spectacles and the rest of it I should have had no explanation to offer but the highly convincing one that I didn t know the key was there Trent dangled the key by its tape idly Then How do you know this is the key of that case he asked quickly I tried it As soon as I found it I went up and fitted it to the lock I knew where I had left the thing So do you I think mister Trent Don t you There was a faint shade of mockery in Marlowe s voice Touche Trent said with a dry smile I found a large empty letter case with a burst lock lying with other odds and ends on the dressing table in Manderson s room Your statement is that you put it there I could make nothing of it He closed his lips There was no reason for hiding it said Marlowe But to get back to my story I burst the lock of the strap I opened the case before one of the lamps of the car The first thing I found in it I ought to have expected of course but I hadn t He paused and glanced at Trent It was began Trent mechanically and then stopped himself Try not to bring me in any more if you don t mind he said meeting the other s eye I have complimented you already in that document on your cleverness You need not prove it by making the judge help you out with your evidence All right agreed Marlowe I couldn t resist just that much If you had been in my place you would have known before I did that Manderson s little pocket case was there As soon as I saw it of course I remembered his not having had it about him when I asked for money and his surprising anger He had made a false step He had already fastened his note case up with the rest of what was to figure as my plunder and placed it in my hands I opened it It contained a few notes as usual I didn t count them Tucked into the flaps of the big case in packets were the other notes just as I had brought them from London And with them were two small wash leather bags the look of which I knew well My heart jumped sickeningly again for this too was utterly unexpected In those bags Manderson kept the diamonds in which he had been investing for some time past I didn t open them I could feel the tiny stones shifting under the pressure of my fingers How many thousands of pounds worth there were there I have no idea We had regarded Manderson s diamond buying as merely a speculative fad I believe now that it was the earliest movement in the scheme for my ruin For any one like myself to be represented as having robbed him there ought to be a strong inducement shown That had been provided with a vengeance Now I thought I have the whole thing plain and I must act I saw instantly what I must do I had left Manderson about a mile from the house It would take him twenty minutes fifteen if he walked fast to get back to the house where he would of course immediately tell his story of robbery and probably telephone at once to the police in Bishopsbridge I had left him only five or six minutes ago for all that I have just told you was as quick thinking as I ever did It would be easy to overtake him in the car before he neared the house There would be an awkward interview I set my teeth as I thought of it and all my fears vanished as I began to savor the gratification of telling him my opinion of him There are probably few people who ever positively looked forward to an awkward interview with Manderson but I was mad with rage My honor and my liberty had been plotted against with detestable treachery I did not consider what would follow the interview That would arrange itself I had started and turned the car I was already going fast when I heard the sound of a shot in front of me to the right Instantly I stopped the car My first wild thought was that Manderson was shooting at me Then I realized that the noise had not been close at hand I could see nobody on the road though the moonlight flooded it I had left Manderson at a spot just round a corner that was now some fifty yards ahead of me I started again and turned the corner at a slow pace Then I stopped again with a jar and for a moment I sat perfectly still Manderson lay dead a few steps from me on the turf within the gate clearly visible to me in the moonlight Marlowe made another pause and Trent with a puckered brow inquired On the golf course Obviously remarked mister Cupples The eighth green is just there He had grown more and more interested as Marlowe went on and was now playing feverishly with his thin beard On the green quite close to the flag said Marlowe He lay on his back his arms were stretched abroad his jacket and heavy overcoat were open the light shone hideously on his white face and his shirt front it glistened on his bared teeth and one of the eyes The other you saw it The man was certainly dead As I sat there stunned unable for the moment to think at all I could even see a thin dark line of blood running down from the shattered socket to the ear Close by lay his soft black hat and at his feet a pistol I suppose it was only a few seconds that I sat helplessly staring at the body Then I rose and moved to it with dragging feet for now the truth had come to me at last and I realized the fullness of my appalling danger It was not only my liberty or my honor that the maniac had undermined It was death that he had planned for me death with the degradation of the scaffold To strike me down with certainty he had not hesitated to end his life a life which was no doubt already threatened by a melancholic impulse to self destruction and the last agony of the suicide had been turned perhaps to a devilish joy by the thought that he dragged down my life with his For so far as I could see at the moment my situation was utterly hopeless If it had been desperate on the assumption that Manderson meant to denounce me as a thief what was it now that his corpse denounced me as a murderer I picked up the revolver and saw almost without emotion that it was my own Manderson had taken it from my room I suppose while I was getting out the car At the same moment I remembered that it was by Manderson s suggestion that I had had it engraved with my initials to distinguish it from a precisely similar weapon which he had of his own I bent over the body and satisfied myself that there was no life left in it I must tell you here that I did not notice then or afterwards the scratches and marks on the wrists which were taken as evidence of a struggle with an assailant But I have no doubt that Manderson deliberately injured himself in this way before firing the shot it was a part of his plan Though I never perceived that detail however it was evident enough as I looked at the body that Manderson had not forgotten in his last act on earth to tie me tighter by putting out of court the question of suicide He had clearly been at pains to hold the pistol at arm s length and there was not a trace of smoke or of burning on the face The wound was absolutely clean and was already ceasing to bleed outwardly I rose and paced the green reckoning up the points in the crushing case against me I was the last to be seen with Manderson I had persuaded him so he had lied to his wife and as I afterwards knew to the butler to go with me for the drive from which he never returned My pistol had killed him It was true that by discovering his plot I had saved myself from heaping up further incriminating facts flight concealment the possession of the treasure But what need of them after all As I stood what hope was there What could I do Marlowe came to the table and leaned forward with his hands upon it I want he said very earnestly to try to make you understand what was in my mind when I decided to do what I did I hope you won t be bored because I must do it You may both have thought I acted like a fool But after all the police never suspected me I walked that green for a quarter of an hour I suppose thinking the thing out like a game of chess I had to think ahead and think coolly for my safety depended on upsetting the plans of one of the longest headed men who ever lived And remember that for all I knew there were details of the scheme still hidden from me waiting to crush me Two plain courses presented themselves at once Either of them I thought would certainly prove fatal I could in the first place do the completely straightforward thing take back the dead man tell my story hand over the notes and diamonds and trust to the saving power of truth and innocence I could have laughed as I thought of it I saw myself bringing home the corpse and giving an account of myself boggling with sheer shame over the absurdity of my wholly unsupported tale as I brought a charge of mad hatred and fiendish treachery against a man who had never so far as I knew had a word to say against me At every turn the cunning of Manderson had forestalled me His careful concealment of such a hatred was a characteristic feature of the stratagem only a man of his iron self restraint could have done it You can see for yourselves how every fact in my statement would appear in the shadow of Manderson s death a clumsy lie I tried to imagine myself telling such a story to the counsel for my defense I could see the face with which he would listen to it I could read in the lines of it his thought that to put forward such an impudent farrago would mean merely the disappearance of any chance there might be of a commutation of the capital sentence True I had not fled I had brought back the body I had handed over the property But how did that help me It would only suggest that I had yielded to a sudden funk after killing my man and had no nerve left to clutch at the fruits of the crime it would suggest perhaps that I had not set out to kill but only to threaten and that when I found that I had done murder the heart went out of me Turn it which way I would I could see no hope of escape by this plan of action The second of the obvious things that I might do was to take the hint offered by the situation and to fly at once That too must prove fatal There was the body I had no time to hide it in such a way that it would not be found at the first systematic search But whatever I should do with the body Manderson s not returning to the house would cause uneasiness in two or three hours at most Martin would suspect an accident to the car and would telephone to the police At daybreak the roads would be scoured and inquiries telegraphed in every direction The police would act on the possibility of there being foul play They would spread their nets with energy in such a big business as the disappearance of Manderson Ports and railway termini would be watched Within twenty four hours the body would be found and the whole country would be on the alert for me all Europe scarcely less I did not believe there was a spot in Christendom where the man accused of Manderson s murder could pass unchallenged with every newspaper crying the fact of his death into the ears of all the world Every stranger would be suspected every man woman and child would be a detective The car wherever I should abandon it would put people on my track If I had to choose between two utterly hopeless courses I decided I would take that of telling the preposterous truth But now I cast about desperately for some tale that would seem more plausible than the truth Could I save my neck by a lie One after another came into my mind I need not trouble to remember them now Each had its own futilities and perils but every one split upon the fact or what would be taken for fact that I had induced Manderson to go out with me and the fact that he had never returned alive Notion after notion I swiftly rejected as I paced there by the dead man and doom seemed to settle down upon me more heavily as the moments passed Then a strange thought came to me Several times I had repeated to myself half consciously as a sort of refrain the words in which I had heard Manderson tell his wife that I had induced him to go out Marlowe has persuaded me to go for a moonlight run in the car He is very urgent about it All at once it struck me that without meaning to do so I was saying this in Manderson s voice As you found out for yourself mister Trent I have a natural gift of mimicry I had imitated Manderson s voice many times so successfully as to deceive even Bunner who had been much more in his company than his own wife It was you remember Marlowe turned to mister Cupples a strong metallic voice of great carrying power so unusual as to make it a very fascinating voice to imitate and at the same time very easy I said the words carefully to myself again like this he uttered them and mister Cupples opened his eyes in amazement and then I struck my hand upon the low wall beside me Manderson never returned alive I said aloud But Manderson shall return alive In thirty seconds the bare outline of the plan was complete in my mind I did not wait to think over details Every instant was precious now I lifted the body and laid it on the floor of the car covered with a rug I took the hat and the revolver Not one trace remained on the green I believe of that night s work As I drove back to White Gables my design took shape before me with a rapidity and ease that filled me with a wild excitement I should escape yet It was all so easy if I kept my pluck Putting aside the unusual and unlikely I should not fail I wanted to shout to scream Nearing the house I slackened speed and carefully reconnoitered the road Nothing was moving I turned the car into the open field on the other side of the road about twenty paces short of the little door at the extreme corner of the grounds I brought it to rest behind a stack When with Manderson s hat on my head and the pistol in my pocket I had staggered with the body across the moonlit road and through that door I left much of my apprehension behind me With swift action and an unbroken nerve I thought I ought to succeed With a long sigh Marlowe threw himself into one of the deep chairs at the fireside and passed his handkerchief over his damp forehead Each of his hearers too drew a deep breath but not audibly Everything else you know he said He took a cigarette from a box beside him and lighted it Trent watched the very slight quiver of the hand that held the match and privately noted that his own at the moment was not so steady The shoes that betrayed me to you pursued Marlowe after a short silence were painful all the time I wore them but I never dreamed that they had given anywhere I knew that no footstep of mine must appear by any accident in the soft ground about the hut where I laid the body or between the hut and the house so I took the shoes off and crammed my feet into them as soon as I was inside the little door I left my own shoes with my own jacket and overcoat near the body ready to be resumed later I made a clear footmark on the soft gravel outside the French window and several on the drugget round the carpet The stripping off of the outer clothing of the body and the dressing of it afterwards in the brown suit and shoes and putting the things into the pockets was a horrible business and getting the teeth out of the mouth was worse The head but you don t want to hear about it I didn t feel it much at the time I was wriggling my own head out of a noose you see I wish I had thought of pulling down the cuffs and had tied the shoes more neatly And putting the watch in the wrong pocket was a bad mistake It had all to be done so hurriedly You were wrong by the way about the whisky After one stiffish drink I had no more but I filled up a flask that was in the cupboard and pocketed it I had a night of peculiar anxiety and effort in front of me and I didn t know how I should stand it I had to take some once or twice during the drive Speaking of that you give rather a generous allowance of time in your document for doing that run by night You say that to get to Southampton by half past six in that car under the conditions a man must even if he drove like a demon have left Marlstone by twelve at latest I had not got the body dressed in the other suit with tie and watch chain and so forth until nearly ten minutes past and then I had to get to the car and start it going But then I don t suppose any demon would have taken the risks I did in that car at night without a head light It turns me cold to think of it now There s nothing much to say about what I did in the house I spent the time after Martin had left me in carefully thinking over the remaining steps in my plan while I unloaded and thoroughly cleaned the revolver using my handkerchief and a penholder from the desk I also placed the packets of notes the note case and the diamonds in the roll top desk which I opened and re locked with Manderson s key When I went upstairs it was a trying moment for though I was safe from the eyes of Martin as he sat in his pantry there was a faint possibility of somebody being about on the bedroom floor I had sometimes found the French maid wandering about there when the other servants were in bed Bunner I knew was a deep sleeper missus Manderson I had gathered from things I had heard her say was usually asleep by eleven I had thought it possible that her gift of sleep had helped her to retain all her beauty and vitality in spite of a marriage which we all knew was an unhappy one Still it was uneasy work mounting the stairs and holding myself ready to retreat to the library again at the least sound from above But nothing happened The first thing I did on reaching the corridor was to enter my room and put the revolver and cartridges back in the case Then I turned off the light and went quietly into Manderson s room What I had to do there you know I had to take off the shoes and put them outside the door leave Manderson s jacket waistcoat trousers and black tie after taking everything out of the pockets select a suit and tie and shoes for the body and place the dental plate in the bowl which I moved from the washing stand to the bedside leaving those ruinous finger marks as I did so The marks on the drawer must have been made when I shut it after taking out the tie Then I had to lie down in the bed and tumble it You know all about it all except my state of mind which you couldn t imagine and I couldn t describe The worst came when I had hardly begun my operations the moment when missus Manderson spoke from the room where I supposed her asleep I was prepared for it happening it was a possibility but I nearly lost my nerve all the same However By the way I may tell you this in the extremely unlikely contingency of missus Manderson remaining awake and so putting out of the question my escape by way of her window I had planned simply to remain where I was a few hours and then not speaking to her to leave the house quickly and quietly by the ordinary way Martin would have been in bed by that time I might have been heard to leave but not seen I should have done just as I had planned with the body and then made the best time I could in the car to Southampton The difference would have been that I couldn t have furnished an unquestionable alibi by turning up at the hotel at six thirty I should have made the best of it by driving straight to the docks and making my ostentatious inquiries there I could in any case have got there long before the boat left at noon I couldn t see that anybody could suspect me of the supposed murder in any case but if any one had and if I hadn t arrived until ten o clock say I shouldn t have been able to answer It is impossible for me to have got to Southampton so soon after shooting him I should simply have had to say I was delayed by a break down after leaving Manderson at half past ten and challenged any one to produce any fact connecting me with the crime They couldn t have done it The pistol left openly in my room might have been used by anybody even if it could be proved that that particular pistol was used Nobody could reasonably connect me with the shooting so long as it was believed that it was Manderson who had returned to the house The suspicion could not I was confident enter any one s mind All the same I wanted to introduce the element of absolute physical impossibility I knew I should feel ten times as safe with that So when I knew from the sound of her breathing that missus Manderson was asleep again I walked quickly across her room in my stocking feet and was on the grass with my bundle in ten seconds I don t think I made the least noise The curtain before the window was of soft thick stuff and didn t rustle and when I pushed the glass doors further open there was not a sound Tell me said Trent as the other stopped to light a new cigarette why you took the risk of going through missus Manderson s room to escape from the house I could see when I looked into the thing on the spot why it had to be on that side of the house there was a danger of being seen by Martin or by some servant at a bedroom window if you got out by a window on one of the other sides But there were three unoccupied rooms on that side two spare bedrooms and missus Manderson s sitting room I should have thought it would have been safer after you had done what was necessary to your plan in Manderson s room to leave it quietly and escape through one of those three rooms The fact that you went through her window you know he added coldly might have suggested if it became known a certain suspicion in regard to the lady herself I think you understand me Marlowe turned upon him with a glowing face And I think you will understand me mister Trent he said in a voice that shook a little when I say that if such a possibility had occurred to me then I would have taken any risk rather than make my escape by that way Oh well he went on more coolly I suppose that to any one who didn t know her the idea of her being privy to her husband s murder might not seem so indescribably fatuous Forgive the expression He looked attentively at the burning end of his cigarette studiously unconscious of the red flag that flew in Trent s eyes for an instant at his words and the tone of them That emotion however was conquered at once Your remark is perfectly just Trent said with answering coolness I can quite believe too that at the time you didn t think of the possibility I mentioned But surely apart from that it would have been safer to do as I said go by the window of an unoccupied room Do you think so said Marlowe All I can say is I hadn t the nerve to do it I tell you when I entered Manderson s room I shut the door of it on more than half my terrors I had the problem confined before me in a closed space with only one danger in it and that a known danger the danger of missus Manderson The thing was almost done I had only to wait until she was certainly asleep after her few moments of waking up for which as I told you I was prepared as a possibility Barring accidents the way was clear But now suppose that I carrying Manderson s clothes and shoes had opened that door again and gone in my shirt sleeves and socks to enter one of the empty rooms The moonlight was flooding the corridor through the end window Even if my face were concealed nobody could mistake my standing figure for Manderson s Martin might be going about the house in his silent way Bunner might come out of his bedroom One of the servants who were supposed to be in bed might come round the corner from the other passage I had found Celestine prowling about quite as late as it was then None of these things was very likely but they were all too likely for me They were uncertainties Shut off from the household in Manderson s room I knew exactly what I had to face As I lay in my clothes in Manderson s bed and listened for the almost inaudible breathing through the open door I felt far more ease of mind terrible as my anxiety was than I had felt since I saw the dead body on the turf I even congratulated myself that I had had the chance through missus Manderson s speaking to me of tightening one of the screws in my scheme by repeating the statement about my having been sent to Southampton Marlowe looked at Trent who nodded as who should say that his point was met As for Southampton pursued Marlowe you know what I did when I got there I have no doubt I had decided to take Manderson s story about the mysterious Harris and act it out on my own lines It was a carefully prepared lie better than anything I could improvise I even went so far as to get through a trunk call to the hotel at Southampton from the library before starting and ask if Harris was there As I expected he wasn t Was that why you telephoned Trent inquired quickly The reason for telephoning was to get myself into an attitude in which Martin couldn t see my face or anything but the jacket and hat yet which was a natural and familiar attitude But while I was about it it was obviously better to make a genuine call If I had simply pretended to be telephoning the people at the exchange could have told you at once that there hadn t been a call from White Gables that night One of the first things I did was to make that inquiry said Trent That telephone call and the wire you sent from Southampton to the dead man to say Harris hadn t turned up and you were returning both those appealed to me A constrained smile lighted Marlowe s face for a moment I don t know that there s anything more to tell I returned to Marlstone and faced your friend the detective with such nerve as I had left The worst was when I heard you had been put on the case no that wasn t the worst The worst was when I saw you walk out of the shrubbery the next day coming away from the shed where I had laid the body For one ghastly moment I thought you were going to give me in charge on the spot Now I ve told you everything you don t look so terrible He closed his eyes and there was a short silence Then Trent got suddenly to his feet Cross examination inquired Marlowe looking at him gravely Not at all said Trent stretching his long limbs Only stiffness of the legs I don t want to ask any questions I believe what you have told us I don t believe it simply because I always liked your face or because it saves awkwardness which are the most usual reasons for believing a person but because my vanity will have it that no man could lie to me steadily for an hour without my perceiving it Your story is an extraordinary one but Manderson was an extraordinary man and so are you You acted like a lunatic in doing what you did but I quite agree with you that if you had acted like a sane man you wouldn t have had the hundredth part of a dog s chance with a judge and jury One thing is beyond dispute on any reading of the affair you are a man of courage The color rushed into Marlowe s face and he hesitated for words Before he could speak mister Cupples arose with a dry cough For my part he said I never supposed you guilty for a moment Marlowe turned to him in grateful amazement Trent with an incredulous stare But pursued mister Cupples holding up his hand there is one question which I should like to put Marlowe bowed saying nothing Suppose said mister Cupples that someone else had been suspected of the crime and put upon trial What would you have done I think my duty was clear I should have gone with my story to the lawyers for the defense and put myself in their hands Trent laughed aloud Now that the thing was over his spirits were rapidly becoming ungovernable I can see their faces he said As a matter of fact though nobody else was ever in danger There wasn t a shred of evidence against any one I looked up Murch at the Yard this morning and he told me he had come round to Bunner s view that it was a case of revenge on the part of some American black hand gang So there s the end of the Manderson case Holy suffering Moses What an ass a man can make of himself when he thinks he s being preternaturally clever He seized the bulky envelop from the table and stuffed it into the heart of the fire There s for you old friend For want of you the world s course will not fail But look here It s getting late nearly seven and Cupples and I have an appointment at half past We must go mister Marlowe good by He looked into the other s eyes I am a man who has worked hard to put a rope round your neck Considering the circumstances I don t know whether you will blame me Will you shake hands CHAPTER XV THE LAST STRAW What was that you said about our having an appointment at half past seven asked mister Cupples as the two came out of the great gateway of the pile of flats Have we such an appointment Certainly we have replied Trent You are dining with me Only one thing can properly celebrate this occasion and that is a dinner for which I pay No no I asked you first I have got right down to the bottom of a case that must be unique a case that has troubled even my mind for over a year and if that isn t a good reason for standing a dinner I don t know what is Cupples we will not go to my club This is to be a festival and to be seen in a London club in a state of pleasurable emotion is more than enough to shatter any man s career Besides that the dinner there is always the same or at least they always make it taste the same I know not how The eternal dinner at my club hath bored millions of members like me and shall bore but to night let the feast be spread in vain so far as we are concerned We will not go where the satraps throng the hall We will go to Sheppard s Who is Sheppard asked mister Cupples mildly as they proceeded up Victoria Street His companion went with an unnatural lightness and a policeman observing his face smiled indulgently at a look of happiness which he could only attribute to alcohol Who is Sheppard echoed Trent with bitter emphasis That question if you will pardon me for saying so Cupples is thoroughly characteristic of the spirit of aimless inquiry prevailing in this restless day I suggest our dining at Sheppard s and instantly you fold your arms and demand in a frenzy of intellectual pride to know who Sheppard is before you will cross the threshold of Sheppard s I am not going to pander to the vices of the modern mind Sheppard s is a place where one can dine I do not know Sheppard It never occurred to me that Sheppard existed Probably he is a myth of totemistic origin All I know is that you can get a bit of saddle of mutton at Sheppard s that has made many an American visitor curse the day that Christopher Columbus was born Taxi A cab rolled smoothly to the curb and the driver received his instruction with a majestic nod Another reason I have for suggesting Sheppard s continued Trent feverishly lighting a cigarette is that I am going to be married to the most wonderful woman in the world I trust the connection of ideas is clear You are going to marry Mabel cried mister Cupples My dear friend what good news this is Shake hands Trent this is glorious I congratulate you both from the bottom of my heart And may I say I don t want to interrupt your flow of high spirits which is very natural indeed and I remember being just the same in similar circumstances long ago but may I say how earnestly I have hoped for this Mabel has seen so much unhappiness yet she is surely a woman formed in the great purpose of humanity to be the best influence in the life of a good man But I did not know her mind as regarded yourself Your mind I have known for some time mister Cupples went on with a twinkle in his eye that would have done credit to the worldliest of creatures I saw it at once when you were both dining at my house and you sat listening to Professor Peppmueller and looking at her Some of us older fellows have our wits about us still my dear boy Mabel says she knew it before that replied Trent with a slightly crestfallen air And I thought I was acting the part of a person who was not mad about her to the life Well I never was any good at dissembling I shouldn t wonder if even old Peppmueller noticed something through his double convex lenses But however crazy I may have been as an undeclared suitor I am going to be much worse now Here s the place he broke off as the cab rushed down a side street and swung round a corner into a broad and populous thoroughfare We re there already The cab drew up Here we are said Trent as he paid the man and led mister Cupples into a long paneled room set with many tables and filled with a hum of talk This is the house of fulfilment of craving this is the bower with the roses around it I see there are three bookmakers eating pork at my favorite table We will have that one in the opposite corner He conferred earnestly with a waiter while mister Cupples in a pleasant meditation warmed himself before the great fire The wine here Trent resumed as they seated themselves is almost certainly made out of grapes What shall we drink mister Cupples came out of his reverie I think he said I will have milk and soda water Speak lower urged Trent The head waiter has a weak heart and he might hear you Milk and soda water Cupples you may think you have a strong constitution and I don t say you have not but I warn you that this habit of mixing drinks has been the death of many a robuster man than you Be wise in time Fill high the bowl with Samian wine leave soda to the Turkish hordes Here comes our food He gave another order to the waiter who ranged the dishes before them and darted away Trent was it seemed a respected customer I have sent he said for wine that I know and I hope you will try it If you have taken a vow then in the name of all the teetotal saints drink water which stands at your elbow but don t seek a cheap notoriety by demanding milk and soda I have never taken any pledge said mister Cupples examining his mutton with a favorable eye I simply don t care about wine I bought a bottle once and drank it to see what it was like and it made me ill But very likely it was bad wine I will taste some of yours as it is your dinner and I do assure you my dear Trent I should like to do something unusual to show how strongly I feel on the present occasion I have not been so delighted for many years To think he reflected aloud as the waiter filled his glass of the Manderson mystery disposed of the innocent exculpated and your own and Mabel s happiness crowned all coming upon me together I drink to you my dear friend And mister Cupples took a very small sip of the wine You have a great nature said Trent much moved Your outward semblance doth belie your soul s immensity I should have expected as soon to see an elephant conducting at the opera as you drinking my health Dear Cupples May his beak retain ever that delicate rose stain No curse it all he broke out surprising a shade of discomfort that fitted over his companion s face as he tasted the wine again I have no business to meddle with your tastes I apologize You shall have what you want even if it causes the head waiter to perish in his pride When mister Cupples had been supplied with his monastic drink and the waiter had retired Trent looked across the table with significance In this babble of many conversations he said we can speak as freely as if we were on a bare hill side The waiter is whispering soft nothings into the ear of the young woman at the pay desk We are alone What do you think of that interview of this afternoon He began to dine with an appetite Without pausing in the task of cutting his mutton into very small pieces mister Cupples replied The most curious feature of it in my judgment was the irony of the situation We both held the clue to that mad hatred of Manderson s which Marlowe found so mysterious We knew of his jealous obsession which knowledge we withheld as was very proper if only in consideration of Mabel s feelings Marlowe will never know of what he was suspected by that person Strange Nearly all of us I venture to think move unconsciously among a network of opinions often quite erroneous which other people entertain about us With regard to Marlowe s story it appeared to me entirely straightforward and not in its essential features especially remarkable once we have admitted as we surely must that in the case of Manderson we have to deal with a more or less disordered mind It was mister Bunner I think you said who told you of his rooted and apparently hereditary temper of suspicious jealousy When the pressure of his business labors brought on mental derangement that abnormality increased until it dominated him entirely Trent laughed loudly Not especially remarkable he said I confess that the affair struck me as a little unusual Only in the development of the details argued mister Cupples What is there abnormal in the essential facts A madman conceives a crazy suspicion he hatches a cunning plot against his fancied injurer it involves his own destruction Put thus what is there that any man with the least knowledge of the ways of lunatics would call remarkable Turn now to Marlowe s proceedings He finds himself in a perilous position from which though he is innocent telling the truth will not save him Is that an unheard of situation He escapes by means of a bold and ingenious piece of deception That seems to me a thing that might happen every day and probably does so He attacked his now unrecognizable mutton I should like to know said Trent after an alimentary pause in the conversation whether there is anything that ever happened on the face of the earth that you could not represent as quite ordinary and commonplace by such a line of argument as that You may say what you like but the idea of impersonating Manderson in those circumstances was an extraordinarily ingenious idea Ingenious certainly replied mister Cupples Extraordinarily so no In those circumstances your own words it was really not strange that it should occur to a clever man It lay almost on the surface of the situation Marlowe was famous for his imitation of Manderson s voice he had a talent for acting he knew the ways of the establishment intimately I grant you that the idea was brilliantly carried out but everything favored it As for the essential idea I do not place it as regards ingenuity in the same class with for example the idea of utilizing the force of recoil in a discharged firearm to actuate the mechanism of ejecting and reloading I do however admit as I did at the outset that in respect of details the case had unusual features It developed a high degree of complexity Did it really strike you in that way inquired Trent with desperate sarcasm The affair became complicated proceeded mister Cupples quite unmoved because after Marlowe s suspicions were awakened a second subtle mind came in to interfere with the plans of the first That sort of duel often happens in business and politics but less frequently I imagine in the world of crime One disturbing reflection was left on my mind by what we learned to day If Marlowe had suspected nothing and walked into the trap he would almost certainly have been hanged Now how often may not a plan to throw the guilt of murder on an innocent person have been practised successfully There are I imagine numbers of cases in which the accused being found guilty on circumstantial evidence have died protesting their innocence I shall never approve again of a death sentence imposed in a case decided upon such evidence I never have done so for my part said Trent To hang in such cases seems to me flying in the face of the perfectly obvious and sound principle expressed in the saying that you never can tell I agree with the American jurist who lays it down that we should not hang a yellow dog for stealing jam on circumstantial evidence not even if he has jam all over his nose As for attempts being made by malevolent persons to fix crimes upon innocent men of course it is constantly happening mister Cupples mused a few moments We know he said from the things Mabel and mister Bunner told you what may be termed the spiritual truth underlying this matter the insane depth of jealous hatred which Manderson concealed We can understand that he was capable of such a scheme But as a rule it is in the task of penetrating to the spiritual truth that the administration of justice breaks down Sometimes that truth is deliberately concealed as in Manderson s case Sometimes I think it is concealed because simple people are actually unable to express it and nobody else divines it The law certainly does not shine when it comes to a case requiring much delicacy of perception said Trent It goes wrong easily enough over the commonplace criminal As for the people with temperaments who get mixed up in legal proceedings they must feel as if they were in a forest of apes whether they win or lose Well I dare say it s good for them and their sort to have their noses rubbed in reality now and again But what would twelve red faced realities in a jury box have done to Marlowe His story would as he says have been a great deal worse than no defense at all It s not as if there were a single piece of evidence in support of his tale Can t you imagine how the prosecution would tear it to rags Can t you see the judge simply taking it in his stride when it came to the summing up And the jury you ve served on juries I expect in their room snorting with indignation over the feebleness of the lie telling each other it was the clearest case they ever heard of and that they d have thought better of him if he hadn t lost his nerve at the crisis and had cleared off with the swag as he intended Imagine yourself on that jury not knowing Marlowe and trembling with indignation at the record unrolled before you cupidity murder robbery sudden cowardice shameless impenitent desperate lying Why you and I believed him to be guilty until I beg your pardon I beg your pardon interjected mister Cupples laying down his knife and fork I was most careful when we talked it all over the other night to say nothing indicating such a belief I was always certain that he was innocent You said something of the sort at Marlowe s just now I wondered what on earth you could mean Certain that he was innocent How can you be certain You are generally more careful about terms than that Cupples I said certain mister Cupples repeated firmly Trent shrugged his shoulders If you really were after reading my manuscript and discussing the whole thing as we did he rejoined then I can only say that you must have totally renounced all trust in the operations of the human reason an attitude which while it is bad Christianity and also infernal nonsense is oddly enough bad Positivism too unless I misunderstand that system Why man Let me say a word mister Cupples interposed again folding his hands above his plate I assure you I am far from abandoning reason I am certain he is innocent and I always was certain of it because of something that I know and knew from the very beginning You asked me just now to imagine myself on the jury at Marlowe s trial That would be an unprofitable exercise of the mental powers because I know that I should be present in another capacity I should be in the witness box giving evidence for the defense You said just now If there were a single piece of evidence in support of his tale There is and it is my evidence And he added quietly it is conclusive He took up his knife and fork and went contentedly on with his dinner The pallor of excitement had turned Trent to marble while mister Cupples led laboriously up to this statement At the last word the blood rushed to his face again and he struck the table with an unnatural laugh It can t be he exploded It s something you fancied something you dreamed after one of those debauches of soda and milk You can t really mean that all the time I was working on the case down there you knew Marlowe was innocent mister Cupples busy with his last mouthful nodded brightly He made an end of eating wiped his sparse mustache and then leaned forward over the table It s very simple he said I shot Manderson myself I am afraid I startled you Trent heard the voice of mister Cupples say He forced himself out of his stupefaction like a diver striking upward for the surface and with a rigid movement raised his glass But half of the wine splashed upon the cloth and he put it carefully down again untasted He drew a deep breath which was exhaled in a laugh wholly without merriment Go on he said It was not murder began mister Cupples slowly measuring off inches with a fork on the edge of the table I will tell you the whole story On that Sunday night I was taking my before bedtime constitutional having set out from the hotel about a quarter past ten I went along the field path that runs behind White Gables cutting off the great curve of the road and came out on the road nearly opposite that gate that is just by the eighth hole on the golf course Then I turned in there meaning to walk along the turf to the edge of the cliff and go back that way I had only gone a few steps when I heard the car coming and then I heard it stop near the gate I saw Manderson at once Do you remember my telling you I had seen him once alive after our quarrel in front of the hotel Well this was the time You asked me if I had and I did not care to tell a falsehood A slight groan came from Trent He drank a little wine and said stonily Go on please It was as you know pursued mister Cupples a moonlight night but I was in shadow under the trees by the stone wall and anyhow they could not suppose there was any one near them I heard all that passed just as Marlowe has narrated it to us and I saw the car go off towards Bishopsbridge I did not see Manderson s face as it went because his back was to me but he shook his left hand at the car with extraordinary violence greatly to my amazement Then I waited for him to go back to White Gables as I did not want to meet him again But he did not go He opened the gate through which I had just passed and he stood there on the turf of the green quite still His head was bent his arms hung at his sides and he looked somehow rigid For a few moments he remained in this tense attitude then all of a sudden his right arm moved swiftly and his hand was at the pocket of his overcoat I saw his face raised in the moonlight the teeth bared and the eyes glittering and all at once I knew that the man was mad Almost as quickly as that flashed across my mind something else flashed in the moonlight He held the pistol before him pointing at his breast Now I may say here I shall always be doubtful whether Manderson intended to kill himself then Marlowe naturally thinks so knowing nothing of my intervention But I think it quite likely he only meant to wound himself and to charge Marlowe with attempted murder and robbery At that moment however I assumed it was suicide Before I knew what I was doing I had leapt out of the shadows and seized his arm He shook me off with a furious snarling noise giving me a terrific blow in the chest and presented the revolver at my head But I seized his wrists before he could fire and clung with all my strength you remember how bruised and scratched they were I knew I was fighting for my own life now for murder was in his eyes We struggled like two beasts without an articulate word I holding his pistol hand down and keeping a grip on the other I never dreamed that I had the strength for such an encounter Then with a perfectly instinctive movement I never knew I meant to do it I flung away his free hand and clutched like lightning at the weapon tearing it from his fingers By a miracle it did not go off I darted back a few steps he sprang at my throat like a wild cat and I fired blindly in his face He would have been about a yard away I suppose His knees gave way instantly and he fell in a heap on the turf I flung the pistol down and bent over him The heart s motion ceased under my hand I knelt there staring struck motionless and I don t know how long it was before I heard the noise of the car returning Trent all the time that Marlowe paced that green with the moonlight on his white and working face I was within a few yards of him crouching in the shadow of the furze by the ninth tee I dared not show myself I was thinking My public quarrel with Manderson the same morning was I suspected the talk of the hotel I assure you that every horrible possibility of the situation for me had rushed across my mind the moment I saw Manderson fall I became cunning I knew what I must do I must get back to the hotel as fast as I could get in somehow unperceived and play a part to save myself I must never tell a word to any one Of course I was assuming that Marlowe would tell everyone how he had found the body I knew he would suppose it was suicide I thought everyone would suppose so When Marlowe began at last to lift the body I stole away down the wall and got out into the road by the club house where he could not see me I felt perfectly cool and collected I crossed the road climbed the fence and ran across the meadow to pick up the field path I had come by that runs to the hotel behind White Gables I got back to the hotel very much out of breath Out of breath repeated Trent mechanically still staring at his companion as if hypnotized I had had a sharp run said mister Cupples Well approaching the hotel from the back I could see into the writing room through the open window There was nobody in there so I climbed over the sill walked to the bell and rang it and then sat down to write a letter I had meant to write the next day I saw by the clock that it was a little past eleven When the waiter answered the bell I asked for a glass of milk and a postage stamp Soon afterwards I went up to bed But I could not sleep mister Cupples having nothing more to say ceased speaking He looked in mild surprise at Trent who now sat silent supporting his bent head in his hands He could not sleep murmured Trent at last in a hollow tone A frequent result of over exertion during the day Nothing to be alarmed about He was silent again then looked up with a pale face Cupples I am cured I will never touch a crime mystery again The Manderson affair shall be Philip Trent s last case His high blown pride at length breaks under him Trent s smile suddenly returned I could have borne everything but that last revelation of the impotence of human reason Cupples I have absolutely nothing left to say except this you have beaten me I drink your health in a spirit of self abasement And you shall pay for the dinner THE END End of Project Gutenberg s The Woman in Black
