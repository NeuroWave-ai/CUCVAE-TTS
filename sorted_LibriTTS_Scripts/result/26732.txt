the windshield was closed it became so filmed with rain that Claire fancied she was piloting a drowned car in dim spaces under the sea When it was open drops jabbed into her eyes and chilled her cheeks She was excited and thoroughly miserable She realized that these Minnesota country roads had no respect for her polite experience on Long Island parkways She felt like a woman not like a driver But the Gomez Dep roadster had seventy horsepower and sang songs Since she had left Minneapolis nothing had passed her Back yonder a truck had tried to crowd her and she had dropped into a ditch climbed a bank returned to the road and after that the truck was not Now she was regarding a view more splendid than mountains above a garden by the sea a stretch of good road To her passenger her father Claire chanted Heavenly There s some gravel We can make time We ll hustle on to the next town and get dry Yes But don t mind me You re doing very well her father sighed Instantly the dismay of it rushing at her she saw the end of the patch of gravel The road ahead was a wet black smear criss crossed with ruts The car shot into a morass of prairie gumbo which is mud mixed with tar fly paper fish glue and well chewed chocolate covered caramels When cattle get into gumbo the farmers send for the stump dynamite and try blasting It was her first really bad stretch of road She was frightened Then she was too appallingly busy to be frightened or to be Miss Claire Boltwood or to comfort her uneasy father She had to drive Her frail graceful arms put into it a vicious vigor that was genius When the wheels struck the slime they slid they wallowed The car skidded It was terrifyingly out of control It began majestically to turn toward the ditch She fought the steering wheel as though she were shadow boxing but the car kept contemptuously staggering till it was sideways straight across the road Somehow it was back again eating into a rut going ahead She didn t know how she had done it but she had got it back She longed to take time to retrace her own cleverness in steering She didn t She kept going The car backfired slowed She yanked the gear from third into first She sped up The motor ran like a terrified pounding heart while the car crept on by inches through filthy mud that stretched ahead of her without relief She was battling to hold the car in the principal rut She snatched the windshield open and concentrated on that left rut She felt that she was keeping the wheel from climbing those high sides of the rut those six inch walls of mud sparkling with tiny grits Her mind snarled at her arms Let the ruts do the steering You re just fighting against them It worked Once she let the wheels alone they comfortably followed the furrows and for three seconds she had that delightful belief of every motorist after every mishap Now that this particular disagreeableness is over I ll never never have any trouble again But suppose the engine overheated ran out of water Anxiety twanged at her nerves And the deep distinctive ruts were changing to a complex pattern like the rails in a city switchyard She picked out the track of the one motor car that had been through here recently It was marked with the swastika tread of the rear tires That track was her friend she knew and loved the driver of a car she had never seen in her life She was very tired She wondered if she might not stop for a moment Then she came to an upslope The car faltered felt indecisive beneath her She jabbed down the accelerator Her hands pushed at the steering wheel as though she were pushing the car The engine picked up sulkily kept going To the eye there was merely a rise in the rolling ground but to her anxiety it was a mountain up which she not the engine but herself pulled this bulky mass till she had reached the top and was safe again for a second Still there was no visible end of the mud In alarm she thought How long does it last I can t keep this up I Oh The guiding tread of the previous car was suddenly lost in a mass of heaving bubble scattered mud like a batter of black dough She fairly picked up the car and flung it into that welter through it and back into the reappearing swastika marked trail Her father spoke You re biting your lips They ll bleed if you don t look out Better stop and rest Can t No bottom to this mud Once stop and lose momentum stuck for keeps She had ten more minutes of it before she reached a combination of bridge and culvert with a plank platform above a big tile drain With this solid plank bottom she could stop Silence came roaring down as she turned the switch The bubbling water in the radiator steamed about the cap Claire was conscious of tautness of the cords of her neck in front of a pain at the base of her brain Her father glanced at her curiously I must be a wreck I m sure my hair is frightful she thought but forgot it as she looked at him His face was unusually pale In the tumult of activity he had been betrayed into letting the old despondent look blur his eyes and sag his mouth Must get on she determined Claire was dainty of habit She detested untwisted hair ripped gloves muddy shoes Hesitant as a cat by a puddle she stepped down on the bridge Even on these planks the mud was three inches thick It squidged about her low spatted shoes Eeh she squeaked She tiptoed to the tool box and took out a folding canvas bucket She edged down to the trickling stream below She was miserably conscious of a pastoral scene all gone to mildew cows beneath willows by the creek milkweeds dripping dried mullein weed stalks no longer dry The bank of the stream was so slippery that she shot down two feet and nearly went sprawling Her knee did touch the bank and the skirt of her gray sports suit showed a smear of yellow earth In less than two miles the racing motor had used up so much water that she had to make four trips to the creek before she had filled the radiator When she had climbed back on the running board she glared down at spats and shoes turned into gray lumps She was not tearful She was angry Idiot Ought to have put on my rubbers Well too late now she observed as she started the engine She again followed the swastika tread To avoid a hole in the road ahead the unknown driver had swung over to the side of the road and taken to the intensely black earth of the edge of an unfenced cornfield Flashing at Claire came the sight of a deep water filled hole scattered straw and brush debris of a battlefield which made her gaspingly realize that her swastikaed leader had been stuck and And instantly her own car was stuck She had had to put the car at that hole It dropped far down and it stayed down The engine stalled She started it but the back wheels spun merrily round and round without traction She did not make one inch When she again killed the blatting motor she let it stay dead She peered at her father He was not a father just now but a passenger trying not to irritate the driver He smiled in a waxy way and said Hard luck Well you did the best you could The other hole there in the road would have been just as bad You re a fine driver dolly Her smile was warm and real No I m a fool You told me to put on chains I didn t I deserve it Well anyway most men would be cussing You acquire merit by not beating me I believe that s done in moments like this If you d like I ll get out and crawl around in the mud and play turtle for you No I m quite all right I did feel frightfully strong minded as long as there was any use of it It kept me going But now I might just as well be cheerful because we re stuck and we re probably going to stay stuck for the rest of this care free summer day The weariness of the long strain caught her all at once She slipped forward sat huddled her knees crossed under the edge of the steering wheel her hands falling beside her one of them making a faint brushing sound as it slid down the upholstery Her eyes closed as her head drooped farther she fancied she could hear the vertebrae click in her tense neck Her father was silent a misty figure in a lap robe The rain streaked the mica lights in the side curtains A distant train whistled desolately across the sodden fields The inside of the car smelled musty The quiet was like a blanket over the ears Claire was in a hazy drowse She felt that she could never drive again CHAPTER II CLAIRE ESCAPES FROM RESPECTABILITY Claire Boltwood lived on the Heights Brooklyn Persons from New York and other parts of the Middlewest have been known to believe that Brooklyn is somehow humorous In newspaper jokes and vaudeville it is so presented that people who are willing to take their philosophy from those sources believe that the leading citizens of Brooklyn are all deacons undertakers and obstetricians The fact is that North Washington Square at its reddest and whitest and fanlightedest Gramercy Park at its most ivied are not so aristocratic as the section of Brooklyn called the Heights Here preached Henry Ward Beecher Here in mansions like mausoleums on the ridge above docks where the good ships came sailing in from Sourabaya and Singapore ruled the lords of a thousand sails And still is it a place of wealth too solid to emulate the nimble self advertising of Fifth Avenue Here dwell the fifth generation possessors of blocks of foundries and shipyards Here in a big brick house of much dignity much ugliness and much conservatory lived Claire Boltwood with her widower father Henry B Boltwood was vice president of a firm dealing in railway supplies He was neither wealthy nor at all poor Every summer despite Claire s delicate hints they took the same cottage on the Jersey Coast and mister Boltwood came down for Sunday Claire had gone to a good school out of Philadelphia on the Main Line She was used to gracious leisure attractive uselessness nut center chocolates and a certain wonder as to why she was alive She wanted to travel but her father could not get away He consistently spent his days in overworking and his evenings in wishing he hadn t overworked He was attractive fresh pink cheeked white mustached and nerve twitching with years of detail Claire s ambition had once been babies and a solid husband but as various young males of the species appeared before her sang their mating songs and preened their newly dry cleaned plumage she found that the trouble with solid young men was that they were solid Though she liked to dance the dancing men bored her And she did not understand the district s quota of intellectuals very well she was good at listening to symphony concerts but she never had much luck in discussing the cleverness of the wood winds in taking up the main motif It is history that she refused a master of arts with an old violin a good taste in ties and an income of eight thousand The only man who disturbed her was Geoffrey Saxton known throughout the interwoven sets of Brooklyn Heights as Jeff Jeff Saxton was thirty nine to Claire s twenty three He was clean and busy he had no signs of vice or humor Especially for Jeff must have been invented the symbolic morning coat the unwrinkable gray trousers and the moral rimless spectacles He was a graduate of a nice college and he had a nice tenor and a nice family and nice hands and he was nicely successful in New York copper dealing When he was asked questions by people who were impertinent clever or poor Jeff looked them over coldly before he answered and often they felt so uncomfortable that he didn t have to answer The boys of Claire s own age not long out of Yale and Princeton doing well in business and jumping for their evening clothes daily at six thirty light o loves and admirers of athletic heroes these lads Claire found pleasant but hard to tell apart She didn t have to tell Jeff Saxton apart He did his own telling Jeff called not too often He sang not too sentimentally He took her father and herself to the theater not too lavishly He told Claire in a voice not too serious that she was his helmed Athena his rose of all the world He informed her of his substantial position not too obviously And he was so everlastingly firmly quietly politely immovably always there She watched the hulk of marriage drifting down on her frail speed boat of aspiration and steered in desperate circles Then her father got the nervous prostration he had richly earned The doctor ordered rest Claire took him in charge He didn t want to travel Certainly he didn t want the shore or the Adirondacks As there was a branch of his company in Minneapolis she lured him that far away Being rootedly of Brooklyn Heights Claire didn t know much about the West She thought that Milwaukee was the capital of Minnesota She was not so uninformed as some of her friends however She had heard that in Dakota wheat was to be viewed in vast tracts maybe a hundred acres mister Boltwood could not be coaxed to play with the people to whom his Minneapolis representative introduced him He was overworking again and perfectly happy He was hoping to find something wrong with the branch house Claire tried to tempt him out to the lakes She failed His nerve fuse burnt out the second time with much fireworks Claire had often managed her circle of girls but it had never occurred to her to manage her executive father save by indirect and pretty teasing Now in conspiracy with the doctor she bullied her father He saw gray death waiting as alternative and he was meek He agreed to everything He consented to drive with her across two thousand miles of plains and mountains to Seattle to drop in for a call on their cousins the Eugene Gilsons Back East they had a chauffeur and two cars the limousine and the Gomez Deperdussin roadster Claire s beloved It would she believed be more of a change from everything that might whisper to mister Boltwood of the control of men not to take a chauffeur Her father never drove but she could she insisted His easy agreeing was pathetic He watched her with spaniel eyes They had the Gomez roadster shipped to them from New York On a July morning they started out of Minneapolis in a mist and as it has been hinted they stopped sixty miles northward in a rain also in much gumbo Apparently their nearest approach to the Pacific Ocean would be this oceanically moist edge of a cornfield between Schoenstrom and Gopher Prairie Minnesota Claire roused from her damp doze and sighed Well I must get busy and get the car out of this Don t you think you d better get somebody to help us But get who Whom No It s just who when you re in the mud No One of the good things about an adventure like this is that I must do things for myself I ve always had people to do things for me Maids and nice teachers and you old darling I suppose it s made me soft Soft I would like a soft davenport and a novel and a pound of almond brittle and get all sick and not feel so beastly virile as I do just now But She turned up the collar of her gray tweed coat painfully climbed out the muscles of her back racking and examined the state of the rear wheels They were buried to the axle in front of them the mud bulked in solid shiny blackness She took out her jack and chains It was too late There was no room to get the jack under the axle She remembered from the narratives of motoring friends that brush in mud gave a firmer surface for the wheels to climb upon She also remembered how jolly and agreeably heroic the accounts of their mishaps had sounded a week after they were over She waded down the road toward an old wood lot At first she tried to keep dry but she gave it up and there was pleasure in being defiantly dirty She tramped straight through puddles she wallowed in mud In the wood lot was long grass which soaked her stockings till her ankles felt itchy Claire had never expected to be so very intimate with a brush pile She became so As though she were a pioneer woman who had been toiling here for years she came to know the brush stick by stick the long valuable branch that she could never quite get out from under the others the thorny bough that pricked her hands every time she tried to reach the curious bundle of switches Seven trips she made carrying armfuls of twigs and solemnly dragging large boughs behind her She patted them down in front of all four wheels Her crisp hands looked like the paws of a three year old boy making a mud fort Her nails hurt from the mud wedged beneath them Her mud caked shoes were heavy to lift It was with exquisite self approval that she sat on the running board scraped a car load of lignite off her soles climbed back into the car punched the starter The car stirred crept forward one inch and settled back one inch The second time it heaved encouragingly but did not make quite so much headway Then Claire did sob She rubbed her cheek against the comfortable rough heather smelling shoulder of her father s coat while he patted her and smiled Good girl I better get out and help She sat straight shook her head Nope I ll do it And I m not going to insist on being heroic any longer I ll get a farmer to pull us out As she let herself down into the ooze she reflected that all farmers have hearts of gold anatomical phenomena never found among the snobs and hirelings of New York The nearest heart of gold was presumably beating warmly in the house a quarter of a mile ahead She came up a muddy lane to a muddy farmyard with a muddy cur yapping at her wet legs and geese hissing in a pool of purest mud serene The house was small and rather old It may have been painted once The barn was large and new It had been painted very much and in a blinding red with white trimmings There was no brass plate on the house but on the barn in huge white letters was the legend Adolph Zolzac nineteen thirteen She climbed by log steps to a narrow frame back porch littered with parts of a broken cream separator She told herself that she was simple and friendly in going to the back door instead of the front and it was with gaiety that she knocked on the ill jointed screen door which flapped dismally in response Ja from within She rapped again Hinein She opened the door on a kitchen the highlight of which was a table heaped with dishes of dumplings and salt pork A shirt sleeved man all covered with mustache and calm sat by the table and he kept right on sitting as he inquired Vell My car my automobile has been stuck in the mud A bad driver I m afraid I wonder if you would be so good as to I usually get t ree dollars but I dunno as I vant to do it for less than four Today I ain d feelin very goot grumbled the golden hearted Claire was aware that a woman whom she had not noticed so much smaller than the dumplings so much less vigorous than the salt pork was she was speaking Aber papa dot s a shame you sharge de poor young lady dot when she drive by sei self Vot she t ink of de Sherman people The farmer merely grunted To Claire Yuh four dollars Dot s what I usually charge sometimes Usually Do you mean to say that you leave that hole there in the road right along that people keep on trying to avoid it and get stuck as I was Oh If I were an official Vell I dunno I don t guess I run my place to suit you smart alecks Papa How you talk on the young lady Make shame from the city If you don t like it you stay bei Mineapolis I haul you out for t ree dollars and a half Everybody pay dot Last mont I make forty five dollars They vos all glad to pay They say I help them fine I don t see vot you re kickin about Oh these vimmins It s blackmail I wouldn t pay it if it weren t for my father sitting waiting out there But go ahead Hurry She sat tapping her toe while Zolzac completed the stertorous task of hogging the dumplings then stretched yawned scratched and covered his merely dirty garments with overalls that were apparently woven of processed mud When he had gone to the barn for his team his wife came to Claire On her drained face were the easy tears of the slave women Oh miss I don t know vot I should do My boys go on the public school and they speak American just so goot as you Oh I vant man lets me luff America But papa he says it is an Unsinn you got the money he says nobody should care if you are American or Old Country people I should vish I could ride once in an automobile But I am so shamed so shamed that I must sit and see my Mann make this Forty years I been married to him and pretty soon I die Claire patted her hand There was nothing to say to tragedy that had outlived hope Adolph Zolzac clumped out to the highroad behind his vast rolling flanked horses so much cleaner and better fed than his wisp of a wife Claire followed him and in her heart she committed murder and was glad of it While mister Boltwood looked out with mild wonder at Claire s new friend Zolzac hitched his team to the axle It did not seem possible that two horses could pull out the car where seventy horsepower had fainted But easily yawning and thinking about dinner the horses drew the wheels up on the mud bank out of the hole and The harness broke with a flying mess of straps and rope and the car plumped with perfect exactness back into its bed CHAPTER III A YOUNG MAN IN A RAINCOAT Huh Such an auto Look it break my harness a ready Two dollar that cost you to mend it De auto iss too heavy stormed Zolzac All right All right Only for heaven s sake go get another harness Claire shrieked Fife fifty dot will be in all Zolzac grinned Claire was standing in front of him She was thinking of other drivers poor people in old cars who had been at the mercy of this golden hearted one She stared past him in the direction from which she had come Another motor was in sight It was a tin beetle of a car that agile cheerful rut jumping model known as a bug with a home tacked home painted tin cowl and tail covering the stripped chassis of a little cheap Teal car The lone driver wore an old black raincoat with an atrocious corduroy collar and a new plaid cap in the Harry Lauder tartan The bug skipped through mud where the Boltwoods Gomez had slogged and rolled Its pilot drove up behind her car and leaped out He trotted forward to Claire and Zolzac His eyes were twenty seven or eight but his pink cheeks were twenty and when he smiled shyly radiantly he was no age at all but eternal boy Claire had a blurred impression that she had seen him before some place along the road Stuck he inquired not very intelligently How much is Adolph charging you He wants three fifty and his harness broke and he wants two dollars Oh So he s still working that old gag I ve heard all about Adolph He keeps that harness for pulling out cars and it always busts The last time though he only charged six bits to get it mended Now let me reason with him The young man turned with vicious quickness and for the first time Claire heard pidgin German German as it is spoken between Americans who have never learned it and Germans who have forgotten it Schon sex hundred times Ich hoere all about the way you been doing autos Zolzac you verfluchter Schweinhund and I ll set the sheriff on you Dot ain d true maybe einmal die Woche kommt somebody and Ich muss die Arbeit immer lassen und in die Regen ausgehen und seh mal how die boots sint mit mud covered two dollars it don t pay for die boots Now that s enough plenty out of you seien die boots verdammt and mach dass du fort gehst muddy boots hell put mal ein egg in die boots and beat it verleicht maybe I ll by golly arrest you myself weiss du I m a special deputy sheriff The young man stood stockily He seemed to swell as his somewhat muddy hand was shaken directly at under and about the circumference of Adolph Zolzac s hairy nose The farmer was stronger but he retreated He took up the reins He whined Don t I get nothing I break de harness Sure You get ten years And you get out From thirty yards up the road Zolzac flung back You t ink you re pretty damn smart That was his last serious reprisal Clumsily as one not used to it the young man lifted his cap to Claire showing straight wiry rope colored hair brushed straight back from a rather fine forehead Gee I was sorry to have to swear and holler like that but it s all Adolph understands Please don t think there s many of the folks around here like him They say he s the meanest man in the county I m immensely grateful to you but do you know much about motors How can I get out of this mud She was surprised to see the youngster blush His clear skin flooded His engaging smile came again and he hesitated Let me pull you out She looked from her hulking car to his mechanical flea He answered the look I can do it all right I m used to the gumbo regular mud hen Just add my power to yours Have you a tow rope No I never thought of bringing one I ll get mine She walked with him back toward his bug It lacked not only top and side curtains but even windshield and running board It was a toy a card board box on toothpick axles Strapped to the bulging back was a wicker suitcase partly covered by tarpaulin From the seat peered a little furry face A cat she exclaimed as he came up with a wire rope extracted from the tin back Yes She s the captain of the boat I m just the engineer What is her name Before he answered the young man strode ahead to the front of her car Claire obediently trotting after him He stooped to look at her front axle He raised his head glanced at her and he was blushing again Her name is Vere de Vere he confessed Then he fled back to his bug He drove it in front of the Gomez Dep The hole in the road itself was as deep as the one on the edge of the cornfield where she was stuck but he charged it She was fascinated by his skill Where she would for a tenth of a second have hesitated while choosing the best course he hurled the bug straight at the hole plunged through with sheets of glassy black water arching on either side then viciously twisted the car to the right to the left and straight again as he followed the tracks with the solidest bottoms Strapped above the tiny angle iron step which replaced his running board was an old spade He dug channels in front of the four wheels of her car so that they might go up inclines instead of pushing against the straight walls of mud they had thrown up On these inclines he strewed the brush she had brought halting to ask with head alertly lifted from his stooped huddle in the mud Did you have to get this brush yourself Yes Horrid wet He merely shook his head in commiseration He fastened the tow rope to the rear axle of his car to the front of hers Now will you be ready to put on all your power as I begin to pull he said casually rather respectfully When the struggling bug had pulled the wire rope taut she opened the throttle The rope trembled Her car seemed to draw sullenly back Then it came out out really out which is the most joyous sensation any motorist shall ever know In excitement over actually moving again as fast as any healthy young snail she drove on on the young man ahead grinning back at her Nor did she stop nor he till both cars were safe on merely thick mud a quarter of a mile away She switched off the power and suddenly she was in a whirlwind of dizzy sickening tiredness Even in her abandonment to exhaustion she noticed that the young man did not stare at her but keeping his back to her removed the tow rope and stowed it away in his bug She wondered whether it was tact or yokelish indifference Her father spoke for the first time since the Galahad of the tin bug had come How much do you think we ought to give this fellow Now of all the cosmic problems yet unsolved not cancer nor the future of poverty are the flustering questions but these twain Which is worse not to wear evening clothes at a party at which you find every one else dressed or to come in evening clothes to a house where it proves they are never worn And Which is worse not to tip when a tip has been expected or to tip when the tip is an insult In discomfort of spirit and wetness of ankles Claire shuddered Oh dear I don t believe he expects us to pay him He seems like an awfully independent person Maybe we d offend him if we offered The only reasonable thing to be offended at in this vale of tears is not being offered money Just the same Oh dear I m so tired But good little Claire will climb out and be diplomatic She pinched her forehead to hold in her cracking brain and wabbled out into new scenes of mud and wetness but she came up to the young man with the most rain washed and careless of smiles Won t you come back and meet my father He s terribly grateful to you as I am And may we You ve worked so hard and about saved our lives May I pay you for that labor We re really much indebted Oh it wasn t anything Tickled to death if I could help you He heartily shook hands with her father and he droned Pleased to meet you mister Uh Boltwood mister Boltwood My name is Milt Milton Daggett See you have a New York license on your car We don t see but mighty few of those through here Glad I could help you Ah yes mister Daggett mister Boltwood was uninterestedly fumbling in his money pocket Behind Milt Daggett Claire shook her head wildly rattling her hands as though she were playing castanets mister Boltwood shrugged He did not understand His relations with young men in cheap raincoats were entirely monetary They did something for you and you paid them preferably not too much and they ceased to be Whereas Milt Daggett respectfully but stolidly continued to be and mister Henry Boltwood s own daughter was halting the march of affairs by asking irrelevant questions Didn t we see you back in what was that village we came through back about twelve miles Schoenstrom suggested Milt Yes I think that was it Didn t we pass you or something We stopped at a garage there to change a tire I don t think so I was in town though this morning Say uh did you and your father grab any eats A I mean did you get dinner there No I wish we had Well say I didn t either and I d be awfully glad if you folks would have something to eat with me now Claire tried to give him a smile but the best she could do was to lend him one She could not associate interesting food with Milt and his mud slobbered tin covered dun painted Teal bug He seemed satisfied with her dubious grimace By his suggestion they drove ahead to a spot where the cars could be parked on firm grass beneath oaks On the way mister Boltwood lifted his voice in dismay His touch of nervous prostration had not made him queer or violent he retained a touching faith in good food We might find some good little hotel and have some chops and just some mushrooms and peas insisted the man from Brooklyn Heights Oh I don t suppose the country hotels are really so awfully good she speculated And look that nice funny boy We couldn t hurt his feelings He s having so much fun out of being a Good Samaritan From the mysterious rounded back of his car Milt Daggett drew a tiny stove to be heated by a can of solidified alcohol a frying pan that was rather large for dolls but rather small for square fingered hands a jar of bacon eggs in a bag a coffee pot a can of condensed milk and a litter of unsorted tin plates and china cups While by his request Claire scoured the plates and cups he made bacon and eggs and coffee the little stove in the bottom of his car sheltered by the cook s bending over it The smell of food made Claire forgiving toward the fact that she was wet through that the rain continued to drizzle down her neck He lifted his hand and demanded Take your shoes off Uh He gulped He stammered I mean I mean your shoes are soaked through If you ll sit in the car I ll put your shoes up by the engine It s pretty well heated from racing it in the mud You can get your stockings dry under the cowl She was amused by the elaborateness with which he didn t glance at her while she took off her low shoes and slipped her quite too thin black stockings under the protecting tin cowl She reflected He has such a nice awkward gentleness But such bad taste They re really quite good ankles Apparently ankles are not done in Teal bug circles His sisters don t even have limbs But do fairies have sisters He is a fairy When I m out of the mud he ll turn his raincoat into a pair of lordly white wings and vanish But what will become of the cat Thus her tired brain like a squirrel in a revolving cage while she sat primly and scraped at a clot of rust on a tin plate and watched him put on the bacon and eggs Wondering if cats were used for this purpose in the Daggett family she put soaked unhappy Vere de Vere on her feet to her own great comfort and the cat s delight It was an open car and the rain still rained and a strange young man was a foot from her tending the not very crackly fire but rarely had Claire felt so domestic Milt was apparently struggling to say something After several bobs of his head he ventured You re so wet I d like for you to take my raincoat No Really I m already soaked through You keep dry He was unhappy about it He plucked at a button of the coat She turned him from the subject I hope Lady Vere de Vere is getting warm too Seems to be She s kind of demanding She wanted a little car of her own but I didn t think she could keep up with me not on a long hike A little car With her paws on the tiny wheel Oh sweet Are you going far mister Daggett Yes quite a ways To Seattle Washington Oh really Extraordinary We re going there too Honest You driving all the way Oh no of course your father No he doesn t drive By the way I hope he isn t too miserable back there I ll be darned Both of us going to Seattle That s what they call a coincidence isn t it Hope I ll see you on the road some time But I don t suppose I will Once you re out of the mud your Gomez will simply lose my Teal Not necessarily You re the better driver And I shall take it easy Are you going to stay long in Seattle It was not merely a polite dinner payment question She wondered she could not place this fresh cheeked unworldly young man so far from his home Why I kind of hope Government railroad Alaska I m going to try to get in on that somehow I ve never been out of Minnesota in my life but there s couple mountains and oceans and things I thought I d like to see so I just put my suitcase and Vere de Vere in the machine and started out I burn distillate instead of gas so it doesn t cost much If I ever happen to have five whole dollars why I might go on to Japan That would be jolly Though I s pose I d have to eat what is it pickled fish There s a woman from near my town went to the Orient as a missionary From what she says I guess all you need in Japan to make a house is a bottle of mucilage and a couple of old newspapers and some two by fours And you can have the house on a purple mountain with cherry trees down below and He put his clenched hand to his lips His head was bowed And the ocean Lord The ocean And we ll see it at Seattle Bay anyway And steamers there just come from India Huh Getting pretty darn poetic here Eggs are done The young man did not again wander into visions He was all briskness as he served her bacon and eggs took a plate of them to mister Boltwood in the Gomez gouged into his own Having herself scoured the tin plates Claire was not repulsed by their naked tinniness and the coffee in the broken handled china cup was tolerable Milt drank from the top of a vacuum bottle He was silent Immediately after the lunch he stowed the things away Claire expected a drawn out tact demanding farewell but he climbed into his bug said Good by Miss Boltwood Good luck and was gone The rainy road was bleakly empty without him It did not seem possible that Claire s body could be nagged into going on any longer Her muscles were relaxed her nerves frayed But the moment the Gomez started she discovered that magic change which every long distance motorist knows Instantly she was alert seemingly able to drive forever The pilot s instinct ruled her gave her tireless eyes and sturdy hands Surely she had never been weary never would be so long as it was hers to keep the car going She had driven perhaps six miles when she reached a hamlet called saint Klopstock On the bedraggled mud and shanty main street a man was loading crushed rock into a truck By him was a large person in a prosperous raincoat who stepped out held up his hand Claire stopped You the young lady that got stuck in that hole by Adolph Zolzac s Yes And mister Zolzac wasn t very nice about it He s going to be just elegant about it now and there ain t going to be any more hole I think Adolph has been keeping it muddy throwing in soft dirt and he made a good and plenty lot out of pulling out tourists Bill and I are going down right now and fill it up with stone Milt Daggett come through here he s got a nerve that fellow but I did have to laugh he says to me Barney This was just now He hasn t more than just drove out of town He said to me Barney he says you re the richest man in this township and the banker and you got a big car y self and you think you re one whale of a political boss he says and yet you let that Zolzac maintain a private ocean against the peace and damn horrible inconvenience of the Commonwealth of Minnesota He s got a great line of talk that fellow He told me how you got stuck made me so ashamed I been to New York myself and right away I got Bill and we re going down and hold a donation and surprise party on Adolph and fill that hole But won t Adolph dig it out again The banker was puffy but his eyes were of stone From the truck he took a shotgun He drawled In that case the surprise party will include an elegant wake But how did Who is this extraordinary Milt Daggett Him Oh nobody specially He s just a fellow down here at Schoenstrom But we all know him Goes to all the dances thirty miles around Thing about him is if he sees something wrong he picks out some poor fellow like me and says what he thinks Claire drove on She was aware that she was looking for Milt s bug It was not in sight Father she exclaimed do you realize that this lad didn t tell us he was going to have the hole filled Just did it He frightens me I m afraid that when we reach Gopher Prairie for the night we ll find he has engaged for us the suite that Prince Collars and Cuffs once slept in Hhhhmm yawned her father Curious young man He said Pleased to meet you Huuuuhhm Fresh air makes me so sleepy And Fooled you Got through that mudhole anyway And he said Look Fields stretch out so here and not a tree except the willow groves round those farmhouses And he said Gee so many times and dinner for the noon meal And his nails No I suppose he really is just a farm youngster mister Boltwood did not answer His machine finish smile indicated an enormous lack of interest in young men in Teal bugs CHAPTER IV A ROOM WITHOUT Gopher Prairie has all of five thousand people Its commercial club asserts that it has at least a thousand more population and an infinitely better band than the ridiculously envious neighboring town of Joralemon But there were few signs that a suite had been engaged for the Boltwoods or that Prince Collars and Cuffs had on his royal tour of America spent much time in Gopher Prairie Claire reached it somewhat before seven She gaped at it in a hazy way Though this was her first prairie town for a considerable stay she could not pump up interest The state of mind of the touring motorist entering a strange place at night is as peculiar and definite as that of a prospector It is compounded of gratitude at having got safely in of perception of a new town yet with all eagerness about new things dulled by weariness of hope that there is going to be a good hotel but small expectation and absolutely no probability that there really will be one Claire had only a blotched impression of peaked wooden buildings and squatty brick stores with faded awnings of a red grain elevator and a crouching station and a lumberyard then of the hopelessly muddy road leading on again into the country She felt that if she didn t stop at once she would miss the town entirely The driving instinct sustained her made her take corners sharply spot a garage send the Gomez whirling in on the cement floor The garage attendant looked at her and yawned Where do you want the car Claire asked sharply Oh stick it in that stall grunted the man and turned his back Claire glowered at him She thought of a good line about rudeness But oh she was too tired to fuss She tried to run the car into the empty stall which was not a stall but a space like a missing tooth between two cars and so narrow that she was afraid of crumpling the lordly fenders of the Gomez She ran down the floor returned with a flourish thought she was going to back straight into the stall and found she wasn t While her nerves shrieked and it did not seem possible that she could change gears she managed to get the Gomez behind a truck and side on to the stall Go forward again and cramp your wheel sharp ordered the garage man Claire wanted to outline what she thought of him but she merely demanded Will you kindly drive it in Why sure You bet said the man casually His readiness ruined her inspired fury She was somewhat disappointed As she climbed out of the car and put a hand on the smart bags strapped on a running board the accumulated weariness struck her in a shock She could have driven on for hours but the instant the car was safe for the night she went to pieces Her ears rang her eyes were soaked in fire her mouth was dry the back of her neck pinched It was her father who took the lead as they rambled to the one tolerable hotel in the town In the hotel Claire was conscious of the ugliness of the poison green walls and brass cuspidors and insurance calendars and bare floor of the office conscious of the interesting scientific fact that all air had been replaced by the essence of cigar smoke and cooking cabbage of the stares of the traveling men lounging in bored lines and of the lack of welcome on the part of the night clerk an oldish bleached man with whiskers instead of a collar She tried to be important Two rooms with bath please The bleached man stared at her and shoved forward the register and a pen clotted with ink She signed He took the bags led the way to the stairs Anxiously she asked Both rooms are with bath From the second step the night clerk looked down at her as though she were a specimen that ought to be pinned on the corks at once and he said loudly No ma am Neither of em Got no rooms vacant with bawth or bath either Not but what we got em in the house This is an up to date place But one of m s took and the other has kind of been out of order the last three four months From the audience of drummers below a delicate giggle Claire was too angry to answer And too tired When after miles of stairs leagues of stuffy hall she reached her coop with its iron bed so loose jointed that it rattled to a breath its bureau with a list to port and its anemic rocking chair she dropped on the bed panting her eyes closed but still brimming with fire It did not seem that she could ever move again She felt chloroformed She couldn t even coax herself off the bed to see if her father was any better off in the next room She was certain that she was not going to drive to Seattle She wasn t going to drive anywhere She was going to freight the car back to Minneapolis and herself go back by train Pullman drawing room But for the thought of her father she would have fallen asleep in her drenched tweeds When she did force the energy to rise she had to support herself by the bureau by the foot of the bed as she moved about the room hanging up the wet suit rubbing herself with a slippery towel putting on a dark silk frock and pumps She found her father sitting motionless in his room staring at the wall She made herself laugh at him for his gloomy emptiness She paraded down the hall with him As they reached the foot of the stairs the old one the night clerk leaned across the desk and in a voice that took the whole office into the conversation quizzed Come from New York eh Well you re quite a ways from home Claire nodded She felt shyer before these solemnly staring traveling men than she ever had in a box at the opera At the double door of the dining room from which the cabbage smell steamed with a lustiness undiminished by the sad passing of its youth a man one of the average sized average mustached average business suited average brown haired men who can never be remembered stopped the Boltwoods and hawed Saw you coming into town You ve got a New York license She couldn t deny it Quite a ways from home aren t you She had to admit it She was escorted by a bouncing black eyed waitress to a table for four The next table was a long one at which seven traveling men or local business men whose wives were at the lake for the summer ceased trying to get nourishment out of the food and gawped at her Before the Boltwoods were seated the waitress dabbed at non existent spots on their napkins ignored a genuine crumb on the cloth in front of Claire s plate made motions at a cup and a formerly plated fork and bubbled Autoing through Claire fumbled for her chair oozed into it and breathed Yes Going far Yes Where do you live New York My You re quite a ways from home aren t you Apparently Hamnegs roasbeef roaspork thapplesauce frypickerel springlamintsauce I I beg your pardon The waitress repeated I oh oh bring us ham and eggs Is that all right father Oh no well You wanted same the waitress inquired of mister Boltwood He was intimidated He said If you please and feebly pawed at a fork The waitress was instantly back with soup and a collection of china gathered by a man of much travel catholic interests and no taste One of the plates alleged itself to belong to a hotel in Omaha She pushed a pitcher of condensed milk to the exact spot where it would catch mister Boltwood s sleeve brushed the crumb from in front of Claire to a shelter beneath the pink and warty sugar bowl recovered a toothpick which had been concealed behind her glowing lips picked for a while gave it up put her hands on her hips and addressed Claire How far you going To Seattle Got any folks there Any Oh yes I suppose so Going to stay there long Really We haven t decided Come from New York eh Quite a ways from home all right Father in business there Yes What s his line I beg pardon What s his line Ouch Jiminy these shoes pinch my feet I used to could dance all night but I m getting fat I guess ha ha Put on seven pounds last month Ouch Gee they certainly do pinch my toes What business you say your father s in I didn t say but Oh railroad G N or N P I don t think I quite understand mister Boltwood interposed Are the ham and eggs ready I ll beat it out and see When she brought them she put a spoon in Claire s saucer of peas and demanded Say you don t wear that silk dress in the auto do you No I should think you d put a pink sash on it Seems like it s kind of plain it s a real pretty piece of goods though A pink sash would be real pretty You dark complected ladies always looks better for a touch of color Then was Claire certain that the waitress was baiting her for the amusement of the men at the long table She exploded Probably the waitress did not know there had been an explosion when Claire looked coldly up raised her brows looked down and poked the cold and salty slab of ham for she was continuing A light complected lady like me don t need so much color you notice my hair is black but I m light really Pete Liverquist says I m a blonde brunette gee he certainly is killing that fellow oh he s a case he sure does like to hear himself talk my there s Old Man Walters he runs the telephone exchange here I heard he went down to saint Cloud on Number two but I guess he couldn t of he ll be yodeling for friend soup and a couple slabs of moo I better beat it I ll say so so long Claire s comment was as acid as the pale beets before her as bitter as the peas as hard as the lumps in the watery mashed potatoes I don t know whether the woman is insane or ignorant I wish I could tell whether she was trying to make me angry for the benefit of those horrid unshaven men or merely for her private edification By me dolly So is this pie Let s get some medium to levitate us up to bed Uh uh I think perhaps we d better not try to drive clear to Seattle If we just went through to Montana or even just to Bismarck Drive through with the hotels like this My dear man if we have one more such day we stop right there I hope we get by the man at the desk I have a feeling he s lurking there trying to think up something insulting to say to us Oh my dear I hope you aren t as beastly tired as I am My bones are hot pokers The man at the desk got in only one cynical question Driving far before Claire seized her father s arm and started him upstairs For the first time since she had been ten and in a state of naughtiness immediately following a pronounced state of grace induced by the pulpit oratory of the new rector of saint Chrysostom s she permitted herself the luxury of not stopping to brush her teeth before she went to bed Her sleep was drugged it was not sleep but an aching exhaustion of the body which did not prevent her mind from revisualizing the road going stupidly over the muddy stretches and sharp corners then becoming conscious of that bed the lump under her shoulder blades the slope to westward and the creak that rose every time she tossed For at least fifteen minutes she lay awake for hours Thus Claire Boltwood s first voyage into democracy It was not so much that the sun was shining in the morning as that a ripple of fresh breeze came through the window She discovered that she again longed to go on keep going on see new places conquer new roads She didn t want all good road She wanted something to struggle against She d try it for one more day She was stiff as she crawled out of bed but a rub with cold water left her feeling that she was stronger than she ever had been that she was a woman not a dependent girl Already in the beating prairie sun glare the wide main street of Gopher Prairie was drying the mud ruts flattening out Beyond the town hovered the note of a meadow lark sunlight in sound Oh it s a sweet morning Sweet We will go on I m terribly excited she laughed She found her father dressed He did not know whether or not he wanted to go on I seem to have lost my grip on things I used to be rather decisive But we ll try it one more day if you like he said When she had gaily marched him downstairs she suddenly and unhappily remembered the people she would have to face the gibing questions she would have to answer The night clerk was still at the desk as though he had slept standing He hailed them Well well Up bright and early Hope you folks slept well Beds aren t so good as they might be but we re kind of planning to get some new mattresses But you get pretty good air to sleep in Hope you have a fine hike today His voice was cordial he was their old friend faithful watcher of their progress Claire found herself dimpling at him In the dining room their inquisitional acquaintance the waitress fairly ran to them Sit down folks Waffles this morning You want to stock up for your drive My ain t it an elegant morning I hope you have a swell drive today Why Claire gasped why they aren t rude They care about people they never saw before That s why they ask questions I never thought I never thought There s people in the world who want to know us without having looked us up in the Social Register I m so ashamed Not that the sunshine changes my impression of this coffee It s frightful But that will improve And the people they were being friendly all the time Oh Henry B young Henry Boltwood you and your godmother Claire have a lot to learn about the world As they came into the garage their surly acquaintance of the night before looked just as surly but Claire tried a boisterous Good morning Mornin Going north Better take the left hand road at Wakamin Easier going Drive your car out for you As the car stood outside taking on gas a man flapped up spelled out the New York license looked at Claire and her father and inquired Quite a ways from home aren t you This time Claire did not say Yes She experimented with Yes quite a ways Well hope you have a good trip Good luck Claire leaned her head on her hand thought hard It s I who wasn t friendly she propounded to her father How much I ve been losing Though I still refuse to like that coffee She noticed the sign on the air hose of the garage Free Air There s our motto for the pilgrimage she cried She knew the exaltation of starting out in the fresh morning for places she had never seen without the bond of having to return at night Thus Claire s second voyage into democracy While she was starting the young man who had pulled her out of the mud and given her lunch was folding up the tarpaulin and blankets on which he had slept beside his Teal bug in the woods three miles north of Gopher Prairie To the high well born cat Vere de Vere Milt Daggett mused aloud Your ladyship as Shakespeare says the man that gets cold feet never wins the girl And I m scared cat clean scared CHAPTER V RELEASE BRAKES SHIFT TO THIRD Milt Daggett had not been accurate in his implication that he had not noticed Claire at a garage in Schoenstrom For one thing he owned the garage Milt was the most prosperous young man in the village of Schoenstrom Neither the village itself nor the nearby Strom is really schoen The entire business district of Schoenstrom consists of Heinie Rauskukle s general store which is brick the Leipzig House which is frame the Old Home Poolroom and Restaurant which is of old logs concealed by a frame sheathing the farm machinery agency which is galvanized iron its roof like an enlarged washboard the church the three saloons and the Red Trail Garage which is also according to various signs the Agency for Teal Car Best at the Test Stonewall Tire Service Station Sewing Machines and Binders Repaired doctor Hostrum the Veterinarian every Thursday Gas Today twenty sevenc The Red Trail Garage is of cement and tapestry brick In the office is a clean hardwood floor a typewriter and a picture of Elsie Ferguson The establishment has an automatic rim stretcher a wheel jack and a reputation for honesty The father of Milt Daggett was the Old Doctor born in Maine coming to this frontier in the day when Chippewas camped in your dooryard and came in to help themselves to coffee which you made of roasted corn The Old Doctor bucked northwest blizzards read Dickens and Byron pulled people through typhoid and left to Milt his shabby old medicine case and thousands of dollars in uncollectible accounts missus Daggett had long since folded her crinkly hands in quiet death Milt had covered the first two years of high school by studying with the priest and been sent to the city of saint Cloud for the last two years His father had meant to send him to the state university But Milt had been born to a talent for machinery At twelve he had made a telephone that worked At eighteen he was engineer in the tiny flour mill in Schoenstrom At twenty five when Claire Boltwood chose to come tearing through his life in a Gomez Dep Milt was the owner manager bookkeeper wrecking crew ignition expert thoroughly competent bill collector and all but one of the working force of the Red Trail Garage There were two factions in Schoenstrom the retired farmers who said that German was a good enough language for anybody and that taxes for schools and sidewalks were yes something crazy and the group who stated that a pig pen is a fine place but only for pigs To this second revolutionary wing belonged a few of the first generation most of the second and all of the third and its leader was Milt Daggett He did not talk much normally but when he thought things ought to be done he was as annoying as a machine gun test in the lot next to a Quaker meeting If there had been a war Milt would probably have been in it rather casual clearing his throat reckoning and guessing that maybe his men might try going over and taking that hill then taking it But all of this history concerns the year just before America spoke to Germany and in this town buried among the cornfields and the wheat men still thought more about the price of grain than about the souls of nations On the evening before Claire Boltwood left Minneapolis and adventured into democracy Milt was in the garage He wore union overalls that were tan where they were not grease black a faded blue cotton shirt and the crown of a derby with the rim not too neatly hacked off with a dull toad stabber jack knife Milt smiled at his assistant Ben Sittka and suggested Well wie geht s mit the work eh Like to stay and get the prof s flivver out so he can have it in the morning You bet boss Getting to be quite a mechanic Ben I ll say so If you get stuck come yank me out of the Old Home Aw rats boss I ll finish it You beat it Ben grinned at Milt adoringly Milt stripped off his overalls and derby crown and washed his big firm hands with gritty soft soap He cleaned his nails with a file which he carried in his upper vest pocket in a red imitation morocco case which contained a comb a mirror an indelible pencil and a note book with the smudged pencil addresses of five girls in saint Cloud and a memorandum about Rauskukle s car He put on a twisted brown tie an old blue serge suit and a hat which being old and shabby had become graceful He ambled up the street He couldn t have ambled more than three blocks and have remained on the street Schoenstrom tended to leak off into jungles of tall corn Two men waved at him and one demanded Say Milt is whisky good for the toothache What d you think The doc said it didn t do any good But then gosh he s only just out of college I guess he s right Is that a fact Well I ll keep off it then Two stores farther on a bulky farmer hailed Say Milt should I get an ensilage cutter yet Yuh in the manner of a man who knows too much to be cocksure about anything I don t know but what I would Julius I guess I vill then Minnie Rauskukle plump hearty Minnie heiress to the general store gave evidence by bridling and straightening her pigeon like body that she was aware of Milt behind her He did not speak to her He ducked into the door of the Old Home Poolroom and Restaurant Milt ranged up to the short lunch counter in front of the pool table where two brick necked farm youngsters were furiously slamming balls and attacking cigarettes Loose jointedly Milt climbed a loose jointed high stool and to the proprietor Bill McGolwey his best friend he yawned You might poison me with a hamburger and a slab of apple Mac I ll just do that little thing Look kind of grouchy tonight Milt Too much excitement in this burg Saw three people on the streets all simultaneously to once What s been eatin you lately Me Nothing Only I do get tired of this metropolis One of these days I m going to buck some bigger place Try Gopher Prairie maybe suggested Mac through the hiss and steam of the frying hamburger sandwich Rats Too small Small Why there s darn near five thousand people there I know but I want to tackle some sure nuff city Like Duluth or New York But what d you do That s the devil of it I don t know just what I do want to do I could always land soft in a garage but that s nothing new Might hit Detroit and learn the motor factory end Aw you re the limit Milt Always looking for something new That s the way to get on The rest of this town is afraid of new things Member when I suggested we all chip in on a dynamo with a gas engine and have electric lights The hicks almost died of nervousness Yuh that s true but You stick here Milt You and me will just nachly run this burg I ll say Only Gosh Mac I would like to go to a real show once And find out how radio works And see em put in a big suspension bridge Milt left the Old Home rather aimlessly He told himself that he positively would not go back and help Ben Sittka get out the prof s car So he went back and helped Ben get out the prof s car and drove the same to the prof s The prof otherwise professor otherwise mister James Martin Jones B A and missus James Martin Jones welcomed him almost as noisily as had Mac They begged him to come in With mister Jones he discussed no ye Claires of Brooklyn Heights this garage man and this threadbare young superintendent of a paintbare school talking in a town that was only a comma on the line did not discuss corn growing nor did they reckon to guess that by heck the constabule was carryin on with the Widdy Perkins They spoke of fish culture Elihu Root the spiritualistic evidences of immortality government ownership self starters for flivvers and the stories of Irvin Cobb Milt went home earlier than he wanted to Because mister Jones was the only man in town besides the priest who read books because missus Jones was the only woman who laughed about any topics other than children and family sickness because he wanted to go to their house every night Milt treasured his welcome as a sacred thing and kept himself from calling on them more than once a week He stopped on his way to the garage to pet Emil Baumschweiger s large gray cat publicly known as Rags but to Milt and to the lady herself recognized as the unfortunate Countess Vere de Vere perhaps the only person of noble ancestry and mysterious past in Milt s acquaintance The Baumschweigers did not treat their animals well Emil kicked the bay mare and threw pitchforks at Vere de Vere Milt saluted her and sympathized You have a punk time don t you countess Like to beat it to Minneapolis with me The countess said that she did indeed have an extraordinarily punk time and she sang to Milt the hymn of the little gods of the warm hearth Then Milt s evening dissipations were over Schoenstrom has movies only once a week He sat in the office of his garage ruffling through a weekly digest of events Milt read much though not too easily He had no desire to be a poet an Indo Iranian etymologist a lecturer to women s clubs or the secretary of state But he did rouse to the marvels hinted in books and magazines to large crowds the mechanism of submarines palm trees gracious women He laid down the magazine He stared at the wall He thought about nothing He seemed to be fumbling for something about which he could deliciously think if he could but grasp it Without quite visualizing either wall or sea he was yet recalling old dreams of a moonlit wall by a warm stirring southern sea If there was a girl in the dream she was intangible as the scent of the night Presently he was asleep a not at all romantic figure rather ludicrously tipped to one side in his office chair his large solid shoes up on the desk He half woke and filtered to what he called home one room in the cottage of an oldish woman who had prejudices against the perilous night air He was too sleepy to go through any toilet save pulling off his shoes and achieving an unconvincing wash at the little stand whose crackly varnish was marked with white rings from the toothbrush mug I feel about due to pull off some fool stunt Wonder what it will be he complained as he flopped on the bed He was up at six and at a quarter to seven was at work in the garage He spent a large part of the morning in trying to prove to a customer that even a Teal car best at the test would not give perfect service if the customer persisted in forgetting to fill the oil well the grease cups and the battery At three minutes after twelve Milt left the garage to go to dinner The fog of the morning had turned to rain McGolwey was not at the Old Home Sometimes Mac got tired of serving meals and for a day or two he took to a pocket flask and among his former customers the cans of prepared meat at Rauskukle s became popular Milt found him standing under the tin awning of the general store He had a troubled hope of keeping Mac from too long a vacation with the pocket flask But Mac was already red eyed He seemed only half to recognize Milt Swell day said Milt Y bet Road darn muddy I should worry Yea bo I m feelin good At eleven minutes past twelve a Gomez Dep roadster appeared down the road stopped at the garage To Milt it was as exciting as the appearance of a comet to a watching astronomer What kind of a car do you call that Milt asked a loafer Gomez Deperdussin Never heard of it Looks too heavy This was sacrilege Milt stormed Why you poor floof it s one of the best cars in the world Imported from France That looks like a special made American body though Trouble with you fellows is you re always scared of anything that s new Too heavy Huh Always wanted to see a Gomez never have except in pictures And I believe that s a New York license Let me at it He forgot noon hunger and clumped through the rain to the garage He saw a girl step from the car He stopped in the doorway of the Old Home in uneasy shyness He told himself he didn t know just what it is about her she isn t so darn unusually pretty and yet gee Certainly isn t a girl to get fresh with Let Ben take care of her Like to talk to her and yet I d be afraid if I opened my mouth I d put my foot in it He was for the first time seeing a smart woman This dark slender fine nerved girl in her plain rough closely belted gray suit her small black Glengarry cocked on one side of her smooth hair her little kid gloves her veil was as delicately adjusted as an aeroplane engine Milt wanted to trumpet her exquisiteness to the world so he growled to a man standing beside him Swell car Nice lookin girl kind of Kind of skinny though I like em with some meat on em yawned the man No Milt did not strike him to earth He insisted feebly Nice clothes she s got though Oh not so muchamuch I seen a woman come through here yesterday that was swell though had on a purple dress and white shoes and a hat big s a bushel Well I don t know I kind of like those simple things apologized Milt He crept toward the garage The girl was inside He inspected the slope topped patent leather motoring trunk on the rack at the rear of the Gomez Dep He noticed a middle aged man waiting in the car Must be her father Probably maybe she isn t married then He could not get himself to shout at the man as he usually did He entered the garage office from the inner door he peeped at the girl who was talking to his assistant about changing an inner tube That Ben Sittka whom an hour ago he had cajoled as a promising child he now admired for the sniffing calmness with which he was demanding Want a red or gray tube Really I don t know Which is the better The girl s voice was curiously clear Milt passed Claire Boltwood as though he did not see her stood at the rear of the garage kicking at the tires of a car his back to her Over and over he was grumbling If I just knew one girl like that Like a picture Like like a silver vase on a blue cloth Ben Sittka did not talk to the girl while he inserted the tube in the spare casing Only in the triumphant moment when the parted ends of the steel rim snapped back together he piped Going far Yes rather To Seattle Milt stared at the cobweb grayed window Now I know what I was planning to do I m going to Seattle he said The girl was gone at twenty nine minutes after twelve At twenty nine and a half minutes after Milt remarked to Ben Sittka I m going to take a trip Uh Now don t ask questions You take charge of the garage until you hear from me Get somebody to help you G by He drove his Teal bug out of the garage At thirty two minutes after twelve he was in his room packing his wicker suitcase by the method of throwing things in and stamping on the case till it closed In it he had absolutely all of his toilet refinements and wardrobe except the important portion already in use They consisted according to faithful detailed report of four extra pairs of thick yellow and white cotton socks two shirts five collars five handkerchiefs a pair of surprisingly vain dancing pumps high tan laced boots three suits of cheap cotton underclothes his Sunday suit which was dead black in color and unimaginative in cut four ties a fagged toothbrush a comb and hairbrush a razor a strop shaving soap in a mug a not very clean towel and nothing else whatever To this he added his entire library and private picture gallery consisting of Ivanhoe Ben Hur his father s copy of Byron a wireless manual and the nineteen sixteen edition of Motor Construction and Repairing the art collection one colored Sunday supplement picture of a princess lunching in a Provence courtyard and a half tone of Colonel Paul Beck landing in an early military biplane Under this last in a pencil scrawl now blurred to grayness Milt had once written This what Ill be aviator What he was to wear was a piercing trouble Till eleven minutes past twelve that day he had not cared People accepted his overalls at anything except a dance and at the dances he was the only one who wore pumps But in his discovery of Claire Boltwood he had perceived that dressing is an art Before he had packed he had unhappily pawed at the prized black suit It had become stupid Undertaker he growled With a shrug which indicated that he had nothing else he had exchanged his overalls for a tan flannel shirt black bow tie thick pigskin shoes and the suit he had worn the evening before his best suit of two years ago baggy blue serge coat and trousers He could not know it but they were surprisingly graceful on his wiry firm white body In his pockets were a roll of bills and an unexpectedly good gold watch For warmth he had a winter ulster an old fashioned turtle neck sweater and a raincoat heavy as tarpaulin He plunged into the raincoat ran out galloped to Rauskukle s store bought the most vehement cap in the place a plaid of cerise orange emerald green ultramarine and five other guaranteed fashionable colors He stocked up with food for roadside camping In the humping tin covered tail of the bug was a good deal of room and this he filled with motor extras a shotgun and shells a pair of skates and all his camping kit as used on his annual duck hunting trip to Man Trap Lake I m a darned fool to take everything I own but Might be gone a whole month he reflected He had only one possession left a check book concealed from the interested eye of his too maternal landlady by sticking it under the stair carpet This he retrieved It showed a balance of two hundred dollars There was ten dollars in the cash register in the office for Ben Sittka The garage would with the mortgage deducted be worth nearly two thousand This was his fortune He bolted into the kitchen and all in one shout he informed his landlady Called out of town li l trip b lieve I don t owe you an thing here s six dollars two weeks notice dunno just when I be back Before she could issue a questionnaire he was out in the bug He ran through town At his friend McGolwey now loose lipped and wabbly sitting in the rain on a pile of ties behind the railroad station he yelled So long Mac Take care yourself old hoss Off on li l trip He stopped in front of the prof s tooted till the heads of the Joneses appeared at the window waved and shouted G by folks Goin outa town Then while freedom and the distant Pacific seemed to rush at him over the hood he whirled out of town It was two minutes to one forty seven minutes since Claire Boltwood had entered Schoenstrom He stopped only once His friend Lady Vere de Vere was at the edge of town on a scientific exploring trip in the matter of ethnology and field mice She hailed him Mrwr Me mrwr You don t say so Milt answered in surprise Well if I promised to take you I ll keep my word He vaulted out tucked Vere de Vere into the seat protecting her from the rain with the tarpaulin winter radiator cover His rut skipping car overtook the mud walloping Gomez Dep in an hour and pulled it out of the mud Before Milt slept that night in his camp three miles from Gopher Prairie he went through religious rites Girl like her she s darn particular about her looks I m a sloppy hound Used to be snappier about my clothes when I was in high school Getting lazy too much like Mac Think of me sleeping in my clothes last night Mrwr rebuked the cat You re dead right Fierce is the word Nev will sleep in my duds again puss That is when I have a reg lar human bed Course camping different But still Let s see all the funny things we can do to us He shaved two complete shaves from lather to towel He brushed his hair He sat down by a campfire sheltered between two rocks and fought his nails though they were discouragingly crammed with motor grease Throughout this interesting but quite painful ceremony Milt kept up a conversation between himself as the World s Champion Dude and his cat as Vallay But when there was nothing more to do and the fire was low and Vere de Vere asleep in the sleeve of the winter ulster his bumbling voice slackened in something like agony he muttered But oh what s the use I can t ever be anything but a dub Cleaning my nails to make a hit with a girl that s got hands like hers It s a long trail to Seattle but it s a darn sight longer one to being being well sophisticated Oh And incidentally what the deuce am I going to do in Seattle if I do get there CHAPTER VI THE LAND OF BILLOWING CLOUDS 
3691-178103-0000	train-other-500	Never a tawny beached ocean has the sweetness of the prairie slew Rippling and blue with long grass up to its edge a spot of dancing light set in the miles of rustling wheat it retains even in July
3691-178103-0001	train-other-500	on an afternoon of glare and brazen locusts the freshness of a spring morning A thousand slews a hundred lakes bordered with rippling barley or tinkling bells of the flax Claire passed
3691-178103-0002	train-other-500	She had left the occasional groves of oak and poplar and silver birch and come out on the treeless Great Plains She had learned to call the slews
none	none	 pugholes 
3691-178103-0003	train-other-500	and to watch for ducks at twilight She had learned that about the pugholes flutter choirs of crimson winged blackbirds that the ugly brown birds squatting on fence rails were the divine voiced meadow larks
3691-178103-0004	train-other-500	that among the humble cowbird citizens of the pastures sometimes flaunted a scarlet tanager or an oriole and that no rose garden has the quaint and hardy beauty of the Indian paint brushes
none	none	 and rag babies and orange milkweed in the prickly burnt over grass between roadside and railway line 
3691-178103-0005	train-other-500	She had learned that what had seemed rudeness in garage men and hotel clerks was often a resentful reflection of her own Eastern attitude that she was necessarily superior to a race she had been trained to call
3691-178103-0006	train-other-500	common people If she spoke up frankly they made her one of their own and gave her companionable aid For two days of sunshine and drying mud
3691-178103-0007	train-other-500	she followed a road flung straight across flat wheatlands then curving among low hills Often there were no fences she was so intimately in among the grain that the fenders of the car brushed wheat stalks
3691-178103-0008	train-other-500	and she became no stranger but a part of all this vast horizoned land She forgot that she was driving as she let the car creep on while she was transported by Armadas of clouds
3691-178103-0009	train-other-500	prairie clouds wisps of vapor like a ribbed beach or mounts of cumulus swelling to gold washed snowy peaks The friendliness of the bearing earth gave her a calm that took no heed of passing hours
3691-178103-0010	train-other-500	Even her father the abstracted man of affairs nodded to dusty people along the road to a jolly old man whose bulk rolled and shook in a tiny rhythmically creaking buggy
3691-178103-0011	train-other-500	to women in the small abrupt towns with their huge red elevators and their long flat roofed stores Claire had discovered America and she felt stronger and all her days were colored with the sun
3691-178103-0012	train-other-500	She had discovered too that she could adventure No longer was she haunted by the apprehension that had whispered to her as she had left Minneapolis She knew a thrill when she hailed as though it were a passing ship
3691-178103-0013	train-other-500	an Illinois car across whose dust caked back was a banner Chicago to the Yellowstone She experienced a new sensation of common humanness when on a railway paralleling the wagon road for miles
3691-178103-0014	train-other-500	the engineer of a freight waved his hand to her and tooted the whistle in greeting Her father was easily tired but he drowsed through the early afternoons when a none too digestible small town lunch was as lead within him
3691-178103-0015	train-other-500	Despite the beauty of the land and the joy of pushing on they both had things to endure After lunch it was sometimes an agony to Claire to keep awake Her eyes felt greasy from the food or smarted with the sun glare
none	none	 In the still air after the morning breeze had been burnt out 
3691-178103-0016	train-other-500	the heat from the engine was a torment about her feet and if there was another car ahead the trail of dust sifted into her throat Unless there was traffic to keep her awake she nodded at the wheel
3691-178103-0017	train-other-500	she was merely a part of a machine that ran on without seeming to make any impression on the prairie s endlessness
none	none	 Over and over there were the same manipulations 
3691-178103-0018	train-other-500	slow for down hill careful of sand at the bottom
none	none	 letting her out on a smooth stretch 
3691-178103-0019	train-other-500	waving to a lonely farmwife in her small baked dooryard slow to pass a hay wagon
none	none	 gas for up the next hill 
3691-178103-0020	train-other-500	and repeat the round all over again But she was joyous till noon and with mid afternoon a new strength came which as rose crept above the golden haze of dust deepened into serene meditation
3691-178103-0021	train-other-500	And she was finding the one secret of long distance driving namely driving keeping on thinking by fifty mile units not by the ten mile stretches of Long Island runs and not fretting over anything whatever
3691-178103-0022	train-other-500	She seemed charmed if she had a puncture why she put on the spare If she ran out of gas why any passing driver would lend her a gallon
3691-178103-0023	train-other-500	Nothing it seemed could halt her level flight across the giant land She rarely lost her way She was guided by the friendly trail signs
none	none	 those big red R s and L s on fence post and telephone pole 
3691-178103-0024	train-other-500	magically telling the way from the Mississippi to the Pacific Her father s occasional musing talk kept her from loneliness He was a good touring companion Motoring is not the best occasion for epigrams satire
3691-178103-0025	train-other-500	and the Good One You Got Off at the Lambs Club last night Such verbiage on motor trips invariably results in the mysterious finding of the corpse of a strange man well dressed hidden beside the road
3691-178103-0026	train-other-500	Claire and her father mumbled Good farmhouse brick or Nice view and smiled and were for miles as silent as the companionable sky She thought of the people she knew
3691-178103-0027	train-other-500	especially of Jeff Saxton But she could not clearly remember his lean earnest face Between her and Jeff were sweeping sunny leagues But she was not lonely
none	none	 Certainly she was not lonely for a young man with a raincoat a cat and an interest in Japan 
3691-178103-0028	train-other-500	No singer after a first concert has felt more triumphant than Claire when she crossed her first state line rumbled over the bridge across the Red River into North Dakota
none	none	 To see Dakota car licenses everywhere instead of Minnesota 
3691-178103-0029	train-other-500	was like the sensation of street signs in a new language And when she found a good hotel in Fargo and had a real bath she felt that by her own efforts she had earned the right to enjoy it
3691-178103-0030	train-other-500	mister Boltwood caught her enthusiasm Dinner was a festival and in iced tea the peaceful conquistadores drank the toast of the new Spanish Main and afterward arm in arm went chattering to the movies
3691-178103-0031	train-other-500	In front of the Royal Palace Pictures four Great Acts Vaudeville four was browsing a small beetle like tin covered car Dad Look I m sure
3691-178103-0032	train-other-500	yes of course there s his suitcase that s the car of that nice boy don t you remember the one that pulled us out of the mud at
none	none	 I don t remember the name of the place 
3691-178103-0033	train-other-500	Apparently he s keeping going I remember he s headed for Seattle too We ll look for him in the theater Oh the darling there s his cat What was the funny name he gave her the Marchioness Montmorency or something
3691-178103-0034	train-other-500	Lady Vere de Vere afraid of Fargo and movie crowds but trusting in her itinerant castle the bug was curled in Milt Daggett s ulster in the bottom of the car She twinkled her whiskers at Claire
3691-178103-0035	train-other-500	and purred to a stroking hand With the excitement of one trying to find the address of a friend in a strange land Claire looked over the audience when the lights came on before the vaudeville
3691-178103-0036	train-other-500	In the second row she saw Milt s stiffish rope colored hair surprisingly smooth above an astoundingly clean new tan shirt of mercerized silk
none	none	 He laughed furiously at the dialogue between Pete Rosenheim Larose Bettina though it contained the cheese joke the mother in law joke and the joke about the wife rifling her husband s pockets 
3691-178103-0038	train-other-500	Our young friend seems to have enviable youthful spirits commented mister Boltwood Now no superiority He s probably never seen a real vaudeville show
none	none	 Wouldn t it be fun to take him to the Winter Garden 
3691-178103-0039	train-other-500	or the Follies for the first time Instead of being taken by Jeff Saxton and having the humor oh so articulately explained The pictures were resumed the film which
3691-178103-0040	train-other-500	under ten or twelve different titles Claire had already seen even though Brooklyn Heights does not devote Saturday evening to the movies The badman the sheriff an aged party with whiskers and boots the holdup the sad eyes of the sheriff s daughter
3691-178103-0041	train-other-500	also an aged party but with a sunbonnet and the most expensive rouge
none	none	 the crook s reformation and his violent adherence to law and order this libel upon the portions of these United States lying west of longitude one hundred one deg Claire had seen too often 
3691-178103-0042	train-other-500	She dragged her father back to the hotel sent him to bed and entered her room to find a telegram upon the bureau She had sent her friends a list of the places at which she would be likely to stop
3691-178103-0043	train-other-500	The message was from Jeff Saxton in Brooklyn It brought to her mind the steady shine of his glasses the most expensive glasses with the very best curved lenses as it demanded
3691-178103-0044	train-other-500	Received letter about trip surprised anxious will tire you out fatigue prairie roads bad for your father mountain roads dangerous strongly advise go only part way then take train GEOFFREY
3691-178103-0045	train-other-500	She held the telegram flipping her fingers against one end of it as she debated She remembered how the wide world had flowed toward her over the hood of the Gomez all day She wrote in answer
3691-178103-0046	train-other-500	Awful perils of road two punctures split infinitive eggs at lunch questionable but struggle on Before she sent it she held council with her father She sat on the foot of his bed and tried to sound dutiful
3691-178103-0047	train-other-500	I don t want to do anything that s bad for you daddy But isn t it taking your mind away from business Ye es I think it is Anyway we ll try it a few days more I fancy we can stand up under the strain and perils
3691-178103-0048	train-other-500	I think we can persuade some of these big farmers to come to the rescue if we encounter any walruses or crocodiles among the wheat And I have a feeling that if we ever get stuck our friend of the Teal bug will help us
none	none	 Probably never see him again He ll skip on ahead of us Of course We haven t laid an eye on him along the road He must have gotten into Fargo long before we did Now tomorrow I think CHAPTER VII THE GREAT AMERICAN FRYING PAN It was Claire s first bad day since the hole in the mud She had started gallantly scooting along the level road that flies straight west of Fargo But at noon she encountered a restaurant which made eating seem an evil That they might have fair fame among motorists the commercial club of Reaper had set at the edge of town a sign Welcome to Reaper a Live Town Speed Limit eight Miles perhr Being interpreted that sign meant that if you went much over twenty miles an hour on the main street people might glance at you and that the real welcome the only impression of Reaper that tourists were likely to carry away was the welcome in the one restaurant It was called the Eats Garden As Claire and her father entered they were stifled by a belch of smoke from the frying pan in the kitchen The room was blocked by a huge lunch counter there was only one table covered with oil cloth decorated with venerable spots of dried egg yolk The waiter cook whose apron was gravy patterned with a border and stomacher of plain gray dirt grumbled Whadyuhwant Claire sufficiently recovered to pick out the type from the fly specks on the menu and she ordered a small steak and coffee for her father for herself tea boiled eggs toast Toast We ain t got any toast Well can t you make it Oh I suppose I could When they came the slices of toast were an inch thick burnt on one side and raw on the other The tea was bitter and the eggs watery Her father reported that his steak was high test rawhide and his coffee well he wasn t sure just what substitute had been used for chicory but he thought it was lukewarm quinine Claire raged You know this town really has aspirations They re beginning to build such nice little bungalows and there s a fine clean bank Then they permit this scoundrel to advertise the town among strangers influential strangers in motors by serving food like this I suppose they think that they arrest criminals here yet this restaurant man is a thief to charge real money for food like this Yes and he s a murderer Oh come now dolly Yes he is literally He must in his glorious career have given chronic indigestion to thousands of people shortened their lives by years That s wholesale murder If I were the authorities here I d be indulgent to the people who only murder one or two people but imprison this cook for life Really I mean it Well he probably does the best he He does not These eggs and this bread were perfectly good before he did black magic over them And did you see the contemptuous look he gave me when I was so eccentric as to order toast Oh Reaper Reaper you desire a modern town yet I wonder if you know how many thousands of tourists go from coast to coast cursing you If I could only hang that restaurant man and the others like him in a rope of his own hempen griddle cakes The Great American Frying Pan I don t expect men building a new town to have time to read Hugh Walpole and James Branch Cabell but I do expect them to afford a cook who can fry eggs As she paid the check Claire tried to think of some protest which would have any effect on the obese wits of the restaurant man In face of his pink puffiness she gave it up Her failure as a Citizeness Fixit sent her out of the place in a fury carried her on in a dusty whirl till the engine spat sounded tired and reflective and said it guessed it wouldn t go any farther that day Now that she had something to do Claire became patient Run out of gas Isn t it lucky I got that can for an extra gallon But there was plenty of gas There was no discernible reason why the car should not go She started the engine It ran for half a minute and quit All the plugs showed sparks No wires were detached in the distributor There was plenty of water and the oil was not clogged And that ended Claire s knowledge of the inside of a motor She stopped two motorists The first was sure that there was dirt on the point of the needle valve in the carburetor While Claire shuddered lest he never get it back he took out the needle valve wiped it put it back and the engine was again started and again with great promptness it stopped The second Good Samaritan knew that one of the wires in the distributor must be detached and though she assured him that she had inspected them he looked pityingly at her smart sports suit said Well I ll just take a look and removed the distributor cover He also scratched his head felt of the fuses under the cowl scratched his cheek poked a finger at the carburetor rubbed his ear said Well uh looked to see if there was water and gas sighed Can t just seem to find out what s the trouble shot at his own car and escaped Claire had been highly grateful and laudatory to both of them but she remained here ten miles from nowhere It was a beautiful place Down a hill the wheat swam toward a village whose elevator was a glistening tower Mud hens gabbled in a slew alfalfa shone with unearthly green and bees went junketing toward a field of red clover But she had the motorist s fever to go on The road behind and in front was very long very white and very empty Her father out of much thought and a solid ignorance about all of motoring beyond the hiring of chauffeurs and the payment of bills suggested Uh dolly have you looked to see if these uh Is the carburetor all right Yes dear I ve looked at it three times so far she said just a little too smoothly On the hill five miles to eastward a line of dust then a small car As it approached the driver must have sighted her and increased speed He came up at thirty five miles an hour Now we ll get something done Look It s a bug a flivver or a Teal or something I believe it s the young man that got us out of the mud Milt Daggett stopped casually greeted them Why hello Miss Boltwood Thought you d be way ahead of me some place Mrwr said Vere de Vere What this meant the historian does not know No I ve been taking it easy mister Uh I can t quite remember your name Milt Daggett There s something mysterious the matter with my car The engine will start after it s left alone a while but then it stalls Do you suppose you could tell what it is I don t know I ll see if I can find out Then you probably will The other two men knew everything One of them was the inventor of wheels and the other discovered skidding So of course they couldn t help me Milt added nothing to her frivolity but his smile was friendly He lifted the round rubber cap of the distributor Then Claire s faith tumbled in the dust Twice had the wires been tested Milt tested them again She was too tired of botching to tell him he was wasting time Got an oil can he hesitated Through a tiny hole in the plate of the distributor he dripped two drops of oil only two drops I guess maybe that s what it needed You might try her now and see how she runs he said mildly Dubiously Claire started the engine It sang jubilantly and it did not stop Again was the road open to her Again was the settlement over there to which it would have taken her an hour to walk only six minutes away She stopped the engine beamed at him there in the dust on the quiet hilltop He said as apologetically as though he had been at fault Distributor got dry Might give it a little oil about once in six months We are so grateful to you Twice now you ve saved our lives Oh I guess you d have gone on living And if drivers can t help each other who can That s a good start toward world fellowship I suppose I wish we could do Return your lunch or mister Daggett Do you read books I mean Yes I do when I run across them Mayn t I gi lend you these two that I happen to have along I ve finished them and so has father I think From the folds of the strapped down top she pulled out Compton Mackenzie s Youth s Encounter and Vachel Lindsay s Congo With a curious faint excitement she watched him turn the leaves His blunt fingers flapped through them as though he was used to books As he looked at Congo he exclaimed Poetry That s fine Like it but I don t hardly ever run across it I Say I m terribly obliged His clear face lifted sun brown and young and adoring She had not often seen men look at her thus Certainly Jeff Saxton s painless worship did not turn him into the likeness of a knight among banners Yet the good Geoffrey loved her while to Milt Daggett she could be nothing more than a strange young woman in a car with a New York license If her tiny gift could so please him how poor he must be He probably lives on some barren farm she thought or he s a penniless mechanic hoping for a good job in Seattle How white his forehead is But aloud she was saying I hope you re enjoying your trip Oh yes I like it fine You having a good time Well Well thanks for the books She was off before him Presently she exclaimed to mister Boltwood You know just occurs to me it s rather curious that our young friend should be so coincidental as to come along just when we needed him Oh he just happened to I suppose hemmed her father I m not so sure she meditated while she absently watched another member of the Poultry Suicide Club rush out of a safe ditch prepare to take leave for immortality change her fowlish mind flutter up over the hood of the car and come down squawking her indignities to the barnyard I m not so sure about his happening No I wonder if he could possibly Oh no I hope not Flattering but You don t suppose he could be deliberately following us Nonsense He s a perfectly decent young chap I know Of course He probably works hard in a garage and is terribly nice to his mother and sisters at home I mean I wouldn t want the dear lamb to be a devoted knight though Too thankless a job She slowed the car down to fifteen an hour For the first time she began to watch the road behind her In a few minutes a moving spot showed in the dust three miles back Oh naturally he would still be behind her Only If she stopped just to look at the scenery he would go on ahead of her She stopped for a moment for a time too brief to indicate that anything had gone wrong with her car Staring back she saw that the bug stopped also and she fancied that Milt was out standing beside it peering with his palm over his eyes a spy unnatural and disturbing in the wide peace She drove on a mile and halted again again halted her attendant He was keeping a consistent two to four miles behind she estimated This won t do at all she worried Flattering but somehow Whatever sort of a cocoon wrapped hussy I am I don t collect scalps I won t have young men serving me graft on them get amusement out of their struggles Besides suppose he became just a little more friendly each time he came up all the way from here to Seattle Fresh No it won t do She ran the car to the side of the road More trouble groaned her father No Just want to see scenery But There s a good deal of scenery on all sides without stopping seems to me Yes but She looked back Milt had come into sight had paused to take observations Her father caught it Oh I see Pardon me Our squire still following Let him go on ahead Wise lass Yes I think perhaps it s better to avoid complications Of course mister Boltwood s manner did not merely avoid Milt it abolished him She saw Milt after five minutes of stationary watching start forward He came dustily rattling up with a hail of Distributor on strike again so cheerful that it hurt her to dismiss him But she had managed a household She was able to say suavely No everything is fine I m sure it will be now I m afraid we are holding you back You mustn t worry about us Oh that s all right breezily Something might go wrong Say is this poetry book No I m sure nothing will go wrong now You mustn t feel responsible for us But uh you understand we re very grateful for what you have done and uh perhaps we shall see each other in Seattle She made it brightly interrogatory Oh I see His hands gripped the wheel His cheeks had been too ruddily tinted by the Dakota sun to show a blush but his teeth caught his lower lip He had no starter on his bug he had in his embarrassment to get out and crank He did it quietly not looking at her She could see that his hand trembled on the crank When he did glance at her as he drove off it was apologetically miserably His foot was shaking on the clutch pedal The dust behind his car concealed him For twenty miles she was silent save when she burst out to her father I do hope you re enjoying the trip It s so easy to make people unhappy I wonder No Had to be done CHAPTER VIII THE DISCOVERY OF CANNED SHRIMPS AND HESPERIDES On the morning when Milt Daggett had awakened to sunshine in the woods north of Gopher Prairie he had discovered the golden age As mile on mile he jogged over new hills without having to worry about getting back to his garage in time to repair somebody s car he realized that for the past two years he had forced himself to find contentment in building up a business that had no future Now he laughed and whooped he drove with one foot inelegantly and enchantingly up on the edge of the cowl he made Lady Vere de Vere bow to astounded farmers he went to the movies every evening twice in Fargo and when the chariot of the young prince swept to the brow of a hill he murmured not in the manner of a bug driver but with a stinging awe All that big country Ours to see puss We ll settle down some day and be solid citizens and raise families and wheeze when we walk but All those hills to sail over and Come on Lez sail Milt attended the motion pictures every evening and he saw them in a new way As recently as one week before he had preferred those earnest depictions in which hard working moral actors shoot one another or ride the most uncomfortable horses up mountainsides But now with a mental apology to that propagandist of lowbrowism the absent Mac he chose the films in which the leading men wore evening clothes and no one ever did anything without being assisted by a man Aside from the pictures Milt s best tutors were traveling men Though he measured every cent and for his campfire dinners bought modest chuck steaks he had at least one meal a day at a hotel to watch the traveling men To Claire traveling men were merely commercial persons in hard boiled suits She identified them with the writing up of order slips on long littered writing tables and with hotels that reduced the delicate arts of dining and sleeping to gray greasiness But Milt knew traveling men He knew that not only were they the missionaries of business supplementing the taking of orders by telling merchants how to build up trade how to trim windows and treat customers like human beings but also that they as much as the local ministers and doctors and teachers and newspapermen were the agents in spreading knowledge and justice It was they who showed the young men how to have their hair cut and to wash behind the ears and shave daily they who encouraged villagers to rise from scandal and gossip to a perception of the Great World of politics and sports and some measure of art and science Claire and indeed her father and mister Jeff Saxton as well had vaguely concluded that because drummers were always to be seen in soggy hotels and badly connecting trains and the headachy waiting rooms of stations they must like these places Milt knew that the drummers were martyrs that for months of a trip all the while thinking of the children back home they suffered from landlords and train schedules that they were Claire s best allies in fighting the Great American Frying Pan that they knew good things and fought against the laziness and impositions of people who kept hotel because they had failed as farmers and that when they did find a landlord who was cordial and efficient they went forth mightily advertising that glorious man The traveling men he knew were pioneers in spats Hence it was to the traveling men not to supercilious tourists in limousines that Milt turned for suggestions as to how to perform the miracle of changing from an ambitious boy into what Claire would recognize as a charming man He had not met enough traveling men at Schoenstrom They scooped up what little business there was and escaped from the Leipzig House to spend the night at saint Cloud or Sauk Centre In the larger towns in Minnesota and Dakota after evening movies before slipping out to his roadside camp Milt inserted himself into a circle of traveling men in large leather chairs and ventured Saw a Gomez Dep with a New York license down the line today Oh You driving through Yes Going to Seattle That distinguished Milt from the ordinary young men loafers and he was admitted as one of the assembly of men who traveled and saw things and wondered about the ways of men It was good talk he heard too much of hotels and too many tight banal little phrases suggesting the solution of all economic complexities by hanging agitators but with this an exciting accumulation of impressions of Vancouver and San Diego Florida and K C That s a wonderful work farm they have at Duluth said one and the next speaking of that I was in Chicago last week and I saw a play Milt had in his two years of high school in saint Cloud and in his boyhood under the genial but abstracted eye of the Old Doctor learned that it was not well thought of to use the knife as a hod and to plaster mashed potatoes upon it as was the custom in Mac s Old Home Lunch at Schoenstrom But the arts of courteously approaching oysters salad and peas were rather unfamiliar to him Now he studied forks as he had once studied carburetors and he gave spiritual devotion to the nice eating of a canned shrimp cocktail a lost legion of shrimps now two thousand miles and two years away from their ocean home He peeped with equal earnestness at the socks and the shirts of the traveling men Socks had been to him not an article of faith but a detail of economy His attitude to socks had lacked in reverence and technique He had not perceived that socks may be as sound a symbol of culture as the cello or even demountable rims He had been able to think with respect of ties and damp pique collars secured by gold safety pins and to the belted fawn overcoat that the saint Klopstock banker s son had brought back from saint Paul he had given jealous attention But now he graduated into differential socks By his campfire sighing to the rather somnolent Vere de Vere he scornfully yanked his extra pairs of thick white streaked yellow cotton socks from the wicker suitcase and uttered anathema Begone ye unworthy and punk looking raiment I know ye Ye werst a bargain and two pairs for two bits But even as Adolph Zolzac and an agent for flivver accessories are ye become in my eyes ye generation of vipers ye clumsy bag footed wrinkle sided gunny sacking ye Next day in the woods a happy hobo found that the manna bringing ravens had left him four pairs of good socks Five quite expensive pairs of silk and lisle socks Milt purchased all that the general merchant at Jeppe had in stock What they lost in suitability to touring and to private laundering at creeks they gained as symbols Milt felt less shut out from the life of leisure Now in Seattle say he could go into a good hotel with less fear of the clerks He added attractive outing shirts ties neither too blackly dull nor too flashily crimson and a vicious nail brush which simply tore out the motor grease that had grown into the lines of his hands Also he added a book The book was a rhetoric Milt knew perfectly that there was an impertinence called grammar but it had never annoyed him much He knew that many persons preferred They were to They was and were nervous in the presence of ain t One teacher in saint Cloud had buzzed frightfully about these minutiae But Milt discovered that grammar was only the beginning of woes He learned that there were such mental mortgages as figures of speech and the choice of synonyms He had always known but he had never passionately felt that the invariable use of hell doggone and You bet left certain subtleties unexpressed Now he was finding subtleties which he had to express As joyously adventurous as going on day after day was his experimentation in voicing his new observations He gave far more eagerness to it than Claire Boltwood had Gustily intoning to Vere de Vere who was the perfect audience inasmuch as she never had anything to say but Mrwr and didn t mind being interrupted in that he clamored The prairies are the sea In the distance they are kind of silvery no they are dim silver and way off on the skyline are the Islands of the of the Now what the devil was them were those islands in the mythology book in high school Of the Blessed Great snakes boots you re an ignorant cat Vere Hesperyds No Hesperides Yea bo Now that man in the hotel May I trouble you for the train guide Thanks so much But how much is so much As Claire s days were set free by her consciousness of sun and brown earth so Milt s odyssey was only the more valorous in his endeavor to criticize life He saw that Mac s lunch room had not been an altogether satisfactory home that Mac s habit of saying to dissatisfied customers If you don t like it get out had lacked something of courtesy Staring at towns along the way Milt saw that houses were not merely large and comfortable or small and stingy but that there was an interesting thing he remembered hearing his teachers call good taste He was not the preoccupied Milt of the garage but a gay eyed gallant the evening when he gave a lift to the school teacher and drove her from the district school among the wild roses and the corn to her home in the next town She was a neat tripping trim sided school teacher of nineteen or twenty You re going out to Seattle My That s a wonderful trip Don t you get tired she adored Oh no And I m seeing things I used to think everything worth while was right near my own town You re so wise to go places Most of the boys I know don t think there is any world beyond Jimtown and Fargo She glowed at him Milt was saying to himself Am I a fool I probably could make this girl fall in love with me And she s better than I am so darn neat and clean and gentle We d be happy She s a nice comfy fire and here I go like a boob chasing after a lone cold star like Miss Boltwood and probably I ll fall into all the slews from hell to breakfast on the way But I d get sleepy by a comfy fire Are you thinking hard You re frowning so ventured the school teacher Didn t mean to Scuse he laughed One hand off the steering wheel he took her hand a fresh cool virginal hand snuggling into his suddenly stirring him He wanted to hold it tighter The lamenting historian of love s pilgrimage must set down the fact that the pilgrim for at least a second forgot the divine tread of the goddess Claire and made rapid calculation that he could in a pinch drive from Schoenstrom to the teacher s town in two days and a night that therefore courtship and this sweet white hand resting in his were not impossible Milt himself did not know what it was that made him lay down the hand and say so softly that he was but half audible through the rattle of the engine Isn t this a slick mean to say glorious evening Sky rose and then that funny lavender And that new moon Makes me think of the girl I m in love with You re engaged wistfully Not exactly but Say did you study rhetoric in Normal School I have a rhetoric that s got all kind of poetic extracts you know and quotations and everything from the big writers Stevenson and all Always been so practical making a garage pay never thought much about how I said things as long as I could say No and say it quick Cept maybe when I was talking to the prof there But it s great sport to see how musical you can make a thing sound Words Like Shenandoah Gol lee Isn t that a wonderful word Makes you see old white mansion and mocking birds Wonder if a fellow could be a big engineer you know build bridges and so on and still talk about oh beautiful things What d you think girlie Oh I m sure you could Her admiration the proximity of her fragrant slightness was pleasant in the dusk but he did not press her hand again even when she whispered Good night and thank you oh thank you If Milt had been driving at the rate at which he usually made his skipjack carom over the roads about Schoenstrom he would by now have been through Dakota into Montana But he was deliberately holding down the speed When he had been tempted by a smooth stretch to go too breathlessly he halted teased Vere de Vere climbed out and sitting on a hilltop his hands about his knees drenched his soul with the vision of amber distances He tried so to time his progress that he might always be from three to five miles behind Claire distant enough to be unnoticed near enough to help in case of need For behind poetic expression and the use of forks was the fact that his purpose in life was to know Claire When he was caught when Claire informed him that he mustn t worry about her when slowly he understood that she wasn t being neighborly and interested in his making time he wanted to escape never to see her again For thirty miles his cheeks were fiery He most considerate of roadmen crowded a woman in a flivver passed a laboring car on an upgrade with such a burst that the uneasy driver bumped off into a ditch He hadn t really seen them Only mechanically had he got past them He was muttering She thought I was trying to butt in Stung again Like a small boy in love with teacher And I thought I was so wise Cussed out Mac blamed Mac no damn all the fine words cussed out Mac for being the village rumhound Boozing is twice as sensible as me See a girl nice dress start for Seattle Two thousand miles away Of course she bawled me out She was dead right Boob Yahoo Goat He caught up Vere de Vere rubbed her fur against his cheek while he mourned Oh puss you got to be nice to me I thought I d do big things And then the alarm clock went off I m back in Schoenstrom For keeps I guess I didn t know I had feelings that could get hurt like this Thought I had a rhinoceros hide But Oh it isn t just feeling ashamed over being a fool It s that Won t ever see her again Not once Way I saw her through the window at that hotel in that blue silky dress that funny long line of buttons and her throat Never have dinner lunch with her by the road In the reaction of anger he demanded of Vere de Vere What the deuce do I care If she s chump enough to chase away a crack garage man that s gone batty and wants to work for nothing let her go on and hit some crook garage and get stuck for an entire overhauling What do I care Had nice trip that s all I wanted Never did intend to go clear to Seattle anyway Go on to Butte then back home No more fussing about fool table manners and books and I certainly will cut out tagging behind her No sir Nev er again It was somewhat inconsistent to add There s a bully place sneak in and let her get past me again But she won t catch me following next time While he tried to keep up his virtuous anger he was steering into an abandoned farmyard parking the car behind cottonwoods and neglected tall currant bushes which would conceal it from the road The windows of the deserted house stared at him a splintered screen door banged in every breeze Lichens leered from the cracks of the porch The yard was filled with a litter of cottonwood twigs and over the flower garden hulked ragged weeds In the rank grass about the slimy green lip of the well crickets piped derisively The barn door was open Stray kernels of wheat had sprouted between the spokes of a rusty binder wheel A rat slipped across the edge of the shattered manger As dusk came on gray things seemed to slither past the upper windows of the house and somewhere under the roof there was a moaning Milt was sure that it was the wind in a knothole He told himself that he was absolutely sure about it And every time it came he stroked Vere de Vere carefully and once when the moaning ended in the slamming of the screen door he said Jiminy This boy of the unghostly cylinders and tangible magnetos had never seen a haunted house To toil of the harvest field and machine shop and to trudging the sun beaten road he was accustomed but he had never crouched watching the slinking spirits of old hopes and broken aspirations feeble phantoms of the first eager bridegroom who had come to this place and the mortgage crushed rust wheat ruined man who had left it He wanted to leap into the bug and go on Yet the haunt of murmurous memories dignified his unhappiness In the soft tree dimmed dooryard among dry blazing plains it seemed indecent to go on growling Gee and Can you beat it It was a young poet a poet rhymeless and inarticulate who huddled behind the shield of untrimmed currant bushes and thought of the girl he would never see again He was hungry but he did not eat He was cramped but he did not move He picked up the books she had given him He was quickened by the powdery beauty of Youth s Encounter by the vision of laughter and dancing steps beneath a streaky gas glow in the London fog of youth not roughhousing and wanting to be a sport yet in frail beauty and faded crimson banners finding such exaltation as Schoenstrom had never known But every page suggested Claire and he tucked the book away In Vachel Lindsay s Congo in a poem called The Santa Fe Trail he found his own modern pilgrimage from another point of view Here was the poet disturbed by the honking hustle of passing cars But Milt belonged to the honking and the hustle and it was not the soul of the grass that he read in the poem but his own sun flickering flight Swiftly the brazen car comes on It burns in the East as the sunrise burns I see great flashes where the far trail turns Butting through the delicate mists of the morning It comes like lightning goes past roaring It will hail all the windmills taunting ringing On through the ranges the prairie dog tills Scooting past the cattle on the thousand hills Ho for the tear horn scare horn dare horn Ho for the gay horn bark horn bay horn Milt did not reflect that if the poet had watched the Teal bug go by he would not have recorded a scare horn a dare horn or anything mightier than a yip horn Milt saw himself a cross continent racer with the envious poet left behind as a dot on the hill celebrating his passing Lord he cried I didn t know there were books like these Thought poetry was all like Longfellow and Byron Old boys Europe And rhymed bellyachin about hard luck But these books they re me Very carefully No they re I And she gave em to me I will see her again But she won t know it Now be sensible son What do you expect Oh nothing I ll just go on and sneak in one more glimpse of her to take back with me where I belong Half an hour after Claire had innocently passed his ambush he began to follow her But not for days was he careless If he saw her on the horizon he paused until she was out of sight That he might not fail her in need he bought a ridiculously expensive pair of field glasses and watched her when she stopped by the road Once when both her right rear tire and the spare were punctured before she could make a town Milt from afar saw her patch a tube pump up the tire in the dust He ached to go to her aid though it cannot be said that hand pumping was his favorite July afternoon sport Lest he encounter her in the streets he always camped to the eastward of the town at which she spent the night After dusk when she was likely to end the day s drive in the first sizable place he hid his bug in an alley and like a spy after the papers sneaked into each garage to see if her car was there He would stroll in look about vacuously and pipe to the suspicious night attendant Seen a traveling man named Smith Usually the garage man snarled No I ain t seen nobody named Smith An thing else I can do for you But once he was so unlucky as to find the long missing mister Smith mister Smith was surprised and insistent Milt had to do some quick lying During that interview the cement floor felt very hard under his fidgeting feet and he thought he heard the garage man in the office telephoning Don t think he knows Smith at all I got a hunch he s that auto thief that was through here last summer When Claire did not stop in the first town she reached after twilight but drove on by dark he had to do some perilous galloping to catch up The lights of a Teal are excellent for adornment but they have no relation to illumination They are dependent upon a magneto which is dependent only upon faith Once skittering along by dark he realized that the halted car which he had just passed was the Gomez He thought he heard a shout behind him but in a panic he kept going To the burring motor he groaned Now I probably never will see her again Except that she thinks I m such a pest that I dassn t let her know I m in the same state I sure am one successful lover As a Prince Charming I win the Vanderbilt Cup I m going ahead backwards so fast I ll probably drop off into the Atlantic over the next hill CHAPTER IX THE MAN WITH AGATE EYES When her car had crossed the Missouri River on the swing ferry between Bismarck and Mandan Claire had passed from Middle West to Far West She came out on an upland of virgin prairie so treeless and houseless so divinely dipping so rough of grass that she could imagine buffaloes still roving In a hollow a real prairie schooner was camped and the wandering homestead seekers were cooking dinner beside it From a quilt on the hay in the wagon a baby peeped and Claire s heart leaped Beyond was her first butte its sharp cut sides glittering yellow and she fancied that on it the Sioux scout still sat sentinel erect on his pony the feather bonnet down his back Now she seemed to breathe deeper see farther Again she came from unbroken prairie into wheat country and large towns Her impression of the new land was not merely of sun glaring breadth Sometimes on a cloudy day the wash of wheatlands was as brown and lowering and mysterious as an English moor in the mist It dwarfed the far off houses by its giant enchantment its brooding reaches changed her attitude of brisk gas driven efficiency into a melancholy that was full of hints of old dark beauty Even when the sun came out and the land was brazenly optimistic she saw more than just prosperity In a new home house and barn and windmill square cornered and prosaic plumped down in a field with wheat coming up to the unporticoed door a habitation unshadowed unsheltered unsoftened she found a frank cleanness as though the inhabitants looked squarely out at life unafraid She felt that the keen winds ought to blow away from such a prairie fronting post of civilization all mildew and cowardice all the mummy dust of ancient fears These were not peasants these farmers Nor she learned were they the hicks of humor She could never again encounter without fiery resentment the Broadway peddler s faith that farmers invariably say Waal by heck For she had spent an hour talking to one Dakota farmer genial eyed quiet of speech He had explained the relation of alfalfa to soil chemistry had spoken of his daughter who taught economics in a state university and asked mister Boltwood how turbines were hitched up on liners In fact Claire learned that there may be an almost tolerable state of existence without gardenias or the news about the latest Parisian imagists She dropped suddenly from the vast smooth swelling miles of wheatland into the tortured marvels of the Bad Lands and the road twisted in the shadow of flying buttresses and the terraced tombs of maharajas While she tried to pick her way through a herd of wild arroyo bred cattle she forgot her maneuvering as she was startled by the stabbing scarlet of a column of rock marking the place where for months deep beds of lignite had burned Claire had often given lifts to tramping harvesters and even hoboes along the road had enjoyed the sight of their duffle bags stuck up between the sleek fenders and the hood and their talk about people and crops along the road as they hung on the running board In the country of long hillslopes and sentinel buttes between the Dakota Bad Lands and Miles City she stopped to shout to a man whose plodding heavy back looked fagged Want a ride Sure You bet Usually her guests stepped on the right hand running board beside mister Boltwood and this man was far over on the right side of the road But while she waited he sauntered in front of the car round to her side mounted beside her Before the car had started she was sorry to have invited him He looked her over grinningly almost contemptuously His unabashed eyes were as bright and hard as agates Below them his nose was twisted a little his mouth bent insolently up at one corner and his square long chin bristled Usually too her passengers waited for her to start the conversation and talked at mister Boltwood rather than directly to her But the bristly man spat at her as the car started Going far Ye es some distance Expensive car Why Fraid of getting held up I hadn t thought about it Pack a cannon don t you I don t think I quite understand Cannon Gun Revolver Got a revolver of course W why no She spoke uncomfortably She was aware that his twinkling eyes were on her throat His look made her feel unclean She tried to think of some question which would lead the conversation to the less exclamatory subject of crops They were on a curving shelf road beside a shallow valley The road was one side of a horseshoe ten miles long The unprotected edge of it dropped sharply to fields forty or fifty feet below Prosperous looking wheat down there she said No Not a bit His look seemed to add And you know it unless you re a fool Well I didn t Make Glendive tonight At least that far Say lady how s the chance for borrowin a couple of dollars I was workin for a Finnski back here a ways and he did me dirt holdin out my wages on me till the end of the month Why uh It was Claire not the man who was embarrassed He was snickering Come on don t be a tightwad Swell car poor man with no eats not even a two bits flop for tonight Could yuh loosen up and slip me just a couple bones mister Boltwood intervened He looked as uncomfortable as Claire We ll see It s rather against my principles to give money to an able bodied man like you even though it is a pleasure to give you a ride Sure Don t cost you one red cent and if I could help you get a job though of course Being a stranger out here Seems strange to me though mister Boltwood struggled on that a strong fellow like you should be utterly destitute when I see all these farmers able to have cars Their guest instantly abandoned his attitude of supplication for one of boasting Destitute Who the hell said I was destitute heh He was snarling across Claire at mister Boltwood His wet face was five inches from hers She drew her head as far back as she could She was sure that the man completely appreciated her distaste for his eyes popped with amusement before he roared on I got plenty of money Just cause I m hoofin it I don t want no charity from nobody I could buy out half these Honyockers I don t need none of no man s money He was efficiently working himself into a rage Who you calling destitute All I wanted was an advance till pay day Got a check coming You high tone kid glove Eastern towerists want to watch out who you go calling destitute I bet I make a lot more money than a lot of your four flushin friends Claire wondered if she couldn t stop the car now and tell him to get off But that snapping eye was too vicious Before he got off he would say things scarring vile things that would never heal in her brain Her father was murmuring Let s drop him but she softly lied No His impertinence amuses me She drove on and prayed that he would of himself leave his uncharitable hosts at the next town The man was storming with a very meek ending I m tellin you I can make money anywhere I m a crack machinist Give me two bits for a meal anyway mister Boltwood reached in his change pocket He had no quarter He pulled out a plump bill fold Without looking at the man Claire could vision his eyes glistening and his chops dripping as he stared at the hoard mister Boltwood handed him a dollar bill There take that and let s change the subject said mister Boltwood testily All right boss Say you haven t got a cartwheel instead of this wrapping paper have you I like to feel my money in my pocket No sir I have not All right boss No bad feelin s Then he ignored mister Boltwood His eyes focused on Claire s face To steady himself on the running board he had placed his left hand on the side of the car his right on the back of the seat That right hand slid behind her She could feel its warmth on her back She burst out flaring Kindly do not touch me Gee did I touch you girlie Why that s a shame he drawled his cracked broad lips turning up in a grin An instant later as they skipped round a bend of the long high hung shelf road he pretended to sway dangerously on the running board and deliberately laid his filthy hand on her shoulder Before she could say anything he yelped in mock regret Love o Mike Scuse me lady I almost fell off Quietly seriously Claire said No that wasn t accidental If you touch me again I ll stop the car and ask you to walk Better do it now dolly snapped mister Boltwood The man hooked his left arm about the side post of the open window shield It was a strong arm a firm grip He seized her left wrist with his free hand Though all the while his eyes grotesquely kept their amused sparkle and beside them writhed laughter wrinkles he shouted hoarsely You ll stop hell His hand slid from her wrist to the steering wheel I can drive this boat s well as you can You make one move to stop and I steer her over Blooie Down the bank He did twist the front wheels dangerously near to the outer edge of the shelf road mister Boltwood gazed at the hand on the wheel With a quick breath Claire looked at the side of the road If the car ran off it would shoot down forty feet turning over and over Y you wouldn t dare because you d g go too she panted Well dearuh you just try any monkey business and you ll find out how much I ll gggggggo too I ll start you down the joy slope and jump off savvy Take your foot off that clutch She obeyed Pretty lil feet ain t they cutie Shoes cost about twelve bucks I reckon While a better man than you or old moldy face there has to hit the pike in three dollar brogans Sit down yuh fool This last to mister Boltwood who had stood up swaying with the car and struck at him With a huge arm the man swept mister Boltwood back into the seat but without a word to her father he continued to Claire And keep your hand where it belongs Don t go trying to touch that switch Aw be sensible What would you do if the car did stop I could blackjack you both before this swell elegant vehickle lost momentum savvy I don t want to pay out my good money to a lawyer on a charge of murder Get me Better take it easy and not worry His hand was constantly on the wheel He had driven cars before He was steering as much as she When I get you up the road a piece I m going to drive all the cute lil boys and girls up a side trail and take all of papa s gosh what a wad in the cunnin potet book and I guess we ll kiss lil daughter and drive on a wavin our hand politely and let you suckers walk to the next burg You wouldn t dare You wouldn t dare Dare Huh Don t make the driver laugh I ll get help Yep Sure Fact there s a car comin toward us Bout a mile away I d make it wouldn t you Well dollface if you make one peep over the bank you go both of you dead as a couplin pin Smeared all over those rocks Get me And me I ll be sorry the regrettable accident was so naughty and went and happened and I just got off in time meself And I ll pinch papa s poke while I m helping get out the bodies Till now she hadn t believed it But she dared not glance at the approaching car It was their interesting guest who steered the Gomez past the other and he ran rather too near the edge of the road so that she looked over down Beaming he went on I d pull the rough stuff right here instead of wastin my time as a cap n of industry by taking you up to see the scenery in that daisy little gully off the road but the whole world can see us along here the hicks in the valley and anybody that happens to sneak along in a car behind us Shame the way this road curves see too far along it Fact you re giving me a lot of trouble But you ll give me a kiss won t you Gwendolyn He bent down chuckling She could feel his bristly chin touch her cheek She sprang up struck at him He raised his hand from the wheel For a second the car ran without control He jabbed her back into the seat with his elbow Don t try any more monkey shines if you know what s good for you he said quite peacefully as he resumed steering She was in a haze conscious only of her father s hand fondling hers She heard a quick pit pit pit pit behind them Car going to pass She d have to let it go by She d concentrate on finding something she could Then Hello folks Having a picnic Who s your little friend in the rompers sang out a voice beside them It was Milt Daggett the Milt who must be scores of miles ahead His bug had caught up with them was running even with them on the broad road CHAPTER X THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE HILLSIDE ROAD So unexpectedly so genially that Claire wondered if he realized what was happening Milt chuckled to the tough on the running board as the two cars ran side by side Bound for some place brother The unwelcome guest looked puzzled For the first time his china eyes ceased twinkling and he answered dubiously Just gettin a lift He sped up the car with the hand throttle Milt accelerated equally Claire roused wanted to shout She was palsied afraid that Milt would leave them The last time she had seen him she had suggested that leaving them would be a favor Her guest growled at her the words coming through a slit at the corner of his rowdy mouth Sit still or I ll run you over Milt innocently babbled on Better come ride with me bo More room in this here handsome coupelet Then was the rough relieved in his uneasy tender little heart and his eyes flickered again as he shouted back not looking at Milt Thanks bub I ll stick by me friends Oh no can t lose pleasure of your company I like your looks You re a bloomin little island way off on the dim silver skyline Claire knitted her brows She had not seen Milt s rhetoric You re an island of Hesperyds or Hesperides Accent on the bezuzus Oh yes moondream I think you better come Haven t decided Milt s tone was bland whether to kill you or just have you pinched Miss Boltwood Switch off your power If she does the tough shouted I ll run em off the bank No you won t sweetheart cause why Cause what ll I do to you afterwards You won t do nothin Jack cause I d gouge your eyes out Why lovesoul d you suppose I d be talking up as brash as this to a bid stwong man like oo if I didn t have a gun handy Yuh I guess so lil sunbeam And before you could shoot I d crowd your tin liz into the bank and jam right into it I may get killed but you won t even be a grease spot He was turning the Gomez from its straight course forcing Milt s bug toward the high bank of earth which walled in the road on the left While Claire was very sick with fear then more sick with contempt Milt squealed You win And he had dropped back The Gomez was going on alone There was only one thing more for Claire to jump And that meant death The tough was storming Your friend s a crack shot with his mouth The thin pit pit pit was coming again She looked back She saw Milt s bug snap forward so fast that on a bump its light wheels were in the air She saw Milt standing on the right side of the bug holding the wheel with one hand and the other hand firm grim broad knuckled hand outstretched toward the tough then snatching at his collar The tough s grip was torn from the steering wheel He was yanked from the running board He crunched down on the road She seized the wheel She drove on at sixty miles an hour She had gone a good mile before she got control of her fear and halted She saw Milt turn his little car as though it were a prancing bronco It seemed to paw the air with its front wheels He shot back pursuing the late guest The man ran bobbing along the road At this distance he was no longer formidable but a comic jerking rabbity figure humping himself over the back track As the bug whirled down on him the tough was to be seen throwing up his hands leaping from the high bank Milt turned again and came toward them but slowly and after he had drawn up even and switched off the engine he snatched off his violent plaid cap and looked apologetic Sorry I had to kid him along I was afraid he really would drive you off the bank He was a bad actor And he was right he could have licked me Thought maybe I could jolly him into getting off and have him pinched next town But you had a gun a revolver didn t you lad panted mister Boltwood Um wellllll I ve got a shotgun It wouldn t take me more n five or ten minutes to dig it out and put it together And there s some shells They may be all right Haven t looked at em since last fall They didn t get so awful damp then But suppose he d had a revolver himself wailed Claire Gee you know I thought he probably did have one I was scared blue I had a wrench to throw at him though confided Milt How did you know we needed you Why back there couple miles behind you maybe I saw your father get up and try to wrestle him so I suspected there was kind of a disagreement Say Miss Boltwood you know when you spoke to me way back there I hadn t meant to butt in Honest I thought maybe as we were going Oh I know the same way you wouldn t mind my trailing if I didn t sit in too often and I thought maybe I could help you if Oh I know I m so ashamed So bitterly ashamed I just meant Will you forgive me You were so good taking care of us Oh sure that s all right I fancy you do know how grateful father and I are that you were behind us this time Wasn t it a lucky accident that we d slipped past you some place Yes dryly quite an accident Well I ll skip on ahead again May run into you again before we hit Seattle Going to take the run through Yellowstone Park Yes but began Claire Her father interrupted Uh mister uh Daggett was it I wonder if you won t stay a little closer to us hereafter I was getting rather a good change out of the trip but I m afraid that now If it wouldn t be an insult I d beg you to consider staying with us for a consideration uh you know remuneration and you could Thanks uh thank you sir but I wouldn t like to do it You see it s kind of my vacation If I ve done anything I m tickled But perhaps mister Boltwood ardently begged the young man recently so abysmally unimportant perhaps you would consent to being my guest when you cared to say at hotels in the Park Fraid I couldn t I m kind of a lone wolf Please Pretty please besought Claire Her smile was appealing her eyes on his Milt bit his knuckles He looked weak But he persisted No you ll get over this scrap with our friend By the way I ll put the deputy onto him in the next town He ll never get out of the county When you forget him Oh no you can go on fine You re a good steady driver and the road s perfectly safe if you give people the once over before you pick em up Picking up badmen is no more dangerous here than it would be in New York Fact there s lot more hold ups in any city than in the wildest country I don t think you showed such awfully good taste in asking Terrible Tim the two gun man right into the parlor Gee please don t do it again Please No meekly I was an idiot I ll be good next time But won t you stay somewhere near us I d like to but I got to chase on Don t want to wear out the welcome on the doormat and I m due in Seattle and Say Miss Boltwood He swung out of the bug cranked up climbed back went awkwardly on I read those books you gave me They re slick mean to say interesting Where that young fellow in Youth s Encounter wanted to be a bishop and a soldier and everything Just like me except Schoenstrom is different from London some ways I always wanted to be a brakie and then a yeggman But I wasn t bright enough for either I just became a garage man And I Some day I m going to stop using slang But it ll take an operation He was streaking down the road and Claire was sobbing Oh the lamb the darling thing Fretting about his slang when he wasn t afraid in that horrible nightmare If we could just do something for him Don t you worry about him dolly He s a very energetic chap And Uh Mightn t we drive on a little farther perhaps I confess that the thought of our recent guest still in this vicinity Yes and Oh I m shameless If Mohammed Milton won t stay with our car mountain we re going to tag after him But when she reached the next hill with its far shining outlook there was no Milt and no Teal bug on the road ahead CHAPTER XI SAGEBRUSH TOURISTS OF THE GREAT HIGHWAY She had rested for two days in Miles City had seen the horse market with horse wranglers in chaps had taken dinner with army people at Fort Keogh once the bulwark against the Sioux now nodding over the dry grass on its parade ground By the Yellowstone River past the Crow reservation Claire had driven on through the Real West along the Great Highway The Red Trail and the Yellowstone Trail had joined now and she was one of the new Canterbury Pilgrims Even mister Boltwood caught the trick of looking for licenses and cried There s a Connecticut car To the Easterner a drive from New York to Cape Cod over asphalt is viewed as heroic but here were cars that had casually started on thousand mile vacations She kept pace not only with large cars touring from saint Louis or Detroit to Glacier Park and Yellowstone but also she found herself companionable with families of workmen headed for a new town and a new job and driving because a flivver bought second hand and soon to be sold again was cheaper than trains Sagebrush Tourists these camping adventurers were called Claire became used to small cars with curtain lights broken bearing wash boilers or refrigerators on the back pasteboard suitcases lashed by rope to the running board frying pans and canvas water bottles dangling from top rods And once baby s personal laundry was seen flapping on a line across a tonneau In each car was what looked like the crowd at a large farm auction grandfather father mother a couple of sons and two or three daughters at least one baby in the arms of each grown up all jammed into two seats already filled with trunks and baby carriages And they were happy incredibly happier than the smart people being conveyed in a bored way behind chauffeurs The Sagebrush Tourists made camp covered the hood with a quilt from which the cotton was oozing brought out the wash boiler did a washing had dinner sang about the fire granther and the youngest baby gamboling together while the limousinvalids insulated from life by plate glass preserved by their steady forty an hour from the commonness of seeing anything along the road looked out at the campers for a second sniffed rolled on wearily wondering whether they would find a good hotel that night and why the deuce they hadn t come by train If Claire Boltwood had been protected by Jeff Saxton or by a chauffeur she too would probably have marveled at cars gray with dust the unshaved men in fleece lined duck coats and the women wind burnt beneath the boudoir caps they wore as motoring bonnets But Claire knew now that filling grease cups does not tend to delicacy of hands that when you wash with a cake of petrified pink soap and half a pitcher of cold hard water you never quite get the stain off you merely get through the dust stratum to the Laurentian grease formation and mutter a nice clean grease doesn t hurt food and go sleepily down to dinner She saw a dozen camping devices unknown to the East trailers which by day bobbed along behind the car like coffins on two wheels but at night opened into tents with beds an ice box a table tents covering a bed whose head rested on the running board beds made up in the car with the cushions as mattresses The Great Transcontinental Highway was colored not by motors alone It is true that the Old West of the stories is almost gone that Billings Miles City Bismarck are more given to Doric banks than to gambling hells But still are there hints of frontier days Still trudge the prairie schooners cowpunchers in chaps still stand at the doors of log cabins when they are tired of playing the automatic piano and blanket Indians Blackfeet and Crows stare at five story buildings when they are not driving modern reapers on their farms They all waved to Claire Telephone linemen lolling with pipes and climber strapped legs in big trucks sang out to her traction engine crews shouted and these she found to be her own people Only once did she lose contentment when on the observation platform of a train bound for Seattle she saw a Britisher in flannels and a monocle headed perhaps for the Orient As the train slipped silkenly away the Gomez seemed slow and clumsy and the strain of driving intolerable And that Britisher must be charming Then a lonely tight haired woman in the doorway of a tar paper shack waved to her and in that wistful gesture Claire found friendship And sometimes in the desert of yet unbroken land she paused by the Great Highway and forgot the passion to keep going She sat on a rock by a river so muddy that it was like yellow milk The only trees were a bunch of cottonwoods untidily scattering shreds of cotton and the only other vegetation left in the dead world was dusty green sagebrush with lumps of gray yet pregnant earth between or a few exquisite green and white flashes of the herb called Snow on the Mountain The inhabitants were jackrabbits or American magpies in sharp black and white livery forever trying to balance their huge tails against the wind and yelling in low magpie their opinion of tourists She did not desire gardens then nor the pettiness of plump terraced hills She was in the Real West and it was hers since she had won to it by her own plodding Her soul if she hadn t had one it would immediately have been provided by special arrangement the moment she sat there sailed with the hawks in the high thin air and when it came down it sang hallelujahs because the sagebrush fragrance was more healing than piney woods because the sharp bitten edges of the buttes were coral and gold and basalt and turquoise and because a real person one Milt Daggett though she would never see him again had found her worthy of worship She did not often think of Milt she did not know whether he was ahead of her or had again dropped behind When she did recall him it was with respect quite different from the titillation that dancing men had sometimes aroused or the impression of manicured agreeableness and efficiency which Jeff Saxton carried about She always supplicated the mythical Milt in moments of tight driving Driving just the actual getting on was her purpose in life and the routine of driving was her order of the day Morning freshness rolling up as many miles as possible before lunch that she might loaf afterward The invariable two P M discovery that her eyes ached and the donning of huge amber glasses which gave to her lithe smartness a counterfeit scholarliness Toward night the quarter hour of level sun glare which prevented her seeing the road Dusk and the discovery of how much light there was after all once she remembered to take off her glasses The worst quarter hour when though the roads were an amethyst rich to the artist they were also a murkiness exasperating to the driver yet still too light to be thrown into relief by the lamps The mystic moment when night clicked tight and the lamps made a fan of gold and Claire and her father settled down to plodding content and no longer had to take the trouble of admiring the scenery The morning out of Billings she wondered why a low cloud so persistently held its shape and realized that it was a far off mountain her first sight of the Rockies Then she cried out and wished for Milt to share her exultation Rather earnestly she said to mister Boltwood The mountains must be so wonderful to mister Daggett after spending his life in a cornfield Poor Milt I hope I don t think you need to worry about that young man I fancy he s quite able to run about by himself as jolly as a sand dog And Of course I m extremely grateful to him for his daily rescue of us from the jaws of death but he was right if he had stayed with us it would have been inconvenient to keep considering him He isn t accustomed to the comedy of manners He ought to be He d enjoy it so He s the real American He has imagination and adaptability It s a shame all the petits fours and Bach recitals wasted on Jeff Saxton when a Milt Dag Yes yes quite so No honest The dear honey lamb so ingenious and really rather good looking But so lonely and gregarious like a little woolly dog that begs you to come and play and I slapped him when he patted his paws and gamboled It was horrible I ll never forgive myself Making him drive on ahead in that nasty patronizing way I feel as if we d spoiled his holiday I wonder if he had intended to make the Yellowstone Park trip He didn t Yes yes Let s forget the young man Look How very curious They were crossing a high bridge over a railroad track along which a circus train was bending mister Boltwood offered judicious remarks upon the migratory habits of circuses and the vision of the Galahad of the Teal bug was thoroughly befogged by parental observations till Claire returned from youthful romance to being a sensible Boltwood and decided that after all Milt was not a lord of the sky painted mountains Before they bent south at Livingston Claire had her first mountain driving and once she had to ford a stream putting the car at it watching the water curve up in a lovely silver veil She felt that she was conquering the hills as she had the prairies She pulled up on a plateau to look at her battery She noted the edge of a brake band peeping beyond the drum in a ragged line of fabric and copper wire Then she knew that she didn t know enough to conquer Do you suppose it s dangerous she asked her father who said a lot of comforting things that didn t mean anything She thought of Milt She stopped a passing car The driver guessed that the brake band was all gone and that it would be dangerous to continue with it along mountain roads Claire dustily tramped two miles to a ranch house and telephoned to the nearest garage in a town called Saddle Back Whenever a motorist has delirium he mutters those lamentable words Telephoned to the nearest garage She had to wait a tedious hour before she saw a flivver rattling up with the garage man who wasn t a man at all but a fourteen year old boy He snorted Rats you didn t need to send for me Could have made it perfectly safe Come on Never has the greatest boy pianist received such awe as Claire gave to this contemptuous young god with grease on his peachy cheeks She did come on But she rather hoped that she was in great danger It was humiliating to telephone to a garage for nothing When she came into the gas smelling garage in Saddle Back she said appealingly to the man in charge a serious lip puffing person of forty five Was it safe to come in with the brake band like that No Pretty risky Wa n t it Mike The Mike to whom he turned for authority was the same fourteen year old boy He snapped Heh That Naw Put in new band Get busy Bring me the jack Hustle up uncle While the older man stood about and vainly tried to impress people who came in and asked questions which invariably had to be referred to his repair boy the precocious expert stripped the wheel down to something that looked to Claire distressingly like an empty milk pan Then the boy didn t seem to know exactly what to do He scratched his ear a good deal and thought deeply The older man could only scratch So for two hours Claire and her father experienced that most distressing of motor experiences waiting while the afternoon that would have been so good for driving went by them Every fifteen minutes they came in from sitting on a dry goods box in front of the garage and never did the repair appear to be any farther along The boy seemed to be giving all his time to getting the wrong wrench and scolding the older man for having hidden the right one When she had left Brooklyn Heights Claire had not expected to have such authoritative knowledge of the Kalifornia Kandy Kitchen Saddle Back Montana across from Tubbs Garage that she could tell whether they were selling more Atharva Cigarettes or Polutropons She prowled about the garage till she knew every pool of dripped water in the tin pail of soft soap in the iron sink She was worried by an overheard remark of the boy wonder Gosh we haven t any more of that decent brake lining Have to use this piece of mush But when the car was actually done nothing like a dubious brake could have kept her from the glory of starting The first miles seemed miracles of ease and speed She came through the mountains into Livingston Kicking his heels on a fence near town and fondling a gray cat sat Milt Daggett and he yelped at her with earnestness and much noise CHAPTER XII THE WONDERS OF NATURE WITH ALL MODERN IMPROVEMENTS Hello said Milt Hel lo said Claire How dee do said mister Boltwood 
3691-178109-0001	train-other-500	This is so nice Where s your car I hope nothing s happened glowed Claire No It s back here from the road a piece Camp there tonight Reason I stopped Struck me you ve never done any mountain driving
3691-178109-0002	train-other-500	and there s some pretty good climbs in the Park slick road but we go up to almost nine thousand feet And cold mornings Thought I d tip you off to some driving tricks if you d like me to
none	none	 Oh of course Very grateful 
3691-178109-0003	train-other-500	Then I ll tag after you tomorrow and speak my piece So jolly you re going through the Park Yes thought might as well What the guide books call Wonders of Nature
none	none	 Only wonder of nature I ever saw in Schoenstrom was my friend Mac trying to think he was soused after a case of near beer 
3691-178109-0004	train-other-500	Well See you tomorrow Not once had he smiled His tone had been impersonal He vaulted the fence and tramped away When they drove out of town in the morning they found Milt waiting by the road and he followed them till noon
3691-178109-0005	train-other-500	By urgent request he shared a lunch and lectured upon going down long grades in first or second speed to save brakes upon the use of the retarded spark and the slipped clutch in climbing
3691-178109-0006	train-other-500	His bug was beside the Gomez in the line up at the Park gate when the United States Army came to seal one s firearms and to inquire on which mountain one intended to be killed by defective brakes He was just behind her all the climb up to Mammoth Hot Springs
3691-178109-0007	train-other-500	When she paused for water to cool the boiling radiator the bug panted up and with the first grin she had seen on his face since Dakota Milt chuckled
3691-178109-0008	train-other-500	The Teal is a grand car for mountains Aside from overheating bum lights thin upholstery faulty ignition tissue paper brake bands and this here special aviation engine specially built for a bumble bee it s what the catalogues call a powerful brute
3691-178109-0009	train-other-500	Claire and her father stayed at the chain of hotels through the Park Milt was always near them but not at the hotels He patronized one of the chains of permanent camps The Boltwoods invited him to dinner at one hotel but he refused and
3691-178109-0010	train-other-500	Because he was afraid that Claire would find him intrusive Milt was grave in her presence He couldn t respond either to her enthusiasm about canyon and colored pool or to her rage about the tourists who she alleged
3691-178109-0011	train-other-500	preferred freak museum pieces to plain beauty who never admired a view unless it was labeled by a signpost and megaphoned by a guide as something they ought to admire and tell the Folks Back Home about
none	none	 When she tried to express this social rage to Milt he merely answered uneasily 
3691-178109-0012	train-other-500	Yes I guess there s something to that She was he pondered so darn particular
none	none	 How could he ever figure out what he ought to do 
3691-178109-0013	train-other-500	No thanks much obliged but guessed he d better not accept her invitation to dinner
none	none	 Darn sorry couldn t come but 
3691-178109-0014	train-other-500	Had promised a fellow down at the camp to have chow with him If in this Milt was veracious he was rather fickle to his newly discovered friend for while Claire was finishing dinner a solemn young man was watching her through a window
3691-178109-0015	train-other-500	She was at a table for six She was listening to a man of thirty in riding breeches a stock and a pointed nose who bowed to her every time he spoke
3691-178109-0016	train-other-500	which was so frequently that his dining gave the impression of a man eating grape fruit on a merry go round Back in Schoenstrom fortified by Mac and the bunch at the Old Home Lunch
none	none	 Milt would have called the man a dude and though less noisily than the others would have yelped 
3691-178109-0017	train-other-500	Get onto Percy s beer bottle pants What s he got his neck bandaged for Bet he s got a boil But now Milt yearned He does look swell
none	none	 Wish I could get away with those things 
3691-178109-0018	train-other-500	Wouldn t I look like a fool with my knees buttoned up though And there s two other fellows in dress suits Wouldn t mind those so much Gee it must be awful where you ve got so many suits of trick clothes you don t know which one to wear That fellow and Claire are talking pretty swift
3691-178109-0019	train-other-500	He doesn t need any piston rings that lad Wonder wonder what they re talking about Music I guess and books and pictures and scenery He s saying that no tongue or pen can describe the glories of the Park and then he s trying to describe em
3691-178109-0020	train-other-500	And maybe they know the same folks in New York Lord how I d be out of it I wish Milt made a toothpick out of a match decided that toothpicks were inelegant in his tragic mood and longed
3691-178109-0021	train-other-500	Never did see her among her own kind of folks till now I wish I could jabber about music and stuff I ll learn it I will I can I picked up autos in three months I Milt you re a dub
3691-178109-0022	train-other-500	I wonder can they be talking French maybe or Wop or something I could get onto the sedan styles in highbrow talk as long as it was in American I could probably spring linen collar stuff about Really a delightful book so full of delightful characters
3691-178109-0023	train-other-500	if I stuck by the rhetoric books long enough But once they begin the parlez vous oui oui I m a gone goose Still by golly didn t I pick up Dutch German like a mice Back off son You did not
none	none	 You can talk Plattdeutsch something grand as long as you keep the verbs and nouns in American 
3691-178109-0024	train-other-500	You got a nice character Milt but you haven t got any parts of speech Now look at Percy Taking a bath in a finger bowl I never could pull that finger bowl stuff
3691-178109-0025	train-other-500	pinning your ears back and jiu jitsing the fried chicken and then doing a high dive into a little dish that ain t that isn t either a wash bowl or real good lemonade
none	none	 He s a perfect lady Percy is Dabs his mouth with his napkin like a watchmaker tinkering the carburetor in a wrist watch 
3691-178109-0026	train-other-500	Lookit him bow and scrape asking her something
none	none	 Rats he s going out in the lobby with her 
3691-178109-0027	train-other-500	Walks like a cat on a wet ash pile But Oh thunder he s all right Neat I never could mingle with that bunch I d be web footed and butter fingered And he seems to know all that bunch
3691-178109-0028	train-other-500	bows to every maiden aunt in the shop Now if I was following her I d never see anybody but her rest of the folks could all bob their heads silly and I d never see one blame thing except that funny little soft spot at the back of her neck Nope
none	none	 you re kind to your cat Milt but you weren t cut out to be no parlor organ duet 
3691-178109-0029	train-other-500	This same meditative young man might have been discovered walking past the porch of the hotel his hands in his pockets his eyes presumably on the stars certainly he gave no signs of watching Claire and the man in riding breeches as they leaned over the rail
none	none	 looked at mountain tops filmy in starlight while in the cologne atomized mode 
3691-178109-0030	train-other-500	Breeches quoted Ah tis far heaven my awed heart seeks When I behold those mighty peaks Milt could hear him commenting Doesn t that just get the feeling of the great open Miss Boltwood
3691-178109-0031	train-other-500	Milt did not catch her answer Himself he grunted
none	none	 I never could get much het up about this poetry that s full of Ah s and tises Claire must have seen Milt just after he had sauntered past She cried 
3691-178109-0032	train-other-500	Oh mister Daggett Just a moment She left Breeches ran down to Milt He was frightened Was he going to get what he deserved for eavesdropping She was almost whispering Save me from our friend up on the porch she implored
3691-178109-0033	train-other-500	He couldn t believe it But he took a chance Won t you have a little walk he roared So nice of you just a little way perhaps she sang out They were silent till he got up the nerve to admire
none	none	 Glad you found some people you knew in the hotel 
3691-178109-0034	train-other-500	But I didn t Oh I thought your friend in the riding pants was chummy So did I She rather snorted Well he s a nice looking lad I did admire those pants I never could wear anything like that I should hope not at dinner
3691-178109-0035	train-other-500	The creepy jack ass I don t believe he s ever been on a horse in his life He thinks riding breeches are the Oh that s it Breeches not pants last word in smartness Overdressing is just ten degrees worse than underdressing
3691-178109-0036	train-other-500	Oh I don t know Take this sloppy old blue suit of mine It s perfectly nice and simple and quite well cut You probably had a clever tailor
none	none	 I had He lives in Chicago or New York I believe 
3691-178109-0037	train-other-500	Really How did he come to Schoenstrom Never been there This tailor is a busy boy He fitted about eleventeen thousand people last year I see Ready mades Cheer up That s where Henry B Boltwood gets most of his clothes
none	none	 mister Daggett if ever I catch you in the Aren t I beautiful frame of mind of our friend back on the porch 
3691-178109-0038	train-other-500	I ll give up my trip to struggle for your soul He seemed to have soul in large chunks He seemed to talk pretty painlessly I had a hunch you and he were discussing sculpture anyway Maybe Rodin
none	none	 What do you know about Rodin 
3691-178109-0039	train-other-500	Articles in the magazines Same place you learned about him But Milt did not sound rude He said it chucklingly You re perfectly right And we ve probably read the very same articles Well our friend back there said to me at dinner
3691-178109-0040	train-other-500	It must be dreadful for you to have to encounter so many common people along the road I said It is in the most insulting tone I could and he just rolled his eyes and hadn t an idea I meant him
3691-178109-0041	train-other-500	Then he slickered his hair at me and mooed Is it not wonderful to see all these strange manifestations of the secrets of Nature and I said Is it and he went on
none	none	 One feels that if one could but meet a sympathetic lady here one s cup of rejoicing in untrammeled nature 
3691-178109-0042	train-other-500	Honest Milt mister Daggett I mean he did talk like that Been reading books by optimistic lady authors
none	none	 And one looked at me one did as if one would be willing to hold my hand if I let one He invited me to come out on the porch and give the double O to handsome mountains as illuminated by terrestrial bodies 
3691-178109-0043	train-other-500	and I felt so weak in the presence of his conceit that I couldn t refuse Then he insisted on introducing me to a woman from my own Brooklyn who condoled with me for having to talk to Western persons while motoring Oh dear God that such people should live
3691-178109-0044	train-other-500	that the sniffy little Claire should once have been permitted to live And then I saw you Through all her tirade they had stood close together her face visibly eager in the glow from the hotel and Milt had grown taller
none	none	 But he responded I m afraid I might have been just as bad I haven t even reached the riding breeches stage in evolution Maybe never will No You won t You ll go right through it By and by when you re so rich that father and I won t be allowed to associate with you you ll wear riding breeches but for riding not as a donation to the beauties of nature Oh I m already rich It shows Waitress down at the camp asked me whose car I was driving through I know what I wanted to say Since you won t be our guest will you be our host I mean as far as welcoming us I think it would be fun for father and me to stop at your camp tomorrow night at the canyon instead of at the hotel Will you guide me to the canyon if I do Oh terribly glad CHAPTER XIII ADVENTURERS BY FIRELIGHT Neither of the Boltwoods had seen the Grand Canyon of the Colorado The Canyon of the Yellowstone was their first revelation of intimidating depth and color gone mad When their car and Milt s had been parked in the palisaded corral back of the camp at which they were to stay they three set out for the canyon s edge chattering and stopped dumb mister Boltwood declined to descend He returned to the camp for a cigar The boy and girl crept down seeming miles of damp steps to an outhanging pinnacle that still was miles of empty airy drop above the river bed Claire had a quaking feeling that this rock pulpit was going to slide She thrust out her hand seized Milt s paw and in its firm warmth found comfort Clinging to its security she followed him by the crawling path to the river below She looked up at columns of crimson and saffron and burning brown up at the matronly falls up at lone pines clinging to jutting rocks that must be already crashing toward her and in the splendor she knew the Panic fear that is the deepest reaction to beauty Milt merely shook his head as he stared up He had neither gossiped nor coyly squeezed her hand as he had guided her She fell to thinking that she preferred this American boy in this American scene to a nimble gentleman saluting the Alps in a dinky green hat with a little feather It was Milt who when they had labored back up again when they had sat smiling at each other with comfortable weariness made her see the canyon not as a freak but as the miraculous work of a stream rolling grains of sand for millions of years till it had cut this Jovian intaglio He seemed to have read whether in books or in paragraphs in mechanical magazines a good deal about geology He made it real Not that she paid much attention to what he actually said She was too busy thinking of the fact that he should say it at all Not condescendingly but very companionably she accompanied Milt in the exploration of their camp for the night the big dining tent the city of individual bedroom tents canvas sided and wooden floored each with a tiny stove for the cold mornings of these high altitudes She was awed that evening by hearing her waitress discussing the novels of Ibanez Jeff Saxton knew the names of at least six Russian novelists but Jeff was not highly authoritative regarding Spanish literature I suppose she s a school teacher working here in vacation Claire whispered to Milt beside her at the long busy scenically conversational table Our waitress Well sort of I understand she s professor of literature in some college said Milt in a matter of fact way And he didn t at all see the sequence when she went on There is an America I m glad I ve found it The camp s evening bonfire was made of logs on end about a stake of iron As the logs blazed up the guests on the circle of benches crooned Suwanee River and Old Black Joe and Claire crooned with them She had been afraid that her father would be bored but she saw that above his carefully tended cigar he was dreaming She wondered if there had been a time when he had hummed old songs The fire sank to coals The crowd wandered off to their tents mister Boltwood followed them after an apologetic Good night Don t stay up too late With a scattering of only half a dozen people on the benches this huge circle seemed deserted and Claire and Milt leaning forward chins on hands were alone by their own campfire among the mountains The stars stooped down to the hills the pines were a wall of blackness a coyote yammered to point the stillness and the mighty pile of coals gave a warmth luxurious in the creeping mountain chill The silence of large places awes the brisk intruder and Claire s voice was unconsciously lowered as she begged Tell me something about yourself mister Daggett I don t really know anything at all Oh you wouldn t be interested Just Schoenstrom But just Schoenstrom might be extremely interesting But honest you d think I was edging in on you I know what you are thinking The time I suggested way back there in Dakota that you were sticking too close You ve never got over it I ve tried to make up for it but I really don t blame you I was horrid I deserve being beaten But you do keep on punishing ra Punishing Lord I didn t mean to No Honest It was nothing You were right Looked as though I was inviting myself But oh pleassssse Miss Boltwood don t ever think for a sec that I meant to be a grouch Then do tell me Who is this Milton Daggett that you know so much better than I ever can Well Milt crossed his knees caught his chin in his hand I don t know as I really do know him so well I thought I did I was onto his evil ways He was the son of the pioneer doctor Maine folks Really My mother came from Maine Milt did not try to find out that they were cousins He went on This kid Milt went to high school in saint Cloud town twenty times as big as Schoenstrom but he drifted back because his dad was old and needed him after his mother s death You have no brothers or sisters No Nobody Cept Lady Vere de Vere which animal she is going to get cuffed if she chews up any more of my overcoat out in my tent tonight Well this kid worked round machinery mostly and got interested in cars and started a garage Wee that was an awful shop first one I had In Rauskukle s barn Six wrenches and a screwdriver and a one lung pump And I didn t know a roller bearing from three point suspension But Well anyway he worked along and built a regular garage and paid off practically all the mortgage on it I remember stopping at a garage in Schoenstrom I m almost sure it was for something I seem to remember it was a good place Do you own it Really Ye es what there is of it But there s a great deal of it It s efficient You ve done your job That s more than most high born aides de camp could say Honestly Well I don t know Who did you play with in Schoenstrom Oh I wish I d noticed that town But I couldn t tell then that What uh which girl did you fall in love with None Honest None Not one Never fell in love You re unfortunate I have lots of times I remember quite enjoying being kissed once at a dance When he answered his voice was strange I suppose you re engaged to somebody No And I don t know that I shall be Once I thought I liked a man rather He has nice eyes and the most correct spectacles and he is polite to his mother at breakfast and his name is Jeff and he will undoubtedly be worth five or six hundred thousand dollars some day and his opinions on George Moore and commercial paper are equally sound and unoriginal Oh I ought not to speak of him and I certainly ought not to be spiteful I m not at all reticent and ladylike am I But Somehow I can t see him out here against a mountain of jagged rock Only you won t always be out here against mountains Some day you ll be back in where is it in New York State I confess it s Brooklyn but not what you d mean by Brooklyn Your remark shows you to have subtlety I must remember that mustn t I I won t always be driving through this big land But Will I get all fussy and ribbon tied again when I go back No You won t You drive like a man What has that It has a lot to do with it A garage man can trail along behind another car and figger out figure out just about what kind of a person the driver is from the way he handles his boat Now you bite into the job You drive pretty neat neatly You don t either scoot too far out of the road in passing a car or take corners too wide You won t be fussy But still I suppose you ll be glad to be back among your own folks and you ll forget the wild Milt that tagged along Milt or mister Daggett no Milt I shall never in my oldest grayest year in a ducky cap by the fireplace forget the half second when your hand came flashing along and caught that man on the running board But it wasn t just that melodrama If that hadn t happened something else would have to symbolize you It s that you oh you took me in a stranger and watched over me and taught me the customs of the country and were never impatient No I shan t forget that neither of the Boltwoods will In the rose haze of firelight he straightened up and stared at her but he settled into shyness again as she added Perhaps others would have done the same thing I don t know If they had I should have remembered them too But it happened that it was you and I uh my father and I will always be grateful We both hope we may see you in Seattle What are you planning to do there What is your ambition Or is that a rude question Why uh What I mean I mean how did you happen to want to go there with a garage at home You still control it Oh yes Left my mechanic in charge Why I just kind of decided suddenly I guess it was what they call an inspiration Always wanted a long trip anyway and I thought maybe in Seattle I could hook up with something a little peppier than Schoenstrom Maybe something in Alaska Always wished I were a mechanical or civil engineer so Then why don t you become one You re young How old are you Twenty five We re both children compared with Je compared with some men who are my friends You re quite young enough to go to engineering school And take some academic courses on the side English so on Why don t you Have you ever thought of it N no I hadn t thought of doing it but All right I will In Seattle B lieve the University of Washington is there You mean it Yes I do You re the boss That s that s flattering but Do you always make up your mind as quickly as this When the boss gives orders He smiled and she smiled back but this time it was she who was embarrassed You re rather overwhelming You change your life if you really do mean it because a jeune fille from Brooklyn is so impertinent from her Olympian height of finishing school learning as to suggest that you do so I don t know what a jeune fille is but I do know He sprang up He did not look at her He paraded back and forth three steps to the right three to the left his hands in his pockets his voice impersonal I know you re the finest person I ever met You re the kind I knew there must be people like you because I knew the Joneses They re the only friends I ve got that have oh I suppose it s what they call culture In a long monologue uninterrupted by Claire he told of his affection for the Schoenstrom prof and his wife The practical slangy Milt of the garage was lost in the enthusiastic undergraduate adoring his instructor in the university that exists as veritably in a teacher s or a doctor s sitting room in every Schoenstrom as it does in certain lugubrious stone hulks recognized by a state legislature as magically empowered to paste on sacred labels lettered Bachelor of Arts He broke from his revelations to plump down on the bench beside her to slap his palm with his fist and sigh Lord I ve been gassing on Guess I bored you Oh please Milt please I see it all so It must have been wonderful the evening when missus Jones read Noyes s Highwayman aloud Tell me long before that were you terribly lonely as a little boy Now Milt had not been a terribly lonely little boy He had been a leader in a gang devoted to fighting swimming pickerel spearing beggie stealing and catching rides on freights But he believed that he was accurately presenting every afternoon of his childhood as he mused Yes I guess I was pretty much I remember I used to sit on dad s doorstep all those long sleepy summer afternoons and I d think Aw geeeeee I wisht I had somebody to play with I always wanted to make b lieve Robin Hood but none of the other kids so many of them were German they didn t know about Robin Hood so I used to scout off alone If I could only have been there to be Maid Marian for you We d have learned archery Lonely little boy on the doorstep Her fingers just touched his sleeve In her gesture the ember light caught the crystal of her wrist watch She stooped to peer at it and her pitying tenderness broke off in an agitated Heavings Is it that late To bed Good night Milt Good night Cl Miss Boltwood No Claire of course I m not normally a first name snatcher but I do seem to have fallen into saying Milt Night As she undressed in her tent Claire reflected He won t take advantage of my being friendly will he Only thing is I sha n t dare to look at Henry B when Milt calls me Claire in that sedate Brooklyn Heights presence The dear lamb Lonely afternoons CHAPTER XIV THE BEAST OF THE CORRAL They met in the frost shimmering mountain morning on their way to the corral to get their cars ready before breakfast They were shy hence they were boisterous and tremendously unreferential to campfire confidences and informative about distilled water for batteries and the price of gas in the Park On Milt s shoulder rode Vere de Vere who in her original way relieved one pause by observing Mrwr They came in through the corral gate before any of the other motor tourists had appeared and they stupidly halted to watch a bear a large black adipose and extremely unchained bear stalk along the line of cars sniff cock an ear at the Gomez lumber up on its running board and bundle into the seat His stern filled the space between side and top and he was to be heard snuffing Oh Look Milt Left box of candy on seat Oh please drive him away Me Drive that Frighten him away Aren t animals afraid human eye Not in this park Guns forbidden Animals protected by U S Army President Congress Supreme Court Department of Interior Monroe Doctrine W C T U But I ll try cautiously Don t you want me think you re hero Ye es providin I don t have to go and be one They edged toward the car The bear flapped his hind legs looked out at the intruders said Oofflll and returned to the candy Shoo Milt answered politely Llooffll From his own bug beside the Gomez Milt got a tool kit and with considerable brilliance as a pitcher he sent a series of wrenches at the agitated stern of the bear They offended the dignity of the ward of the Government He finished the cover and ribbons of the candy box and started for Milt who proceeded with haste toward Claire who was already at the gate Lady Vere de Vere cat of a thousand battles gave one frightful squawl shot from Milt s shoulder and at the bear claws out fur electric The bear carelessly batted once with its paw and the cat sailed into the air The satisfied bear strolled to the fence shinned up it and over Good old Vere That wallop must of darn near stunned her though Milt laughed to Claire as they trotted back into the corral The cat did not move as they came up did not give the gallant Mrwr with which she had saluted Milt on lonely morning after morning of forlorn driving behind the Gomez He picked Vere up She s she s dead he said He was crying Oh Milt Last night you said Vere was all the family you had You have the Boltwoods now She did not touch his hand nor did they speak as they walked soberly to the far side of the corral and buried Lady Vere de Vere At breakfast they talked of the coming day s run from the canyon out of the Park and northward But they had the queer quick casualness of intimates It was at breakfast that her father heard one Milt Daggett address the daughter of the Boltwoods as Claire The father was surprised into clearing his throat and attacking his oatmeal with a zealousness unnatural in a man who regarded breakfast foods as moral rather than interesting While he was lighting a cigar and Claire was paying the bill mister Boltwood stalked Milt cleared his throat all over again and said Nice morning It was the first time the two men had talked unchaperoned by Claire Yes We ought to have a good run sir The sir came hard The historian puts forth a theory that Milt had got it out of fiction We might go up over Mount Washburn Take us up to ten thousand feet Uh you said didn t Miss Boltwood tell me that you are going to Seattle too Yes Friends there no doubt Milt grinned irresistibly Not a friend But I m going to make em I m going to take up engineering and some French I guess at the university there Ah Really Yes Been too limited in my ambition Don t see why I shouldn t get out and build railroads and power plants and roads Siberia Africa all sorts of interesting places Quite right Quite right Uh ah I oh I Have you seen Miss Boltwood I saw Miss Boltwood in the office Oh yes Quite so Uh ah here she is When the Gomez had started mister Boltwood skirmished This young man Do you think you better let him call you by your Christian name Why not I call him Milt mister Daggett is too long a handle to use when a man is constantly rescuing you from the perils of the deep or hoboes or bears or something Oh I haven t told you Poor old Milt his cat was killed Yes yes dolly you may tell me about that in due time but let s stick to this social problem for a moment Do you think you ought to be too intimate with him He s only too self respecting He wouldn t take advantage I m quite aware of that I m not speaking on your behalf but on his I m sure he s a very amiable chap and ambitious In fact Did you know that he has saved up money to attend a university When did he tell you that How long has he been planning I thought that I Just this morning just now Oh I m relieved I don t quite follow you dolly but Where was I Do you realize what a demure tyrant you are If you can drag me from New York to the aboriginal wilds and I did not like that oatmeal what will you do to this innocent I want to protect him You better Because I m going to carve him and paint him and possibly spoil him The creating of a man of one who knows how to handle life is so much more wonderful than creating absurd pictures or statues or stories I ll nag him into completing college He ll learn dignity or perhaps lose his simplicity and be ruined and then I ll marry him off to some nice well bred pink face like Jeff Saxton s pretty cousin who may turn him into a beastly money grubber and I m monkeying with destiny and I ought to be slapped and I realize it and I can t help it and all my latent instinct as a feminine meddler is aroused and golly I almost went off that curve CHAPTER XV THE BLACK DAY OF THE VOYAGE That was the one black day of her voyage black stippled with crimson It began with the bear s invasion of the car resulting in long claw marks across the upholstery the loss of some particularly good candy bought at a Park hotel and genuine grief abiding after the sentimental tragedy of Vere de Vere s death The next act was the ingenious loss of all power of her engine She forgot that before breakfast Milt had filled the oil well for her When she stopped for gasoline and the seller inquired Quart of oil she absently nodded So the cylinders filled with surplus oil the spark plugs were fouled and the engine had the power of a sewing machine She could not make Mount Washburn she could not make even the slopes of the lower road Now she knew the agony of the feeble car in the mountains most shameful and anxious of a driver s dolors the brisk start up the hill the belief that you will keep on going this time the feeling of weariness through all the car the mad shifting of gears the slipping of the clutch and more gas and less gas and wondering whether more gas or less is the better and the appalling knocking when you finally give her a lot too much gas the remembrance when it s too late to retard the spark the safe crawling up to the last sharp pitch just fifteen feet from the summit the car s halting the yelp at your passenger Jump out and push the painful next five feet and the final death of the power just as the front wheels creep up over the pitch Then the anxious putting on of brakes holding the car with both foot brake and emergency lest it run down backward slip off the road The calf of your leg begins to ache from the pressure on the foot brake and with an unsuccessful effort to be courteous you bellow at the passenger who has been standing beside the car looking deprecatory Will you please block the back wheels with a stone hustle up will you All this routine Claire thoroughly learned Always Milt bumbled up said cheerful things and either hauled the Gomez over the pitch by a towline to his bug or getting out pushing on a rear fender till his neck was red and bulgy gave the extra impetus necessary to get the Gomez over Would you mind shoving on that side just a little bit he suggested to mister Boltwood who ceased the elaborate smoking of cigars dusted his hands and gravely obeyed while Claire was awaiting the new captain s command to throw on the power I wish we weren t under so much obligation to this young man said mister Boltwood after one crisis I know but what can we do Don t you suppose we might pay him Henry B Boltwood if you tried to do that I m not sure Your being my parent might save you but even so I think he d probably chase you off the road clear down into that chasm I suppose so Shall we have to entertain him in Seattle Have to My dear parent you can t keep me from it Any of the Seattle friends of Gene Gilson who don t appreciate that straight fine aspiring boy may go Not overdo it you understand But Oh take him to the theater By the way shall we try to climb Mount Rainier before See here my good dolly you stop steering me away from my feeble parental efforts Do you wish to be under obligations Don t mind with Milt He wouldn t charge interest as Jeff Saxton would Milt is oh he s folks Quite true But are we Are you Learning to be Between discussions and not making hills Claire cleaned the spark plugs as they accumulated carbon from the surplus oil or she pretended to help Milt clean them The plugs were always very hot and when you were unscrewing the jacket from the core you always burned your hand and wished you could swear and sometimes you could After noon when they had left the Park and entered Gardiner Milt announced I ve got to stick around a while The key in my steering gear seems to be worn May have to put in a new one Get the stuff at a garage here If you wouldn t mind waiting be awful glad to tag and try to give a few helping hands till the oil cleans itself out I ll just stroll on she said but she drove away as swiftly as she could Her father s worry about obligations disturbed her and she did not wish to seem too troublesome an amateur to Milt She would see him in Livingston and tell him how well she had driven The spark plugs kept clean enough now so that she could command more power but Between the Park and the transcontinental road there are many climbs short but severely steep up shoots like the humps on a scenic railway To tackle them with her uncertain motor was like charging a machine gun nest She spent her nerve force lavishly and after every wild rush to make a climb she had to rest to rub the suddenly aching back of her neck Because she was so tired she did not take the trouble to save her brakes by going down in gear She let the brakes smoke while the river and railroad below rose up at her There was a long drop How long it was she did not guess because it was concealed by a curve at the top She seemed to plane down forever The brakes squealed behind She tried to shift to first but there was a jarring snarl and she could neither get into first nor back into third She was running in neutral the great car coasting while she tried to slow it by jamming down the foot brake The car halted and started on again The brake lining which had been wished on her at Saddle Back was burnt out She had the feeling of the car bursting out from under control ready to leap off the road into a wash She wanted to jump It took all her courage to stay in the seat She got what pressure she could from the remaining band With one hand she kept the accelerating car in the middle of the road with the other she tried to pull the handle of the emergency brake back farther She couldn t She was not strong enough Faster faster rushing at the next curve so that she could scarce steer round it As quietly as she could she demanded of her father Pull back on this brake lever far as you can Take both hands I don t understand Heavens Y don t haft un stand Yank back Yank I tell you Again the car slowed She was able to get into second speed Even that check did not keep the car from darting down at thirty miles an hour which pace to one who desires to saunter down at a dignified rate of eighteen is equivalent in terms of mileage on level ground to seventy an hour with a drunken driver on a foggy evening amid traffic She got the car down and in the midst of a valley of emptiness and quiet she dropped her head on her father s knee and howled I just can t face going down another hill I just can t face it she sobbed No dolly Mustn t We better You re quite right This young Daggett is a very gentlemanly fellow I didn t think his table manners But we ll sit here and regard the flora and fauna till he comes He ll see us through Yes He will Honestly dad She said it with the first touch of hero worship since she had seen an aviator loop loops Isn t he oh effective Aren t you glad he s here to help us instead of somebody like Jeff Saxton We ul you must remember that Geoffrey wouldn t have permitted the brake to burn out He d have foreseen it and have had a branch office with special leased wire located back on that hill ready to do business the instant the market broke Enthusiasm is a nice quality dolly but don t misplace it This lad however trustworthy he may be would scarcely even be allowed to work for a man like Geoffrey Saxton It may be that later with college No He d work for Jeff two hours Then Jeff would give him that You poor fish look and Milt would hit him and stroll out and go to the North Pole or some place and discover an oil well and hire Jeff as his nice efficient general manager And I do wish Milt would hurry though It was dusk before they heard the pit pit pit chuckling down the hill Milt s casual grin changed to bashfulness as Claire ran into the road her arms wide in a lovely gesture of supplication and cried We been waiting for you so long One of my brake bands is burnt out and the other is punk Well well Let s try to figure out something to do She waited reverently while the local prophet sat in his bug stared at the wheels of the Gomez and thought The level floored sagebrush sprinkled hollow had filled with mauve twilight and creeping stilly sounds The knowable world of yellow lights and security was far away Milt was her only means of ever getting back to it Tell you what we might try he speculated I ll hitch on behind you and hold back in going down hill She did not even try to help him while he again cleaned the spark plugs and looked over brakes oil gas water She sat on the running board and it was pleasant to be relieved of responsibility He said nothing at all While he worked he whistled that recent refined ballad I wanta go back to Oregon And sit on the lawn and look at the dawn Oh motheruh dear don t leavuh me here The leaves are so sere in the fallothe year I wanta go back to Oregugon To dearuh old Oregugon They started shouting optimistically to each other lights on trouble seeming over and they stopped after the next descent and pools of tears were in the corners of Claire s eyes The holdback had not succeeded Her big car with its quick increasing momentum had jerked at the bug as though it were a lard can The tow rope had stretched sung snapped and again in fire shot delirium she had gone rocking down hill He drove up beside her got out stood at her elbow His I m a bum inventor We ll try somethin else was so careless that in her nerve twanging exhaustion she wailed Oh don t be so beastly cheerful You don t care a bit In the dusk she could see him straighten and his voice came sharp as he ignored the ever present parental background and retorted Somebody has got to be cheerful Matter fact I worked out the right stunt coming down Like a man in the dentist s chair recovering between bouts she drowsed and ignored the fact that in a few minutes she would again have to reassemble herself become wakeful and calm and go through quite impossible maneuvers of driving Milt was with a hatchet from his camping kit cutting down a large scrub pine He dragged it to the Gomez and hitched it to the back axle The knuckles of the branches would dig into the earth the foliage catch at every pebble There That anchor would hold a truck he shouted It held She went down the next two hills easily But she was through Her forearms and brain were equally numb She appealed to Milt I can t seem to go on any more It s so dark and I m so tired All right No ranch houses anywheres near so we ll camp here if mister Boltwood doesn t mind Claire stirred herself to help him prepare dinner It wasn t much of a dinner to prepare Both cars had let provisions run low They had bacon and petrified ends of a loaf and something like coffee not much like it Scientists may be interested in their discovery that as a substitute for both cream and sugar in beverages strawberry jam is a fallacy For mister Boltwood s bed Milt hauled out the springy seat cushions of both cars The Gomez cushion was three inches thicker than that of the bug which resulted in a mattress two stories in front with a lean to at the foot and the entire edifice highly slippery But with a blanket from Milt s kit it was sufficient To Claire Milt gave another blanket his collection of antique overcoats and good advice He spoke vaguely of a third blanket for himself And he had one Its dimensions were thirteen by twenty inches it was of white wool he had bought it in Dakota for Vere de Vere and many times that day he had patted it and whispered Poor old cat Under his blankets mister Boltwood thought of rattlesnakes bears rheumatism Brooklyn his debt to Milt and the fact that though he hadn t happened to mention it to Claire he had expected to be killed when the brake had burned out Claire was drowsily happy She had got through She was conscious of rustling sagebrush of the rapids of the Yellowstone beside her of open sky and sweet air and a scorn for people in stuffy rooms and comfortably ever conscious of Milt ten feet away She had in him the interest that a young physician would have in a new X ray machine a printer in a new font of type any creator in a new outlet for his power She would see to it that her Seattle cousins the Gilsons helped him to know the right people during his university work She herself would be back in Brooklyn but perhaps he would write to her write write letters Brooklyn she was in Brooklyn no no where was she oh yes camping bad day brakes No she would not marry Jeff Saxton Brooklyn river singing stars And when Milt wasn t unromantically thinking of his cold back he exulted She won t be back among her own folks till Seattle Probably forget me then Don t blame her But till we get there she ll let me play in her yard Gee In the morning I ll be talking to her again and she s right there right now In the morning they were all very stiff but glad of the sun on sagebrush and river and the boy and girl sang over breakfast While Milt was gathering fuel he looked up at Claire standing against a background of rugged hills her skirt and shoes still smug but her jacket off her blouse turned in at the throat her hair blowing her sleeves rolled up one hand on her hip erect charged with vigor the spirit of adventure When her brake had been relined at Livingston they sauntered companionably on to Butte And the day after Butte when Milt was half a mile behind the Gomez a pink haired man with a large shiny revolver stepped out from certain bushes and bowed politely and at that point Milt stopped CHAPTER XVI THE SPECTACLES OF AUTHORITY Over the transcontinental divide and into Butte diamond glittering on its hills in the dark into Missoula where there are trees and a university with a mountain in everybody s backyard through the Flathead Agency where scarlet blanketed Indians stalk out of tepees and the papoose rides on mother s back as in forgotten days down to saint Ignatius that Italian Alp town with its old mission at the foot of mountains like the wall of Heaven Claire had driven west then north She was sailing past Flathead Lake where fifty miles of mountain glory are reflected in bright waters Everywhere were sections of flat wheat plains stirring with threshing with clattering machinery and the flash of blown straw But these miniature prairies were encircled by abrupt mountains mister Boltwood remarked I d rather have one of these homesteads and look across my fields at those hills than be King of England Not that he made any effort to buy one of the homesteads But then he made no appreciable effort to become King of England Claire had not seen Milt for a day and a half not since the morning when both cars had left Butte She wondered and was piqued and slightly lonely Toward evening when she was speculating as to whether she would make Kalispell almost up to the Canadian border she saw a woman run into the road from a house on the shore of Flathead Lake The woman held out her hand Claire pulled up Are you Miss Boltwood It was as startling as the same question would have been in a Chinese village W why yes Somebody trying to get you on the long distance phone Me Phone She was trembling Something s happened to Milt He needs me She could not manage her voice as she got the operator on the farmers line wire and croaked Was some one trying to get Miss Boltwood Yes This Boltwood Hotel in Kalispell trying to locate you for two hours Been telephoning all along the line from Butte to Somers W well w will you g get em for me It was not Milt s placid and slightly twangy voice but one smoother more decisive perplexingly familiar that finally vibrated Hello Hello Miss Boltwood Operator I can t hear Get me a better connection Miss Boltwood Yes Yes This is Miss Boltwood she kept beseeching during a long and not unheated controversy between the unknown and the crisp operator who knew nothing of the English language beyond Here s your party Why don t you talk Speak louder Then came clearly Hear me now Yes Yes Miss Boltwood Yes Oh Oh hello Claire This is Jeff Jess who Not Jess Jeff Geoffrey J e f f Jeff Saxton Oh It was like a sob Why why but you re in New York Not exactly dear I m in Kalispell Montana But that s right near here So am I B but Out West to see copper interests Traced you from Yellowstone Park but missed you at Butte Thought I d catch you on road You talking from Barmberry s The woman who had hailed her was not missing a word of a telephone conversation which might be relative to death fire elopement or any other dramatic event Claire begged of her Where in the world am I talking from anyway This is Barmberry s Inn Yes Claire answered on the telephone I seem to be Shall I start on and No Got ripping plan Stay right where you are Got a fast car waiting Be right down We ll have dinner By A click No answer to Claire s urgent hellos She hung up the receiver very very carefully She hated to turn and face her audience of mister Henry B Boltwood mister James Barmberry missus James Barmberry and four Barmberry buds averaging five and a quarter in age She tried to ignore the Barmberrys but their silence was noisy and interested while she informed her father It s Jeff Saxton Out here to see copper mines Telephoned along road to catch us Says we re to wait dinner till he comes Yessum missus Barmberry contributed he told me if I did catch you I was to have some new killed chickens ready to fry and some whipped cream Jim Barmberry you go right out and finish whipping that cream and don t stand there gawping and gooping and you children you scat Claire seized the moment of mister Boltwood s lordly though bewildered bow to their hostess and escaped outdoors Round the original settler s log cabin were nests of shacks and tents for bedrooms and on a screened porch looking on Flathead Lake was the dining room The few other guests had finished supper and gone to their tents She ambled to the lake shore feeling feebler more slapped and sent back to be a good little girl than she had when Milt had hitched a forest to the back axle three days ago A map of her thoughts about Jeff Saxton would have shown a labyrinth Now she was muttering Dear Jeff So thoughtful Clever of him to find me So good to see him again Now It s still distinctly understood that I am not engaged to him and I m not going to be surprised into kissing him when he comes down like a wolf on the fold Now Jeff Saxton Here Makes me homesick for the Heights And nice shops in Manhattan and a really good play music just before the curtain goes up Now Ohhhhhh geeeeee whizzzzzz I wonder if he ll let us go any farther in the car He s so managerial and dad is sure to take his side He tried to scare us off by that telegram to Fargo Now He d be horrified if he knew about that bum brake Milt didn t mind Milt likes his womenfolks to be daring Jeff wants his harem admiring and very reliable She crouched on the shore a rather forlorn figure The peaks of the Mission Range across the violet shadowed mirror of Flathead Lake were a sudden pure rose in reflection of sunset then stony forbidding Across the road on the Barmberry porch she could hear her father saying Ah and Indeed to James s stories Up the road a blaring horn great lights growing momently more dazzling a roar a rush the halting car and out of its blurred bulk a trim figure darting Jeff Saxton home and the people she loved and the ways and days she knew best of all He had shouted only Is Miss before she had rushed to him into the comfort of his arms and kissed him She backed off and tried to sound as if it hadn t happened but she was quavery I can t believe it It s too ridiculously wonderful to see you She retreated toward the Barmberry porch Jeff following his two hands out They came within the range of the house lights and mister Boltwood hailed Ah Geoffrey Never had such a surprise nor a more delightful one mister Boltwood Looking splendid sir New man William Street better look to its laurels when you come back and get into the game Then on the lamp lighted porch the two men shook hands and looked for some other cordial thing to do They thought about giving each other cigars They smiled and backed away and smiled in the foolish indeterminate way males have being unable to take it out in kissing mister Boltwood solved the situation by hemming Must trot in and wash See you very soon mister James Barmberry and the squad of lesser Barmberrys regretfully followed Claire was alone with Jeff and she was frightened Yet she was admitting that Jeff in his English cap and flaring London top coat his keen smile and his extreme shavedness was more attractive than she had remembered Glad to see me he demanded Oh rather You re looking You re so Nice trip You know you ve sent me nothing but postcards with Pretty town or something equally sentimental Yes it s really been bully These mountains and big spaces simply inspire me She said it rather defiantly Of course they do Trouble is with you away we ve nothing to inspire us Do you need anything with your office and your club Why Claire I m sorry That was horrid of me Yes it was Though I don t mind I m sure we ve all become meek missing you so I m quite willing to be bullied and reminded that I m a mere T B M She had got herself into it she had to tell him that he wasn t just a business man that she had just meant he was so practical But Jeff is no longer the practical one he declared Think of Claire driving over deserts and mountains But Oh it s been so lonely for us Can you guess how much A dozen times every evening I ve turned to the telephone to call you up and beg you to let me nip in and see you and then realized you weren t there and I ve just sat looking at the phone Oh other people are so dull You really miss I wish I were a poet so I could tell you adequately But you haven t said you missed me Claire Didn t you a teeny bit Wouldn t it have been tolerable to have poor old Jeff along to drive down dangerous hills And fill grease cups Nasty and stickum on the fingers Yes I d have done that too And invented surprises along the way I m a fine surpriser I ve arranged for a motor boat so we can explore the lake here tomorrow That s why I had you wait here instead of coming on to Kalispell Tomorrow morning unfortunately I have to hustle back and catch a train called to California and possibly a northern trip But meantime By now my driver must have sneaked my s prises into the kitchen What are they Guess Food Eats Divine eats Maybe But what Please sir Claire is so hungry We shall see in time my child Uncle Jeff is not to be hurried Ah let me see now I ll kick and scream From New York Jeff had brought a mammoth picnic basket To the fried chicken ordered for dinner he added sealed jars of puree of wood pigeon of stuffed artichokes prepared by his club chef caviar and anchovies a marvelous nightmare creating fruit cake to go with the whipped cream two quarts of a famous sherry candied fruits in a silver box Dinner was served not on the dining porch but before the fire in the Barmberrys living room Claire looked at the candied fruits stared at Jeff rather queerly as though she was really thinking of some one else and mused I didn t know I cared so much for these foolish luxuries Tonight I d like a bath just a tiny bit scented and a real dressing table with a triple mirror and French talc and come down in a dinner gown Oh I have enjoyed the trip Jeff But my poor body does get so tired and dusty and then you treacherously come along with these things that you ve magicked out of the mountains and I m not a pioneer woman after all And Henry B is not a caveman See him act idolatrously toward his soup I feel idolatrous I d forgotten the supreme ethical importance of the soup I ll never let myself forget it again said mister Boltwood in the tone of one who has come home Claire was grateful to Jeff that he did not let her go on being grateful He turned the talk to Brooklyn He was neat and explicit and almost funny in his description of an outdoor presentation of Midsummer Night s Dream in which a domestic and intellectual lady weighing a hundred and eighty seven stageside had enacted Puck As they sat after dinner as Claire shivered he produced a knitted robe and pulled it about her shoulders smiling at her in a lonely hungry way She caught his hand Nice Jeff she whispered Oh my dear he implored He shook his head in a wistful way that caught her heart and dutifully went back to informing mister Boltwood of the true state of the markets Talk to Claire too she demanded She stopped stared From outside she heard a nervous pit pit pit a blurred dialogue between mister James Barmberry and another man Into the room rambled Milt Daggett dusty of unpressed blue suit tired of eyes and not too well shaved of chin grumbling Thought I d never catch up with you Claire Why Oh Oh Milt mister Daggett Oh Jeff this is our good friend Milt Daggett who has helped us along the road Jeff s lucid rimless spectacles stared at Milt s wind reddened eyes his jaunty patch pocket outing clothes sniffed at Milt s sweater his even voice followed Milt s grunt of surprise with a curt Ah mister Daggett Pleased meet you faltered Milt Jeff nodded turned his shoulder on Milt and went on The fact is mister Boltwood the whole metal market Milt was looking from one to another Claire was now over her first shocked comparison of candied fruits with motor grease She rose moved toward Milt murmuring Have you had dinner The door opened again A pink haired red faced man in a preposterous green belted suit lunged in swept his broad felt hat in greeting and boomed like a cheap actor Friends of my friend Milt we about to dine salute you Let me introduce myself as Westlake Parrott better known to the vulgar as Pinky Parrott gentleman adventurer born in the conjunction of Mars and Venus with Saturn ascendant Jeff had ignored Milt But at this absurd second intrusion on his decidedly private dinner party he flipped to the center of the room and said I beg your pardon in such a head office manner that the pink locked Mystery halted in his bombast Claire felt wabbly She had no theories as to where Milt had acquired a private jester nor as to what was about to happen to Milt and possibly to her incautious self CHAPTER XVII THE VAGABOND IN GREEN As Milt had headed westward from Butte as he rattled peacefully along the road conscious of golden haze over all the land and the unexpectedness of prairie threshing crews on the sloping fields of mountainsides a man had stepped out from bushes beside the road and pointed a forty four navy revolver The man was not a movie bandit He wore a green imitation of a Norfolk jacket he had a broad red smile and as he flourished his hat in a bow his hair was a bristly pompadour of gray streaked red that was almost pink He made oration Pardon my eccentric greeting brother of the open road but I wanted you to give ear to my obsequious query as to how s chances on gettin a lift I have learned that obsequiousness is best appreciated when it is backed up by prayer and ca tridges What s the idea I seem to gather you d like a lift Jump in You do not advocate the Ciceronian style I take it chuckled the man as he climbed aboard Milt was not impressed Claire might have been but Milt had heard politics and religion argued about the stove in Rauskukle s store too often to be startled by polysyllabomania He knew it was often the sign of a man who has read too loosely and too much by himself He snorted Huh What are you newspaper politics law preacher or gambler Well a little of all those interesting occupations And ten twent thirt trouping and county fair spieling and selling doctor Thunder Rapids Choctaw Herbal Sensitizer How far y going Seattle Honest Say kid this is Muh boy we shall have the rare privilege of pooling adventures as far as Blewett Pass four to six days run from here a day this side of Seattle I m going to my gold mine there I ll split up on the grub I note from your kit that you camp nights Quite all right my boy Pinky Parrott is no man to fear night air He patted Milt s shoulder with patronizing insolence He filled a pipe and though the car was making twenty five he lighted the pipe with distinguished ease then settled down to his steady stride In the pride of youth you feel that you have thoroughly categorized me particularly since I am willing to admit that though I shall have abundance of the clinking iron men to buy my share of our chow I chance just for the leaden footed second to lack the wherewithal to pay my railroad fare back to Blewett and the bumpers and side door Pullman of the argonauts like me not Too damn dusty But your analysis is unsynthetic though you will scarce grasp my paradoxical metaphor The hell I won t I ve taken both chemistry and rhetoric growled Milt strictly attending to driving and to the desire to get rid of his parasite Oh Oh I see Well anyway I am no mere nimble knight of wits as you may take it In fact I am lord of fair acres in Arcady Don t know the burg Montana or Idaho Neither In the valley of dream Oh That one Huh But I happen to back them up with a perfectly undreamlike gold mine Prospected for it in a canyon near Blewett Pass and found it b gum and my lady wife erstwhile fairest among the society favorites of North Yakima now guards it against her consort s return Straight goods Got the stuff Been to Butte to get a raise on it but the fell khedives of commerce are jealous They would hearken not Gee those birds certainly did pull the frigid mitt So I wend my way back to the demure Dolores the houri of my heart and the next time I ll take a crack at the big guns in Seattle And I ll sure reward you for your generosity in taking me to Blewett all the long long languid languorous way Too bad I got to stop couple of days at Spokane Well then you shall have the pleasure of taking me that far And about a week in Kalispell Twill discommode me but pon honor I like your honest simple face and I won t desert you Besides I know a guy in Kalispell and I can panhandle the sordid necessary chuck while I wait for you Little you know my cockerel how facile a brain your bus so lightly bears When I ve cashed in on the mine I ll take my rightful place among the motored gentry Not merely as actor and spieler promoter and inventor and soldier and daring journalist have I played my role but also I am a mystic an initiate a clairaudient a psychometrist a Rosicrucian adept and profoundly psychic in fact my guide is Hermes Trismegistus himself I also hold a degree as doctor of mento practic and my studies in astro biochemistry Gonna stop All off Make little coffee said Milt He did not desire coffee and he did not desire to stop but he did desperately desire not to inflict Pinky Parrott upon the Boltwoods It was in his creed as a lover of motors never to refuse a ride to any one when he had room He hoped to get around his creed by the hint implied in stopping Pinky s reaction to the hint was not encouraging Why you have a touch of the psychic s flare I could do with coffee myself But don t trouble to make a fire I ll do that You drive I do the camp work Not but that I probably drive better than you if you will permit me to say so I used to do a bit of racing before I took up aviation Huh Aviation What machine d you fly Why why a biplane Huh What kind of motor Why a foreign one The the It was a French motor Huh What track you race on The Pardon me till I build a fire for our al fresco collation and I my driving history will unfold But he didn t do either After he had brought seven twigs one piece of sagebrush and a six inch board Pinky let Milt finish building the fire while he told how much he knew about the mysteries of ancient Egyptian priests Milt gave up hope that Pinky would become bored by waiting and tramp on After one hour of conversational deluge he decided to let Pinky drive to make him admit that he couldn t He was wrong Pinky could drive He could not drive well he wabbled in his steering and he killed the engine on a grade but he showed something of the same dashing idiocy that characterized his talk It was Milt not Pinky who was afraid of their running off the road and suggested resuming the wheel Seven times that day Milt tried to lose him Once he stopped without excuse and merely stared up at rocks overhanging the hollowed road Pinky was not embarrassed He leaned back in the seat and sang two Spanish love songs Once Milt deliberately took a wrong road up a mountainside They were lost and took five hours getting back to the highway Pinky loved the thrill and in a brief address lasting fifteen minutes he said so Milt tried to bore him by driving at seven miles an hour Pinky affectionately accepted this opportunity to study the strata of the hills When they camped that night Pinky loved him like a brother and was considering not stopping at Blewett Pass to see his gold mine and Dolores the lady wife but going clear on to Seattle with his playmate The drafted host lay awake and when Pinky awoke and delivered a few well chosen words on the subject of bird song at dawn Milt burst out Pinky I don t like to do it but I ve never refused a fellow a lift but I m afraid you ll have to hike on by yourself the rest of the way Pinky sat up in his blankets Afraid of me eh You better be I m a bad actor I killed Dolores s husband and took her along see I Are you trying to scare me you poor four flusher Milt s right hand expanded fingers arching with the joyous tension of a man stretching No I m just reading your thoughts I m telling you you re scared of me You think that if I went on I might steal your car You re afraid because I m so suave You aren t used to smooth ducks You don t dare to let me stick with you even for today You re afraid I d have your mis able car by tonight You don t dare The hell I don t howled Milt If you think I m afraid Just to show you I m not I ll let you go on today That s sense my boy It would be a shame for two such born companions of the road to part Pinky had soared up from his blankets was lovingly shaking Milt s hand Milt knew that he had been tricked but he felt hopeless Was it impossible to insult Pinky He tried again I ll be frank with you You re the worst wind jamming liar I ever met Now don t reach for that gat of yours I ve got a hefty rock right here handy But my dear dear boy I don t intend to reach for any crude lethal smoke wagon Besides there isn t anything in it I hocked the shells in Butte I am not angry merely grieved We ll argue this out as we have breakfast and drive on I can prove to you that though occasionally I let my fancy color mere untutored fact with the pigments of a Robert J Ingersoll By the way do you know his spiel on whisky Stick to the subject We ll finish our arguing right now and I ll give you breakfast and we ll sadly part Merely because I am lighter of spirits than this lugubrious old world No I decline to be dropped I ll forgive you and go on with you Mind you I am sensitive I will not intrude where I am not welcome Only you must give me a sounder reason than my diverting conversational powers for shucking me My logic is even stronger than my hedonistic contempt for hitting the pike Well hang it if you must know Hate to say it but I d do almost anything to get rid of you Fact is I ve been sort of touring with a lady and her father and you would be in the way Aaaaaaah You see Why my boy I will not only stick but for you I shall do the nimble John Alden and win the lady fair I will so bedizen your virile though somewhat crassly practical gifts Why women are my long suit They fall for Tut tut tut You re a fool She s no beanery mistress like you re used to She really is a lady How blind you are cruel friend You do not even see that whatever my vices may be my social standing Oh shut up Can t you see I m trying to be kind to you Have I simply got to beat you up before you begin to suspect you aren t welcome Your social standing isn t even in the telephone book And your vocabulary You let too many kids slip in among the juicy words Have I got to lick Well You re right I m a fliv Shake hands m boy and no hard feelings Good Then I can drive on nice and alone without having to pound your ears off Certainly That is we ll compromise You take me on just a few miles into more settled country and I ll leave you So it chanced that Milt was still inescapably accompanied by mister Pinky Parrott that evening when he saw Claire s Gomez standing in the yard at Barmberry s and pulled up Pinky had voluntarily promised not to use his eloquence on Claire nor to try to borrow money from mister Boltwood Without ever having quite won permission to stay he had stayed He had also carried out his promise to buy his half of the provisions by adding a five cent bag of lemon drops to Milt s bacon and bread When they had stopped Milt warned There s their machine now Seems to be kind of a hotel here I m going in and say howdy Good by Pink Glad to have met you but I expect you to be gone when I come out here again If you aren t Want granite or marble for the headstone I mean it now I quite understand my lad I admire your chivalric delicacy Farewell old compagnon de voyage Milt inquired of mister Barmberry whether the Boltwoods were within and burst into the parlor living room library As he cried to Claire by the fire Thought I d never catch up with you he was conscious that standing up talking to mister Boltwood was an old young man very suave very unfriendly of eye He had an Oxford gray suit unwrinkled cordovan shoes a pert insultingly well tied blue bow tie and a superior narrow pink bald spot As he heard Jeff Saxton murmur Ah mister Daggett Milt felt the luxury in the room the fleecy robe over Claire s shoulders the silver box of candy by her elbow the smell of expensive cigars and the portly complacence of mister Boltwood Have you had any dinner Claire was asking when a voice boomed Let me introduce myself as Westlake Parrott Jeff abruptly took charge He faced Pinky and demanded I beg pardon Claire s eyebrows asked questions of Milt This is a fellow I gave a lift to Miner I mean actor well kind of spiritualistic medium mister Boltwood with the geniality of dinner and cigar soothed Jeff uh Daggett here has saved our lives two distinct times and given us a great deal of help He is a motor expert He has always refused to let us do anything in return but I noticed there was almost a whole fried chicken left I wonder if he wouldn t share it with uh with his acquaintance here before before they make camp for the night In civil and vicious tones Jeff began Very glad to reward any one who has been of service to He was drowned out by Pinky s effusive True hospitality is a virtue as delicate as it is rare We accept your invitation In fact I should be glad to have one of those cigarros elegantos that mine olfactory Milt cut in abruptly Pink Shut up Thanks folks but we ll go on Just wanted to see if you had got in safe See you tomorrow some place Claire was close to Milt her fingers on his sleeve Please Milt Father You didn t make your introduction very complete You failed to tell mister Daggett that this is mister Saxton a friend of ours in Brooklyn Please Milt do stay and have dinner I won t let you go on hungry And I want you to know Jeff mister Saxton Jeff mister Daggett is an engineer that is in a way He s going to take an engineering course in the University of Washington Some day I shall make you bloated copper magnates become interested in him missus Barmberry Mrssssssss Barrrrrrrmberrrrrry Oh Oh missus Barmberry won t you please warm up that other chicken for Oh now that s too bad Me and Jim have et it all up wept the landlady at the door I ll go on stammered Milt Jeff looked at him expressionlessly You will not go on Claire was insisting missus Barmberry won t you cook some eggs or steak or something for these boys Perhaps Jeff suggested they d rather make their own dinner by a campfire Must be very jolly and that sort of thing Jeff if you don t mind this is my party just for the moment Quite right Sorry Milt you sit here by the fire and get warm I m not going to be robbed of the egotistic pleasure of being hospitable Everybody look happy now She got them all seated all but Pinky He had long since seated himself by the fire in Claire s chair and he was smoking a cigar from the box which Jeff had brought for mister Boltwood Milt sat farthest from the fire by the dining table He was agonizing This Jeff person is the real thing He s no Percy in riding breeches He s used to society and nastiness If he looks at me once more young garage man found froze stiff near Flathead Lake scared look in eyes believed to have met a grizzly no signs of vi lence And I thought I could learn to mingle with Claire s own crowd I wish I was out in the bug I wonder if I can t escape CHAPTER XVIII THE FALLACY OF ROMANCE During dinner Milt watched Jeff Saxton s manner and manners The hot day had turned into a cold night Jeff tucked the knitted robe about Claire s shoulders when she returned to the fire He moved quietly and easily He kept poking up the fire smiling at Claire as he did so He seemed without difficulty to maintain two conversations one with mister Boltwood about finances one with Claire about mysterious persons called Fannie and Alden and Chub and Bobbie and Dot the mention of whom made Milt realize how much a stranger he was Once as he passed by Claire Jeff said gently You are lovely Only that and he did not look at her But Milt saw that Claire flushed and her eyes dimmed Pinky was silent till he had eaten about two thirds of the total amount of fried eggs cold lamb and ice box curios When Claire came over to see how they fared Pinky removed himself with smirking humility and firmly joined himself to Jeff and mister Boltwood He caught the subject of finance and while Claire dropped down in the chair by Milt Pinky was lecturing the two men from New York Ah finance Queen of the sociological pantheon I don t know how come I am so graced by Fortune as to have encountered in these wilds two gentlemen so obviously versed in the stratagems of the great golden game but I will take the opportunity to give you gentlemen some statistics about the gold deposits still existent in the Cascades and other ranges that may be of benefit and certainly will be a surprise to you It happens that I have at the present time a mine Claire was whispering to Milt If we can get rid of your dreadful passenger I do want you to meet mister Saxton He may be of use to you some day He s terribly capable and really quite nice Think He happened to be out here and he traced me by telephone oh he treats long distance phoning as I do a hair pin He brought down the duckiest presents divertissements for dinner and that knitted robe and some real Rene Bleuzet perfume I was all out of it And after the grime of the road Do you really care for things like that all those awfully expensive luxuries begged Milt Of course I do Especially after small hotels Then you don t really like adventuring Oh yes in its place For one thing it makes a clever dinner seem so good by contrast Well Afraid I don t know much about clever dinners Milt was sighing when he was aware of Jeff Saxton looming down on him demanding Daggett would you mind trying to inform your friend that neither mister Boltwood nor I care to invest in his gold mine We can t seem to get that into his head I don t mind being annoyed myself but I really feel I must protect mister Boltwood What can I do My dear sir since you brought him here It was the potassium cyanide and cracked ice and carpet tacks and TNT and castor oil in Jeff s My dear sir that did it Milt discovered himself on his feet bawling I am not your dear sir Pinky is my guest and Gee sorry I lost my temper Claire terrible sorry See you along the road Good night Pink You take your hat Git Milt followed Pinky out of the door snarling Git in the car and do it quick I ll take you clear to Blewett Pass We drive all night Pinky was of great silence and tact Milt lumped into the bug beside him But he did not start the all night drive He wanted to crawl back on his knees to apologize to Claire and to be slapped by Jeff Saxton He compromised by slowly driving a quarter of a mile up the road and camping there for the night Pinky tried to speak words of philosophy and cheer just once he tried it For hours by a small fire Milt grieved that all his pride was gone in a weak longing to see Claire again In the morning he did see her putting off on the lake in a motor boat with Jeff and mister Barmberry He saw the boat return saw Jeff get into the car which had brought him from Kalispell saw the farewell the long handclasp the stoop of Jeff s head and Claire s quick step backward before Jeff could kiss her But Claire waved to Jeff long after his car had started When Claire and her father came along in the Gomez Milt was standing by the road She stopped She smiled Night of sadness and regrets You were fairly rude Milt So was mister Saxton but I ve lectured him and he sends his apologies I send him mine deed I do said Milt gravely Then everything s all right I m sure we were all tired We ll just forget it Morning Daggett mister Boltwood put in Hope you lose that dreadful red headed person No I can t mister Boltwood When mister Saxton turned on me I swore I d take Pinky clear through to Blewett Pass though not to Seattle by golly Foolish oaths should be broken Claire platitudinized Claire look You don t really care so terribly much about these little luxuries food and fixin s and six dollar a day hotel junk do you Yes stoutly I do But not compared with mountains and Oh it s all very well to talk and be so superior about these dear old grandeurs of Nature and the heroism of pioneers and I do like a glimpse of them But the niceties of life do mean something and even if it is weak and dependent I shall always simply adore them All these things are kind of softening And he meant that she was still soft At least they re not rude And she meant that he was rude They re absolutely trivial They shut off They shut off rain and snow and dirt and I still fail to see the picturesqueness of dirt Good by She had driven off without looking back She was heading for Seattle and the Pacific Ocean at forty miles an hour and they had no engagement to meet either in Seattle or in the Pacific Before Milt went on he completed a task on which he had decided the night before while he had meditated on the tailored impertinence of Jeff Saxton s gray suit The task was to give away the Best Suit that stolid very black covering which at Schoenstrom had seemed suitable either to a dance or to the Y P S C E The recipient was mister Pinky Parrott who gave in return a history of charity and high souls Milt did not listen He was wondering now that they had started where they had started for Certainly not for Seattle Why not stop and see Pinky s gold mine Maybe he did have one Even Pinky had to tell the truth sometimes With a good popular gold mine in his possession Milt could buy quantities of clothes like Jeff Saxton s and And he reflected I can learn as good manners as his in one hour with a dancing lesson thrown in If I didn t I d sue the professor CHAPTER XIX THE NIGHT OF ENDLESS PINES On the edge of Kootenai Canyon feeling more like an aviator than like an automobilist Claire had driven and now nearing Idaho she had entered a national forest She was delayed for hours while she tried to change a casing after a blow out when the spare tire was deflated She wished for Milt She would never see him again She was sorry He hadn t meant But hang it she panted if he admired her at all he d be here now and get on this per fect ly beast ly casing over which she had been laboring for a dozen years and she was simply too ridiculously tired and was there any respectful way of keeping Henry B from beaming in that benevolent manner while she was killing herself and look at those fingernails and oh drrrrrrat that casing To make the next town after this delay she had to drive for hours by night through the hulking pines of the national forest It was her first long night drive A few claims with log cabins of recent settlers once or twice the shack of a forest ranger a telephone in a box by the road or a rough R F D box nailed to a pine trunk these indicated that civilization still existed but they were only melancholy blurs She was in a cold enchantment All of her was dead save the ability to keep on driving forever with no hope of the tedium ending She was bewildered She passed six times what seemed to be precisely the same forest clearing always with the road on a tiny ridge to the left of the clearing always with a darkness stilled house at one end and always in the pasture at the other end a horse which neighed She was in a panorama stage scene things moved steadily by her there was a sound of the engine and a sensation of steering but she was forever in the same place among the same pines with the same scowling blackness between their bare clean trunks Only the road ahead was clear a one way track the foot high earthy bank and the pine roots beside it two distinct ruts and a roughening of strewn brown bark and pine needles which in the beating light of the car s lamps made the sandy road scabrous with little incessant shadows She had never known anything save this strained driving on Jeff and Milt were old tales and untrue Was it ten hours before that she had cooked dinner beside the road No matter She wasn t hungry any longer She would never reach the next town and she didn t care It wasn t she but a grim spirit which had entered her dead body that kept steering feeding gas watching the road In the darkness outside the funnel of light from her lamps were shadows that leaped and gray hands hastily jerked back out of sight behind tree trunks as she came up things that followed her and hidden men waiting for her to stop As drivers will she tried to exorcise the creeping fear by singing She made up what she called her driving song It was intended to echo the hoofs of a fat old horse on a hard road The old horse trots with a jog jog jog And a jog jog jog and a jog jog jog And the old road makes a little jog jog jog To the west jog jog and the north jog jog While the farmer drinks some cider from his jug jug jug From his coy jug jug from his joy jug jug Till he accumulates a little jag jag jag And he jigs jigs jigs with his jug jug jug The song was a comfort at first then a torment She drove to it and she steered to it and when she tried to forget it sang itself in her tired brain Jog jog jog oh damn Her father had had a chill Miserable weak as a small boy he had curled up on the bottom of the car his head on the seat and gone to sleep She was alone The mile posts went by slowly The posts said there was a town ahead called Pellago but it never came And when it did come she was too tired to care In a thick dream she drove through midnight streets of the town In stupid paralysis she kicked at the door of the galvanized iron covered garage No answer She gave it up She drove down the street and into the yard of a hotel marked by a swing sign out over the plank sidewalk She got out the traveling bags awakened her father led him up on the porch The Pellago Tavern was a transformed dwelling house The pillars of the porch were aslant and the rain warped boards snapped beneath her feet She hesitatingly opened the door The hallway was dark and musty A sound like a moan filtered down the unlighted stairs There seemed to be light in the room on the right Trying to assure herself that her father was a protection she pushed open the door She looked into an airless room scattered with rubber boots unsavory old corduroy caps tattered magazines By the stove nodded a wry mouthed squat old woman and a tall cheaply handsome man of forty Tobacco juice stained the front of his stiff bosomed collarless shirt His hands were white but huge The old woman started Well I want to get two rooms for the night please The man smirked at her The woman creaked Well I don t know Where d you come from heh We re motoring through Heh Who s that man He s my father madam Needn t to be so hoity toity about it he s my father madam F that matter that thing there is my husband The man had been dusting his shabby coat stroking his mustache smiling with sickly gallantry He burbled Shut up Teenie This lady is all right Give her a room Number two is empty and I guess Number seven has been made up since Bill left if tain t the sheets ain t been slept on but one night Where d you come Now don t go shooting off a lot of questions at the lady Teenie I ll show her the rooms The woman turned on her husband He was perhaps twenty five years younger a quarter century less soaked in hideousness Her yellow concave sided teeth were bared at him her mouth drew up on one side above the gums Pete if I hear one word more out of you out you go Lady Huh Where d you come from young woman Claire was too weak to stagger away She leaned against the door Her father struggled to speak but the woman hurled Wherdjuhcomfromised From New York Is there another hotel Nah there ain t another hotel Oh So you come from New York do you Snobs that s what N Yorkers are I ll show you some rooms They ll be two dollars apiece and breakfast fifty cents extra The woman led them upstairs Claire wanted to flee but Oh she couldn t drive any farther She couldn t The floor of her room was the more bare in contrast to a two foot square splash of gritty ingrain carpet in front of the sway backed bed On the bed was a red comforter that was filthy beyond disguise The yellow earthenware pitcher was cracked The wall mirror was milky Claire had been spoiled She had found two excellent hotels since Yellowstone Park She had forgotten how badly human beings can live She protested Seems to me two dollars is a good deal to charge for this I didn t say two dollars I said three Three each for you and your pa If you don t like it you can drive on to the next town It s only sixteen miles Why the extra dollar or extra two dollars Don t you see that carpet These is our best rooms And three dollars I know you New Yorkers I heard of a gent once and they charged him five dollars five dol lars for a room in New York and a boy grabbed his valise from him and wanted a short bit and Oh all right Can we get something to eat Now We haven t eaten since noon That ain t my fault Some folks can go gadding around in automobuls and some folks has to stay at home If you think I m going to sit up all night cooking for people that come chassayin in here God knows what all hours of the day and night There s an all night lunch down the street When she was alone Claire cried a good deal Her father declined to go out to the lunch room The chill of the late ride was still on him he croaked through his door he was shivering he was going right to bed Yes do dear I ll bring you back a sandwich Safe to go out alone Anything s safe after facing that horrible I do believe in witches now Listen dear I ll bring you a hot water bag She took the bag down to the office The landlady was winding the clock while her husband yawned She glared I wonder if I may have some hot water for my father He has a chill Stove s out No hot water in the house Couldn t you heat some Now look here miss You come in here asking for meals and rooms at midnight and you want a cut rate on everything and I do what I can but enough s enough The woman stalked out Her husband popped up Mustn t mind the old girl lady Got a grouch Well you can t blame her in a way when Bill lit out he done her out of four bits But I ll tell you he leered You leave me the hot water biznai and I ll heat you some water myself Thank you but I won t trouble you Good night Claire was surprised to find a warm rather comfortable all night lunch room called the Alaska Cafe with a bright eyed man of twenty five in charge He nodded in a friendly way and made haste with her order of two ham and egg sandwiches She felt adventurous She polished her knife and fork on a napkin as she had seen people do in lunches along the way A crowd of three rubbed their noses against the front window to stare at the strange girl in town but she ignored them and they drifted away The lunchman was cordial At a hotel ma am Which one Gee not the Tavern Why yes Is there another Sure First rate one two blocks over one up The woman said the Tavern was the only hotel Oh she s an old sour face Don t mind her Just bawl her out What s she charging you for a room Three dollars Per each Gee Well she sticks tourists anywheres from one buck to three Natives get by for fifty cents She s pretty fierce but she ain t a patch on her husband He comes from Spokane nobody knows why guess he was run out He takes some kind of dope and he cheats at rummy But why does the town stand either of them Why do you let them torture innocent people Why don t you put them in the insane hospital where they belong That s a good one her friend chuckled But he saw it only as a joke She thought of moving her father to the good hotel but she hadn t the strength Claire Boltwood of Brooklyn Heights went through the shanty streets of Pellago Montana at one A M carrying a sandwich in a paper bag which had recently been used for salted peanuts and a red rubber hot water bag filled with water at the Alaska Cafe At the Tavern she hastened past the office door She made her father eat his sandwich she teased him and laughed at him till the hot water bag had relieved his chill pinched back she kissed him boisterously and started for her own room at the far end of the hall The lights were off She had to feel her way and she hesitated at the door of her room before she entered She imagined voices creeping footsteps people watching her from a distance She flung into the room and when the kindled lamp showed her familiar traveling bag she felt safer But once she was in bed with the sheet down as far as possible over the loathly red comforter the quiet rustled and snapped about her and she could not relax Sinking into sleep seemed slipping into danger and a dozen times she started awake But only slowly did she admit to herself that she actually did hear a fumbling hear the knob of her door turning W who s there It s me lady The landlord Brought you the hot water Thanks so much but I don t need it now Got something else for you Come to the door Don t want to holler and wake ev body up At the door she said timorously Nothing else I want thank you D don t bother me Why I ve brought you up a sandwich girlie all nice and hot and a nip of something to take the chill off I don t want it I tell you Be a sport now You use Pete right and he ll use you right Shame to see a lady like you not gettin no service here Open the door Dandy sandwich The knob rattled again She said nothing The heel of her palm pressed against the door till the molding ate into it The man was snorting I ain t going to all this trouble and then throw away a good sandwich You asked me M must I s shout S shout your fool head off He kicked the door Good friends of mine long this end of the hall Aw listen Just teasing I m not going to rob you little honey bird Laws you could have a million dollars and old Pete wouldn t take two bits I just get so darn lonely in this hick town Like to chat to live ones from the big burg I m a city fella myself Spokane and Cheyenne and everything In her bare feet Claire had run across the room looked desperately out of the window Could she climb out reach her friend of the Alaska Cafe If she had to Then she grinned The world was rose colored and hung with tinkling bells I love even that Pinky person she said In the yard of the hotel beside her Gomez was a Teal bug and two men were sleeping in blankets on the ground She marched over to the door She flung it open The man started back He was holding an electric torch She could not see him but to the hovering ball of light she remarked Two men friends of mine are below by their car You will go at once or I ll call them If you think I am bluffing go down and look Good night CHAPTER XX THE FREE WOMAN Before breakfast Claire darted down to the hotel yard She beamed at Milt who was lacing a rawhide patch on a tire before she remembered that they were not on speaking terms They both looked extremely sheepish and young It was Pinky Parrott who was the social lubricant Pinky was always on speaking terms with everybody Ah here she is The little lady of the mutinous eyes Our colonel of the flivver hussars But he got no credit Milt straightened up and lumbered Hel lo She peeped at him and whispered Hel lo Say oh please Claire I didn t mean Oh I know Let s let s go have breakfast Was awfully afraid you d think we were fresh but when we came in last night and saw your car didn t like the looks of the hotel much and thought we d stick around I m so glad Oh Milt yes and you mister Parrott will you whip lick beat up however you want to say it somebody for me With one glad communal smile Milt and Pinky curved up their wrists and made motions as of pulling up their sleeves But not unless I say so I want to be a Citizeness Fixit I ve been good for so long But now Show him to me and Up lads and atum responded her squad Not till after breakfast It was a sufficiently vile breakfast at the Tavern The feature was curious cakes whose interior was raw creepy dough A dozen skilled workmen were at the same long table with Claire Milt Pinky and mister Boltwood the last two of whom were polite and scenically descriptive to each other but portentously silent about gold mines The landlady and a slavey waited on table the landlord could be seen loafing in the kitchen Toward the end of the meal Claire insultingly crooked her finger at the landlady and said Come here woman The landlady stared then ignored her Very well Then I ll say it publicly Claire swept the workmen with an affectionate smile Gentlemen of Pellago I want you to know from one of the poor tourists who have been cheated at this nasty place that we depend on you to do something This woman and her husband are criminals in the way they overcharge for hideous food and The landlady had been petrified Now she charged down Behind her came her husband Milt arose The husband stopped But it was Pinky who faced the landlady tapped her shoulder and launched into And what s more you hag if our new friends here have any sense they ll run you out of town That was only the beginning of Pinky s paper on corrections and charities He enjoyed himself Before he finished the landlady was crying she voluntarily promised to give her boarders waffles some morning jus soon as she could find the waffle iron With her guard about her at the office desk Claire paid one dollar apiece for the rooms and discussion was not Before they started Milt had the chance to say to her I m getting so I can handle Pinky now Have to Thinking of getting hold of his gold mine I just give him the eye as your friend mister Saxton would and he gets so meek But don t Please understand me Milt I do admire mister Saxton he is fine and capable and really generous only He may be just a bit snippish at times while you you re a playmate father s and mine and I did face that landlady didn t I I m not soft and trivial am I Praise She had driven through the panhandle of Idaho into Washington through Spokane through the writhing lava deposits of Moses Coulee where fruit trees grow on volcanic ash Beyond Wenatchee with its rows of apple trees striping the climbing fields like corduroy in folds she had come to the famous climb of Blewett Pass Once over that pass and Snoqualmie she would romp into Seattle She was sorry that she hadn t come to know Milt better but perhaps she would see him in Seattle Not adventure alone was she finding but high intellectual benefit in studying the names of towns in the state of Washington Not Kankakee nor Kalamazoo nor Oshkosh can rival the picturesque fancy of Washington and Claire combined the town names in a lyric so emotion stirring that it ought perhaps to be the national anthem It ran Humptulips Tum Tum Moclips Yelm Satsop Bucoda Omak Enumclaw Tillicum Bossburg Chettlo Chattaroy Zillah Selah Cowiche Keechelus Bluestem Bluelight Onion Creek Sockeye

leave it to you Henry B if any union poet has ever written as gay a refrain as Ohop Ladd She was not merely playing mental whist She was trying to keep from worry All the way she had heard of Blewett Pass its fourteen miles of climbing and the last half mile of stern pitch On this eastern side of the pass the new road was not open there was a tortuous flint scattered trail too narrow in most places for the passing of other cars Claire was glad that Milt and Pinky were near her If so many of the race of kind advisers of tourists had not warned her about it doubtless she would have gone over the pass without difficulty But their voluntary croaking sapped her nerve and her father s He kept worrying Do you think we better try it When they stopped at a ranch house at the foot of the climb for the night he seemed unusually tired He complained of chill He did not eat breakfast They started out silent depressed He crouched in the corner of the seat She looked at him and was anxious She stopped on the first level space on the pass crying You are perfectly miserable I m afraid of I think we ought to see a doctor Oh I ll be all right But she waited till Milt came pit pattering up the slope Father feels rather sick What shall I do Turn round and drive to the nearest doctor at Cashmere I suppose There s a magnolious medico ahead here on the pass Pinky Parrott interrupted A young thing but they say he s a graduate of Harvard He s out here because he has some timber claims Look Milt o the Daggett why don t you drive Miss Boltwood s bus make better time and hustle the old gent up to the doc and I ll come on behind with your machine Why Claire fretted I hate A new Milt the boss abrupt almost bullying snapped out of his bug Good idee Jump in Claire I ll take your father up Heh whasat Pink Yes I get it second turn beyond grocery Right On we go Huh Oh we ll think about the gold mine later Pink With the three of them wedged into the seat of the Gomez and Pinky recklessly skittering after them in the bug they climbed again and lo there was no climb Unconsciously Claire had hesitated before dashing at each sharp upsloping bend had lost headway while she was wondering Suppose the car went off this curve Milt never sped up but he never slackened His driving was as rhythmical as music They were so packed in that he could scarcely reach gear lever and hand brake He halted on a level and curtly asked That trap door in the back of the car convertible extra seat Yes but we almost never use it and it s stuck Can t get it open I ll open it all right Got a big screwdriver Want you sit back there Need elbow room Perhaps I d better drive with mister Pinky Nope Don t think better With one yank he opened the trap door revealing a folding seat which she meekly took Back there she reflected How strong his back looks Funny how the little silvery hairs grow at the back of his neck They came to a settlement and the red cedar bungalow of doctor Hooker Beach The moment Claire saw the doctor s thin demanding face she trusted him He spoke to mister Boltwood with assurance All you need is some rest and your digestion is a little shaky Been eating some pork Might stay here a day or two We re glad to have a glimpse of Easterners mister Boltwood went to bed in the Beaches guest room missus Beach gave Claire and Milt lunch with thin toast and thin china on a porch from which an arroyo dropped down for a hundred feet Fir trees scented the air and a talking machine played the same Russian music that was popular that same moment in New York And the Beaches knew people who knew Claire Claire was thinking These people were genuine aristocrats while Jeff Saxton for all his family and his assumptions about life was the eternal climber Milt who had been uncomfortable with Jeff was serene and un self conscious with the Beaches and the doctor gratefully took his advice about his stationary gas engine He s rather like the Beaches in his simplicity yes and his ability to do anything if he considers it worth while she decided After lunch when the doctor and his wife had to trot off to a patient Claire proposed Let s walk up to that ledge of rock and see the view shall we Milt Yes And keep an eye on the road for Pinky The poor nut he hasn t showed up So reckless hope he hasn t driven the Teal off the road She crouched at the edge of a rock where she would have been frightened a month before and looked across the main road to a creek in a pine laced gully He sat beside her elbows on knees Those Beaches their kin are judges and senators and college Presidents all over New England she said This doctor must be the grandson of the ambassador I fancy Honest I thought they were just regular folks Was I nice Of course you were Did I did I wash my paws and sit up and beg No you aren t a little dog I m that You re the big mastiff that guards the house while I run and yip She was turned toward him smiling Her hand was beside him He touched the back of it with his forefinger as though he was afraid he might soil it There seemed to be no reason but he was trembling as he stammered I I I m d darn glad I didn t know they were anybody or d have been as bad as a flivver driver the first time he tries a t twelve cylinder machine G gee your hand is little She took it back and inspected it I suppose it is And pretty useless N no it isn t but your shoes are Why don t you wear boots when you re out like this A flicker of his earlier peremptoriness came into his voice She resented it My shoes are perfectly sensible I will not wear those horrible vegetarian uplift sacks on my feet Your shoes may be all right for New York but you re not going to New York for a while You ve simply got to see some of this country while you re out here British Columbia and Alaska Would be nice but I ve had enough roughing Chance to see the grandest mountains in the world almost and then you want to go back to tea and all that junk Stop trying to bully me You have been dictatorial ever since we started up Have I Didn t mean to be Though I suppose I usually am bullying At least I run things There s two kinds of people those that give orders and those that naturally take them and I belong to the first one and But my dear Milt so do I and really And mostly I d take them from you But hang it Seattle is just a day away and you ll forget me Wish I could kidnap you Have half a mind to Take you way up into the mountains and when you got used to roughing it in sure enough wilderness say you d helped me haul timber for a flume then we d be real pals You have the stuff in you but you still need toughening before Listen to me Milton You have been reading fiction about this man sometimes he s a lumberjack and sometimes a trapper or a miner but always he s frightfully hairy and he sees a charming woman in the city and kidnaps her and shuts her up in some unspeakable shanty and makes her eat nice cold boiled potatoes and so naturally she simply adores him A hundred men have written that story and it s an example of their insane masculine conceit which I as a woman resent Shakespeare may have started it with his silly Taming of the Shrew Shakespeare s men may have been real but his women were dolls designed to please some majesty You may not know it but there are women today who don t live just to please majesties fancies If a woman like me were kidnapped she would go on hating the brute or if she did give in then the man would lose anyway because she would have degenerated she d have turned into a slave and lost exactly the things he d liked in her Oh you cavemen With your belief that you can force women to like you I have more courage than any of you I admit you have courage but you d have still more if you bucked the wilds Nonsense In New York I face every day a hundred complicated problems you don t know I ever heard of Let me remind you that Brer Julius Caesar said he d rather be mayor in a little Spanish town than police commissioner in Rome I m king in Schoenstrom while you re just one of a couple hundred thousand bright people in New York Really Oh at least a million Thanks Oh gee Claire I didn t mean to be personal and get in a row and all but can t you see kind of desperate Seattle so soon Her face was turned from him its thin profile was firm as silver wire He blundered off into silence and they were at it again I didn t mean to make you angry he gulped Well you did Bullying You and your men of granite in mackinaws and a much needed shave trying to make a well bred woman satisfied with a view consisting of rocks and stumps and socks on the line Let me tell you that compared with a street canyon a mountain canyon is simply dead and yet these unlettered wild men See here I don t know if you re firing these adjectives at me but I don t know that I m so much more unlettered You talked about taking French in your finishing school Well they taught American in mine They would Then he was angry Yes and chemistry and physics and Greek and Latin and history and mathematics and economics and I took more or less of a whirl at all of them while you were fiddling with ribbons and then I had to buck mechanics and business methods I also fiddled with manners an unfortunate omission in your curriculum I take it You have been reasonably rude So have you I had to be But I trust you begin to see that even your strong hand couldn t control a woman s taste Kidnapping As intelligent a boy as you wanting to imitate these boorish movie Not a darn bit more boorish than your smart set with its champagne and these orgies at country clubs You know so much about country clubs don t you The worst orgy I ever saw at one was the golf champion reading the beauty department in Boudoir Would you mind backing up your statements about the vices of myself and my friends Oh you Oh I didn t mean Then why did you Now you re bullying me and you know that if the smart set isn t vicious at least it s so snobbish that it can t see any Then it s wise to be snobbish because if it did condescend I won t stand people talking about condescending Would you mind not shouting so Very well I ll keep still Silence again while both of them looked unhappy and tried to remember just what they had been fighting about They did not at first notice a small red car larruping gaily over the road beneath the ledge though the driver was a pink haired man in a green coat He was almost gone before Milt choked It s Pinky Pink Pinky he bellowed Pinky looked back but instead of stopping he sped up and kept going CHAPTER XXI THE MINE OF LOST SOULS That couldn t have been Pinky Why Why the car he had was red cried Claire Sure The idiot s got hold of some barn paint somewhere and tried to daub it over He s trying to make a getaway with it 
3691-178118-0001	train-other-500	We ll chase him In my car Don t you mind Of course not I do not give up my objections to the roughing philosophy but You were right about these shoes Oh don t leave me behind Want to go along
3691-178118-0002	train-other-500	These sentences she broke scattered and totally lost as she scrambled after him down the rocks He halted His lips trembled He picked her up
3691-178118-0003	train-other-500	carried her down hesitated a second while his face curiously foreshortened as she looked up at it from his big arms twisted with emotion He set her down gently and she climbed into the Gomez
none	none	 It seemed to her that he drove rather too carefully too slowly 
3691-178118-0004	train-other-500	He took curves and corners evenly His face was as empty of expression as unmelodramatic as that of a jitney driver Then she looked at the speedometer He was making forty eight miles an hour down hill and forty to thirty on upgrades
3691-178118-0005	train-other-500	They were in sight of the fleeing Pinky in two miles
none	none	 Pinky looked back instantly was to be seen pulling his hat low stooping over 
3691-178118-0006	train-other-500	the demon driver Milt merely sat more erect looked more bland and white browed and steady The bug fled before them on a winding shelf road It popped up a curve then slowed down
3691-178118-0007	train-other-500	He took it too fast Poor Pink said Milt They gained on that upslope but as the road dropped the bug started forward desperately Another car was headed toward them was drawn to the side of the road in one of the occasional widenings
3691-178118-0008	train-other-500	Pinky passed it so carelessly that with crawling spine Claire saw the outer wheels of the bug on the very edge of the road the edge of a fifty foot drop
3691-178118-0009	train-other-500	Milt went easily past the halted car even waved his hand to the waiting driver This did not seem to Claire at all like the chase of a thief She looked casually ahead at Pinky as he whirled round an S shaped curve on the downslope then
3691-178118-0010	train-other-500	It was too quick to see what happened The bug headed directly toward the edge of the road shot out went down the embankment over and over It lay absurdly upside down its muffler and brake rods showing in place of the seat and hood
3691-178118-0011	train-other-500	Milt quite carefully stopped the Gomez The day was still just a breathing of running water in the deep gully The topsy turvy car below them was equally still no sight of Pinky no sound
3691-178118-0012	train-other-500	The gauche boy gone from him Milt took her hand pressed it to his cheek Claire You re here You might have gone with him to make room Oh I was bullying you because I was bullying myself Trying to make myself tell you
3691-178118-0013	train-other-500	but oh you know you know Can you stand going down there I hate to have you but you may be needed Yes I ll come she whispered Their crawl down the rock rolling embankment seemed desperately slow Wait here
3691-178118-0014	train-other-500	bade Milt at the bottom She looked away from the grotesque car She had seen that one side of it was crumpled like paper in an impatient hand Milt was stooping looking under
none	none	 seemed to be saying something 
3691-178118-0015	train-other-500	When he came back he did not speak He wiped his forehead Come We ll climb back up Nothing to do now
none	none	 Guess you better not try to help anyway 
3691-178118-0016	train-other-500	You might not sleep well He gave her his hand up the embankment drove to the nearest house telephoned to doctor Beach Later she waited while Milt and the doctor with two other men were raising the car
3691-178118-0017	train-other-500	As she waited she thought of the Teal bug as a human thing as her old friend to which she had often turned in need Milt returned to her There is one thing for you to do Before he died Pinky asked me to go get his wife
3691-178118-0018	train-other-500	Dolores I think it is She s up in a side canyon few miles away She may want a woman around Beach will take care of of him Can you come Of course Oh Milt I didn t
3691-178118-0019	train-other-500	I didn t mean you were a caveman You re my big brother
none	none	 mean you were a snob 
3691-178118-0020	train-other-500	They drove five miles along the highway then up a trail where the Gomez brushed the undergrowth on each side as it desperately dug into moss rain gutted ruts loose rocks all on a vicious slant
3691-178118-0021	train-other-500	which seemed to push the car down again Beside them the mountain woods were sacredly quiet with fern and lily and green lit spaces They came out in a clearing before dusk Beside the clearing was a brook with a crude cradle
3691-178118-0022	train-other-500	sign of a not very successful gold miner Before a log cabin in a sway sided rocker creaked a tall white flabby woman once nearly beautiful now rubbed at the edges
3691-178118-0023	train-other-500	She rose huddling her wrapper about her bosom as they drove into the clearing and picked their way through stumps and briars Where you folks think you re going she whimpered Why why just
none	none	 I cer nly am glad to see somebody I been most scared to death Been here alone two weeks now Got a shotgun but if anybody come 
3691-178118-0024	train-other-500	I guess they d take it away from me I was brought up nice no rough house or
none	none	 Say did you folks come to see the gold mine M 
3691-178118-0025	train-other-500	mine babbled Milt Course not
none	none	 Pinky said I was to show it but I m so sore on that low life hound now I swear I won t even take the trouble and lie about it 
3691-178118-0026	train-other-500	No more gold in that crick than there is in my eye Or than there s flour or pork in the house The woman s voice was rising Her gestures were furious Claire and Milt stood close their hands slipping together
none	none	 What d you think of a man that d go off and leave a lady without half enough to eat while he gallivanted around trying to raise money by gambling when he was offered a good job up here He s a gambler told me he was a rich mine owner but never touched a mine in his life 
3691-178118-0027	train-other-500	Lying hound worst talker in ten counties Got a gambler s hand on him too I ought to seen it
none	none	 Oh wait till I get hold of him just wait 
3691-178118-0028	train-other-500	Claire thought of the still hand so still that she had seen under the edge of the upturned car She tried to speak while the woman raved on wrath feeding wrath Thank God I ain t really his wife My husband is a fine man mister Kloh
none	none	 Dlorus Kloh my name is 
3691-178118-0029	train-other-500	mister Kloh s got a fine job with the mill at North Yakima Oh I was a fool
none	none	 This gambler Pinky Parrott he comes along with his elegant ways and he hands me out a swell line of gab 
3691-178118-0030	train-other-500	and I ups and leaves poor Kloh and the kid and the nicest kid Say please could you folks take me wherever you re going
none	none	 Maybe I could get a job again used to was a good waitress 
3691-178118-0031	train-other-500	and I ain t going to wait here any longer for that lying cheating mean talking
none	none	 Oh missus Kloh please don t 
3691-178118-0032	train-other-500	He s dead wailed Claire Dead Pinky Oh my God And I won t ever see him and he was so funny and She threw herself on the ground she kicked her heels
3691-178118-0033	train-other-500	she tore at her loosely caught tarnished blonde hair Claire knelt by her You mustn t you mustn t we ll Damn you with your smug faced husband there and your fine auto and all butting into poor folks troubles shrieked Dlorus
none	none	 Claire stumbled to her feet stood with her clenched right hand to her trembling lips cupping it with her nervous left hand 
3691-178118-0034	train-other-500	Her shoulders were dejected Milt pleaded Let s hike out I don t mind decent honest grease but this place look in at table Dirty dishes And gin bottles on the floor Desert her When she needs me so
3691-178118-0035	train-other-500	Claire started forward but Milt caught her sleeve and admired You were right You ve got more nerve than I have No I wouldn t dare if I m glad you re here with me
3691-178118-0036	train-other-500	Claire calmed the woman bound up her hair washed her face which needed it and sat on the log doorstep holding Dlorus s head in her lap while Dlorus sobbed Pinky dead Him that was so lively
3691-178118-0037	train-other-500	And he was so sweet a lover oh so sweet He was a swell fellow my he could just make you laugh and cry the way he talked and he was so educated
none	none	 and he played the vi lin he could do anything and athaletic he would have made me rich 
3691-178118-0038	train-other-500	Oh let me alone I just want to be alone and think of him I was so bored with Kloh and no nice dresses or nothin
none	none	 and I did love the kid but he squalled so 
3691-178118-0039	train-other-500	just all the time and Pinky come and he was so funny Oh let me alone
none	none	 Claire shivered then and the strength seemed to go from the steady arms that had supported Dlorus s head 
3691-178118-0040	train-other-500	Dusk had sneaked up on them the clearing was full of swimming grayness and between the woman s screams the woods crackled Each time Dlorus spoke her screech was like that of an animal in the woods
3691-178118-0041	train-other-500	and round about them crept such sinister echoes that Milt kept wanting to look back over his shoulder Yes sighed Claire at last perhaps we d better go If you go I ll kill myself
none	none	 Take me to mister Kloh Oh he was My husband mister Kloh Oh so good 
3691-178118-0042	train-other-500	Only he didn t understand a lady has to have her good times and Pink danced so well Dlorus sprang up flung into the cabin stood in the dimness of the doorway holding a butcher knife and clamoring
none	none	 I will I ll kill myself if you leave me 
3691-178118-0043	train-other-500	Take me down to mister Kloh at North Yakima tonight Milt sauntered toward her Don t you get flip young man I mean it And I ll kill you
none	none	 Most unchivalrously 
3691-178118-0044	train-other-500	quite out of the picture of gray grief Milt snapped
none	none	 That ll be about enough of you Here Gimme that knife 
3691-178118-0045	train-other-500	She dropped the knife sniveling Oh Gawd somebody s always bullying me And all I wanted was a good time Claire herded her into the cabin We ll take you to your husband tonight Come let s wash up and I ll help you put on your prettiest dress
3691-178118-0046	train-other-500	Honest will you cried the woman in high spirits all grief put aside I got a dandy China silk dress and some new white kid shoes My mister Kloh he won t hardly know me He ll take me back I know how to handle him That ll be swell going back in an automobile
3691-178118-0047	train-other-500	And I got a new hair comb with genuine Peruvian diamonds Say you aren t kidding me along In the light of the lantern Milt had kindled Claire looked questioningly at him Both of them shrugged Claire promised
none	none	 Yes Tonight If we can make it And will you jolly mister Kloh for me Gee I ll be awfully scared of him I swear I ll wash his dishes and everything He s a good man He Say he ain t seen my new parasol neither CHAPTER XXII ACROSS THE ROOF OF THE WORLD Claire dressed Dlorus cooked a dinner of beet greens potatoes and trout and by bullying and great sweetness kept Dlorus from too many trips to the gin bottle Milt caught the trout cut wood locked in a log shed Pinky s forlorn mining tools They started for North Yakima at eight of the evening with Dlorus back in the spare seat alternately sobbing and to inattentive ears announcing what she d say to the Old Hens Milt was devoted to persuading the huge cat of a car to tiptoe down the slippery gouged ruts of the road and Claire s mind was driving with him Every time he touched the foot brake she could feel the strain in the tendons of her own ankle A mile down the main road they stopped at a store post office to telephone back to mister Boltwood and doctor Beach On the porch was a man in overalls and laced boots He was lean and quick moving As he raised his head and his spectacles flashed Claire caught Milt s arm and gasped Oh my dear I m in a beautiful state of nerves For a moment I thought that was Jeff Saxton I bet it is his astral body And you thought he was going to forbid your running away on this fool expedition and you were scared chuckled Milt as they sat in the car Of course I was And I still am I know what he ll say afterward He is here reasoning with me Oughtn t I to be sensible Oughtn t I to have you leave me at the Beaches before you start jolly jaunt to take a strange woman to her presumably homicidal husband Why am I totally lacking in sense Just listen to what Jeff is saying Of course you ought to go back and let me drive alone Absolutely insane your But you would like me to go along wouldn t you Like you to It s our last ride together and that bloomin old Browning never thought of a ride together by midnight over the roof of the world No it s really our first ride together and tomorrow you re gone No I sha n t be gone but Addressing herself to the astounded overalled man on the porch she declared You re quite right Jeff And Milt is wrong Insane adventure Only it s wonderful to be young enough to do insane adventures Falling down abyssy places is so much more interesting than bridge I m going going going Milt you telephone Don t you think you better No siree Father would forbid me Try not to get him just tell doctor Beach where we re going and hang up and scoot All night they drove down the Pacific side of Blewett Pass down the sweeping spirals to a valley Dlorus drowsed in the extra seat Claire s sleepy head was fantastically swaying She was awakened by an approaching roar and as though she sat at a play she watched a big racing machine coming toward them passing them with two wheels in the ditch She had only a thunderous glimpse of the stolid driver a dark hooded romantic figure like a sailor at the helm in a storm Milt cried Golly May be a transcontinental racer Be in New York in five days going night and day take mud at fifty an hour crack mechanic right from the factory change tires in three minutes people waiting up all night to give him gasoline and a sandwich That s my idea of fun Studying Milt s shadowed face Claire considered He could do it too Sitting there at the wheel taking danger and good road with the same steadiness Oh he s well anyway he s a dear boy But what she said was Less dramatic things for you now Milt Trigonometry is going to be your idea of fun blueprints and engineering books Yes I know I m going to do it Do four years work in three or two I ll tack pages of formulas on the wall in my bum hallroom and study em while I m shaving Oh I ll be the grind But learn to dance the fox trot though If America gets into the war I ll get into the engineering corps and come back to school afterward Will the finances I ll sell my garage by mail Rauskukle will take it He won t rob me of more than a thousand dollars on price not much more You re going to love Seattle And we ll have some good tramps while I m there you and I Honestly Will you want to Do you suppose for one second I d give up my feeling of free air If you don t come and get me I ll call on you and make you come Warn you I ll probably be living over some beanery Probably With dirty steps leading up to it I ll sweep the steps I ll cook supper for you I can do things can t I I did manage Dlorus didn t I He was murmuring Claire dear when she changed her tone to the echo of Brooklyn Heights and hurried on You do understand don t you We ll be uh good friends Yes He drove with much speed and silence Though they were devouring the dark road though roadside rocks caught by the headlights seemed to fly up at them though they went on forever chased by a nightmare Claire snuggled down in security Her head drooped against his shoulder He put his arm about her his hand about her waist She sleepily wondered if she ought to let him She heard herself muttering Sorry I was so rude when you were so rude and her chilly cheek discovered that the smooth worn shoulder of his old blue coat was warm and she wondered some more about the questions of waists and hands and She was asleep She awoke bewildered to find that dawn was slipping into the air While she had slept Milt had taken his arm from about her and fished out a lap robe for her Behind them Dlorus was slumbering with her soft mouth wide open Claire felt the luxury of the pocket of warmth under the lap robe she comfortably stretched her legs while she pictured Milt driving on all the night rigid tireless impersonal as the engineer of a night express They came into North Yakima at breakfast time and found the house of mister Kloh a neat bare drab frame box with tight small front and back yards Dlorus was awake and when she wasn t yawning she was enjoying being hysterical Miss Boltwood she whined you go in and jolly him up Milt begged Better let me do it Claire They looked squarely at each other No I think I d better she decided Right Claire but I wish I could do more things for you I know He lifted her stiff cold little body from the car His hands under her arms he held her on the running board an instant her eyes level with his Little sister plucky little sister he sighed He lowered her to the ground Claire knocked at the back door To it came a bald tired man in an apron wet at the knees The kitchen floor was soaped and a scrubbing brush rode amid the seas A rather dirty child clung to his hand Trying to clean up ma am Not very good at it I hope you ain t the Cruelty to Children lady Willy looks mussed but fact is I just can t get time to wash the clothes but he means a terrible lot to me What was it Will you step in Claire buttoned the child s rompers before she spoke Then mister Kloh I want to be perfectly honest with you I ve had word from your wife She s unhappy and she loves and admires you more than any other man in the world and I think she would come back misses the child so The man wiped his reddened hands I don t know I don t wish her no harm Trouble was I m kind of pokey I guess I couldn t give her any good times I used to try to go to dances with her but when I d worked late I d get sleepy and She s a beautiful woman smart s a whip and I guess I was too slow for her No she wouldn t never come back to me She s out in front of the house now waiting Great Caesar s ghost and the floor not scrubbed With a squawk of anxiety he leaped on the scrubbing brush and when Milt and Dlorus appeared at the door mister Kloh and Miss Claire Boltwood were wiping up the kitchen floor Dlorus looked at them arms akimbo and sighed Hello Johnny my ain t it nice to be back oh you had the sink painted oh forgive me Johnny I was a bad ungrateful woman I don t care if you don t never take me to no more dances hardly any Willy come here dear oh he is such a sweet child my his mouth is so dirty will you forgive me Johnny is my overcoat in the moth balls When mister Kloh had gone off to the mill thrice returning from the gate to kiss Dlorus and to thank her rescuers Claire sat down and yawningly lashed off every inch of Dlorus s fair white skin You re at it already taking advantage of that good man s forgiveness and getting lofty with him and rather admiring yourself as a spectacular sinner You are a lazy ignorant not very clean woman and if you succeed in making mister Kloh and Willy happy it will be almost too big a job for you Now if I come back from Seattle and find you misbehaving again Dlorus broke down You won t miss And I will raise chickens like he wanted honest I will Then you may let me have a room to take a nap in and perhaps mister Daggett could sleep in there on the sofa and we ll get rested before we start back Both Milt and Dlorus meekly followed the boss It was noon before Milt and Claire woke and discovered that Dlorus had prepared for them scrambled eggs and store celery served on an almost clean table cloth mister Kloh came home for lunch and while Dlorus sat on his lap in the living room and repeated that she had been a bad naughty ittle dirl what did the fellows say at the mill Milt and Claire sat dumpily on the back porch regarding scenery which featured of seven tin cans a broken patent washing machine and a rheumatic pear tree I suppose we ought to start groaned Claire I have about as much nerve as a rabbit and as much punch as a bale of hay Milt admitted We re like two children that have been playing too long But don t want to go home Quite Though I don t think much of your idea of a playhouse those tin cans But it s better than having to be grown up In the midst of which chatter they realized that mister Henry B Boltwood and doctor Hooker Beach had come round the corner of the house and were gaping at them CHAPTER XXIII THE GRAEL IN A BACK YARD IN YAKIMA I must say that you two have chosen a fine pastoral scene observed mister Boltwood Hhhhhhhhow did you get here gasped Claire Auto bus over Blewett Pass train here from Ellensburg That woman everything all right Yes everything s fine We were just starting back sir implored Milt Huh Awfully sorry sir to take Claire on such a hike I don t blame you particularly When that young woman gets an idea into her head the rest of us are pawns Why even me she s dragged me all over the Rocky Mountains And I will admit Claire that it s been good for me But I begin to feel human again and I think it s about time I took charge We ll catch the afternoon train for Seattle Claire The trip has been extremely interesting but I think perhaps we ll call it enough Daggett want to get you to drive the Gomez on to Seattle Beach tells me your car is completely wrecked Lose any money in it No sir Had my roll in the bug I ll have to go back to it and get some clothes out of it though Well then will you drive my car in Charge me anywhere up to fifty dollars if you want to I d rather not It s a perfectly honest job I d do it too quick Or if your confounded pride won t let you charge anything bring the car on anyway Come dolly I have a jitney here please observe my graceful use of jitney and I have the bags We ll hustle to the station now No No arguments chick On the station platform Claire and Milt were under the surveillance of mister Boltwood who was extremely irritable as every two minutes the train was reported to be two minutes later They tramped up and down speaking in lowered voices very meek but in their joint naughtiness very intimate That was a nice place to end a transcontinental drive in the back yard of mister Johnny Kloh with an unrestricted view of tin cans lamented Claire Still your drive didn t end at Kloh s it ended way up in the mountains mister Boltwood bumbled down on them Another minute late Like to know what the matter is Yes father When mister Boltwood s impatiently waiting back was turned Claire gripped Milt s hand and whispered to him You see I m captured I thought I was father s lord and chauffeur but he sniffs the smoke of the ticker In his mind he s already back in the office running things He ll probably turn me over to Jeff for disciplining You won t let them change me back into a pink face will you Come to tea at the Gilsons just as soon as you reach Seattle Tea Now we re so near your Gilsons I begin to get scared Wouldn t know what to do Gee I ve heard you have to balance a tea cup and a sandwich and a hunk o cake and a lot of conversation all at once I d spill the tea and drop crumbs and probably have the butler set on me You will not And if you did can t you see it wouldn t matter It just wouldn t matter Honestly Claire dear do you know why I came on this trip In Schoenstrom I heard you say you were going to Seattle That moment I decided I would too and get acquainted with you if murder would do it But oh I m clumsy You ve seen me clumsy in driving You taught me to get over it Perhaps I can teach you some things And we ll study together evenings I m a thoroughly ignorant parasite woman Make me become real A real woman Dear dear mister Boltwood loomed on them The train s coming at last We ll have a decent sleep for once at the Gilsons I ve wired them to meet us He departed Terribly glad your father keeps coming down on us because it scares me so I get desperate said Milt Golly I think I can hear the train I uh Claire Claire dear Milt are you proposing to me Please hurry because that is the train Isn t it absurd some day you ll have to propose all over again formally for the benefit of people like father when you and I already know we re partners We ve done things together not just danced together When you re an engineer you ll call me and I ll come a running up to Alaska And sometimes you ll come with me to Brooklyn we ll be a couple of bombs There s the train Oh playmate hurry with your engineering course Hurry hurry hurry Because when it s done then Whither thou goest there I go also And you did bully me you did you did and I like it and Yes father the bags are right here Telephone me minute you reach Seattle dear and we ll have a private lesson in balancing tea cups Yes father I have the tickets So glad dear the trip smashed up like this shocked me into reality made me realize I ve been with you every hour since I dismissed you back in Dakota and you looked at me big hurt eyes like a child and Yes father Pullman s at the back Yes I m coming W wait D did you know I was going to propose Yes Ever since the Yellowstone Been trying to think of a nice way to refuse you But there isn t any You re like Pinky can t get rid of you have t adopt you Besides I ve found out You love me I don t know How can I tell But I do like to drive with my head on your shoulder and Yesssss father coming CHAPTER XXIV HER OWN PEOPLE mister Henry B Boltwood was decorously asleep in a chair in the observation car and Claire on the wide back platform sat unmoving apparently devoted to agriculture and mountain scenery But it might have been noted that her hand clenched one of the wooden supports of her camp stool and that her hunched back did not move When she had turned to follow her father into the train Milt had caught her shoulders and kissed her For half an hour that kiss had remained a perceptible warm pressure on her lips And for half an hour she had felt the relief of gliding through the mountains without the strain of piloting the comfort of having the unseen mysterious engineer up ahead automatically drive for her She had caroled to her father about nearing the Pacific Her nervousness had expressed itself in jerky gaiety But when he had sneaked away for a nap and Claire could no longer hide from herself by a veil of chatter the big decision she had made on the station platform then she was lonely and frightened and very anxious to undecide the decision She could not think clearly She could see Milt Daggett only as a solemn young man in an inferior sweater standing by the track in a melancholy autumnal light waving to her as the train pulled out disappearing in a dun obscurity less significant than the station the receding ties or the porter who was in places known only to his secretive self concealing her baggage She could only mutter in growing panic I m crazy In sane Pledging myself to this boy before I know how he will turn out Will he learn anything besides engineering I know it I do want to stroke his cheek and his kiss frightened me but Will I hate him when I see him with nice people Can I introduce him to the Gilsons Oh I was mad so wrought up by that idiotic chase with Dlorus and so sure I was a romantic heroine and And I m simply an indecisive girl in a realistic muddle Threatened by darkness and the sinister evening chill of the mountains with the train no longer cheerfully climbing the rocky ridge but rumbling and snorting in the defiles and startling her with agitating forward leaps as though the brakes had let go she could not endure the bleak platform and even less could she endure sitting in the chair car eyed by the smug tourists people as empty of her romance as they were incapable of her sharp tragedy She balanced forward to the vestibule She stood in that cold swaying darkling place that was filled with the smell of rubber and metal and grease and the thunderous clash of steel on steel she tried to look out into the fleeing darkness she tried to imagine that the train was carrying her away from the pursuing enemy from her own weak self Her father came puffing and lip pursing and jolly to take her to dinner mister Boltwood had no tearing meditations he had a healthy interest in soup But he glanced at her across the bright sleek dining table he seemed to study her and suddenly Claire saw that he was a very wise man His look hinted You re worried my dear but his voice ventured nothing beyond comfortable drawling stories to which she had only from the depth of her gloomy brooding to nod mechanically She got a great deal of satisfaction and horror out of watching two traveling men after dinner Milt had praised the race and one of the two traveling men a slender clear faced youngster was rather like Milt despite plastered hair a watch chain slung diagonally across his waistcoat maroon silk socks and shoes of pearl buttons gray tops and patent leather bottoms The other man was a butter ball Both of them had harshly pompous voices the proudly unlettered voices of the smoking compartment The slender man was roaring Yes sir he s got a great proposition there believe me he s got a great proposition he s got one great little factory there take it from me He can turn out toothpicks to compete with Michigan He s simply piling up the shekels why say he s got a house with eighteen rooms every room done different Claire wondered whether Milt when the sting and faith of romance were blunted would engage in Great Propositions and fight for the recognition of his toothpicks Would his creations be favorites in the best lunch rooms Would he pile up shekels Then her fretting was lost in the excitement of approaching Seattle and their host Claire s cousin Eugene Gilson an outrageously prosperous owner of shingle mills He came from an old Brooklyn Heights family He had married Eva Gontz of Englewood He liked music and wrote jokey little letters and knew the addresses of all the best New York shops He was of Her Own People and she was near now to the security of his friendship the long journey done Lights thicker and thicker a factory illuminated by arc lamps the baggage the porter the eager trail of people in the aisle climbing down to the platform red caps passing the puffing engine which had brought them in the procession to the gate faces behind a grill Eugene Gilson and Eva waving kisses cries of How was the trip and Oh Had won derful drive the huge station and curious waiting passengers Jap coolies in a gang lumbermen in corks the Gilsons quiet car and baggage stowed away by the chauffeur instead of by their own tired hands streets strangely silent after the tumult of the train Seattle and the sunset coast at last attained Claire had forgotten how many charming most desirable things there were in the world The Gilsons drove up Queen Anne Hill to a bay fronting house on a breezy knob a Georgian house of holly hedge French windows a terrace that suggested tea and a great hall of mahogany and white enamel with the hint of roses somewhere and a fire kindled in the paneled drawing room to be seen beyond the hall Warmth and softness and the Gilsons confident affection wrapped her around and in contented weariness she mounted to a bedroom of Bakst sketches a four poster and a bedside table with a black and orange electric lamp and a collection of Arthur Symons essays She sank by the bed pitifully rubbed her cheek against the silk comforter that was primly awaiting her commands at the foot of the bed and cried Oh four posters are necessary I can t give them up I won t They No one has a right to ask me She mentally stamped her foot I simply won t live in a shack and take in washing It isn t worth it A bath faintly scented in a built in tub in her own marble bathroom A preposterously and delightfully enormous Turkish towel One of Eva Gilson s foamy negligees Slow exquisite dressing not the scratchy hopping over ingrown dirt among ingrown smells of a filthy small hotel bedroom but luxurious wandering over rugs velvety to her bare feet A languid inspection of the frivolous colors and curves in the drawings by Bakst and George Plank and Helen Dryden A glance at the richness of the toilet table at the velvet curtains that shut out the common world Expanding to the comfort as an orchid to cloying tropic airs she drew on her sheerest chemise her most frivolous silk stockings In a dreaming enervated joy she saw how smooth were her arms and legs she sleepily resented the redness of her wrists and the callouses of the texture of corduroy that scored her palms from holding the steering wheel Yes she was glad that she had made the experiment but gladder that she was safely in from the long dust whitened way back in her own world of beauty and she couldn t imagine ever trying it again To think of clumping out into that world of deliberate and brawling crudeness Of one Milt Daggett she didn t think at all Gorgeously sleepy and gorgeously certain that by and by she would go not to a stingy hotel bed with hound dog ribs to cut into her tired back but to a feathery softness of slumber she wavered down to the drawing room and on the davenport by the fire with Victoria chocolates by her elbow and pillows behind her shoulders she gossiped of her adventure and asked for news of friends and kin back East Eugene and Eva Gilson asked with pyrotechnic merriness about the funny people she must have met along the road With a subdued hidden unhappiness Claire found that she could not mention Milt that she was afraid her father would mention Milt to these people who took it for granted that all persons who did not live in large houses and play good games of bridge were either queer or common who believed that their West was desirable in proportion as it became like the East and that they though Westerners were as superior to workmen with hard hands as was Brooklyn Heights itself Claire tried to wriggle out from under the thought of Milt while with the Gilsons as the perfect audience she improvised on the theme of wandering With certain unintended exaggerations and certain not quite accurate groupings of events she described the farmers and cowpunchers the incredible hotels and garages Indeed they had become incredible to her own self Obviously this silken girl couldn t possibly take seriously a Dlorus Kloh or a young garage man who said ain t Eva Gilson had been in Brooklyn within the month and in a passion of remembrance of home Claire cried Oh do tell me about everybody I had such a good time with Amy Dorrance said missus Gilson Of course Amy is a little dull but she s such an awfully good sort and We did have the jolliest party one afternoon We went to lunch at the Ritz and a matinee and we saw such an interesting man Gene is frightfully jealous when I rave about him I m sure he was a violinist simply an exquisite thing he was I wanted to kiss him Gene will now say Why didn t you And Gene said Well why didn t you and Claire laughed and her toes felt warm and pink and good and she was perfectly happy and she murmured It would be good to hear a decent violinist again Oh What had George Worlicht been doing when you were home Don t you think Georgie is wonderful fluttered missus Gilson He makes me rue my thirty six sad years I think I ll adopt him You know he almost won the tennis cup at Long Branch Georgie had a little mustache and an income just enough income to support the little mustache and he sang inoffensively and was always winning tennis cups almost and he always said at least once at every party The basis of savoir faire is knowing how to be rude to the right people Fire enamored and gliding into a perfumed haze of exquisite drowsiness Claire saw Georgie as heroic and wise But the firelight got into her eyes and her lids wouldn t stay open and in her ears was a soft humming as of a million bees in a distant meadow golden spangled and Gene was helping her upstairs sleepiness submerged her like bathing in sweet waters she fumbled at buttons and hooks and stays let things lie where they fell and of all that luxury nothing was more pleasant than the knowledge that she did not have to take precautions against the rats mice cockroaches and all their obscene little brothers which on some far off fantastic voyaging when she had been young and foolish she seemed to remember having found in her own room Then she was sinking into a bed like a tide of rainbow colored foam sinking deep deep deep And it was morning and she perceived that the purpose of morning light was to pick out surfaces of mahogany and orange velvet and glass and that only an idiot would ever leave this place and go about begging dirty garage men to fill her car with stinking gasoline and oil The children were at breakfast children surely not of the same species as the smeary cheeked brats she had seen tumbling by roadsides along the way sturdy Mason with his cap of curls and Virginia with bobbed ash blond hair prim about her delicate face They curtsied and in voices that actually had intonations they besought her Oh Cousin Claire would you pleasssssse tell us about drive to the coast After breakfast she went out on the terrace for the View In Seattle even millionaires and the I W W and men with red garters on their exposed shirt sleeves who want to give you real estate all talk about the View The View is to Seattle what the car service the auditorium the flivver factory or the price of coal is to other cities At parties in Seattle you discuss the question of whether the View of Lake Union or the View of the Olympics is the better and polite office managers say to their stenographers as they enter How s your View this morning All real estate deeds include a patent on the View and every native son has it as his soundest belief that no one in Tacoma gets a View of Mount Rainier missus Gilson informed Claire that they had the finest View in Seattle Below Claire was the harbor with docks thrust far out into the water and steamers alive with smoke missus Gilson said they were Blue Funnel Liners loading for Vladivostok and Japan The names just the names shot into Claire s heart a wistful unexpressed desire that was somehow vaguely connected with a Milt Daggett who back in the Middlewestern mud and rain had longed for purple mountains and cherry blossoms and the sea But she cast out the wish and lifted her eyes to mountains across the sound not purple mountains but sheer silver streaked with black like frozen surf on a desolate northern shore the Olympics two score miles away Up there one could camp with a boy in a deteriorated sweater singing as he watched the coffee Hastily she looked to the left across the city with its bright new skyscrapers its shining cornices and masses of ranked windows and the exclamation point of the tallest building outside of New York far livelier than her own rusty Brooklyn Beyond the city was a dun cloud but as she stared far up in the cloud something crept out of the vapor and hung there like a dull full moon aloof majestic overwhelming and she realized that she was beholding the peak of Mount Rainier with the city at its foot like white quartz pebbles at the base of a tower A landing stage for angels she reflected It did seem larger than dressing tables and velvet hangings and scented baths But she dragged herself from the enticing path of that thought and sighed wretchedly Oh yes he would appreciate Rainier but how how would he manage a grape fruit I mustn t be a fool I mustn t She saw that missus Gilson was peeping at her and she made herself say adequate things about the View before she fled inside fled from her sputtering inquiring self In the afternoon they drove to Capitol Hill they dropped in at various pretty houses and met the sort of people Claire knew back home Between people they had Views and the sensible Miss Boltwood making a philosophic discovery announced to herself After all I ve seen just as much from this limousine as I would from a bone breaking Teal bug Silly to make yourself miserable to see things Oh yes I will go wandering some more but not like a hobo But What can I say to him Good heavens he may be here any time now with our car Oh why why why was I insane on that station platform CHAPTER XXV THE ABYSSINIAN PRINCE Snoqualmie Pass lies among mountains prickly with rocks and burnt stumps but the road is velvet with broad saucer curves and to Milt it was pure beauty it was release from life to soar up coaxing inclines and slip down easy grades in the powerful car No more Teals for me he cried in the ecstasy of handling an engine that slowed to a demure whisper then at a touch of the accelerator floated up a rise effortless joyous humming the booming song of the joy in speed He suddenly hated the bucking tediousness of the Teal The Gomez Dep symbolized his own new life So he came to Lake Washington and just across it was the city of his long dreams the city of the Pacific and of Claire There was no ferry in sight and he rounded the lake struck a brick pavement rolled through rough woods suburban villas and petty business streets to a region of factories and mills with the funnels of ships beyond And every minute he drove more slowly and became more uneasy The pavement the miles of it the ruthless lumbermills with their thousands of workmen quite like himself the agitation of realizing that every three minutes he was passing a settlement larger than Schoenstrom the strangeness of ships and all the cynical ways of the sea the whole scene depressed him as he perceived how little of the world he knew and how big and contemptuous of Milt Daggetts that world must be Huh he growled Quite some folks living here Don t suppose they spend such a whale of a lot of time thinking about Milt Daggett and Bill McGolwey and Prof Jones I guess most of these people wouldn t think Heinie Rauskukle s store was so gosh awful big I wasn t scared of Minneapolis much but there they didn t ring in mountains and an ocean on you And I didn t have to go up on the hill and meet folks like Claire s relations and figure out whether you shake hands catch as catch can or Corinthian Look at that sawmill chimney isn t it nice of em to put the fly screen over it so the flies won t get down into the flames No they haven t got much more than a million feet of lumber in that one pile And here s a bum little furniture store it wouldn t cost more n about ten times all I ve got to buy one of those Morris chairs Oh Gooooooosh won t these houses ever stop Say that must be a jitney The driver snickered at me Will the whole town be onto me Milt you re a kind young fellow and you know what s the matter with Heinie s differential but they don t need you here Quite a few folks to carry on the business Gosh look at that building ahead nine stories He had planned to stop at a hotel to wash up and to gallop to Claire But well wouldn t it maybe be better to leave the car at a public garage so the Boltwoods could get it when they wanted to He d better just kind of look around before he tackled the watch dog It was the public garage which finally crushed him It was a garage of enameled brick and colored tiles with a plate glass enclosed office in which worked young men clad as the angels One of them wore a carnation Milt noted Huh I ll write back and tell Ben Sittka that hereafter he s to wear his best Sunday go to meeting clothes and a milkweed blossom when he comes down to work at the Red Trail Garage Milt drove up the brick incline into a room thousands of miles long with millions of new and recently polished cars standing in lines as straight as a running board He begged of a high nosed colored functionary not in khaki overalls but in maroon livery Where ll I put this boat The Abyssinian prince gave him a check and in a tone of extreme lack of personal interest snapped Take it down the aisle to the elevator Milt had followed the natural lines of traffic into the city he had spoken to no one the prince s snort was his welcome to Seattle Meekly he drove past the cars so ebon and silvery so smug and strong that they would have regarded a Teal bug as an insult Another attendant waved him into the elevator and Milt tried not to look surprised when the car started not forward but upward as though it had turned into an aeroplane When these adventures were over when he had had a shave and a shine and washed his hands and looked into a department store window that contained ten billion yards of silk draped against polished satinwood when he had felt unhappy over a movie theater large enough to contain ten times the population of Schoenstrom and been cursed by a policeman for jaywalking and had passed a hotel entirely full of diplomats and marble and caviare then he could no longer put off telephoning to Claire and humbly in a booth meant for an umbrella stand he got the Eugene Gilson house and to a female who said Yes in a tone which made it mean No he ventured May I speak to Miss Boltwood Miss Boltwood it seemed was out He was not sorry He was relieved He ducked out of the telephone booth with a sensation of escape Milt was in love with Claire she was to him the purpose of life he thought of her deeply and tenderly and longingly All the way into Seattle he had brooded about her remembered her every word and gesture recalled the curve of her chin and the fresh feeling of her hands But Claire had suddenly become too big In her were all these stores these office buildings for clever lawyers and surgeons these contemptuous trolley cars these careless people in beautiful clothes They were too much for him Desperately he was pushing them back back fighting for breath And she belonged with them He mailed the check for the stored car to her with a note written standing before a hacked wall desk in a branch post office which said only Here s check for the boat Did not know whether you would have room for it at house Tried to get you on phone phone again just as soon as rent room et cetera Hope having happy time M D He went out to the university On the trolley he relaxed But he did not exultantly feel that he had won to the Pacific he could not regard Seattle now as a magic city the Bagdad of modern caravans with Alaska and the Orient on one hand the forests to the north and eastward the spacious Inland Empire of the wheat He saw it as a place where you had to work hard just to live where busy policemen despised you because you didn t know which trolley to take where it was incredibly hard to remember even the names of the unceasing streets where the conductors said Step lively and there was no room to whistle no time to swap stories with a Bill McGolwey at an Old Home lunch counter He found the university he talked with the authorities about entering the engineering school the Y M C A gave him a list of rooms and because it was cheap he chose a cubbyhole in a flat over a candy store a low room which would probably keep out the rain but had no other virtues It had one bed one table one dissipated bureau two straight bare chairs and one venerable lithograph depicting a girl with ringlets shaking her irritating forefinger at a high church kitten The landlady consented to his importing an oil stove for cooking his meals He bought the stove with a box of oatmeal a jar of bacon and half a dozen eggs He bought a plane and solid geometry and an algebra At dinner time he laid the algebra beside his plate of anemic bacon and leaking eggs The eggs grew cold He did not stir He was reviewing his high school algebra He went down the pages word by word steadily quickly absolutely concentrated as concentrated as he would recently have been in a new problem of disordered transmission Not once did he stop to consider how glorious it would be to marry Claire or how terrifying it would be to marry Miss Boltwood Three hours went by before he started up bewildered rubbed his eyes picked at the chill bacon and altogether disgusting eggs and rambled out into the street Again he risked the scorn of conductors and jitney drivers He found Queen Anne Hill found the residence of mister Eugene Gilson He sneaked about it slipped into the gate prowled toward the house Flabby from the intensity of study he longed for the stimulus of Claire s smile But as he stared up at the great squares of the clear windows at the flare of white columns in the porch lights that smile seemed unreachable He felt like a rustic at court From the shelter of the prickly holly hedge he watched the house It was some kind of a party or what would folks like these call a party Limousines were arriving he had a glimpse of silken ankles frothy underskirts heard easy laughter saw people moving through a big blue and silver room caught a drifting tremor of music At last he saw Claire She was dancing with a young man as decorative as that confounded Saxton fellow he had met at Flathead Lake but younger than Saxton a laughing young man with curly black hair For the first time in his life Milt wanted to kill He muttered Damn damn DAMN as he saw the young man carelessly embracing Claire His fingers tingling his whole body yearning till every cell seemed a beating hammer Milt longed just once to slip his hand about Claire s waist like that He could feel the satin of her bodice and its warmth Then it seemed to him as Claire again passed the window that he did not know her at all He had once talked to a girl who resembled her but that was long ago He could understand a Gomez Dep and appreciate a brisk sports suit but this girl was of a world unintelligible to him Her hair in its dips and convolutions was altogether a puzzle How did she ever fix it like that Her low evening dress what was it made of some white stuff but was it silk or muslin or what Her shoulders were startling in their bare powdery smoothness how dare that young pup dance with her And her face that had seemed so jolly and friendly floated past the window as pale and illusive as a wisp of fog His longing for her passed into clumsy awe He remembered without resentment that once on a hilltop in Dakota she had coldly forbidden him to follow her With all the pleasure of martyrdom to make quite sure that he should realize how complete a fool he had been to intrude on Miss Boltwood he studied the other guests He gave them perhaps a glory they did not have There were girls sleek as ivory There was a lean stooped man very distinguished There was a bulky man in a dinner coat with a semi circle of mustache and eyes that even at a distance seemed to give impatient orders He would be a big banker or a lumberman It was the easy friendliness of all of them that most made Milt feel like an outsider If a servant had come out and ordered him away he would have gone meekly he fancied He straggled off too solidly unhappy to think how unhappy he was In his clammy room he picked up the algebra For a quarter hour he could not gather enough vigor to open it In his lassitude his elbows felt feeble his fingers were ready to drop off He slowly scratched the book open At one o clock he was reading algebra his face still and grim But already it seemed less heartily brick red He listlessly telephoned to Claire in the morning Hello Oh Miss Boltwood This is Milt Daggett Oh Oh how are you Why why I m I ve got settled I can get into the engineering school all right I m glad Uh enjoying Seattle Oh Oh yes The mountains Do you like it Oh Oh yes Sea and all Great town Uh w when are we going to see you Daddy had to go East left you his regards W when Why why I suppose you re awful awfully busy meeting people and all Yes I am rather but Her hedging uncomfortable tone changed to a cry of distress Milt I must see you Come up at four this afternoon Yes He rushed to a small hot tailor shop He panted Press m suit while I wait They gave him a pair of temporary trousers an undesirable pair of trousers belonging to a short fat man with no taste in fabrics and with these flapping about his lean legs he sat behind a calico curtain reading The War Cry and looking at a fashion plate depicting nine gentlemen yachtsmen each nine feet tall while the Jugoslav in charge unfeelingly sprinkled and ironed and patted his suit He spent ten minutes in blacking his shoes in his room and twenty minutes in getting the blacking off his fingers He was walking through the gate in the Gilson hedge at one minute to four But he had reached Queen Anne Hill at three For an hour he had walked the crest road staring at the steamers below alternately gripping his hands with desire of Claire and timorously finally deciding that he wouldn t go to her house wouldn t ever see her again He came into the hall tremblingly expecting some great thing some rending scene and she met him with a cool Oh this is nice Eva had some little white cakes made for us He felt like a man who has asked for a drink of cold charged water and found it warm and flat How Dandy house he muttered limply shaking her limp hand Yes isn t it a darling They do themselves awfully well here I m afraid your bluff plain democratic Westerners are a fraud I hear a lot more about society here than I ever did in the East The sets seem frightfully complicated She was drifting into the drawing room to a tapestry stool and Milt was awkwardly stalking a large wing chair while she fidgeted Everybody tells me about how one poor dear soul a charming lady who used to take in washing or salt gold mines or something and she came here a little while ago with billions and billions of dollars and tried to buy her way in by shopping for all the charities in town and apparently she s just as out of it here as she would be in London You and I aren t exclusive like that are we Somehow Her you and I was too kindly as though she was trying to put him at ease as though she knew he couldn t possibly be at ease With a horribly elaborate politeness with a smile that felt hot on his twitching cheeks he murmured Oh no No we No I guess If he knew what it was he guessed he couldn t get it out While he was trying to find out what had become of all the things there were to say in the world a maid came in with an astonishing object a small red shelved table on wheels laden with silver vessels and cake and sandwiches that were amazingly small and thin The maid was so starched that she creaked She glanced at Milt Claire didn t make him so nervous that he thought of his clothes but the maid did He was certain that she knew that he had blacked his own shoes knew how old were his clothes He was urging himself Must get new suit tomorrow ready made mustn t forget now be sure get suit tomorrow He wanted to apologize to the maid for existing He wouldn t dare to fall in love with the maid And he d kill the man who said he could be fool enough to fall in love with Miss Boltwood He sipped his tea and dropped sandwich crumbs and ached and panted and peeped at the crushing quantities of pictures and sconces and tables and chairs in the room and wondered what they did with all of them while Claire chattered Yes we weren t exclusive out on the road Didn t we meet funny people though Oh somehow that funny people sounds familiar But What fun that morning was at Pellago was it Heavens I m forgetting those beastly little towns already that place where we hazed the poor landlady who overcharged me Yes He was thinking of how much Claire would forget now Yes We certainly fixed her all right Uh did you get the storage check for your car Oh yes thank you So nice of you to bother with it Oh nothing at all nothing Nothing at all Uh Do you like Seattle Oh yes Such views the mountains Do you like it Oh yes Always wanted to see the sea Yes and Such a well built town Yes and They must do a lot of business here Yes they Oh yes I do like Seat He had darted from his chair brushed by the tea wagon ignoring its rattle and the perilous tipping of cups He put his hand on her shoulder snorted Look here We re both sparring for time Stop it It s it s all right Claire I want you to like me but I m not I m not like that woman you were telling about that s trying to butt in I know Lord I know so well what you re thinking You re thinking I m not up to the people you ve been seeing last couple of days not up to em yet anyway Well We ll be good friends Fearless now his awe gone in tenderness he lifted her chin looked straight into her eyes smiled But his courage was slipping He wanted to run and hide He turned abruptly grumbling Well better get back to work now I guess Her cry was hungry Oh please don t go She was beside him shyly picking at his sleeve I know what you mean I like you for being so understanding But I do like you You were the perfect companion Let s Oh let s have a walk and try to laugh again He definitely did not want to stay At this moment he did not love her He regarded her as an estimable young woman who for a person so idiotically reared had really shown a good deal of pluck out on the road where he wanted to be He stood in the hall disliking his old cap while she ran up to put on a top coat Mute casual they tramped out of the house together and down the hill to a region of shabby old brown houses like blisters on the hillside They had little to say and that little was a polite reminiscence of incidents in which neither was interested When they came back to the Gilson hedge he stopped at the gate with terrific respectableness removed his cap Good night she said cheerily Call me up soon again He did not answer Good night He said Good by and he meant it to be his last farewell He caught her hand hastily dropped it fled down the hill He was he told himself going to leave Seattle that evening That doubtless is the reason why he ran to a trolley to get to a department store before it closed and why precipitating himself upon a startled clerk he purchased a new suit of chaste blue serge a new pair of tan boots curiously like some he had seen on the university campus that morning and a new hat so gray and conservative and felty that it might have been worn by Woodrow Wilson He spent the evening in reading algebra and geometry and in telling himself that he was beautifully not thinking about Claire In the midst of it he caught himself at it and laughed What you re doing my friend is pretending you don t like Claire so that you can hide from your fool self the fact that you re going to sneak back to see her the first chance you get first time the watch dog is out Seriously now son Claire is impossible for you No can do Now that you ve been chump enough to leave home Oh Lord I wish I hadn t promised to take this room for all winter Wish I hadn t matriculated at the U But I m here now and I ll stick it out I ll stay here one year anyway and go back home Oh And to By Golly She liked me He was thinking of the wild rose teacher to whom he had given a lift back in Dakota He was remembering her daintiness her admiration Now there s somebody who d make me keep climbing but wouldn t think I was a poor hick If I were to drive back next spring I could find her CHAPTER XXVI A CLASS IN ENGINEERING AND OMELETS The one thing of which Milt Daggett was certain was that now he had managed to crawl into the engineering school he must get his degree in mechanical engineering He was older than most of his classmates He must hurry He must do four years work in two There has never been a Freshman not the most goggle eyed and earnest of them who has seen less of classmates thought less about outside activities more grimly centered the universe about his work Milt had sold his garage by mail to Ben Sittka and Heinie Rauskukle He had enough money to get through two years with economy His life was as simple and dull as it had been in Schoenstrom He studied while he cooked his scrappy meals he pinned mathematical formulae and mechanical diagrams on the wall and pored over them while he was dressing or while he was trying to break in the new shoes which were beautiful squeaky and confoundedly tight He was taking French and English and composition writing in addition to engineering and he made out a schedule of life as humorlessly as a girl grind who intends to be a Latin teacher When he was not at work or furiously running and yanking chest weights in the gymnasium he was attending concerts lectures Studying the life about him he had discovered that the best way to save time was to avoid the lazy friendships of college the pipe smoking yawning comfortable rather heavy altogether pleasant wondering about what ll we do next which occupies at least four hours a day for the average man in college He would have liked it as he had liked long talks about nothing with Bill McGolwey at the Old Home Lunch But he couldn t afford it He had to be ready to That was the point at which his reflections always came up with a jolt He was quite clear about the method of getting ready but he hadn t the slightest idea of what he was getting ready for The moment he had redecided to marry Claire he saw that his only possible future would be celibate machinery installing in Alaska and the moment he was content with the prospect of an engineer s camp in Alaskan wilds his thoughts went crazily fluttering after Claire Despite his aloofness Milt was not unpopular in his class The engineers had few of them the interest in dances athletics college journalism which distinguished the men in the academic course They were older and more conscious of a living to earn And Milt s cheerful How s the boy his manner of waving his hand as though to a good customer leaving the Red Trail Garage with the generator at last tamed indicated that he was a good fellow One group of collegians Milt did seek It is true that he had been genuine in scorning social climbers But it is also true that the men whom he sought to know were the university smart set Their satisfaction in his allegiance would have been lessened however had they known how little he cared for what they thought of him and with what cruel directness he was using them as models for the one purpose of pleasing Miss Claire Boltwood The American state universities admit in a pleased way that though Yale and Harvard and Princeton may be snobbish the state universities are the refuge of a myth called college democracy But there is no university near a considerable city into which the inheritors of the wealth of that city do not carry all the local social distinctions Their family rank their place in the unwritten peerage determines to which fraternity they shall be elected and the fraternity determines with whom men and girls they shall be intimate The sons and daughters of Seattle and Tacoma the scions of old families running in an unbroken line clear back to eighteen eighty were amiable to poor outsiders from the Yakima valley and the new claims of Idaho but they did not often invite them to their homes on the two hills and the Boulevard Yet it was these plutocrats whom Milt followed they whose boots and table manners cigarettes and lack of interest in theology he studied He met them in his English class He remarked Hello Smith and Mornin Jones as though he liked them but didn t care a hang whether they liked him And by and by he drifted into their fraternity dwelling house with a question about the next day s assignment and met their friends He sat pipe smoking silent cheerful and they seemed to accept him Whenever one of them felt that Milt was intruding and asked impertinent questions in the manner of a Pullman porter at a Darktown ball Milt had a peculiar level look which had been known to generate courtesy even in the offspring of a million dollars They found that he knew more about motor cars than any of them and as motor cars were among their greater gods they considered him wise He was incomparably simple and unpretentious they found his presence comfortable But there is a question as to what they would have thought had they known that lying awake in the morning Milt unsmilingly repeated Hair always straight down at the back Never rounded Nix on clippers over the ears Matisse is a popular nut artist Fashionable for the swells to laugh at him and the fellows on the college papers to rave about him Blinx and Severan the swellest the smartest haberdashery in the city The one way to get in Dutch is to mention labor leaders Never say Pleased to meet you Just look about halfway between bored and tol able and say How do you do All these first three weeks of his life in Seattle he had seen Claire only on his first call Twice he had telephoned to her On one of these high occasions she had invited him to accompany the family to the theater which meant to the movies and he had wretchedly refused the other time she had said that she might stay in Seattle all winter and she might go any day and they must be sure to have that good long walk and he had said oh yes ten or twelve unhappy times and had felt very empty as he hung up the receiver Then she wrote to invite him to late Sunday breakfast at the Gilsons they made a function of it and called it bruncheon The hour was given as ten thirty most people came at noon but Milt arrived at ten thirty one and found only a sleepy butler in sight He waited in the drawing room for five minutes feeling like a bill collector Into the room vaulted a medium sized medium looking amiable man Eugene Gilson babbling Oh I say so sorry to keep you waiting mister Daggett Rotten shame do come have a bun or something frightfully informal these bruncheons play auction Zallright no said Milt The host profusely led him to a dining room where in English fashion or something like English fashion or anyway a close approximation to the fictional pictures of English fashion kidneys and sausages and omelets waited in dishes on the side board mister Gilson poured coffee and chanted Do try the kidneys They re usually very fair Miss Boltwood tells me that you were very good to her on the trip Must have been jolly trip You going to be in town some time oh yes Claire said you were in the university engineering wasn t it have you ever seen our lumbermills do drop around some Try the omelet before the beastly thing gets cold do you mind kicking that button we ll have some more omelet in any time at the mill and I ll be glad to have some one show you through how did you find the roads along the Red Trail Why pretty fair said Milt Into the room precipitated missus Gilson in a smile a super sweater and a sports skirt that would have been soiled by any variety of sport more violent than pinochle and she was wailing as she came We re disgraced Gene is this mister Daggett how do you do so good of you to come do try the kidneys they re usually quite decent are the omelets warm you might ring for some more Gene for heaven s sake give me some coffee Miss Boltwood will be right down mister Daggett she told us how fortunate they were that they met you on the road did you like the trip how were the roads Why they were pretty good said Milt Claire arrived fresh and serene in white taffeta and she cried prettily I ought to have known that you d be prompt even if no one else in the world is so glad you came have you tried the kidneys and do have an oh I see you have tried the omelets how goes the work at the university Why fine said Milt He ate stolidly and looked pleased and sneaked in a glance at his new and still tight and still squeaky tan boots to make sure that they were as well polished as they had seemed at home From nowhere appeared a bustling weighty woman purring Hello hello hello is it possible that you re all up mister Daggett Yes do lead me to the kidneys And a man with the gray hair of a grandfather and the giggle of a cash girl bounced in clamoring Mornin expected to have bruncheon alone do we have some bridge Oh good morning mister Daggett how do you like Seattle Oh thanks so much yes just two Then Milt ceased to keep track of the conversation which bubbled over the omelets and stewed over the kidneys and foamed about the coffee and clashed above a hastily erected bridge table and altogether sounded curiously like four cars with four quite different things the matter with them all being tried out at once in a small garage People flocked in and nodded as though they knew one another too well to worry about it They bowed to him charmingly and instantly forgot him for the kidneys and sausages He sat looking respectable and feeling lonely by a cup of coffee till Claire dropping the highly unreal smile with which she had been listening to the elderly beau s account of a fishing trip he hadn t quite got around to taking slipped into a chair beside him and begged Are they looking out for you Milt Oh yes thank you You haven t been to see me Oh no but Working so darn hard What a strikingly original reason But have you really Honest Suddenly he wanted eternal man forever playing confidential small boy to the beloved to tell her about his classes and acquaintances to get pity for his bare room and his home cooking But round them blared the brazen interest in kidneys and as Claire glanced up with much brightness at another arrival Milt lost momentum and found that there was absolutely nothing in the world he could say to her He made a grateful farewell to the omelets and kidneys and escaped He walked many miles that day trying to remember how Claire looked CHAPTER XXVII THE VICIOUSNESS OF NICE THINGS What did you think of my nice Daggett boy Claire demanded of Eva Gilson the moment bruncheon was over Which one was Oh the boy you met on the road Why really I didn t notice him particularly I d rather fancied from the way you referred to him that he was awfully jolly and forceful but rather crude But I didn t notice him at all He seemed perfectly well bred but slightly heavy No he isn t that He Why did you lead spades reflected Claire They were in the drawing room resting after the tact and tumult of the bruncheon Claire had been here long enough now for the Gilsons to forget her comfortably and be affectionate and quarrelsome and natural and to admit by their worrying that even in their exalted social position there were things to fuss about I do think we ought to have invited Belle Torrens fretted missus Gilson We ve simply got to have her here soon mister Gilson speculated intensely But she s the dullest soul on earth and her husband spends all his spare time in trying to think up ways of doing me dirt in business Oh by the way did you get the water tap in the blue room fixed It s dripping all the time No I forgot it Well I do wish you d have it attended to It simply drips all the time I know I intended to phone the plumber Can t you phone him tomorrow from the office No I haven t time to bother with it But I do wish you would It keeps on dripping I know it doesn t seem to stop Well you remind me of it in the morning I m afraid I ll forget You better make a note of it If it keeps on dripping that way it s likely to injure something And I do wish you d tell the Jap not to put so much parsley in the omelet And I say how would an omelet be with a butter sauce over it Oh no I don t think so An omelet ought to be nice and dry Butter makes it so greasy besides with the price of butter But there s a richness to butter You d better make a note about the tap dripping in the blue room right now before you forget it Oh Why in heaven s name did we have Johnny Martin here He s dull as ditchwater I know but It is nice to go out to his place on the Point Oh Gene I do wish you d try and remember not to talk about your business so much You and mister Martin were talking about the price of lumber for at least half an hour Nothing of the kind We scarcely mentioned it Oh What car are you going to use this afternoon If we get out to the Barnetts I thought we might use the limousine Or no you ll probably go out before I do I have to read over some specifications and I promised to give Will a lift couldn t you take the Loco maybe you might drive yourself no I forgot the clutch is slipping a little well you might drive out and send the car back for me still there wouldn t hardly be time Listening to them as to a play Claire suddenly desired to scream Oh for heaven s sake quit fussing I m going up and drown myself in the blue room tap What does it matter Walk Take a surface car Don t fuss so Her wrath came from her feeling of guilt Yes Milt had been commonplace Had she done this to him Had she turned his cheerful ignorances into a careful stupor And she felt stuffy and choking and overpacked with food She wanted to be out on the road clear headed forcing her way through an independent human being with Milt not too far behind missus Gilson was droning I do think Mattie Vincent is so nice Rather dull I d call her yawned mister Gilson Mattie was the seventh of their recent guests whom he had called dull by now Not at all oh of course she doesn t dance on tables and quote Maeterlinck but she does have an instinct for the niceties and the proprieties her little house is so sweet everything just exactly right it may be only a single rose but always chosen so carefully to melt into the background and such adorable china I simply die of envy every time I see her Lowestoft plates And such a quiet way of reproving any bad taste the time that crank university professor was out there and spoke of the radical labor movement and Mattie just smiled at him and said If you don t mind let s not drag filthy lumberjacks into the drawing room they d hate it just as much as we would don t you think perhaps Oh damn nice china Oh let s hang all spinsters who are brightly reproving Claire was silently raging And particularly and earnestly confound all nicety and discretion of living She tried to break the spell of the Gilsons fussing She false heartedly fawned upon mister Gilson and inquired Is there anything very exciting going on at the mills Gene Exciting asked mister Gilson incredulously Why how do you mean Don t you find business exciting Why do you do it then Oh wellllll Of course Oh yes exciting in a way Well Well we ve had a jolly interesting time making staves for candy pails promises to be wonderfully profitable We have a new way of cutting them But you wouldn t be interested in the machinery Of course not You don t bore Eva with your horrid headachy business problems do you Claire cooed with low cunning Indeed no Don t think a chap ought to inflict his business on his wife The home should be a place of peace Yes said Claire But she wasn t thinking Yes She was thinking Milt what worries me now isn t how I can risk letting the nice people meet you It s how I can ever waste you on the nice people Oh I m spoiled for cut glass and velvet afternoons Eternal spiritual agony over blue room taps is too high a price even for four poster beds I want to be driving hiking living That afternoon after having agreed that mister Johnny Martin was a bore mister and missus Gilson decided to run out to the house of mister Johnny Martin They bore along the lifeless Claire mister Martin was an unentertaining bachelor who entertained There were a dozen supercilious young married people at his bayside cottage when the Gilsons arrived Among them were two eyebrow arching young matrons whom Claire had not met missus Corey and missus Betz We ve all heard of you Miss Boltwood said missus Betz You come from the East don t you Yes fluttered Claire trying to be cordial missus Corey and missus Betz looked at each other in a motionless wink and missus Corey prodded From New York No Brooklyn Claire tried not to make it too short Oh The tacit wink was repeated missus Corey said brightly much too brightly I was born in New York I wonder if you know the Dudenants Now Claire knew the Dudenants She had danced with that young ass Don Dudenant a dozen times But the devil did enter into her and possess her and to Eva Gilson s horror Claire said stupidly No o but I think I ve heard of them The condemning wink was repeated I hear you ve been doing such interesting things motoring and adventuring you must have met some terrible people along the way fished missus Betz Yes everybody does seem to feel that way But I m afraid I found them terribly nice flared Claire I always say that common people can be most agreeable missus Corey patronized Before Claire could kill her there wasn t any homicidal weapon in sight except a silver tea strainer missus Corey had pirouetted on Though I do think that we re much too kind to workmen and all the labor situation is getting to be abominable here in the West and upon my word to keep a maid nowadays you have to treat her as though she were a countess Why shouldn t maids be like countesses They re much more important said Claire sweetly It cannot be stated that Claire had spent any large part of her time in reading Karl Marx leading syndicalist demonstrations or hemming red internationalist flags but at this instant she was a complete revolutionist She could have executed missus Corey and pretty missus Betz with zeal she disliked the entire bourgeoisie she looked around for a Jap boy to call comrade and she again thought about the possibilities of the tea strainer for use in assassination She stolidly wore through the combined and exclamatory explanations of missus Corey missus Betz missus Gilson and mister Johnny Martin about the inherent viciousness of all maids and when the storm was over she said in a manner of honey and syrup You were speaking of the Dudenants weren t you missus Corey I do remember them now Poor Don Dudenant isn t it a pity he s such a fool His father is really a very decent old bore I observed missus Corey in prim horror regard the Dudenants as extremely delightful people I fancy we must be thinking of different families I mean the Manhattan Dudenants not the Brooklyn family Oh yes I meant the Manhattan family too the one that made its fortune selling shoddy woolens in the Civil War caressed Claire Right there her welcome by missus Corey and missus Betz ceased and without any of the unhappiness which the thought would have caused her three months before Claire reflected How they hate me The Gilsons had a number of thoughts upon the subject of tact to express to Claire on the way home But she who had always smiled who had been the obedient guest shrugged and snapped They re idiots those young women They re impertinent shopgirls in good frocks I like your Seattle It s a glorious city And I love so many of the fine simple real people I ve met here I admire your progress I do know how miraculously you ve changed it from a mining camp But for heaven s sake don t forget the good common hardiness of the miners Somehow London social distinctions seem ludicrous in American cities that twenty years ago didn t have much but board sidewalks and saloons I don t care whether it s Seattle or Minneapolis or Omaha or Denver I refuse to worry about the Duchess of Corey and the Baroness Betz and all the other wonderful imitations of gilt When a pair of finishing school flappers like Betz and Corey try to impress me with their superiority to workmen and their extreme aristocracy and Easternness they make me tired I am the East She had made peace with the Gilsons by night she had been reasonably repentant about not playing the game of her hosts but inside her eager heart she snuggled a warm thought She remembered how gaily she had once promised out on the road to come to Milt s room and cook for him She thought of it with homesick desire His room probably wasn t particularly decorative and she doubted his having an electric range but it would be fun to fry eggs again to see him fumbling with the dish washing to chatter and plan golden futures and not worry about the opinions of missus Corey and missus Betz The next afternoon the limousine was not busy and she borrowed it with the handsome Greek chauffeur She gave him an address not far from the university He complained Pardon me miss but I think you have the wrong number That block is a low quarter Probably But that s the right number He raised his Athenian eyebrows and she realized what a mistake she had made in not bringing the lethal tea strainer along When they had stopped in front of a cheap candy store he opened the door of the car with such frigid reserve that she thought seriously about slapping him She climbed the stingy flapping stairs and knocked at the first door in the upper hall It was opened by a large apron to which a sleepy woman was an unimportant attachment and out of the mass of apron and woman came a yawning mister Daggett s room is down the hall on the right Claire knocked at a door which had at various epochs been blue yellow and pink and now was all three No answer She tried the knob went in She could not tell whether it was the barrenness of the room or Milt s carefulness that caught her The uncarpeted boards of the floor were well swept He had only one plate one spoon but they were scoured and put away on newspaper covered shelves in a cupboard made of a soap box Behind a calico curtain was his new suit dismayingly neat on its hanger On the edge of the iron sink primly washed and spread out to dry was a tattered old rag At the sight of it at the thought of Milt solemnly washing dishes the tears began to creep to her eyes There was but one picture in the room a half tone of a girl clipped from a magazine devoted to actresses The name was cut off As she wondered at it Claire saw that the actress was very much like herself The only other ornament was a papier mache figure of a cat a cat reminiscent of the Lady Vere de Vere Claire picked it up On the bottom was the price mark three cents It was the price mark that pierced her She flung across the room dropped on his creaky cot bed howled Oh I ve been a beast a beast a beast All the pretty things limousines and marble baths thinking so much of them and not wanting them for him And he with so little with just nothing he that would appreciate jolly things so much here in this den and making it as tolerable as he can and me half ashamed of him instead of fighting for him I belong with Corey and Betz Oh I m so ashamed so bitterly ashamed She patted his bed smooth with nervous eager fingers She scraped a pin point of egg yolk off a platter Before she had been home five minutes she had written a note asking him to tea for next day CHAPTER XXVIII THE MORNING COAT OF mister HUDSON B RIGGS mister Hudson B Riggs now enters the tale somewhat tardily and making a quick exit all in a morning coat too tight about the shoulders and a smile of festivity too tight about the lips He looked as improbable as an undertaker s rubber plant Yet in his brief course he had a mighty effect upon the progress of civilization as exemplified in the social career of mister Milton Daggett mister Riggs had arrived at a golden position in Alaskan mining engineering by way of the farm the section gang the surveyor s chain and prospecting and his thick hands showed his evolution His purpose in life was to please missus Riggs and he wasn t ever going to achieve his purpose in life She wore spangles and her corsets creaked and she smiled nervously and could tell in a glance quicker than the one one hundred kodak shutter whether or not a new acquaintance was worth cultivating She had made mister Riggs thoroughly safe and thoroughly unhappy in the pursuit of society He stood about keeping from doing anything he might want to and he was profusely polite to young cubs whom he longed to have in his office so that he could get even with them What mister Riggs wanted to do at the third large tea given by missus Gilson for Miss Claire Boltwood was to sneak out on the sun porch and play over the new records on the phonograph but the things he had heard from missus Riggs the last time he d done that had convinced him that it was not a wise method of escape So he stood by the fireplace safe on one side at least and ate lettuce sandwiches which he privately called cow feed and listened to a shining largely feminine crowd rapidly uttering unintelligible epigrams from which he caught only the words Ripping hand trained nurse whipcord really worth seeing lost the ball near the second hole most absurd person new maid thanks so much He was hoping that some one would come around and let him be agreeable He knew that he stood the ride home with missus Riggs much better after he had been agreeable to people he didn t like What mister Riggs did not know was that a young man in uninteresting blue who looked like a good tennis player was watching him It wasn t because he detected a fellow soul in purgatory but because he always was obsequious outside of his office that mister Riggs bowed so profusely that he almost lost his tea cup when the young man in blue drifted to him and suggested I hear you re in the Alaskan mining game mister Riggs Oh yes Do you get up there much now No not much I hope to hit Alaska some day I m taking engineering at the U Do you Straight mister Riggs violently set his cup down on a table missus Riggs would later tell him that he d put it down in the wrong place but never mind He leaned over Milt and snarled Offer me a cigarette I don t know if they smoke here and I dassn t be the first to try Say boy Alaska I wish I was there now Say it beats all hell how good tea can taste in a tin cup and how wishy washy it is in china Boy I don t know anything about you but you look all right and when you get ready to go to Alaska you come to me and I ll see if I can t give you a chance to go up there But don t ever come back When the crowd began bubblingly to move toward the door Milt prepared to move and bubble with them Though Claire s note had sounded as though she was really a little lonely at the tea she had said nothing to him except So glad you came Do you know Dolly Ransome Dolly this is my nice mister Daggett Take him and make him happy Dolly hadn t made him in the least happy She had talked about tennis she had with some detail described her remarkable luck in beating one Sally Saunders three sets Now Milt was learning tennis He was at the present period giving two hours a week to tennis two to dancing two to bridge But he preferred cleaning oil wells to any of these toilsome accomplishments and it must sadly be admitted that all the while he was making his face bright at Dolly he was wondering what would happen if he interrupted Dolly s gurgling galloping giggling multitudinousness by shouting Oh shut up When it seemed safe to go and he tried to look as though he too were oozing out to a Crane Simplex Claire slipped beside him soft as a shadow and whispered Please don t go I want to talk to you Please There was fluttering wistfulness in her voice though instantly it was gone as she hastened to the door and was to be heard asserting that she did indeed love Seattle Milt looked out into the hall He studied a console with a curious black and white vase containing a single peacock feather and a gold mirror shimmering against a gray wall Lovely stuff I like that mirror Like a slew in the evening But it isn t worth being a slave for I m not going to be a mister Riggs Poor devil he s more of a servant than any of these maids Certainly am sorry for that poor fish He ll have a chance to take his coat off and sit down and smoke when he s dead The guests were gone the Gilsons upstairs Claire came running seized Milt s sleeve coaxed him to the davenport in the drawing room then sighed and rubbed her forehead and looked so tired that he could say nothing but Hope you haven t been overdoing No just just talking too much He got himself to say Miss Ransome the one that s nuts about tennis she s darn nice Is she Yes she s she s What do you hear from your father Oh he s back at work Trip do him good Oh a lot Did he Milt Tell me about you What are you doing What are you studying How do you live Do you really cook your own meals Do you begin to get your teeth into the engineering Oh do tell me everything I want to know so much There isn t a whole lot to tell Mostly I m getting back into math Been out of touch with it I find that I know more about motors than most of the fellows That helps And about living oh I keep conservative Did you know I d sold my garage Oh I didn t I didn t He wondered why she said it with such stooping shame but he went on mildly Well I got a pretty good price but of course I don t want to take any chances on running short of coin so I m not splurging much And He looked at his nails and whistled a bar or two and turned his head away and looked back with a shy And I m learning to play bridge and tennis and stuff Oh my dear It was a cry of pain She beat her hands for a moment before she murmured When are we going to have our lessons in dancing and in making an impression on sun specks like Dolly Ransome I don t know he parried Then looking at her honestly he confessed I don t believe we re ever going to Claire I can t do it I m no good for this tea game You know how clumsy I was I spilled some tea and I darn near tripped over some woman s dress and Oh I m not afraid of them Now that I get a good close look at this bunch they seem pretty much like other folks except maybe that one old dame says cawn t But I can t do the manners stunt I can t get myself to give enough thought to how you ought to hold a tea cup Oh those things don t matter they don t matter Besides everybody likes you only you re so terribly cautious that you never let them see the force and courage and all that wonderful sweet dear goodness that s in you And as for your manners heaven knows I m no P G Wodehouse valet But I ll teach you all I know Claire I appreciate it a lot but I m not so darn sure I want to learn I m getting scared I watched that bird named Riggs here today He s a regular fellow or he was but now he s simply lost in the shuffle I don t want to be one of the million ghosts in a city Seattle is bad enough it s so big that I feel like a no see um in a Norway pine reserve But New York would be a lot worse I don t want to be a mister Riggs Yes but I m not a missus Riggs What do you He did not finish asking her what she meant She was in his arms she was whispering My heart is so lonely and the room was still The low sun flooded the windows swam in the mirror in the hall but they did not heed did not see its gliding glory Not till there was a sound of footsteps did she burst from his arms spring to her reflection in the glass of a picture and shamefacedly murmur to him over her shoulder My hair it s a terrible giveaway He had followed her he stood with his arm circling her shoulder She begged No Please no I m frightened Let s oh let s have a walk or something before you scamper home Look My dear Let s run away and explore the town and not come back till late evening Yes Let s They walked from Queen Anne Hill through the city to the docks There was nothing in their excited childish Oh see that and There s a dandy car and Ohhhhh that s a Minnesota license wonder who it is to confess that they had been so closely so hungrily together They swung along a high walk overlooking the city wharf They saw a steamer loading rails and food for the government railroad in Alaska They exclaimed over a nest of little tarry fishing boats They watched men working late to unload Alaska salmon They crossed the city to Jap Town and its writhing streets its dark alleys and stairways lost up the hillsides They smiled at black eyed children and found a Japanese restaurant and tried to dine on raw fish and huge shrimps and roots soaked in a very fair grade of light medium motor oil With Milt for guide Claire discovered a Christianity that was not of candles and shifting lights and insinuating music nor of carpets and large pews and sound oratory but of hoboes blinking in rows and girls in gospel bonnets and little silver and crimson placards of Bible texts They stopped on a corner to listen to a Pentecostal brother to an I W W speaker to a magnificent negro who boomed in an operatic baritone that the Day of Judgment was coming on April eleven nineteen twenty three at three in the morning In the streets of Jap Town in cheap motion picture theaters in hotels for transient workmen she found life running swift and eager and many colored and it seemed to her that back in the house of four posters and walls of subdued gray life was smothered in the very best pink cotton batting Milt s delight in every picturesque dark corner and the colloquial eloquence of the street orators stirred her And when she saw a shopgirl caress the hand of a slouching beau in threadbare brown her own hand slipped into Milt s and clung there But they came shyly up to the Gilson hedge and when Milt chuckled Bully walk let s do it again she said only Oh yes I did like it Very much He had abruptly dropped his beautiful new felt hat He was clutching her arms demanding Can you like me Oh my God Claire I can t play at love I m mad I just live in you You re my blood and soul Can I become the kind of man you like My dear She was fiercely addressing not him alone but the Betzes and Coreys and Gilsons and Jeff Saxtons don t you forget for one moment that all these people here or Brooklyn either that seem so aloof and amused are secretly just plain people with enamel on and you re to have the very best enamel if it s worth while I m not sure that it is You re going to kiss me No Please no I don t I don t understand us even now Can t we be just playmates a while yet But I do like you She fled When she reached the hall she found her eyelids wet It was the next afternoon Claire was curled on the embroidered linen counterpane of her bed thinking about chocolates and Brooklyn and driving through Yellowstone Park and corn fritters and satin petticoats versus crepe de chine and Mount Rainier and Milt and spiritualism and manicuring when missus Gilson prowled into her room and demanded Busy so casually that Claire was suspicious No Not very Something up A nice party Come down and meet an amusing man from Alaska Claire took her time powdering her nose and ambled downstairs and into the drawing room to find Jeff Saxton mister Geoffrey Saxton who is the height of Brooklyn Heights standing by the fireplace smiling at her CHAPTER XXIX THE ENEMY LOVE But at second glance was it Jeff This man was tanned to a thick even brown in which his eyes were startlingly white His hands were burned red there was a scar across one of them and he was standing with them cockily at his hips all unlike the sleekly noisily quiet Jeff of Brooklyn He was in corduroy trousers and belted corduroy jacket with a khaki colored flannel shirt But his tranquilly commanding smile was Jeff s and his lean grace and Jeff s familiar amused voice greeted her paralyzed amazement with Hello pard Ain t I met you some place in Montana Well where in the Just landed from Alaska Had to run up there from California How are you little princess His hand was out to her then both hands beseechingly but she did not run to him as she had at Flathead Lake She stalked him cautiously and shook hands much too heartily She sought cover in the wing chair and much too cordially she invited Tell me all about it He was watching her Already his old pursuing determination his steady dignity were beginning to frighten her But he calmly dropped into a straight chair and obliged It s really been quite a lively journey Didn t know I could like roughing it so well And it was real roughing it pretty much Oh not dangerous at all but rather vigorous I had to canoe up three hundred miles of a shallow river with one Indian guide making a portage every ten miles or so and we got tipped over in the rapids now and then the Big Chief almost got drowned once and we camped at night in the original place where they invented mosquitoes and one morning I shot a black bear just in time to keep him from eating my boots Oh she sighed in admiration and Oh again uneasily Nothing had been said about it Jeff was the last person in the world to spoil his triumph by commenting on it but both of them knew that they had violently changed places that now it was she who was the limp indoor dweller and he who was the ruddy ranger that as he had admired her at Flathead Lake so now it was hers to admire and his to be serenely heroic She was not far from the worshiping sub deb in her sighing How did you get the scar That Oh nothing Please tell me Really and truly Nothing at all Just a drunken fellow with a knife playing the fool I didn t have to touch him quite sure he could have given me a frightful beating and all that sort of thing It was the Big Chief who got rid of him He cut you With a kniiiiiife Ohhhhhhh She ran to him pityingly stroked the scar looked down at him with filmy eyes Then she tried to retreat but he retained her hand glanced up at her as though he knew her every thought She felt weak How could she escape him Please she begged flutteringly If he held her hand another moment she trembled she d be on his lap in his arms lost And he was holding it He was Oh he was too old for her Yes and too paternal But still Life with Jeff would be protected kindly honorable Yet all the time she wanted and stormily knew she wanted to be fleeing to the boy Milt her mate to run away with him hand in hand discovering all the colored world laughing at life not afraid of losing dignity In fear of Jeff s very kindliness and honor she jerked her hand free Then she tried to smile like a clever fencer As she retreated to her chair she stammered Did you Was Alaska interesting He did not let her go this time Easy cat like for all his dry gravity he sauntered after her and with a fine high seriousness pleaded his case Claire dear those few weeks of fighting nature were a revelation to me I m going to have lots more of it As it happens they need me there There s plenty of copper but there s big transportation and employment problems that I seem better able to solve than the other chaps though of course I m an absolute muff when it comes to engineering problems But I ve had certain training and I m going to arrange things so that I get up there at least once a year Next summer I ll make a much longer trip see the mountains oh glorious mountains and funny half Russian towns and have some fishing Wandering The really big thing Even finer than your superb plucky trip through Wasn t plucky I m a cry baby she said like a bad contradictory little girl He didn t argue it He smiled and said Tut and placidly catalogued her with You re the pluckiest girl I ve ever seen and it s all the more amazing because you re not a motion picture Tomboy but essentially exquisite I m a grub Very well then You re a grub So am I And I like it And when I make the big Alaskan trip next year I want you to go along Claire Haven t you any idea how terribly close to me the thought of you has been these weeks You ve guided me through the wilderness It s I m glad She sprang up beseeching Jeff dear you re going to stay for tea I must run up and powder my nose Not until you say you re glad to see me Child dear we ve been ambling along and No You aren t a child any more You re a woman And if I ve never been quite a man but just a dusty office machine that s gone now I ve got the wind of the wilderness in my lungs Man and woman My woman That s all I m going to say now but Oh my God Claire I do need you so He drew her head to his shoulder and for an instant she rested there But as she looked up she saw coming age in the granulated skin of his throat He needs me but he d boss me I d be the cunning child wife even at fifty she worried and Hang him it s like his superiority to beat poor Milt even at adventuring and to be such a confounded Modest Christian Gentleman about it You d you re so dreadfully managing she sighed aloud For the first time in all their acquaintanceship Jeff s pride broke and he held her away from him while his lips were pathetic and he mourned Why do you always try to hurt me Oh my dear I don t Is it because you resent the decent things I have managed to do I don t understand If I have an idea for a party you think I m managing If I think things out deeply you say I m dull Oh you aren t I didn t mean What are you A real woman or one of these flirts that love to tease a man because he s foolish enough to be honestly in love I m not honorable estly I m not Jeff It s You don t quite make me It s just that I m not in love with you I like you and respect you terribly but I m going to make you love me His clutching fingers hurt her arm and somehow she was not angry but stirred But I m not going to try now Forget the Alaskan caveman Remember I haven t even used the word love I ve just chatted about fjords or whatever they are but one of these days No I won t do it I want to stay here in Seattle a few days and take you on jolly picnics but Would you rather I didn t even do that I m He dropped her arm kneaded his forehead with the heel of his palm I can t stand being regarded as a bothersome puppy I can t stand it I can t Please stay Jeff We ll have some darling drives and things We ll go up Rainier as far as we can He stayed He was anecdotal and amusing at tea that afternoon Claire saw how the Gilsons and two girls who dropped in admired him That made her uneasy And when missus Gilson begged him to leave his hotel and stay with them he refused with a quick look at Claire that hurt her He wants me to be free He s really so much more considerate than Milt And I hurt him Even his pride broke down And I ve spoiled Milt s life by meddling And I ve hurt the Gilsons feelings And I m not much of a comfort to father Oh I m absolutely no good she agonized CHAPTER XXX THE VIRTUOUS PLOTTERS mister Geoffrey Saxton in Alaskan tan and New York evening clothes and Piccadilly poise was talking to the Eugene Gilsons while Claire finished dressing for the theater missus Gilson observed She s the dearest thing We ve become awfully fond of her But I don t think she knows what she wants to do with life She s rather at loose ends Who is this Daggett boy some university student whom she seems to like Well since you speak of him I hadn t meant to unless you did I want to be fair to him What did she tell you about him Jeff asked confidentially Nothing except that he s a young engineer and frightfully brave and all those uncomfortable virtues and she met him in Yellowstone Park or somewhere and he saved her from a bear or was it a tramp from something unnecessary at any rate Eva I don t want to be supercilious but the truth is that this young Daggett is a rather dreadful person He s been here at the house hasn t he How did he strike you Not at all He s silent and as dull as lukewarm tea but perfectly inoffensive Then he s cleverer than I thought Daggett is anything but dull and inoffensive and if he can play that estimable role It seems that he is the son of some common workman in the Middlewest he isn t an engineer at all he s really a chauffeur or a taxi driver or something and he ran into Claire and Henry B on the road and somehow insinuated himself into their graces far from being silent and commonplace he appears to have some strange kind of charm which Jeff sighed I don t understand at all I simply don t understand it I met him in Montana with the most gorgeously atrocious person I ve ever encountered one Pinky Westlake or some such a name positively a crook He tried to get Boltwood and myself interested in the commonest kind of a mining swindle hinted that we were to join him in cheating the public And this Daggett was his partner they actually traveled together But I do want to be just I m not sure that Daggett was aware of his partner s dishonesty That isn t what worries me about the lad It s his utter impossibility He s as crude as iron ore When he s being careful he may manage to be inconspicuous but give him the chance Really I m not exaggerating when I say that at thirty five he ll be dining in his shirt sleeves and sitting down to read the paper with his shoes off and feet up on the table But Claire you know what a dear Quixotic soul she is she fancies that because this fellow repaired a puncture or something of the sort for her on the road she s indebted to him and the worse he is the more she feels that she must help him And affairs of that kind Oh it s quite too horrible but there have been cases you know where girls as splendid and fine and well bred as Claire herself have been trapped into low marriages by their loyalty to cadging adventurers Oh groaned missus Gilson and Good Lord lamented mister Gilson delighted by the possibility of tragedy and Really I m not exaggerating said Jeff enthusiastically What are we going to do demanded missus Gilson while mister Gilson being of a ready and inventive mind exclaimed By Jove you ought to kidnap her and marry her yourself Jeff I d like to But I m too old They beautifully assured him that he was a blithe young thing with milk teeth and with a certain satisfaction Jeff suggested I tell you what we might do Of course it s an ancient stunt but it s good I judge that Daggett hasn t been here at the house much Why not have him here so often that Claire will awaken to his crudity and get sick of him We ll do it thrilled missus Gilson We ll have him for everything from nine course dinners with Grandmother Eaton s napkins on view to milk and cold ham out of the ice box When Claire doesn t invite him I will CHAPTER XXXI THE KITCHEN INTIMATE Milt had become used to the Gilson drawing room He was no longer uncomfortable in the presence of its sleek fatness though at first not knowing that there were such resources as interior decorators he had been convinced that to have created the room the Gilsons must have known everything in the world Now he glanced familiarly at its white paneling its sconces like silver candlesticks the inevitable davenport inevitably backed by an amethyst shaded piano lamp and a table crowded with silver boxes and picture frames He liked the winsomeness of light upon velvet and polished wood It was not the drawing room but the kitchen that dismayed him In Schoenstrom he had known that there must somewhere be beautiful parlors but he had trusted in his experience of kitchens Kitchens according to his philosophy were small smelly rooms of bare floors and provided with one oilcloth covered table one stove the front draft always broken and propped up with the lid lifter one cupboard with panes of tin pierced in rosettes and one stack of dirty dishes But the Gilson kitchen had the efficiency of a laboratory and the superciliousness of a hair dresser s booth With awe Milt beheld walls of white tiles a cork floor a gas range large as a hotel stove a ceiling high refrigerator of enamel and nickel zinc topped tables and a case of utensils like a surgeon s knives It frightened him it made more hopelessly unapproachable than ever the Alexandrian luxury of the great Gilsons The Vanderbilts kitchen must be like this And maybe King George s He was viewing the kitchen upon the occasion of an intimate Sunday evening supper to which he had been yearningly invited by missus Gilson The maids were all out The Gilsons and Claire Milt and Jeff Saxton shoutingly prepared their own supper While missus Gilson scrambled eggs and made coffee the others set the table and brought cold ham and a bowl of salad from the ice box Milt had intended to be a silent but deft servitor When he had heard that he was to come to supper with the returned mister Geoffrey Saxton he had first been panic shaken then resolved He d let old iron face Saxton do the high and mighty Let him stand around and show off his clothes and adjectives way he did at Flathead Lake But he Milt would be on the job He d help get supper and calmly ignore Jeff s rudeness Only Jeff wasn t rude He greeted Milt with Ah Daggett This is so nice And Milt had no chance to help It was Jeff who anticipated him and with a pleasant Let me get that I m kitchen broke snatched up the cold ham and salad It was Jeff who found the supper plates while Milt was blunderingly wondering how any one family could use a whole furniture store full of different kinds of china It was Jeff who sprang to help Claire wheel in the tea wagon and so captured the chance to speak to her for which Milt had been maneuvering these five minutes When they were settled Jeff glowed at him and respectfully offered I thought of you so often Daggett on a recent little jaunt of mine You d have been helpful Where was that asked Milt suspiciously wondering and waiting to see whether you could take cold ham in your fingers Oh in Alaska In Alaska Milt was dismayed Yes just a business trip there There s something I wish you d advise me about He was humble And Milt was uneasy He grumbled What s that I ve been wondering whether it would be possible to use wireless telephony in Alaska But I m such a dub at electricity Do you know What would be the cost of installing a wireless telephone plant with a hundred mile radius Gee I don t know Oh so sorry Well I wonder if you can tell me about wireless telegraphy then No I don t know anything about that either Milt had desperately tried to make his answer gracious but somehow He hated this devil s obsequiousness more than he had his chilliness at Flathead Lake He had a feeling that the Gilsons had delightedly kicked each other under the table that for all her unchanging smile Claire was unhappy And she was so far off a white wraith floating beyond his frantic grasp It doesn t matter really But I didn t know So you ve started in the engineering school at the University of Washington Saxton was purring Have you met Gid Childers there son of old Senator Childers charming people I ve seen him He has a Stutz no his is the Mercer sighed Milt He hated himself for it but he couldn t quite keep the awe out of his voice People with Mercers Claire seemed to be trying to speak She made a delicate feminine clairesque approximation to clearing her throat But Jeff ignored her and with almost osculatory affection continued to Milt Do let me know if there s anything I can do to help you We re acquainted with two or three of your engineering faculty at the Office They write in about various things Do you happen to know doctor Philgren Oh yes Say He s a wonder Milt was betrayed into exclaiming Yes Good chap I believe He s been trying to get a job with us We may give him one Just tell him you re a friend of mine and that he s to give you any help he can Milt choked on a Thanks And now that we re just the family here together how goes the financial side Can I be of any assistance in introducing you to some engineering firm where you could do a little work on the side You could make quite a little money So confoundedly affectionate and paternal Milt said irritably Thanks but I don t need to do any work I ve got plenty of money How pleasant Saxton s voice was smooth as marshmallow You re fortunate I had quite a struggle to get through Princeton Wasn t mister Gilson contrasting Saxton s silk shirt with Milt s darned cotton covering and in light of that contrast chuckling at Milt s boast and Saxton s modesty Milt became overheated His scalp prickled and his shoulder blades were damp As Saxton turned from him and crooned to Claire More ham honey Milt hated himself He was in much of the dramatic but undesirable position of a man in pajamas not very good pajamas who has been locked out in the hotel corridor by the slamming of his door He was in the frame of mind of a mongrel of a real Boys Dog at a Madison Square dog show He had a faint shrewd suspicion of Saxton s game But what could he do about it He felt even more out of place when the family forgot him and talked about people of whom he had never heard He sat alone on an extremely distant desert isle and ate cold ham and wished he were in Schoenstrom Claire had recovered her power of speech She seemed to be trying to bring him into the conversation so that the family might appreciate him She hesitated and thought with creased brows and brought out Uh uh oh Oh Milt How much is gas selling at now Milt left that charming and intimate supper party at nine He said Got to work on on my analytical geometry as though it was a lie and he threw Good night at Saxton as though he hated his kind good benefactor and when he tried to be gracious to missus Gilson the best he could get out was Thanks f inviting me They expansively saw him to the door Just as he thought that he had escaped Saxton begged Oh Daggett I was arguing with a chap What color are Holstein Friesian cattle Red Black and white Milt said eagerly He heard missus Gilson giggle He stood on the terrace wiping his forehead and without the least struggle finally and irretrievably admitting that he would never see Claire Boltwood or any of her friends again Not never He had received from missus Gilson a note inviting him to share their box at the first night of a three night Opera Season He had spent half a day in trying to think of a courteously rude way of declining A straggly little girl came up from the candy shop below his room demanding Say are you mister Daggett Say there s some woman wants to talk to you on our telephone Say tell them we ain t supposed to be no messenger office You ain t supposed to call no upstairs people on our telephone We ain t supposed to leave the store and go trotting all over town to Gee a nickel gee thank you don t mind what ma says she s always kicking On the telephone he heard Claire s voice in an agitated Milt Meet me down town at the Imperial Motion Picture Theater right away Something I ve got to tell you I ll be in the lobby Hurry When he bolted in she was already in the lobby agitatedly looking over a frame of stills She ran to him hooked her fingers in his lapel poured out They ve invited you to the opera I want you to come and put it all over them I m almost sure there s a plot They want to show me that you aren t used to tiaras and saxophones and creaking dowagers and tulle Beat em Beat em Come to the opera and be awf ly aloof and supercilious You can Yes you can And be sure wear evening clothes Now I ve got to hurry B but Don t disappoint me I depend on you Oh say you will I will She was gone whisking into the Gilson limousine He was in a glow at her loyalty in a tremor of anger at the meddlers But he had never worn evening clothes He called it a dress suit and before the complications of that exotic garb he was flabby with anxiety To Milt and to Schoenstrom to Bill McGolwey even to Prof Jones and the greasily prosperous Heinie Rauskukle the dress suit was the symbol and proof the indication and manner of sophisticated wealth In Schoenstrom even waiters do not wear dress suits For one thing there aren t any waiters There is one waitress at the Leipzig House Miss Annie Schweigenblat but you wouldn t expect Miss Schweigenblat to deal them off the arm in black trousers with braid down the side No a dress suit was what the hero wore in the movies and the hero in the movies when he wasn t a cowpuncher was an ex captain of the Yale football team and had chambers and a valet You could tell him from the valet because he wasn t so bald It is true that Milt had heard that in saint Cloud there were people who wore dress suits at parties but then saint Cloud was a city fifteen or sixteen thousand How could he get away with a dress suit How could he keep from feeling foolish in a low cut vest and what the deuce would he do with the tails Did you part em or roll em up when you sat down And wouldn t everybody be able to tell from his foolish look that he didn t belong in one He could hear A D T boys and loafers in front of pool rooms whispering Look at the piker in the rented soup and fish For of course he d rent one Nobody bought them except plutes like Henry B Boltwood He agitatedly walked up and down for an hour peering into haberdashery windows looking for a kind faced young man He found him in Ye Pall Mall Toggery Shoppe Shoes an open faced young man who was gazing through the window as sparklingly as though he was thinking of going as a missionary to India and liked curry Milt ironed out his worried face clumped in demanded fraternally Say old man don t some of these gents furnishings stores have kind of little charts that tell just what you wear with dress suits and Prince Alberts and everything You bet said the kind faced young man West of Chicago You bet means Rather and Yes indeed and On the whole I should be inclined to fancy that there may be some vestiges of accuracy in your curious opinion and You re a liar but I can t afford to say so The kind faced young man brought from behind the counter a beautiful brochure illustrated with photographs of Phoebus Apollo in what were described as American Beauty Garments neat natty nobby new The center pages faithfully catalogued the ties shirts cuff links spats boots hats to wear with evening clothes morning clothes riding clothes tennis costumes polite mourning As he looked it over Milt felt that his wardrobe already contained all these gentlemanly possessions With the aid of the clerk and the chart he purchased a tradition haunted garment with a plate armor bosom and an opening as crooked as the Missouri River a white tie which in his strong red hands looked as silly as a dead fish waistcoat pearl links and studs For the first time except for seizures of madness during two or three visits to Minneapolis motor accessory stores he caught the shopping fever The long shining counter the trim red stained shelves the glittering cases the racks of flaunting ties were beautiful to him and beckoning He revolved a pleasantly clicking rack of ties then turned and fought his way out He bought pumps which cost exactly twice as much as the largest sum which he had allowed himself He bought a newspaper and in the want columns found the advertisement Silberfarb the Society Tailor DRESS SUITS TO RENT Snappiest in the City Despite the superlative snappiness of mister Silberfarb s dress suits his establishment was a loft over a delicatessen approached by a splintery stairway along which hung shabby signs announcing the upstairs offices of J L T J O Regan Private Detectives The Zenith Spiritualist Church Messages by reverend Lulu Paughouse The International Order of Live Ones Seattle Wigwam and Mme Lavourie Sulphur Baths The dead air of the hallway suggested petty crookedness Milt felt that he ought to fight somebody but there being no one to fight he banged along the flapping boards of the second floor hallway to the ground glass door of Silberfarb the Society Tailor who was also as an afterthought on a straggly placard Pressng Cleang While U Wait He belligerently shouldered into a low room The light from the one window was almost obscured by racks of musty smelling black clothes which stretched away from him in two dismal aisles that resembled a morgue of unhappy dead men indecently hung up on hooks On a long clumsily carpentered table a small Jew collarless sweaty unshaven was darning trousers under an evil mantle gaslight The Jew wrung out his hands and tried to look benevolent Want to rent a dress suit said Milt I got just the t ing for you The little man unfolded himself galloped down the aisle seized the first garment that came to hand and came back to lay it against Milt s uncomfortable frame bumbling Fine mister fy en Milt studied the shiny seamed worn buttonholed limp object with dislike Its personality was disintegrated The only thing he liked about it was the good garage stink of gasoline That s almost worn out he growled At this sacrilege mister Silberfarb threw up his hands with the dingy suit flapping in them like a bed quilt shaken from a tenement window He looked Milt all over coldly His red but shining eyes hinted that Milt was a clodhopper and no honest wearer of evening clothes Milt felt humble but he snapped No good Want something with class Vell that was good enough for a university professor at the big dance but if you say so In the manner of one who is being put to an unfair amount of trouble mister Silberfarb returned the paranoiac dress suit to the rack sighing patiently as he laboriously draped it on a hanger He peered and pawed He crowed with throaty triumph and brought back a rich ripe thing of velvet collar and cuffs He fixed Milt with eyes that had become as sulky as the eyes of a dog in August dust Now that you can t beat that if you vant class and it ll fit you like a glove Oh that s an ellllegant garment Shaking himself out of the spell of those contemptuous eyes Milt opened his brochure studied the chart and in a footnote found Never wear velvet collars or cuffs with evening coat Nope Nix on the velvet he remarked Then the little man went mad and ran around in circles He flung the ellllegant garment on the table He flapped his arms and wailed What do you vant What do you vannnnt That s a hundred and fifty dollar dress suit That belonged to one of the richest men in the city He sold it to me because he was going to Japan Well you can send it to Japan after him I want something decent Have you got it or shall I go some place else The tailor instantly became affectionate How about a nice Tuxedo he coaxed Nope It says here let me see oh yes here it is it says here in the book that for the theater with ladies should not wear dinner coat or so called Tuxedo but Oh dem fellows what writes books they don t know nothing Absolute They make it up Huh Well I guess I ll take my chance on them The factory knows the ignition better n any repair man Vell say you re a hard fellow to please I ll give you one of my reserve stock but you got to leave me ten dollars deposit instead of five mister Silberfarb quite cheerfully unlocked a glass case behind the racked and ghostly dead he brought out a suit that seemed to Milt almost decent And it almost fitted when after changing clothes in a broiling boiling reeking gasoline pulsing hole behind the racks he examined it before a pier glass But he caught the tailor assisting the fit by bunching up a roll of cloth at the shoulder Again Milt snapped and again the tailor suffered and died and to a doubting heathen world maintained the true gospel of What do you vannnnt It ain t stylish to have the dress suit too tight All the gents is wearing em loose and graceful But in the end after Milt had gone as far as the door mister Silberfarb admitted that one dress coat wouldn t always fit all persons without some alterations The coat did bag a little and it was too long in the sleeves but as Milt studied himself in his room by placing his small melancholy mirror on the bureau then on a chair then on the floor finally to get a complete view clear out in the hall he admitted with stirring delight that he looked pretty fair in the bloomin outfit His clear face his shining hair his straight shoulders seemed to go with the costume He wriggled into his top coat and marched out of his room theater bound with the well fed satisfaction of a man who is certain that no one is giggling Look at the hand me downs His pumps did alternately pinch his toes and rub his heels the trousers cramped his waist and he suspected that his tie had gone wandering But he swaggered to the trolley and sat as one rich and famous and very kind to the Common People till Another man in evening clothes got on the car and Milt saw that he wore a silk hat and a white knitted scarf that he took out and examined a pair of white kid gloves He d forgotten the hat He was wearing his gray felt He could risk the gloves but the hat the stovepipe and the chart had said to wear one he was ruined He turned up the collar of his top coat to conceal his white tie tried to hide each of his feet behind the other to cover up his pumps sought to change his expression from that of a superior person in evening clothes to that of a decent fellow in honest Regular Clothes Had the conductor or any of the passengers realized that he was a dub in a dress suit without the hat Once he thought that the real person in real evening clothes was looking at him He turned his head and bore the probable insult in weak misery Too feeble for anything but thick suffering he was dragged on toward the theater the opera people in silk hats toward Jeff Saxton and exposure But his success in bullying the tailor had taught him that dressing wasn t really a hidden lore to be known only by initiates that some day he too might understand the black and white magic of clothes His bruised self consciousness healed I ll do something he determined He waited vacuously The Gilson party was not in the lobby when he arrived He tore off his top coat He draped it over his felt hat so that no one could be sure what sort of hat it shamefully concealed That unveiling did expose him to the stare of everybody waiting in the lobby He was convinced that the entire ticket buying cue was glumly resenting him Peeping down at the unusual white glare of his shirt front he felt naked and indecent Nice kind o vest Must make em out of old pique collars He endured his martyrdom till his party arrived the Gilsons Claire Jeff Saxton and a glittering young woman whose name Milt thought was missus Corey And Saxton wasn t wearing a high hat He wore a soft one and he didn t seem to care Milt straightened up followed them through the manifold dangers of the lobby down a perilous aisle of uptilted scornful faces to a red narrow corridor winding stairs a secret passage a mysterious dark closet and he walked out into a room with one side missing and on that side ten trillion people in a well and nine trillion of them staring at him and noticing that he d rented his dress suit Hot about the neck he stumbled over one or two chairs and was permitted to rest in a foolish little gilt chair in the farthest corner Once safe he felt much better Except that Jeff did put on white kid gloves Milt couldn t see that they two looked so different And neither of the two men in the next box wore gloves Milt made sure of that comfort he reveled in it he looked at Claire and in her loyal smile found ease He snarled She trusts you Forget you re a dub Try to be human Hang it I m no greener at the opera than old horsehair sofa there would be at a garage There was something What was it he was trying to remember Oh yes When he d worked in the Schoenstrom flour mill as engineer at eighteen the owner had tried to torment him to get his goat Milt put it and Milt had found that the one thing that would save him was to smile as though he knew more than he was telling It did not he remembered make any difference whether or not the smile was real If he merely looked the miller up and down and smiled cynically he was let alone Why not Saxton was bending toward him asking in honeyed respectfulness Don t you think that the new school in music audible pointillage one might call it mistakes cacophony for power Milt smiled paternally Saxton waited for something more He dug the nail of his right middle finger into his thumb looked thoughtful and attacked again Which do you like better the new Italian music or the orthodox German Milt smiled like two uncles watching a clever baby and patronized Saxton with They both have their points He saw that Claire was angry but that the Gilsons and missus Corey flap eared gape mouthed forward bending were very proud of their little Jeff He saw that except for their clothes and self conscious coiffures they were exactly like a gang of cracker box loafers at Heinie Rauskukle s badgering a new boy in town Saxton looked bad tempered Then missus Corey bustled with her face and yearned at Milt Do tell me what is the theme of the opera tonight I ve rather forgotten Milt ceased to smile While all of them regarded him with interest he said clearly I haven t got the slightest idea I don t know anything about music Some day I hope I can get a clever woman like you to help me missus Corey It must be great to know all about all these arts the way you do I wish you d explain that overture they call it don t they For some reason mister Gilson was snickering missus Corey flushing Claire looking well pleased Milt had tried to be insulting but had got lost in the intricacies of the insult He felt that he d better leave it in its apparently safe state and he leaned back and smiled again as though he was waiting missus Corey did not explain the overture She hastily explained her second maid to missus Gilson The opera was Il Amore dei Tre Re Milt was bewildered To him who had never seen an opera the convention that a girl cannot hear a man who is bellowing ten feet away from her was absurd and he wished that the singers would do something besides making their arms swim He discovered that by moving his chair forward he could get within a foot of Claire His hand slipped across touched hers She darted a startled backward glance Her fingers closed tight about his then restlessly snuggled inside his palm and Milt was lost in enchantment Stately kings of blood red cloaks and chrysoberyls malevolent in crowns of ancient and massy gold the quick dismaying roll of drums and the shadow of passing banners below a tower a woman tall and misty veiled and pale with dreams a world of spirit where the soul had power over unseen dominions this he saw and heard and tasted in the music What the actual plot was or the technique of the singing he did not know but it bore him beyond all reality save the sweet sure happiness of Claire s nestling hand He held her fingers so firmly that he could feel the pulse beat in them In the clamminess of his room when the enchantment was gone he said gravely How much longer can I keep this up Sooner or later I bust loose and smash little Jeff one in the snoot and he takes the count and I m never allowed to see Claire again Turn the roughneck out on his ear I s pose I m vulgar I s pose that fellow Michael in Youth s Encounter wouldn t talk about snoots I don t care I ll If I poke Saxton one I m not afraid of the kid glove precinct any more My brain s as good as theirs give it a chance But oh they re all against me And they bust the Athletic Union s wrestling rule that striking kicking gouging hair pulling butting and strangling will not be allowed How long can I go on being good natured When I do break loose Slowly beneath the moral cuff of his dress shirt Milt s fist closed in a brown broad knuckled lump and came up in the gesture of a right to the jaw But it came up only a foot The hand opened climbed to Milt s face rubbed his temples while he sighed Nope Can t even do that Bigger game now Used to could used to be able to settle things with a punch But I ve got to be more oh more diplomatic now Oh Lord how lonely I get for Bill McGolwey No That isn t true I couldn t stand Bill now Claire took all that out of me Where am I where am I Why did I ever get a car that takes a thirty six x six CHAPTER XXXII THE CORNFIELD ARISTOCRAT It was an innocent little note from Jeff Saxton a polite humble little note it said that Jeff had a card to the Astoria Club and wouldn t Milt please have lunch with him But Milt dropped it on the table and he walked round it as though it were a dictagraph which he d discovered in the table drawer after happy happy hidden hours at counterfeiting It seemed more dangerous to refuse than to go He browned the celebrated new shoes he pressed the distinguished new trousers with a light and quite unsatisfactory flatiron he re re retied his best spotted blue bow it persisted in having the top flaps too short but the retying gave him spiritual strength and he modestly clumped into the aloof brick portal of the Astoria Club on time He had never been in a club before He looked at the red tiled floor of the entrance hall he stared through the hall into an immense lounge with the largest and softest chairs in the world with oil portraits of distinguished old bucks and ninety per cent of the wealth and power of Seattle pulling its several mustaches reading the P I and ignoring the lone intruder out in the hall A small Zulu in blue tights and brass buttons glared at Milt and a large soft suave insulting young man demanded Yes sir mister G g geoffrey Saxton ventured Milt Not in sir The sir sounded like And you know it The flaming guardian retired behind a narrow section of a bookkeeper s desk and ignored him I m to meet him for lunch Milt forlornly persisted The young man looked up hurt and annoyed at finding that the person was still to be dealt with If you will wait in there he groaned Milt sat in there which was a small blue tapestry room with hard chairs intended to discourage bill collectors He turned his hat round and round and round till he saw Jeff Saxton slim and straight and hard as the stick hooked over his arm sailing into the hall He plunged out after him took refuge with him from the still unconvinced inspection of the hall man For twenty seconds he loved Jeff Saxton And Jeff seemed to adore him in turn He solicitously led Milt to the hat checking counter He showed Milt the lounge and the billiard room through which Milt crept with erect shoulders and easy eyes and a heart simply paralyzed with fear that one of these grizzled clubmen with clipped mustaches would look at him He coaxed Milt into a grill that was a cross between the Chinese throne room and a Viennese Weinstube and he implored his friend Milt to do him the favor of trying the very fair English mutton chops and potatoes au gratin I did want to see you again before we go East Daggett he said pleasantly Th thanks When do you go I m trying to get Miss Boltwood to start soon now The season is opening in the East She does like your fine sturdy West as I do but still when we think of the exciting new shows opening and the dances and the touch with the great world Oh it does make one eager to get back That s so risked Milt We uh Daggett In fact I m going to call you Milt as Claire does You don t know what a pleasure it has been to have encountered you There s a fine keen courage about you Western chaps that makes a cautious old fogy like me envious I shall remember meeting you with a great deal of pleasure Th thanks Been pleasure meet you And I know Claire will too Milt felt that he was being dealt with foully He wanted to object to Saxton s acting as agent for Claire as incompetent irrelevant immaterial and no foundation laid But he could not see just where he was being led and with Saxton glowing at him as warmly and greasily as the mutton chops Milt could only smile wanly and reflectively feel the table leg to see if it was loose enough to jerk out in case of need Saxton was being optimistic In fact Claire and I both hope that some day when you ve finished your engineering course we ll see you in the East I wonder As I say my dear fellow I ve taken the greatest fancy to you and I do hope you won t think I m too intimate if I say that I imagine that even in your charming friendship with Miss Boltwood you ve probably never learned what important people the Boltwoods are I thought I d tell you so that you could realize the privilege both you and I have in knowing them Henry B is while not a man of any enormous wealth regarded as one of the keenest intellects in New York wholesale circles But beyond that he is a scholar and a man of the broadest interests Of course the Boltwoods are too modest to speak of it but he was chiefly instrumental in the establishment of the famous Brooklyn Symphony Orchestra And his ancestors clear through his father was a federal judge and his mother s brother was a general in the Civil War and afterwards an ambassador So you can guess something of the position Claire holds in that fine quiet solid old Brooklyn set Henry Ward Beecher himself was complimented at being asked to dine with the Boltwoods of his day and No the table leg wouldn t come loose so it was only verbally that the suddenly recovered Milt attacked Certainly is nice to have one of those old families It s something like As you say you and I have gotten pretty well acquainted along the line so I guess I can say it to you My father and his folks came from that same kind of family Father s dad was a judge back in Maine and in the war grand dad was quite friendly with Grant This tribute of Milt to his grandsire was loyal but inaccurate Judge Daggett who wasn t a judge at all but a J P had seen General Grant only once and at the time the judge had been in company with all the other privates in the Fourteenth Maine Dad was a pioneer He was a doctor He had to give up all this easy going stuff in order to help open up the West to civilization but I guess it was worth it He used to do the hardest kind of operations on kitchen tables with his driver giving the chloroform I m mighty proud of him As you say it s kind of what you might call inspiring to belong to the old Pilgrim aristocracy Never before had Milt claimed relation to a group regarding which his only knowledge was the information derived from the red school history to the effect that they all carried blunderbusses put people in the stocks for whistling and frequently said Why don t you speak for yourself John But he had made his boast with a clear eye and a pleasant superior calm smile Oh Very interesting grunted Saxton Would you like to see grandfather s daguerreotype Oh yes yes uh thanks that would be very interesting Do let me see it when Uh as I was saying Claire doubtless has a tremendous social career before her So many people expecting her to marry well Of course she has a rather unusual combination of charm and intelligence and In fact I think we may both be glad that Yes That s right And the best thing about her is the way she can shake off all the social stuff and go camping and be a regular human being Milt caressed Um uh no doubt no doubt though Of course though that isn t an inherent part of her I fancy she s been rather tired by this long trip poor child Of course she isn t very strong That s right Real pluck And of course she ll get stronger by hiking You ve never seen her bucking a dangerous hill I kind of feel that a person who hasn t seen her in the wilds doesn t know her I don t want to be contradictory old man but I feel on the other hand that no one who has failed to see her at the Junior League Dances in a Poiret frock can know her Come come Don t know how we drifted into this chorus of praise of Claire What I wanted to ask was your opinion of the Pierce Arrow I m thinking of buying one Do you think that All the way home Milt exulted I put it all over him I wasn t scared by the Don t butt into the aristocracy my young friend stuff I lied handsome But Darn it now I ll have to live up to my New England aristocracy Wonder if my grand dad s dad was a hired man or a wood sawyer Ne mine I m Daggett of Daggett from now on He bounded up to his room vaingloriously remarking I m there with the ancestors I was brought up in the handsome city of Schoenstrom which was founded by a colony of Vermont Yankees headed by Herman Skumautz I was never allowed to play with the Dutch kids and He opened the door the Schoenstrom minister taught me Greek and was my bosom frien He stopped with his heart in his ankles Lolling on the bed grinning waving a cigarette was Bill McGolwey proprietor of the Old Home Lunch of Schoenstrom Minnesota Wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwhy where the heck did you come from stammered the deposed aristocrat to his bosom friend Bill You old lemon pie faced lollygagging flap footed crab nosed son of misery gee but it s good to see you Milt Bill was off the bed wringing Milt s hand with simple joy with perfect faith that in finding his friend all the troubles of life were over And Milt was gloomily discovering the art of diplomacy Bill was his friend yes but It was hard enough to carry his own self He pictured Jeff Saxton leering at the door and while he pounded Bill s shoulder and called him the name which west of Chicago is the token of hatred and of extreme gladness at meeting he discovered that some one had stolen his stomach and left a piece of ice in its place They settled down on bed and chair Bill s ears red with joy while Milt demanded How the deuce did you get here Well tell you old hoss Schoenstrom got so darn lonely after you left and when Ben and Heinie got your address and bought the garage think s I lez go off on a little bum Milt was realizing and hating himself for realizing that Bill s face was dirty his hair linty the bottoms of his trousers frayed masses of mud while Bill chuckled I figured out maybe I could get a job here in a restaurant and you and me could room together I sold out my good will in the Old Home Lunch for a hundred bucks I was going to travel swell riding the cushions But Pete Swanson wanted me to go down to the Cities first and we run into some pretty swift travelers in Minneapolis and a couple of girls saaaaaaay kid some class Bill winked and Milt Milt was rather sick He knew Bill s conception of class in young women Was this the fellow he had liked so well These the ideas which a few months ago he had taken as natural and extremely amusing And I got held up in an alley off Washington Avenue and they got the last twenty bones off n me and I was flatter n a pancake So I says ish kabibble and I sneaks onto the blind baggage and bums my way West You d a died laughing to seen me throwing my feet for grub Oh I m some panhandler There was one Frau sicked her dog onto me and I kicked him in the jaw and Oh it was one swell hike Milt was trying to ignore the voice that was raging And now he expects to live on me after throwing his own money away The waster The hobo He ll expect to meet Claire I d kill him before I d let him soil her by looking at her Him and his classy girls Milt tried to hear only the other inner voice which informed him He looks at you so trustingly He d give you his shirt if you needed it and he wouldn t make you ask for it Milt tried to be hearty What re you going to do old kid Well the first thing I m going to do is to borrow ten iron men and a pair of pants You bet Here she is Haven t got any extra pants Tell you Here s another five and you can get the pants at the store in the next block this side of the street Hustle along now and get em He chuckled at Bill he patted his arm he sought to hurry him out He had to be alone to think But Bill kissed the fifteen dollars carelessly rammed it into his pocket crawled back on the bed yawned What s the rush Gosh I m sleepy Say Milt whadyuh think of me and you starting a lunch room here together You got enough money out of the garage Oh no noooo gee I d like to Bill but you see well I ve got to hold onto what little I ve got so I can get through engineering school Sure but you could cash in on a restaurant you could work evenings in the dump and there d be a lot of city sports hanging around and we d have the time of our lives No I I study evenings And I The fact is Bill I ve met a lot of nice fellows at the university and I kind of go around with them Aw how d you get that way Rats you don t want to go tagging after them Willy boys Damn dirty snobs And the girls are worse I tell you Milt these hoop te doodle society Janes may look all right to hicks like us but on the side they raise more hell than any milliner s trimmer from Chi that ever vamped a rube burg What do you know about them Now don t get sore I m telling you I don t like to see any friend of mine make a fool of himself hanging around with a bunch that despises him because he ain t rich that s all Met any of the high toned skirts Yes I have Trot em up and lemme give em the once over We we ll see about it Now I got to go to a mathematics recitation Bill You make yourself comfortable and I ll be back at five Milt did not have to go to a recitation He marched out with briskness in his step and a book under his arm but when he reached the corner the briskness proved to be spurious and the mathematics book proved to be William Rose Benet s Merchants of Cathay which Claire had given him in the Yellowstone and which he had rescued from the wrecked bug He stood staring at it He opened it with unhappy tenderness He had been snatched from the world of beautiful words and serene dignity of soaring mountains and companionship with Claire in the radiant morning back to the mud and dust of Schoenstrom from the opera to city sports in a lunch room He hated Bill McGolwey and his sneering assumption that Milt belonged in the filth with him And he hated himself for not being enough of a genius to combine Bill McGolwey and Claire Boltwood But not once in his maelstrom of worry on that street corner did he expect Claire to like Bill Through all his youthful agonizing he had enough common sense to know that though Claire might conquer a mountain pass she could never be equal to the social demands of Schoenstrom and Bill McGolwey He wandered for an hour and came back to find that in a dry city which he had never seen before the crafty Bill had obtained a quart of Bourbon and was in a state of unsteady beatitude He wanted he announced to dance Milt got him into the community bathtub and soused him under but Bill s wet body was slippery and Bill s merry soul was all for frolicsome gamboling and he slid out of Milt s grasp he sloshed around in the tub he sprinkled Milt s sacred good suit with soapy water and escaped and in the costume of Adam he danced orientally in Milt s room till he was seized with sleepiness and cosmic grief and retired to Milt s bed in tears and nothing else The room dimmed grew dark The street lamps outside sent a wan wavery gleam into the room Evening crowds went by and in a motion picture theater a banging piano struck up Bill breathed in choking snorts Milt sat unmoving feeling very old very tired too dumbly unhappy to be frightened of the dreadful coming hour when Claire and Jeff should hear of Bill and discover Milt s real world He was not so romantically loyal not so inhumanly heroic that it can truthfully be reported that he never thought of getting rid of Bill He did think of it again and again But always he was touched by Bill s unsuspecting trust and shook his head and sank again into the fog What was the use of trying to go ahead Wasn t he after all merely a Bill McGolwey himself If he was he wouldn t inflict himself on Claire For several minutes he gave up forever the zest of climbing When Bill awoke brightly solicitous about the rest of the quart of Bourbon and bouncingly ready to go out and have a time Milt loafed about the streets with him showing him the city He dully cut his classes next morning and took Bill to the wharves It was late in the afternoon when they were lounging in the room and Bill was admiring his new pants he boasted of having bought them for three dollars and pointed out that Milt had been a galoot to spend ten dollars for shoes that some one knocked at the door Sleepily expectant of his landlady Milt opened it on Miss Claire Boltwood mister and missus Eugene Gilson and mister Geoffrey Saxton Saxton calmly looked past him at Bill smiled slightly and condescended I thought we ought to call on you so we ve dropped in to beg for tea Bill had stopped midway in scratching his head to gape at Claire Claire returned the look stared at Bill s frowsy hair his red wrists his wrinkled grease stained coat his expression of impertinent stupidity Then she glanced questioningly at Milt who choked Oh yes yes sure glad see you come in get some tea so glad see you come in CHAPTER XXXIII TOOTH MUG TEA My friend mister McGolwey I knew him in Schoenstrom come on to Seattle for a while Bill these are some people I met along the road Milt grumbled Glad to meet em Have a chair Have two chairs Say Milt y ought to have more chairs if you re going to have a bunch of swells coming to call on you Ha ha ha Say I guess I better pike out and give the folks a chance to chin with you Bill fondly offered Oh sit down Milt snapped at him They all sat down four on the bed and Milt s inner ear heard a mute snicker from the Gilsons and Saxton He tried to talk He couldn t Bill looked at him and perceiving the dumbness gallantly helped out So you met the kid on the road eh Good scout Milt is We always used to say at Schoenstrom that he was the best darn hand at fixing a flivver in seven townships So you knew mister Daggett at home Now isn t that nice said missus Gilson Knew him Saaaaay Milt and I was brung up together Why him and I have bummed around together and worked on farms summers and fished for bull heads Ever catch a bull head Damnedest slipperiest fish you ever saw and got horns that sting the stuffin s out of you and Say I wonder if Milt s told you about the time we had at a barn dance once There was a bunch of hicks there and I says Say kid lez puncture their tires and hide back of the manure pile and watch the fun when they come out I guess maybe I was kind of stewed a little tell the truth but course Milt he don t drink much hardly at all nice straight kid if I do say so Bill Milt ordered We must have some tea Here s six bits You run down to the corner grocery and get some tea and a little cream Oh you better buy three four cups too Hustle now son Attaboy Yours to command ladies and gents like the fellow says Bill boomed delightedly He winked at Jeff Saxton airily spun his broken hat on his dirty forefinger and sauntered out Charming fellow A real original crooned missus Gilson Did he know your friend mister Pinky asked Saxton Before Milt could answer Claire rose from the bed inspected the Gilsons and Jeff with cold dislike and said quietly to Milt The poor dear thing he was dreadfully embarrassed It s so good of you to be nice to him I believe in being loyal to your old friends Oh so do I babbled missus Gilson It s just too splendid And we must do something for him I m going to invite mister Daggett and mister mister McGollups was it to dinner this evening I do want to hear him tell about your boyhood It must have been so interesting It was mused Milt It was poor and miserable We had to work hard we had to fight for whatever education we got we had no one to teach us courtesy Oh now with your fine old doctor father Surely he was an inspiration Jeff didn t this time trouble to hide the sneer Yes He was He gave up the chance to be a rich loafer in order to save farmers babies for fees that he never got I m sure he did I wish I d known him We need to know men like that in this pink frosting playing at living we have in cities Claire said sweetly not to Milt but to Jeff missus Gilson had ignored them waiting with the patience of a cat at a mouse hole and she went on But you haven t said you d come this evening Do say you will I don t suppose mister McGollups will care to dress for dinner With saccharin devotion Milt yearned back No missus Gilson No mister McGolwey won t care to dress He s eccentric But you ll make him come Milt was tactfully beginning to refuse when Gene Gilson at last exploded turned purple covered his dripping too red lips with his handkerchief Then abruptly Milt hurled at missus Gilson All right We ll come Bill ll be awfully funny He s never been out of a jerkwater burg in his life hardly He s an amusing cuss He thinks I m smart He loves me like a dog Oh he s rich Ha ha ha Milt might have gone on if he had mister and missus Gilson would have gone away much displeased But Bill arrived with some of the worst tea in the world and four cups tastefully done in cupids heads and much gilt Milt made tea ignoring them while Bill entertained the Gilsons and Saxtons with Rabelaisian stories of threshing time when shirts prickly with chaff and gritty with dust stuck to sweat dripping backs of the funny thing of Milt and Bill being hired to move a garbage pile and swiping their employer s mushmelons of knotting shirts at the swimming hole so that the bawling youngsters had to chaw beef of drinking beer in the livery stable at Melrose of dropping the water pitcher from a saint Klopstock hotel window upon the head of the constabule and escaping from him across the lean to roof missus Gilson encouraged him Bill sat with almost closed eyes glorying in the saga of small town life Saxton and Gilson did not conceal their contemptuous grins But Claire After nervously rubbing the tips of her thumbs with flickering agitated fingers she had paid no attention to Bill and the revelation of Milt s rustic life she had quietly gone to Milt to help him prepare the scanty tea She whispered Never mind dear I don t care It was all twice as much fun as being wheeled in lacy prams by cranky nurses as Jeff and I were But I know how you feel Are you ashamed of having been a prairie pirate No I m not We were wild kids we raised a lot of Cain but I m glad we did So am I I couldn t stand it if you were ashamed Listen to me and remember little Claire s words of wisdom These fools are trying oh they re so obvious they re trying to make me feel that the prim Miss Boltwood of Brooklyn Heights is a stranger to you Well they re succeeding in making me a stranger to them Claire Dear You don t mind Bill Yes I do And so do you You ve grown away from him I don t know but Today has been quite a test Yes It has Because if I can stand your friend mister McGolwey Then you do care Perhaps And if I think that he s oh not much good and I remember that for a long time you just had him to play with then I m all the more anxious to make it up to you Don t be sorry for me I can t stand that After all it was a good town and good folks No No I m not sorry for you I just mean you couldn t have had so terribly much fun after you were eighteen or so Schoenstrom must have been a little dull after very many years there This stuff about the charm of backwoods villages the people that write it seem to take jolly good care to stay in Long Island suburbs Claire He was whispering desperately The tea s most done Oh my dear I m crazy with this puttering around trying to woo you and having to woo the entire Gilson tribe Let s run away No first I m going to convince them that you are what I know you are But you can t Huh You wait I ve thought of the most beautiful beastly cruel plan for the reduction of social obesity Then she was jauntily announcing Tea my dears Jeff you get the tooth mug Isn t this jolly Yes Oh yes Very jolly Jeff was thoroughly patronizing but she didn t look offended She made them drink the acid tea and taste the chalk like bread and butter sandwiches She coaxed Bill to go on with his stories and when the persistent missus Gilson again asked the pariahs to come to dinner Claire astonished Milt and still more astonished missus Gilson by begging Oh yes please do come Milt He consented savagely But first Claire added to missus Gilson I want us to take the boys to Oh I have the bulliest idea Come everybody We re going riding Uh where hinted mister Gilson That s my secret Come Claire pranced to the door herded all of them down to the limousine whispered an address to the chauffeur Milt didn t care much for that ride Bill was somewhat too evidently not accustomed to limousines He wiped his shoes caked with red mud upon the seat cushions and apologized perspiringly He said Gee whillikens that s a dandy idee telephone to bawl the shuffer out with and Are them flowers real the bokay in the vase But the Gilsons and Jeff Saxton were happy about it all till the car turned from a main thoroughfare upon a muddy street of shacks that clung like goats to the sides of a high cut a street unchanged from the pioneer days of Seattle Good heavens Claire you aren t taking us to see Aunt Hatty are you wailed missus Gilson Oh yes indeed I knew the boys would like to meet her No really I don t think Eva my soul Jeff and you planned our tea party today and assured me I d be so interested in Milt s bachelor apartment By the way I d been up there already so it wasn t entirely a surprise It s my turn to lead She confided to Milt Dear old Aunt Hatty is related to all of us She s Gene s aunt and my fourth cousin and I think she s distantly related to Jeff She came West early and had a hard time but she s real Brooklyn Heights and she belongs to Gramercy Park and North Washington Square and Rittenhouse Square and Back Bay too though she has got out of touch a little So I wanted you to meet her Milt wondered what unperceived bag of cement had hardened the faces of Saxton and the Gilsons Silent save for polite observations of Claire upon tight skirts and lumbering the merry company reached the foot of a lurching flight of steps that scrambled up a clay bank to a cottage like a hen that has set too long Milt noticed that missus Gilson made efforts to remain in the limousine when it stopped and he caught Gilson s mutter to his wife No it s Claire s turn Be a sport Eva Claire led them up the badly listed steps to an unpainted porch on which sat a little old lady very neat very respectable very interested and reflectively holding in one ivory hand a dainty handkerchief and a black clay pipe Hello Claire my dear You ve broken the relatives record you ve called twice in less than a year said the little old lady How do you do Aunt Harriet remarked missus Gilson with great lack of warmth Hello Eva Sit down on the edge of the porch Those chickens have made it awful dirty though haven t they Bring out some chairs There s two chairs that don t go down under you often Aunt Harriet was very cheerful The group lugubriously settled in a circle upon an assemblage of wind broken red velvet chairs and wooden stools They resembled the aftermath of a funeral on a damp day Claire was the cheerful undertaker missus Gilson the grief stricken widow Claire waved at Milt and conversed with Aunt Hatty in a high brisk voice This is the nice boy I met on the road that I think I told you about Cousin Hatty The little old lady screwed up the delicate skin about her eyes examined Milt and cackled Boy there s something wrong here You don t belong with my family Why you look like an American You haven t got an imitation monocle and I bet you can t talk with a New York London accent Why Claire I m ashamed of you for bringing a human being into the Boltwood Gilson Saxton tomb and expecting Then was the smile of missus Gilson lost forever It was simultaneously torpedoed mined scuttled and bombed It went to the bottom without a ripple while missus Gilson snapped Aunt Hatty please don t be vulgar Me croaked the little old lady She puffed at her pipe and dropped her elbows on her knees My ain t it hard to please some folks Cousin Hatty I want Milt to know about our families I love the dear old stories Claire begged prettily missus Gilson snarled Claire really Oh do shut up Eva and don t be so bossy yelped the dear little old lady in sudden and dismaying rage I ll talk if I want to Have they been bullying you Claire Or your boy I tell you boy these families are fierce I was brought up in Brooklyn went through all the schools used to be able to misplay the piano and mispronounce French with the best of em Then Gene s pa and I came West together he had an idea he d get rich robbing the Injuns of their land And we went broke I took in washing I learned a lot I learned a Gilson was just the same common stuff as a red shirt miner when he was up against it But Gene s pa succeeded there was something about practically stealing a fur schooner but I never was one to tattle on my kin Anyway by the time Gene come along his pa was rich and that means aristocratic This aristocracy west of Pittsburgh is just twice as bad as the snobbery in Boston or New York because back there the families have had their wealth long enough some of em got it by stealing real estate in eighteen twenty and some by selling Jamaica rum and niggers way back before the Revolutionary War they ve been respectable so long that they know mighty well and good that nobody except a Britisher is going to question their blue blood and oh my what good blueing third generation money does make But out here in God s Country the marquises of milling and the barons of beef are still uneasy Even their pretty women after going to the best hair dressers and patronizing the best charities sometimes get scared lest somebody think they haven t either brains or breeding So they re nasty to all low pussons like you and me to make sure we understand how important they are But lands I know em boy I m kept pensioned up here out of the way but I read the social notes in the papers and I chuckle When there s a big reception and I read about missus Vogeland s pearls and her beautiful daughter in law I remember how she used to run a boarding house for miners Well I guess it s just as shoddy in the East if you go far enough back Claire you re a nice comforting body and I hate to say it but the truth is your great grandfather was an hostler and made his first money betting on horses Now my I oughtn t to tell that Do you mind dearie Not a bit Isn t it delightful that this is such a democratic country with no castes said Claire At this the first break in the little old lady s undammable flood missus Gilson sprang up yammering The rest of you may stay as long as you like but if I m to be home in time to dress for dinner Yes and I must be going babbled Saxton Milt noted that his lower lip showed white tooth marks It must be admitted that all of them rather ignored the little old lady for a moment Milt was apologetically hinting I don t really think Bill and I d better come to dinner this evening missus Gilson Thanks a lot but It s kind of sudden Claire again took charge Not at all Milt Of course you re coming It was Eva herself who invited you I m sure she ll be delighted Charmed said missus Gilson with the expression of one who has swallowed castor oil and doubts the unity of the universe There was a lack of ease about the farewells to Aunt Harriet As they all turned away she beckoned Milt and murmured Did I raise the dickens I tried to It s the only solace besides smoking that a moral old lady can allow herself after she gets to be eighty two and begins to doubt everything they used to teach her Come and see me boy Now get out and boy beat up Gene Gilson Don t be scared of his wife s hoity toity ways Just sail in I will said Milt He had one more surprise before he reached the limousine Bill McGolwey who had sat listening to everything and scratching his cheek in a puzzled way seized Milt s sleeve and rumbled Good by old hoss I m not going to butt in on your game and get you in Dutch Gosh I never supposed you had enough class to mingle with elittys like this gang but I know when I m in wrong You were too darn decent to kick me out Do it myself You re best friend I ever had and Good luck old man God bless you Bill was gone running stumbling fleeing past Aunt Harriet s cottage off into a sandy hilltop vacancy The last Milt saw of him was when on the skyline Bill stopped for a glance back and seemed to be digging his knuckles into his eyes Then Milt turned resolutely marched down the stairs said to his hosts with a curious quietness Thank you for asking me to dinner but I m afraid I can t come Claire will you walk a few blocks with me During the half minute it had taken to descend the steps Milt had reflected with an intensity which forgot Bill that he had been selfish that he had thought only of the opinion of these nice people regarding himself instead of understanding that it was his duty to save Claire from their enervating niceness Not that he phrased it quite in this way What he had been muttering was Rotten shame me so scared of folks clothes that I don t stand up to em and keep em from smothering Claire Lord it would be awful if she settled down to being a missus Jeff Saxton Got to save her not for myself for her It may have been Aunt Harriet it may have been Milt s resolution but missus Gilson answered almost meekly Well if you think Would you like to walk Claire As he tramped off with Claire Milt demanded Glad to escape Yes and I m glad you refused dinner It really has been wearing this trial by food This is the last time I ll dare to meet the Gilsons And I ll have to be going back East I hope the Gilsons will forgive me some day I m afraid you didn t win them over by Aunt Hatty No They re probably off me for life Oh these horrible social complications worse than any real danger fire or earthquake Oh these complications they don t exist We just make em like we make rules for a card game What the deuce do we care about the opinions of people we don t like And who appointed these people to a fixed social position Did the president make Saxton High Cockalorum of Dress Suits or something Why these are just folks the same as kings and coal heavers There s no army we ve got to fight There s just you and me you and I and if we stick together then we have all society we are all society Ye es but Milt dear I don t want to be an outcast You won t be In the long run if you don t take these aristocrats seriously they ll be all the more impressed by you No That sounds cheering in stories and these optimistic editorials in the magazines but it isn t true And you don t know how pleasant it is to be In I ve always been more or less on the inside and thought outsiders dreadful But Oh I don t care I don t care With you I m happy That s all I know and all I want to know I ve just grown up I ve just learned the greatest wisdom to know when I m happy But Milt dear I say this because I love you Yes I do love you No don t kiss me Yes it is too It s far too public And I want to talk seriously You can t have any idea how strong social distinctions are Don t despise them just because you don t know them No I won t I ll learn Probably America will get into the war I ll be an engineering officer I ll learn this social dope from the college boy officers And I ll come to Brooklyn with shoulder straps and bells on and Will you be waiting Oh yes But Milt If the war comes you must be very careful not to get shot All right if you insist Good Lord Claire I don t know what put it into my head but Do you realize that a miracle has happened We re no longer Miss Boltwood and a fellow named Daggett We have been even when we ve liked each other up to today Always there s been a kind of fence between us We had to explain and defend ourselves and scrap But now we re us and the rest of the world has disappeared and And nothing else matters said Claire CHAPTER XXXIV THE BEGINNING OF A STORY It was the farewell to Claire and Jeff Saxton a picnic in the Cascades near Snoqualmie Falls a decent and decidedly Milt less fiesta missus Gilson was going to show Claire that they were just as hardy adventurers as that horrid Daggett person So she didn t take the limousine but merely the seven passenger Locomobile with the special body They were ever so rough and wild They had no maid The chauffeur was absolutely the only help to the Gilsons Claire Jeff and the temporarily and ejaculatorily nature loving missus Betz in the daring task of setting out two folding camp tables covering them with a linen cloth and opening the picnic basket Claire had to admit that she wished that she could steal the picnic basket for Milt There were vacuum bottles of hot coffee There were sandwiches of anchovy and pate de foie gras There were cream cakes with almonds hidden in the suave cream and there was a chicken salad with huge chunks of pure white meat wallowing in a sea of mayonnaise When the gorging was done and the cigarettes brought out the chauffeur passed a spirit lamp they stretched on rubber blankets and groaned a little and spoke well of nature and the delights of roughing it What is it What s wrong They re so oh so polite They don t mean what they say and they don t dare to say what they mean Is that it worried Claire She started She discovered that she was looking at a bristle of rope colored hair and a grin projected from the shelter of a manzanita bush For the she gasped She was too startled to be able to decide what was for the She spoke judiciously to Jeff Saxton about Upper Montclair the subway and tennis She rose to examine the mountains strolled away darted down a gully and pounced on Milt Daggett with How in heaven s name Found out where you all were going Look Got a bug Rented it Come on Let s duck Drive back with me At the end of the gully was a new Teal bug shinier than the ancient lost chariot but equally gay and uncomfortable Can t Like to but Be awfully rude to them Won t do that not more than is good for their souls even for you Now don t be sulky I won t Nev be sulky again because you re crazy about me and I don t have to be sulky Oh I am am I Good heavens the inconceivable conceit of the child She turned her back He darted to her caught her hands behind her kissed her hair and whispered You are I am not Well then you re not Lord you re sweet Your hair smells like cinnamon and clean kittens You d rather go bumping off in my flivver than sailing in that big Loco they ve got there Yes defiantly I would and I m ashamed of myself I m a throw back to my horrid ancestor the betting hostler Probably I m a throw back to my ancestor the judge I ll train you to meet my fine friends Well upon my word I Oh do stop being idiotic We talk like children You reduce me to the rank of a gibbering schoolgirl And I like it It s so oh I don t know so darn human I suppose Now hurry kiss me and get out before they suspect Listen Yes I ll accidentally meet your car along the road Invite you to ride All right Yes Do Oh we are two forlorn babes in the woods G by She sauntered back to the picnic and observed What is that purple flower up on the mountain side The big car was sedately purring back when it was insulted by an intermediate host of a machine that came jumping out of a side road The vulgar driver hailed them with uncouth howling The Gilsons chauffeur stopped annoyed Why hello folks bawled the social bandit Oh How do you do refuted missus Gilson Jeff Saxton turned a ripe purple How do you like my new bug Claire Awful little object But I can make fifty an hour Come and try it Claire can t you Why Claire was obviously shocked by the impropriety of the suggestion She looked at missus Gilson who was breathing as though she was just going under the ether Claire said doubtfully Well If you can get me right back to the house Sure agreed Milt When the Loco was gone Milt drove the bug to the side of the road yanked up the emergency brake and carefully kissed the girl who was snuggled down into the absurd low tin sided seat Do we have to get back soon he begged Oh I don t care if we never get back Let s shoot up into the mountains Side road Let s pretend we re driving across the continent again Firs dashing by rocks in the sunshine clouds jaunty beyond the inviting mouth of a mountain pass even the ruts and bumps and culverts she seemed a part of them all In the Gilsons huge cars she had been shut off from the road but in this tiny bug so close to earth she recovered the feeling of struggle of triumph over difficulties of freedom unbounded And she could be herself good or bad ignorant or wise with this boy beside her All of which she expressed in the most eloquent speech she had ever uttered namely Oh Milt And to herself Golly it s such a relief not to have to try to be gracious and aphoristic and repartistic and everything with Jeff And But I wonder if I am aphoristic and subtle I wonder if when she gets the rice powder off Claire isn t a lot more like Milt than she thought And aloud again Oh this is Yump It sure is Milt agreed They had turned from a side road into a side side road They crossed an upland valley The fall rains had flooded a creek till it had cut across the road washed through the thin gravel left across the road a shallow violent stream Milt stopped abruptly at its margin Here s where we turn back I guess he sighed Oh no Can t we get across It s only a couple of feet deep and gravel bottom insisted the restored adventurer Yes but look at the steep bank Never get up it I don t care Let s try it We can woggle around and dig it out somehow I bet you two bits we can said the delicate young woman whom missus Gilson was protecting All right In she goes The bug went in shot over the bank dipped down till the little hood sloped below them as though they were looping the loop struck the rushing water with a splash which hurled yellow drops over Claire s rose jersey suit lumbered ahead struck the farther bank pawed at it feebly rose two inches slipped back and sat there with the gurgling water all around it turned into a motor boat No can do grunted Milt Scared Nope Love it This is a real camp the brush on the bank and the stream listen to it chuckle under the running board Do you like to camp with me Love it Say Gee Never thought Claire Got your transportation back East My ticket Yes Why Well I m sure you can turn it in and get a refund So that s all right Are you going to let me in on the secret Oh yes might s well I was just wondering I don t think much of wasting all our youth waiting Two three years in engineering school and maybe going to war and starting in on an engineering job and me lonely as a turkey in a chicken yard and you doing the faithful young lady in Brooklyn I think perhaps we might get married tomorrow and Good heavens what do you Do you want to go back to Brooklyn Gilsonses No but Dear can t we be crazy once while we re youngsters Don t bombard me so Let me think One must be practical even in craziness I am I have over a thousand dollars from the garage and I can work evenings as dear Jeff suggested We d have a two by four flat Claire Oh let me think I suppose I could go to the university too and learn a little about food and babies and building houses and government I need to go to school a lot more than you do Besides auction and the piano which I play very badly and clothes and how to get hold of tickets for successful plays I don t know one single thing Will you marry me tomorrow Well uh Think of missus Gilson s face when she learns it And Saxton and that missus Betz It was to no spoken sentence but to her kiss that she added Providing we ever get the car out of this river that is Oh my dear my dear and all the romantic ways I was going to propose I had the best line about roses and stars and angels and everything They always use those but nobody ever proposed to me in a bug in a flood before Oh Milt Life is fun I never knew it till you kidnapped me If you kiss me again

of the crew of Eric the Red They swung out on the running board now awash With slight squeals they dropped into the cold stream Dripping laughing his clothes clinging to him he ducked down behind the car to get the jack under the back axle and with the water gurgling about her and splashing its exhilarating coldness into her face she stooped beside him to yank the stiff new chains over the rear wheels They climbed back into the car joyously raffish as a pair of gipsies She wiped a dab of mud from her cheek and remarked with an earnestness and a naturalness which that Jeff Saxton who knew her

marbles and Watch out for that turn Heavens how I have to look after you Is there a class in cooking at your university No do not kiss me on a turn This is the beginning of the story of Milt and Claire Daggett The prelude over and the curtain risen on the actual play they face the anxieties and glories of a changing world Not without quarrels and barren hours not free from ignorance and the discomfort of finding that between the mountain peaks they must for long gray periods dwell in the dusty valleys they yet start their drama with the distinction of being able to laugh together with the advantage of having discovered that neither Schoenstrom nor Brooklyn Heights is quite all of life with the cosmic importance to the tedious world of believing in the romance that makes youth
