and with different seasoning This is by far the most popular Italian dish and it seems to have pleased the taste of all the peoples of the earth The highly nutritive qualities of spaghetti and of cheese their indispensable condiment have been recognized by all diet authorities and as for its palatableness the lovers of spaghetti are just as enthusiastic and numerous outside of Italy as within the boundaries of that blessed country The most popular seasoning for spaghetti are tomato sauce brown stock and anchovy sauce The description of these three condiments follows twelve TOMATO SAUCE Salsa di Pomidoro Chop together fine one quarter of an onion a clove of garlic a piece of celery as long as your finger a few bay leaves and just enough parsley Season with a little oil salt and pepper cut up seven or eight tomatoes and put everything over the fire together Stir it from time to time and when you see the juice condensing into a thin custard strain through a sieve and it is ready for use When fresh tomatoes are not available the tomato paste may be used This is a concentrated paste made from tomatoes and spices which is to be had at all Italian grocers now so numerous in all American cities Thinned with water it is a much used ingredient in Italian recipes Catsup and concentrated tomato soup do not make satisfactory substitutes as they are too sweet in flavor Of course canned tomatoes seasoned with salt and a bit of bay leaf can always be used instead of fresh tomatoes This sauce serves many purposes It is good on boiled meat excellent to dress macaroni spaghetti or other pastes which have been seasoned with butter and cheese or on boiled rice seasoned in the same way see Risotto Mushrooms are a fine addition to it When using concentrated paste the following recipes will be found to give good results Chop one onion one carrot and a celery stalk form a little bunch of parsley and other aromatic greens and put everything to brown in a saucepan together with a piece of butter Add a reasonable portion of tomato paste while cooking stir and keep on a low fire until the sauce assumes the necessary consistency thirteen BROWN STOCK Sugo di Carne Cover the bottom of a saucepan with thin slices of beef taken from a juicy cut and small pieces of salt pork Place over a large onion one carrot and a stalk of celery all chopped in small pieces Add some butter and cover the whole with any trimmings from steaks or roasts and any bit of left over cooked meat Season with salt and cloves Put over the fire without stirring When you smell the onions getting very brown turn the meat and when everything is quite brown add a cup of water renewing the latter three times Finally add a certain quantity of boiling water or better still of broth and let it boil gently five or six hours Strain cool and skim off the fat which will form a cake on top of the liquid The meat can be used afterward for meat balls or Croquettes The stock may be kept for some days and forms the basis for many dishes fourteen ANCHOVY SAUCE Salsa d Acciughe This recipe does not call for the filets of anchovies prepared for hors d oeuvre but the less expensive and larger whole anchovies in salt to be had in bulk or cans at large dealers Wash them thoroughly in plenty of water Remove head tail backbone and skin and they are ready for use Put five or six anchovies into a colander and dip quickly into boiling water to loosen the skins remove the salt skin and bone them Chop them and put over the fire in a saucepan with a generous quantity of oil and some pepper Do not let them boil but when they are hot add two tablespoons of butter and three or four tablespoons of concentrated tomato juice made by cooking down canned tomatoes and rubbing through a sieve When this sauce is used to season spaghetti these must be boiled in water that is only slightly salted and care must be taken not to let them become too soft The quantities above mentioned ought to be sufficient for about one pound of spaghetti fifteen SPAGHETTI OR MACARONI WITH BUTTER AND CHEESE Pasta al burro e formaggio This is the simplest form in which the spaghetti may be served and it is generally reserved for the thickest paste The spaghetti are to be boiled until tender in salted water taking care to remove them when tender and not cooked until they lose form They should not be put into the water until this is at a boiling point Take as much macaroni as will half fill the dish in which it is to be served Break into pieces two and a half to three inches long if you so desire The Italians leave them unbroken but their skill in turning them around the fork and eating them is not the privilege of everybody Put the macaroni into salted boiling water and boil twelve to fifteen minutes or until the macaroni is perfectly soft Stir frequently to prevent the macaroni from adhering to the bottom Turn it into a colander to drain then put it into a pudding dish with a generous quantity of butter and grated cheese If more cheese is liked it can be brought to the table so that the guests can help themselves to it The macaroni called Mezzani which is a name designating size not quality is the preferable kind for macaroni dishes made with butter and cheese sixteen MACARONI WITH SAUCE Maccheroni al sugo The most appreciated kind of macaroni are those seasoned with tomato sauce or with brown stock see nos twelve and thirteen The macaroni are boiled as above then drained in a colander returned to the saucepan and mixed with the sauce and grated cheese For those who like it some butter may be added in the mixing seventeen MACARONI WITH ANCHOVY SAUCE Maccheroni con salsa d acciughe After the paste is drained thoroughly it is to be put into the hot dish in which it is to be served and the anchovy sauce poured over it and well mixed with two silver forks until the sauce has gone all through it Some olive oil may be added but grated cheese is not generally used with the anchovy sauce eighteen MACARONI A LA CORINNA Maccheroni alla Corinna Put on the fire a pot with two quarts of salted water to which add a small piece of butter When it begins to boil put in it three four lb macaroni Let it boil for five minutes then drain them in a colander Put them again in new boiling water prepared as above and let them cook on a slow fire Drain them again Cover the bottom of a plate with macaroni and cover this first layer with grated cheese and with some vegetables in macedoine that is chopped fine and fried brown with butter Repeat the draining moisten the macaroni with the water in which they have previously cooked and keep on a low fire for ten minutes more The Macedoine of vegetables can be made with a dozen Bruxelles sprouts or one cabbage half a

saucepan and when the turnips the carrots and the onions are half cooked add the cabbage or sprouts Put in some water and some more butter boil for ten minutes and then add the mushrooms and the

onion the parsley chopped a clove or small section of garlic shredded fine and a few dried mushrooms which have been softened by soaking in warm water When the vegetables are very brown great care must be taken not to burn the onion which scorches very easily add one two lb round steak ground coarsely or cut up in little cubes When the meat is a good brown color add some fresh or canned tomatoes or half a tablespoonful of tomato paste and simmer slowly until all has cooked down to a thick creamy sauce It will probably take three four hour The sauce may be bound together with a little flour if it shows a tendency to separate This sauce is used to dress all kinds of macaroni and spaghetti also for boiled rice see Risotto The macaroni or spaghetti should be left unbroken when cooked If they are too long to fit in the kettle immerse one end in the boiling salted water and in a very few minutes the ends of the spaghetti under the water will become softened so that the rest can be pushed down into the kettle Be careful not to overcook it and it will not be pasty but firm and tender Drain it carefully and put in a hot soup tureen Sprinkle a handful of grated cheese over it and pour on the sauce Lift with two forks until thoroughly mixed twenty one MACARONI FRIED WITH OIL Maccheroni all olio After the macaroni have boiled drain them and put them in a saucepan in which some

cooking When the whole is almost cooked add some salt and take it away from the water almost dry Add some butter stir and serve hot twenty five RISOTTO WITH LOBSTER Risotto coi gamberi For this risotto either lobster or crab meat can be used the former is however considered more tasty The lobster or crab meat ought to be about half the weight of the rice employed A little more than a pound of rice and half this weight of crab meat ought to be enough for six persons Chop fine a sprig of parsley a stalk of celery one carrot half an onion a clove of garlic and brown the whole in good olive oil When browned add the crab meat and season with salt and pepper During the cooking process stir and turn over the crabs and when they have become red pour over as much hot water as is necessary to

but not to a froth then mix the yolk with the white and salt the whole Shake out the artichokes to take away the superfluous flour and then put them in the egg leaving them for a while so that the egg may be attached to them Throw the pieces one by one into the pan where there is boiling fat butter or olive oil and when they are well browned take them away and serve with lemon If it is desired that the artichokes remain white it is better to fry them in oil and to squeeze half lemon into the water where the artichokes are put to soften twenty nine STEAMED ARTICHOKES Carciofi a vapore Artichokes have been only recently imported to the United States principally by Italian farmers and they are just beginning to find their way into the American kitchen The artichokes may be eaten raw or cooked It is a healthy and palatable vegetable easily digested when cooked It is nutritious and adapted for convalescents It may be prepared in a thousand ways and here follow some of the simplest and most tasteful To prepare the steamed artichokes they must first be cleaned and the stalk cut to less than half an inch Put them in a saucepan standing on their bottoms one near the other in half an inch or

hardened stir them and remove when they begin to be browned thirty three LAMB OMELET Agnello in frittata Cut in little pieces a loin of lamb which is the part that lends itself best for this dish and

When the gravy is thick enough add hot water to prevent the burning of the vegetables Cover the pan tightly and simmer until the chicken is very tender This is an excellent way to cook tough chickens Fowls which have been boiled may be cooked in this way but of course young and tender chickens will have the finer flavor thirty six CORN MEAL WITH SAUSAGES Polenta con salsicce Cook in water one cup of yellow cornmeal making a stiff mush Salt it well and when it is cooked spread out to cool on a bread board about half an inch thick Then cut the mush into small squares Put in a saucepan several

prepared disk of paste moisten the edge with a wet finger cover with another disk of paste and cook In the second case which is more convenient because the shells can be prepared one day before the two disks are put together without the stuffing but in the upper disk a circular cut must be made as large as a half dollar coin The pate on cooking swells and leaves an empty space in the interior Lifting with the point of a knife the little circle above which has the form of a cover the interior space can be made larger filled with the stuffing and covered with the little cover In this way it
