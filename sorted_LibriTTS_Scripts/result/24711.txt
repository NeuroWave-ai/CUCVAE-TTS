going to tell you something about a little girl who was always saying and doing funny things and very often getting into trouble Her name was Prudy Parlin and she and her sister Susy three years older lived in Portland in the State of Maine though every summer they went to Willowbrook to visit their grandmother At the very first of our story Susy was more than six years old and Prudy was between three and four Susy could sew quite well for a girl of her age and had a stint every day Prudy always thought it very fine to do just as Susy did so she teased her mother to let her have some patchwork too and missus Parlin gave her a few calico pieces just to keep her little fingers out of mischief But when the squares were basted together she broke needles pricked her fingers and made a great fuss sometimes crying and wishing there were no such thing as patchwork One morning she sat in her rocking chair doing what she thought was a stint She kept running to her mother with every stitch saying Will that do Her mother was very busy and said My little daughter must not come to me So Prudy sat down near the door and began to sew with all her might but soon her little baby sister came along looking so cunning that Prudy dropped her needle and went to hugging her O little sister cried she I wouldn t have a horse come and eat you up for any thing in the world After this of course her mother had to get her another needle and then thread it for her She went to sewing again till she pricked her finger and the sight of the wee drop of blood made her cry O dear I wish somebody would pity me But her mother was so busy frying doughnuts that she could not stop to talk much and the next thing she saw of Prudy she was at the farther end of the room while her patchwork lay on the spice box Prudy Prudy what are you up to now Up to the table said Prudy O mother I m so sorry but I ve broke a crack in the pitcher What will mamma do with you You haven t finished your stint what made you get out of your chair O I thought grandma might want me to get her speckles I thought I would go and find Zip too See mamma he s so tickled to see me he shakes all over every bit of him Where s your patchwork I don t know You ve got a double name haven t you doggie It s Zip Coon but it isn t a very double name is it mother When missus Parlin had finished her doughnuts she said Pussy you can t keep still two minutes Now if you want to sew this patchwork for grandma s quilt I ll tell you what I shall do There s an empty hogshead in the back kitchen and I ll lift you into that and you can t climb out I ll lift you out when your stint is done O what a funny little house said Prudy when she was inside and as she spoke her voice startled her it was so loud and hollow I ll talk some more thought she it makes such a queer noise Old missus Hogshead I thought I d come and see you and bring my work I like your house ma am only I should think you d want some windows I s pose you know who I am missus Hogshead My name is Prudy My mother didn t put me in here because I was a naughty girl for I haven t done nothing nor nothing nor nothing Do you want to hear some singing O come come away From labor now reposin Let busy Caro wife of Barrow Come come away Prudy what s the matter said mamma from the next room Didn t you hear somebody singing said Prudy well twas me O I was afraid you were crying my dear Then I ll stop said the child Now missus Hogshead you won t hear me singing any more it mortifies my mother very much So Prudy made her fingers fly and soon said Now mamma I ve got it done and I m ready to be took out Just then her father came into the house Prudy s in the hogshead said missus Parlin Won t you please lift her out father I ve got baby in my arms mister Parlin peeped into the hogshead How in this world did you ever get in here child said he I think I ll have to take you out with a pair of tongs Prudy laughed Give me your hands said papa Up she comes Now come sit on my knee added he when they had gone into the parlor and tell me how you climbed into that hogshead Mother dropped me in and I m going to stay there till I make a bedquilt only I m coming out to eat you know mister Parlin laughed but just then the dinner bell rang and when they went to the table Prudy was soon so busy with her roasted chicken and custard pie that she forgot all about the patchwork CHAPTER II PRUDY GOING UP TO HEAVEN Prudy soon tired of sewing and her mother said laughing If grandma Read has to wait for somebody s little fingers before she gets a bedquilt poor grandma will sleep very cold indeed The calico pieces went into the rag bag and that was the last of Prudy s patchwork One day the children wanted to go and play in the new house which was not quite done missus Parlin was almost afraid little Prudy might get hurt for there were a great many loose boards and tools lying about and the carpenters who were at work on the house had all gone away to see some soldiers But at last she said they might go if Susy would be very careful of her little sister I dare say Susy meant to watch Prudy with great care but after a while she got to thinking of something else The little one wanted to play catch but Susy saw a great deal more sport in building block houses Now I know ever so much more than you do said Susy I used to wash dishes and scour knives when I was four years old and that was the time I learned you to walk Prudy so you ought to play with me and be goody Then I will but them blocks is too big Susy If I had a axe I d chop em I ll go get a axe Little Prudy trotted off and Susy never looked up from her play and did not notice that she was gone a long while By and by missus Parlin thought she would go and see what the children were doing so she put on her bonnet and went over to the new house Susy was still busy with her blocks but she looked up at the sound of her mother s footsteps Where is Prudy said missus Parlin glancing around I m most up to heaven cried a little voice overhead They looked and what did they see Prudy herself standing on the highest beam of the house She had climbed three ladders to get there Her mother had heard her say the day before that she didn t want to shut up her eyes and die and be all deaded up she meant to have her hands and face clean and go up to heaven on a ladder O thought the poor mother she is surely on the way to heaven for she can never get down alive My darling my darling Poor Susy s first thought was to call out to Prudy but her mother gave her one warning glance and that was enough Susy neither spoke nor stirred missus Parlin stood looking up at her stood as white and still as if she had been frozen Her trembling lips moved a little but it was in prayer she knew that only God could save the precious one While she was begging Him to tell her what to do a sudden thought flashed across her mind She dared not speak lest the sound of her voice should startle the child but she had a bunch of keys in her pocket and she jingled the keys holding them up as high as possible that Prudy might see what they were When the little one heard the jingling she looked down and smiled You goin to let me have some cake and serves in the china closet me and Susy missus Parlin smiled such a smile It was a great deal sadder than tears though Prudy did not know that she only knew that it meant yes O then I m coming right down cause I like cake and serves I won t go up to heaven till bime by Then she walked along the beam and turned about to come down the ladders missus Parlin held her breath and shut her eyes She dared not look up for she knew that if Prudy should take one false step she must fall and be dashed in pieces But Prudy was not wise enough to fear any thing O no She was only thinking very eagerly about crimson jellies and fruit cake She crept down the ladders without a thought of danger no more afraid than a fly that creeps down the window pane The air was so still that the sound of every step was plainly heard as her little feet went pat pat on the ladder rounds God was taking care of her yes at length the last round was reached she had got down she was safe Thank God cried missus Parlin as she held little Prudy close to her heart while Susy jumped for joy exclaiming We ve got her we ve got her O ain t you so happy mamma O mamma what you crying for said little Prudy clinging about her neck Ain t I your little comfort there now you know what you speaked about You said you d get some cake and verserves for me and Susy CHAPTER III PRUDY S KNITTING WORK Susy felt as if she had been sadly to blame and for a long time was very watchful of her little sister Your name is Susy said the child and your middle name is Sister Susy and you take the care o me No I don t thought Susy to herself If I had taken any care of you at all you wouldn t have climbed those ladders When Prudy was four years old she teased to go to school and her mother decided to let her go until she grew tired of it O dear sighed Susy the first day she took her she ll talk out loud I just about know she will she s such a little chatter box Poh no I shan t said Prudy I ain t a checker box Susy Parlin but you are I shan t talk in school nor I shan t whisper never in my world When they got home that night missus Parlin asked if Prudy had whispered in school No ma am I never done such a thing I guess Did I Susy How much I didn t talk to you don t you know O she was pretty good mother said Susy but she cried once so I had to go out with her Now Susy Parlin you told me to cry She did mamma She said if I d cry she d give me a piece of her doughnut Susy blushed and her mother looked at her and said I would like to see you alone a little while Susy Then missus Parlin had a talk with Susy in the parlor and told her how wrong it was to deceive and how she must take the care of her little sister and set her good examples Susy said she would do as well as she could But mamma if you are willing I d rather not sit with Prudy now certainly She says such queer things Why to day she said she had grandma s rheumatism in her back and wanted me to look at her tongue and see if she hadn t Why mother as true as I live she shut up her eyes and put out her tongue right there in school and of course we girls couldn t help laughing Well perhaps she d better sit by herself replied missus Parlin smiling I will speak to the teacher about her carrying her knitting work that may keep her out of mischief Now it happened that grandma Read had taken a great deal of pains to teach Prudy to knit but such a piece of work as the child made of it The first time she carried the thing which she supposed was going to be a stocking the A B C scholars looked very much surprised for none of them knew how to knit Prudy said Poh I know how to do it just as easy But in trying to show them how smart she could be she knit so fast that she dropped a stitch every other moment There now you are dropping stitches like every thing said Lottie Palmer very much pleased I guess I know how to do that Poh them s nothing but the loops said Prudy But it was not long before she broke the yarn short off and got her work into such a fix that she had to take it home and ask grandma to fix it out Why child where s the ball said her grandmother And here s two needles gone O I left em to school I s pose said Prudy I m sure I never noticed em I found the ball under the teacher s desk once said Susy Well tain t there now replied Prudy it s all wounded now and I put it where it b longs Where s that asked grandma laughing Well I don t know answered Prudy trying to think but I guess it s somewhere missus Parlin began to think it was a foolish plan to let Prudy take her knitting work I was going to mention something she did the last day she carried it She got tired of knitting tired of twisting her pretty curls round her finger and tired of looking at pictures Let s guess riddles she whispered to Nancy Glover who sat on the bench beside her I can make up riddles just as easy There s something in this room in Miss Parker s watch pocket goes tick tick Now guess that that s a riddle I wish you d behave Prudy Parlin said Nancy Here I am trying to get my spelling lesson Then Nancy turned her head a little to one side and went to studying as hard as she could for it was almost time for her class to be called All at once Prudy happened to look at Nancy s ear and thought What funny little holes folks have in their ears I s pose they go clear through I guess I ll put my knitting needle right through Nannie s ear while she s a studyin The needle will look so funny stickin out at the other end So Prudy was very sly about it and said not a word but began to push in the needle with all her might O such sharp screams as Nannie gave The teacher was frightened but when she found that Nannie was not so very badly hurt after all she felt easier about her and began to talk to little Prudy asking her why she didn t sit still like a lady and mind Prudy began to cry I was a mindin said she of course I was I never knew twas a goin to hurt her Miss Parker smiled and said Well you needn t bring that knitting work here any more The next thing we should have somebody s eyes put out When Miss Parker called out the next class in spelling Nannie sat with her head down feeling very cross I don t like you Prudy said she You most killed me I ll pay you for this now you see Miss Parker had to call Nannie by name before she would go to her class She was three or four years older than Prudy and ought to have known better than to be angry with such a little child She should have forgotten all about it that would have been the best way But instead of that she kept thinking O how that knitting needle did hurt Prudy ought to be ashamed I ll pay her for it now you see You may be sure Prudy did not worry her little brains about it at all Her mother was brushing her hair next morning for school and mister Parlin said Don t you think she s too little to go to school mother I don t care about her learning to read yet awhile missus Parlin smiled in a droll way I should be very sorry myself to have Prudy learn to read replied she but she won t keep still long enough you needn t be a bit afraid Look here Prudy exclaimed mister Parlin can you spell any words Poh yes sir I guess I can replied Prudy her eyes looking very bright I can spell most all there is to spell O ho laughed mister Parlin Let s hear you spell your own name Can t do it can you Poh yes I can That ain t nothin Pre ed Prood Pre i eddy Prudy There Bravo cried papa You re getting ahead I declare Now can you spell Susy s name Spell Susy Why I can do it just as easy replied Prudy her eyes shining very bright indeed C ez Sooz C i ezzy Susy There Can t I spell Why I should think you could said papa laughing I can t begin to spell the way you do Now can you spell Cat Cat Cat repeated Prudy looking puzzled Well I guess I ve forgot how to spell cat But I can spell Kitty You just hear Kee et kit kee i etty kitty I can spell the big words the best What think now said missus Parlin The truth is Prudy knew eight letters when she began to go to school and now she knows but four Glad of it returned mister Parlin Are you ready for school little one And he held out his arms saying And now my own dear little girl There is no way but this Put your arms about my neck And give me one sweet kiss So Prudy hugged and kissed her father just as hard Then she and Susy trudged along to school and they met Nancy Glover who was carrying something in her apron Mayn t I see what you ve got said little Prudy Not till I get ready said Nancy Who stuck that knitting needle into my ear You know she didn t mean to said Susy I don t care cried Nancy it hurt Prudy felt very sorry I wish I hadn t hurt you Nanny said she cause I want to see what you ve got in your apron Well I guess you ll see it soon enough I brought it to school to purpose for you O did you cried the child How good you are Nanny I love you most as well as I do Susy When little Prudy spoke so sweetly Nancy didn t know what to say so she said nothing They went into the school house and took their seats Nancy keeping the corner of her apron rolled up all the while By and by when Miss Parker was hearing the third class Nancy whispered Look here Prudy Parlin you wanted to know what I had in my apron shall I show you now O goody Well then continued Nanny Open your mouth and shut your eyes And I ll give you something to make you wise So Prudy opened her mouth as wide as it would go and squeezed her eyelids together very hard Then what should Nancy do but take out of her apron a wee bit of a toad and drop it in Prudy s mouth I can t see how she dared do such a thing but she did it She had found the toad in the street and picked it up to frighten little Prudy The moment the toad was dropped on the child s tongue of course it began to hop Prudy hopped too She seized her tongue with one hand and the toad with the other screaming at the top of her voice The scholars were all frightened to hear such a scream and to see Prudy running out to the teacher so fast Do tell me what ails you said Miss Parker By that time Prudy had got rid of the toad and could speak O dear dear dear cried she I didn t know it was a toad till it hopped right up A toad here in the house cried Miss Parker No ma am said Prudy trembling and sobbing It wasn t in the house it was in my mouth right here on my tongue Prudy showed Miss Parker her tongue Miss Parker laughed thinking her a very funny child I ve heard before now of little folks having frogs in their throats said she Is that what you mean I guess so sobbed Prudy And it was alive just as alive as could be O O Nancy she told me to shut up my eyes you know and I didn t see the toad till it hopped right up in my mouth and then I didn t see it O O Nancy come here said Miss Parker sternly What have you been doing to this little child Nancy came out with her fingers in her mouth but did not speak Answer me did you drop a toad into Prudy s mouth Yes replied Nancy sulkily but she stuck a knitting needle into my ear fust For shame you wicked child said Miss Parker Take up that toad Nancy and carry it out of doors then come to me for I must punish you Now Prudy added Miss Parker what do you think I ought to do to Nancy for being so naughty I don t know answered Prudy crying still I don t s pose my mother would be willing to have folks put toads in my mouth But what do you think I ought to do to her said Miss Parker smiling Was you goin to whip her asked Prudy looking up through her tears I think I must my child Well I hope you won t hurt her said dear little Prudy Please to don t But Miss Parker struck Nancy with a piece of whalebone and hurt her a good deal It was the only way to make Nancy remember not to do such a cruel trick again When Prudy saw how much Nancy was hurt it was more than her tender heart could bear She ran up to Miss Parker and caught hold of the skirt of her dress hiding her head in it O Miss Parker said she I ve got to cry Nanny won t do so no more The toad was just as alive as could be but it never bit a bit O won t you please to don t CHAPTER IV PRUDY S PICNIC This was about the last of Prudy s going to school In the first place she was very tired of it in the second place it was vacation and in the third place the whole family were going to Willowbrook on a visit It was very pleasant at grandpa Parlin s at any time Such a stout swing in the big oil nut tree Such a beautiful garden with a summer house in it Such a nice cosy seat in the trees So many cubby holes all about to hide in But this summer I speak of was pleasanter than ever for the Western cousins Grace and Horace Clifford had come from Indiana to visit their friends in Maine The Parlin children had not seen them for two years but Grace and Susy became fast friends in a very short time while little Prudy was thrown one side for Horace to take care of when he could stop O dear suz said she one morning I m so glad there happened to be a world and God made me What you here Prudy said grandma Parlin What made you get up so early O the flies waked me I s pose I was dreaming about my pignig I thought I had it on top o the trees Ah it s the day for Grace s party sure enough said her grandmother sighing a little and stirring faster at her drop cake You mean my party said Prudy dancing around the table The party b longs to me You didn t know that did you You d better go and talk to your aunt Madge said grandma I m busy O said Prudy I guess you ain t glad I got up I tried to keep asleep grandma but the flies waked me Prudy was going out of the room but turned and came back Grandma said she if you love me why don t you hug me O I can t stop dear said grandma laughing we can t hug little girls all the time But she did it After a while Grace and Horace and Susy came down stairs and then there was a great time As soon as breakfast was over kind aunt Madge promised to make out a list of the little folks to be invited First of all said she are you going to have boys and girls or only girls O we don t want any boys said cousin Grace tossing her head they race round and act so Of course we don t want em said Susy I d laugh if we d got to have a lot of noisy boys Poh we don t want boys echoed Prudy They are pickin fusses all the time Cousin Horace stood by aunt Madge s chair looking quite forlorn but too proud to say a word See here Horace said Grace very grandly we think you d better go a strawberrying to day I reckon I won t if I don t want to said Horace working the flag out of his cap He knew the girls thought he was almost always in the way I want to tell you something Horace said aunt Madge stroking his hair mister Allen is going out to North Pond with some other gentleman fishing and I begged him to let you go and he said he would though he wouldn t take the girls for any thing There girls cried Horace with beaming face Did mister Allen truly say so auntie Of course he wouldn t have girls go If we caught a fish how they would scream wouldn t they though Horace darted off to find mister Allen and so he was out of the girls way Now said aunt Madge smiling tell me what girls you want to ask Grace So they gave several names Grace and Susy which Prudy repeated after them But where is Abby Grant said aunt Madge Don t you want her Grace and Susy looked at each other without speaking Prudy looked at them I don t go with such poor girls when I m home said Grace Nor I don t said Susy Nor me neither chimed in little Prudy glad to know what to say Aunt Madge shook her curly head I guess you mustn t have a party said she if you slight good little girls because they are poor Why I should ask her a great deal quicker because it isn t often she has any thing nice to eat at home So would I said Grace looking ashamed You may put her name down auntie Yes put her name down auntie said Prudy Such a time as there was to get ready for that party Aunt Madge and aunt Louise worked with all their might cooking nice things and the children were too happy to keep still Susy s mother had gone back to Portland When the first little girl arrived Grace and Susy hadn t the slightest idea what to do with her and aunt Madge had to go in and set them to playing Puss in the corner The next girl that came was Abby Grant I s posed ye wouldn t come said Prudy We never asked you Why child said Grace blushing yes we did ask her too O so we did said foolish little Prudy We asked you Abby cause you don t get any thing nice to eat to your house Grace didn t shake Prudy only because she didn t dare to In a few minutes all the little girls had come and the whole party went into the front yard to play Aunt Madge made believe she was a little girl and played Ring Round Rosy Catch and Button as hard as any body When they had played till they were all out of breath aunt Louise sent them to the summer house in the garden to rest while she and aunt Madge set the table in the front yard O the apple puffs and lemon tarts and little seed cakes and frosted cake and candy looked so good to poor little Abby Grant Then the raspberries like red coral and the white currants like round pearls Then the flowers fresh from the garden The children sat on the double steps of the long piazza to eat their supper They had plenty of room and it was nice fun to peep round the great white pillars at their neighbors plates and whisper to one another I m having a grand time ain t you What splendid cake Don t you wish you lived here And the two aunties smiled and said to each other It is worth all our trouble to see these children so happy After the table was cleared away they sang several pieces and Prudy s sweet little voice filled all the pauses with some funny little chorus of her own When the party broke up the children were quite tired out and glad to go to bed Well said Grace as they went slowly upstairs didn t my picnic go off nicely Your pignig said Prudy why it b longs to me I had it myself Hush said Susy Cousin Grace came two thousand miles to see us and grandma promised her this party and she had it There now Susy said Prudy much grieved I ve got a cent and I was goin to buy you some shiny shoes but now I shan t Grace and Susy could not help laughing and poor tired little Prudy could not bear that There cried she don t you do that again If you ll say twas my pignig Susy Parlin then I ll kiss you but if you say it isn t I won t speak to you again never in my world Well it wasn t your picnic so there said Susy Prudy settled her cheek to the pillow Susy Parlin said she drowsily I ain t a goin to speak to you again till you say twas my pig But in the middle of a word Prudy made a mistake and dropped off to sleep CHAPTER V PRUDY IN THE PINES No my dears said grandma I couldn t consent to let you go strawberrying up by the Pines as you call it It is mister Judkins s mowing field But grandma said Grace Johnny Gordon went there yesterday and there wasn t any fuss about it Then you may be sure mister Judkins did not know it said grandma If he should catch any children in his field he would be sure to give them a severe scolding Besides chimed in aunt Madge Prudy isn t fit to walk so far she isn t very well No she is quite out of sorts said grandma So if you must go somewhere you may take your little baskets and go out in the meadow on the other side of the cornfield Only take good care of Prudy now remember Grandma always says that over said Susy as the three children were on their way to the meadow and aunt Madge always says it too take care of Prudy As if she were a little baby That is all because she cries so much I presume said Grace looking at poor Prudy rather sternly I did hope Susy that when Horace went down to the crick fishing you and I might go off by ourselves and have a nice time for once But here is little Pitcher right at our heels We never can have any peace Little Miss Somebody thinks she must follow of course Yes that s the way it is said Susy Some folks are always round you know Now Susy said Prudy forcing back her tears as well as she could I guess you don t love your little sister or you wouldn t talk that way to me They gathered strawberries for a while in silence Prudy picking more leaves than berries and sometimes in her haste to keep up with the others pulling up grass by the roots Well I don t think much of this said Grace there ain t more than ten strawberries in this meadow and those ain t bigger than peas O I know it said Susy in the tone of one who has made up her mind for the worst I suppose we ve got to stay here though We could go up in the Pines now if it wasn t for Prudy and they are real thick up there Yes said Grace but grandma knew we couldn t without she would be sure to follow Do you think mister Judkins would be likely to scold Susy No indeed said Susy eating a dry strawberry He keeps sheep and goes round talking to himself I ain t a bit afraid of him What could we little girls do to his grass I d like to know It isn t as if we were great rude boys is it Grace No said Grace thoughtfully Now if we could only get rid of Prudy Little Prudy pushed back her shaker and looked up showing a pair of flushed cheeks damp with tears I don t think you are very polite to me said the child Bime by I shall go to heaven and I shan t never come back any more and then I guess you ll cry What shall we do said Grace looking at Susy we mustn t take her and we can t go without her Well I m a goin right straight home right off that s what I m goin to do said Prudy and when I say my prayers I shall just tell God how naughty you be Prudy turned short about and the girls went toward the Pines feeling far from happy for a still small voice told them they were doing wrong They had got about half way up the hill when looking back there was Prudy puffing and running for dear life I thought you had gone home said Susy quite vexed Well I didn t said Prudy who had got her smiles all back again I couldn t get home cause I got my feet most damp and some wet I won t be no trouble Susy So the girls made the best of it and helped little Mother Bunch up the long steep hill Prudy had one hearty cry before the long walk was over Her nose fell on a rock she said but as it was only grazed a little she soon forgot about it This is something worth while now said Grace after they had at last reached the field and were seated in the tall grass The strawberries are as thick as spatter Yes said Susy and grandma and aunt Madge will be so glad to see our baskets full they ll certainly be glad we didn t stay in the meadow Big as your thumb ain t they Illustration FLYING FROM THE FIELD You see the girls were trying to stifle that still small voice and they tried to believe they were having a good time Grace and Susy had got their baskets nearly half full and Prudy had covered the bottom of hers with leaves stems and a few berries when a man s voice was heard muttering not far off O Grace whispered Susy that s mister Judkins He carried a whetstone on which he was sharpening his jackknife Ah said he talking to himself and not appearing to notice the girls I never would have thought that these little children ah would have come into my field ah and trampled down my grass I shall hate ah to cut off their little ears ah and see the blood running down I suppose it was not two minutes before the children had left that field pulling the screaming Prudy through the bars as roughly as if she had been a sack of wool instead of flesh and blood their hair flying in the wind and their poor little hearts pounding against their sides like trip hammers If the field had been on fire they could not have run faster dragging helpless Prudy who screamed all the way at the very top of her voice Susy and Prudy had thrown away their pretty little baskets Grace had pushed hers up her arm and her sleeve was soaking in the red juice of the bruised strawberries while little streams of juice were trickling down her nice buff colored dress ruining it entirely You hadn t ought to have took me up there sobbed Prudy as soon as she could find her voice and these were the first words spoken O hush hush right up cried Susy in terror He s after us to take us to jail The family were really frightened when the panting children rushed into the house in such a plight It was a crazy drunk man cried Prudy and he had a axe No said Grace it was that wicked mister Judkins and it was his jackknife And he snips off your ears and nose broke in Prudy and blood comes a runnin down and he kills you dead and then he puts you in jail and then he chased us don t you hear him comin What does all this mean cried grandma and aunt Madge in one breath Have you been in that mowing field children Grace and Susy hung their heads Yes they did said Prudy and I wasn t well and they shouldn t have gone and took me up there and twas cause they were naughty What shall I do with children that disobey me in this manner said grandma much displeased Worst of all said aunt Madge pulling off Prudy s shoes this child has got her feet wet and is sure to be sick CHAPTER VI PRUDY SICK When aunt Madge went up stairs that night she found little Prudy hiding her head under the pillow and screaming with fright O there I was cried the child tossing up her arms all tumbled out of the window And the man got me and I begun to be dead Why no darling said aunt Madge here is auntie close by you and here you are in your pretty white bed don t you see No no screamed Prudy I m up in the Pines I ain t here Perhaps you d like to have me sing to you said aunt Madge and she began in a low voice a little ditty Prudy loved There was a little darling I used to know And they called her Prudy Long time ago Stop Nancy said Prudy you put a toad in my mouth I must have a drink dreffully Aunt Madge brought some water but her fingers were not steady and the glass trembled against the child s hot lips She watched till Prudy dozed again and then stole softly down stairs to get a night candle and to tell her mother she was really afraid Prudy was going to be sick But missus Parlin said aunt Madge mustn t be nervous that children were very apt to be out of their heads in the night and she was pretty sure Prudy would wake up bright in the morning Aunt Madge tried to hope so but she hardly slept a wink for Prudy tossed and twisted all night Sometimes she thought she was picking berries on the tufted coverlet Sometimes she cried out that the crazy man was coming with a axe When grandma saw her purple cheeks by daylight she did not laugh at aunt Madge She brushed the soft curls away from the little one s hot temples and said softly How do you feel Prudy darling A wild light burned in the child s eyes It isn t Prudy screamed she I ain t her Go way You re goin to snip off my nose O go right off You may be sure that Grace and Susy were far from happy that day When they noticed that their grandmother grew more and more uneasy and when they saw the doctor s gig at the gate their hearts were very heavy O Grace said Susy sobbing Prudy thought we didn t love her We kept saying she was always round How much do you suppose she is sick O dear I don t know said Grace wringing her hands but I ll tell you one thing we ought to have seen to her Susy O Grace said Susy you don t begin to feel so bad as I do you can t because you haven t got any little sister Only think of my scolding to such a darling little thing as she is Come you go up stairs and see what the doctor says said Grace you steal in easy O I don t dare to whispered Susy I m all of a tremble But the moment their grandmother s step was heard in the passage they flew to her missus Parlin set her vial down on the hall table I don t like to tell you said she shaking her head sadly the doctor calls her a very sick child and says he is afraid of brain fever Do they die with that cried Susy seizing hold of her grandmother s dress O stop a minute is she going to die We hope not said missus Parlin but she is so sick that we shall send a despatch for your mother I want you to try and keep the house still girls and coax Horace to stay out of doors Keep the house still I guess we will said Grace O grandma will you forgive us for being so naughty yesterday Can you forgive us said Susy I tell you we feel awfully about it grandma missus Parlin took off her spectacles to wipe them My dear children said she gravely I am ready to forgive you with all my heart but I hope that before this you have asked pardon of your dear Father in heaven That is the first thing you know Susy stole off into the nursery and threw herself on the lounge O God sobbed she I should think you would hate me I have acted so bad O can you forgive me and not take Prudy I never will do so again I didn t mean any thing when I said she was always round O don t let her die and be put in the ground Please don t dear God Seems to me I love her the best of any body When we have any fuss it s always me that s to blame Here Susy s prayer was drowned in sobs but her heart felt a little lighter because she had told her kind Father just how she felt and if it was best for Prudy to get well she was sure he would save her Prudy s mother came in the cars that night looking pale and troubled Prudy did not know her Why don t you bring my own mamma said she Look at me darling said her mother here I am right here Mother won t leave her little Prudy again I ain t Prudy screamed the child Prudy s gone to heaven God came and helped her up the steps One of the first things missus Parlin did was to cut off her little daughter s beautiful curls and lay them tenderly away in a drawer Ah sister Madge said she you can t guess how it makes my heart ache to have my child take me for a stranger Perhaps she may know you to morrow said aunt Madge though in her heart she had very little hope of the child But Prudy did not know any body to morrow nor the next day nor the next O the long weary time that they watched by her bed The terrible disease seemed to be drinking up her life Her cheeks looked as if fierce fires were hidden in them and when she raved so wildly her eyes shone like flames A deep hush had fallen on the house Grace and Susy would go and sit by the hour in their seat in the trees and talk about dear little Prudy Horace had the heartache too and asked every day Do you think she s going to die Nobody could answer him and he had to wait like all the rest But God did not mean that Prudy should die At last after many days the fever died out like a fire when it has burned the wood all down to cinders Then there was a pale little girl left who looked as if a breath would blow her away like white ashes I think a little baby that tips over if you touch it could not be weaker than Prudy was when she began to get well Ah but it was so joyful to see her own sweet smile once more though never so faint And every low word she spoke now dropped from her lips like a note of music Her father and mother and the whole family were full of joy and Grace and Susy went to their cosy seat in the trees to talk over the pretty things they were going to make for Prudy when she should be well enough to enjoy them CHAPTER VII PRUDY S PRESENT Well dear said grandma coming up stairs one morning all out of breath what did you call me for What do you want little one I don t know said Prudy but I guess I shall want somethin by and by There there darling said grandma don t cry No I won t said Prudy trying to stop I was a talkin to myself and I said I won t cry no more and then I cried I don t like to stay in this country grandma thout I can have somethin to eat Of all things said grandma I don t believe there s a little girl any where that has so many nice things as you do See the jelly and oranges and lemons and Well if I wasn t sick grandma and you should ask me to eat some smashed potatoes and some pie I d eat em said Prudy smiling through her tears Bless your little heart cried grandma kissing Prudy s pale cheek Can t you think of something besides eating What pretty thing shall I bring you to look at O now I know what it is I want replied Prudy lifting her head from the pillow I want to eat up the old lady Prudy was thinking of a little image aunt Madge had formed out of candy O that s made to be looked at said grandma Let s see where do you suppose your little Zip is nowadays I guess he misses Prudy I don know I ate a little dog once said Prudy wiping her eyes He was made out of a doughnut Once when I lived to Portland to my mother s Portland I used to eat things Poor grandma herself could hardly keep from crying to see Prudy so hungry Here is some nice arrow root said she You may have it all if you like You are a darling little girl not to tease for things you ought not to have I believe she went on looking at patient little Prudy as she drained the bowl I should like to give such a good child a pretty present O dear me suz screamed Prudy I m glad I didn t go to heaven yet Will it be a little wee doll that can live in a thimble made out of sugar Well said grandma I don t know You may be thinking all day what you would like best Not to eat dear but to keep remember Now I must go down stairs but here come Grace and Susy so you won t be lonesome It was pleasant to see how softly the little girls entered the room and how the glad smiles came and went on Prudy s face when they tried to amuse her They were dressed in a very funny rig Susy looked a great deal wiser than an owl out of a pair of spectacles without any eyes and a flaring cap Grace had stuck some false hair on her head and a bonnet that looked as if a wagon wheel had rolled over it Fine day missus Prudy said Grace how have you been ma am I ve been a thinkin said Prudy smiling about my present You see we ve come a visiting missus Prudy said Grace Very sorry ma am to see your doll looking so sick Has she got the smallpox No ma am answered Prudy delighted she s got the measles Deary me said Susy pushing back her cap and trying to look frightened how was she taken ma am Taken repeated Prudy taken sick She s got it all over her Poor little creeter cried Grace rolling up her eyes how she must suffer I hope she s out of her head Does she have her senses ma am Her what said Prudy O yes m she s got em I laid em up on the shelf to keep em for her Here the two visitors turned away their heads to laugh What do you s pose my present will be said Prudy forgetting their play Look here Susy I could take that vase now and smash it right down on the floor and break it and grandma wouldn t scold cause I m sick you know But you wouldn t do it said Grace O here come mister Allen and aunt Madge Now missus Prudy you re going to have a ride mister Allen laughed to see aunt Madge bundle Prudy so much and said the child would be so heavy that he could not carry her in his arms but I think he found her only too light after all Prudy almost forgot how hungry she was when she was seated in her little carriage and wheeled about the pleasant yard She had an idea that the trees and the flowers in the garden were having good times and the open windows of the house looked as if they were laughing But she did not say much and when aunt Madge asked her what made her so quiet she said she was a thinkin And the most of her small thoughts were about her present Now said mister Allen I m going to hold you up so you can peep over into the pig pen There do you see that little mite of a white piggy O dear dear dear cried Prudy clapping her hands what a cunning little piggy wiggy He looks nice enough to eat right up I never did see such a darling O he winks his eyes see him He ain t dead is he Not a mite No my little dear he s alive enough if that s all said mister Allen O my stars said Prudy sighing with delight Don t you wish you had such a pretty pink nose and such little bits of shiny eyes mister Allen laughed O so white and nice added Prudy He hasn t got a speck of red cheeks cept his nose and little toes Mayn t he have one of my oranges I never did see any thing look so much like a sugar pig It did mister Allen and aunt Madge a world of good to see the child so pleased Do you know said she eagerly who that piggy b longs to Why to grandpa I suppose O said Prudy very sadly while the bright color died out of her cheeks at once I didn t know but it b longed to grandma Well you little pet said aunt Madge laughing what do you care who it b longs to You can look at it all the same can t you But said Prudy do you s pose S pose what Do you s pose if grandpa thought I was a darlin Prudy could get no farther Of course he knows you re a darling said aunt Madge Do you s pose when I don t tease for things to eat and grandma says I may think what I want for a present he d be willing I should have she should give me that piggy O what a Prudy said aunt Madge laughing till she cried Isn t there something nicer you would like for a present You d better think again O no no said Prudy trembling with eagerness If grandma should give me a house full of dolls and candy all rolled up and every single present in the world I d rather have that piggy Well well said mister Allen I guess the folks that wouldn t give their pigs away to Prudy don t live here Let s go and see They went into the house to see grandpa Of course he said Yes Of all the funny presents said grandma but Prudy was happy and that was enough Grandpa was very kind but there was one thing he would not consent to he would not let the pig come into the house But as he said he would be sure to take good care of it and give it sweet milk to drink Prudy did not mind so much When she grew stronger she fed it herself and the pretty creature knew her and was glad to see her Prudy thought Now she had a great many presents that summer but none that pleased her half so well as the little pet pig CHAPTER VIII PRUDY FISHING One morning after Prudy was quite well aunt Madge told her she might go into the garden and get some currants While she was picking with all her might and breathing very fast she saw Horace close by on the other side of the fence with a pole in his hand I thought you was to school cried Prudy Well I ain t said Horace pulling his hat over his eyes and looking ashamed The teacher don t keep no order and I won t go to such a school so there They don t want me to go said Prudy cause I should know too much I can say all my letters now right down straight thout looking on either O ho cried Horace trailing his long pole you can t say em skipping about and I shouldn t care if I was you But you ought to know how to fish Miss Don t you wish you could drop in your line and catch em the way I do Do they like to have you catch em said Prudy dropping her little dipper and going to the fence don t it hurt Hurt Not as I know of They needn t bite if they don t want to No returned Prudy looking very wise I s pose they want to get out and that s why they bite Of course when fishes stay in the water much it makes em drown O my stars cried Horace laughing you ought to live out west you re such a cunning little spud Come now here s another fish pole for you I ll show you how to catch one and I bet twill be a pollywog you re just big enough But grandma didn t say I might go down to the river Wait till I go ask her Poh said Horace no you needn t I have to hurry Grandma always likes it when you go with me Prudy because you see I m a boy and she knows I can take care of you twice as well as Grace and Susy can O cried Prudy clapping her little hands they won t any of em know I can fish and how they ll laugh But there now they don t let me climb the fence I forgot Well give us your bonnet and then you scooch down and I ll pull you through There said the naughty boy when they had got down to the river now I ve been and put a bait on the end of your hook and I plump it in the water so You just hold on to the pole But it jiggles it tips me cried Prudy and as she spoke she fell face downwards on the bank Well that s smart said Horace picking her up There you sit down next time and I ll prop up the pole with a rock this way There now you hold it a little easy and when you feel a nibble you let me know What s a nibble asked Prudy shaking the line A nibble Why it s a bite They sat quite still for some minutes the hot sun glaring on Prudy s bare head with its rings of soft golden hair Now now cried she suddenly I ve got a nibble Horace sprang to draw up her line I feel it right here on my neck said the child I s pose it s a fly Now look here said Horace rather vexed you re a little too bad You made me drop my line just when I was going to have a nibble Wait till you feel the string wiggle and then speak but don t scream The children sat still for a few minutes longer and no sound was heard but now and then a wagon going over the bridge But they might as well have dropped their lines in the sand for all the fish they caught Horace began to wish he had gone to school O dear groaned Prudy getting tired I never did see such fishes I guess they don t want to be catched There now you ve spoke again and scared one away said Horace If it hadn t been for you I should have got I don t know how many by this time Prudy s lip began to tremble and two big round tears rose to her eyes Poh crying about that said Horace you re a nice little girl if you do talk too much so don t you cry Horace rather enjoyed seeing Grace and Susy in tears but could never bear to have Prudy cry I ll tell you what it is said Horace when Prudy s eyes were clear again I don t think I make much playing hookey I don t like playing hookey neither returned Prudy cause the hooks won t catch em O you don t know what I mean laughed Horace When we boys out west stay out of school we call that playing hookey O do you But I want to go home now if we can t catch any nibbles No I ll tell you what we ll do we ll walk out on that log and try it there The river was quite high and this was one of the logs that had drifted down from the Rips Prudy was really afraid to walk on it because it was so round but not liking to be laughed at she crept on her hands and knees to the very end of the log trembling all the way Horace took the two poles and followed but the moment he stepped on the log it rolled quite over carrying Prudy under I do not know what Horace thought then but he had to think fast If he had been older he might have plunged in after Prudy but he was only a little boy seven years old so he ran for the house O how he ran Aunt Madge was ironing in the back kitchen She heard heavy breathing and the quick pattering of feet and the words gasped out Prudy s in the river Prudy screamed aunt Madge looking wildly at the boy s face which was as white as death Run tell grandpa cried she and flew down the steps and out across the field towards the river as if she had wings on her slippers though it seemed to her they were clogged with lead Has she just been saved from death only to be drowned was one of the quick thoughts that rushed across aunt Madge s dizzy brain I shall be too late too late And her mother gone God forgive me It is I who should have watched her Poor aunt Madge as if any one was to blame but Horace There was a child crying down by the river Not Prudy thought aunt Madge It sounds like her voice but it can t be She has sunk by this time Don t be afraid Prudy cried mister Allen who was just behind aunt Madge we are running to you The cry came up louder it was Prudy s voice mister Allen leaped the fence at a bound and ran down the bank The child was out of the water struggling to climb the bank but slipping back at every step She was dripping wet and covered with sand mister Allen lifted her in his arms and there she lay sobbing as if her heart would break but not speaking a word When she was lying clean and warm in soft blankets and had had a nap she told them how she got out The log kept jiggling said she and I couldn t hold on but I did I thought my father would say I was a nice little girl not to get drowned and let the fishes eat me up and so I kept a holdin on Only think said grandma shuddering and looking at Horace if Prudy hadn t held on Horace seemed very sad and humble and was still quite pale It makes you feel mortified don t it Race said Prudy smiling don t you feel as if you could cry At these first words little Prudy had spoken to him since she fell into the water the boy ran out of the room and hid in the green chamber for he never would let any one see him cry O won t you forgive him said Prudy looking up into missus Clifford s face won t you forgive him aunt Ria he feels so bad and he didn t catch a fish and he didn t mean to and twas the log that jiggled So Horace was forgiven for Prudy s sake CHAPTER IX THE HATCHET STORY One night the children clustered about their aunt Madge begging for a story Fairy you know said Susy A fairy story repeated aunt Madge I don t know about that I told a little boy a fairy story once and he went right off and whispered to his mother that I was a very wicked lady for that story wasn t true not a bit and if a baby six months old should hear it he wouldn t believe a word of it Poh he was a smart boy cried Horace So I am afraid to tell fairy stories since that for I don t like to be called a wicked lady you know There now auntie said Susy don t you s pose we know they re only play stories Just as if we hadn t a speck of sense Well let me see said aunt Madge covering her eyes with her fingers Once upon a time when the moon was full Full of what said Prudy who was leaning on the arm of her auntie s chair and peeping up into her face full of fairies When the moon was round my child said auntie stroking the little one s hair But wait I ll tell a story Prudy can understand wouldn t you my dears When I was a little girl Illustration AUNT MADGE TELLING A STORY That s right cried the children O tell about that Was you about as big as me said Prudy and was your name little Madge Yes they called me little Madge sometimes and sometimes Maggie When I was about as old as our Susy I happened to go into the back room one day and saw uncle Edward s hatchet lying on the meat block I knew I had no right to touch it but it came into my head that I would try to break open the clams The hatchet instead of cracking the shells came down with full force on my foot I had on thick boots but it cut through my right boot deep into the bone O how I screamed I should have thought you would auntie cried Grace fairly turning pale Did it bring the blood Yes indeed Why when I went into the kitchen my footsteps were tracked with little pools of blood oozing out of my boot Sister Maria screamed out O look at Maggie She s cut her foot with that hatchet No no I haven t said I for I was frightened almost to death and afraid of being punished for disobedience You see father had forbidden us little ones ever to touch the hatchet Why you told a right up and down fib said Susy looking shocked A real whopper said Horace shaking his head So I did children and before my story is done you shall see what misery my sin caused me Did mister Gustus Allen know about it asked little Prudy I guess not replied aunt Madge blushing He lived ever so far off then O dear sighed Prudy I wish he hadn t gone to the wars How it made you cry Hush up please can t you Prudy said Susy Aunt Madge is telling a story Well they sent for the doctor in great haste and then tried to pull off my boot but my foot was so badly swollen and bleeding so fast that it took a great while I can t tell how long for I fainted When the doctor saw the wound they said he looked very sober So so little girl said he that was after I came to myself you thought you d make me a good job while you were about it There s no half way work about you You are the child that had the tip of a finger clipped off in the corn sheller hey I was always afraid of doctor Foster so I only buried my face in my apron and cried She must have brought the hatchet down with a great deal of force said the doctor See missus Parlin how deep it went into the bone I fell and hit my foot I sobbed out I never touched the hatchet I knew well enough that the doctor didn t believe me So so said he Very well never mind how twas done but keep your foot still little one and we ll talk about the hatchet another time missus Parlin if it goes to bleeding again be sure to send for me It was ever so long before I could walk a step Every time any body spoke of my hurt I said Why I was just coming into the house with those clams and my foot slipped and I fell and hit me on something I don t know whether it was a hatchet or a stick of wood but I never touched the hatchet There I shouldn t have thought that of you auntie said Grace Poh cried Horace they must have known you was a foolin of course they did Well every time the doctor came to see me he laughed and asked me how I cut my foot Just the same as I did in the first place you know said I I don t know nothing about it only I never touched the hatchet Well he would answer you remember the old saying A lie well stuck to is better than the truth wavering I didn t know what that meant but he laughed so that I knew he was making sport of me I knew nobody believed me The hatchet had been found red with blood and mother looked O so sad but I had told that falsehood so many times that it did seem as if I hadn t any courage left to tell the truth It had grown to be very easy to keep saying I never touched the hatchet Makes me think of that play My father s lost his hatchet whispered Susy to Grace Every one tried to amuse me while I was sick but there was always a thorn in my pillow A thorn said Prudy Not a real thorn dear I mean I had told a wrong story and I couldn t feel happy Here Susy turned away her head and looked out of the window though she saw nothing there but grandpa coming in from the garden with a watering pot Whenever father looked at me I felt just as if he was thinking Margaret doesn t tell the truth and when mother spoke my name quick I was afraid she was going to say something about the hatchet I got well only I limped a little Then it was almost time to think of making presents for the Christmas tree I didn t like to have Christmas come while I was feeling so People are so good that day I thought That is the time when every body loves you and spends money for you I wanted to confess and feel clean but then I had told that lie over so many times that I thought I couldn t take it back I talked it over with myself a great while though and at last said I I will I ll do it First I asked God to forgive me and help me and when I had got as far as that the thing was half done children I went into the parlor where your grandfather was he wasn t deaf then I thought I should choke but I caught hold of one of the buttons on his coat and spoke as fast as I could O father said I I ve told more than a hundred thousand lies I did take that hatchet Will you forgive me Did he asked Susy Forgive I guess he did My dear child it was just what he had been waiting to do And O I can tell you he talked to me in such a way about the awful sin of lying that I never never forgot it and shan t if I live to be a hundred years old My father had forgiven me I was sure God had forgiven me too and after that I felt as if I could look people in the face once more and I had a splendid time Christmas I believe that s about all the story there is to it children Well said Grace I m much obliged to you auntie I think it s just as nice as a fairy story don t you Susy I don t know I m sure replied Susy looking confused See here auntie I ve lost your gold ring My ring said aunt Madge I forgot that I let you take it Don t you know I asked you for it when you stood by the table making bread and it slipped off my finger this afternoon into the water barrel Why Susy And I was a coward and didn t dare tell you auntie I thought maybe you d forget I had it and some time when you asked for it I was going to say Hadn t you better take a pair of tongs and see if it isn t in the water barrel O Susy said aunt Madge She isn t any worse than me auntie said Grace Ma asked me how the mud came on my handkerchief and I said Prudy wiped my boots with it And so she did auntie but I told her to and wasn t I such a coward for laying it off on little Prudy I am ashamed you may believe I am I am glad you have told me the whole truth now replied aunt Madge though it does make me feel sad too for it s too much like my hatchet story O do remember from this time children and never never dare be cowards again Just then grandpa Parlin came to the door with a sad face saying Margaret please come up stairs and see if you can soothe poor little Harry by singing He is so restless that neither Maria nor I can do any thing with him This baby Horace s brother was sick all the time now and once in a while Margaret s sweet voice would charm him to sleep when every thing else failed CHAPTER X MORE STORIES I move we have some more stories said Horace the next evening as they were sitting in the twilight It s your turn Gracie Well I don t know but I d as soon tell a story as not replied Grace pushing back her curls I reckon Pincher wants to hear one he begins to wag his tail I can t make up any thing as I go along but I can tell a sober true story Certain true black and blue asked Prudy who always would have something to say whether she knew what she was talking about or not Didn t I ever tell you about our school dog out West aunt Madge You see it was so queer I don t know where in the world he came from He had one of his eyes put out and was most blind out of the other and only a stump of a tail and didn t know how to get his living like other dogs O dear it was so funny he should take it into his head to come to school now wasn t it auntie He knew Miss All n just as well as could be and used to go with the rest of the scholars to meet her every morning and when she patted him on the head and said Good old doggie it did seem like he d fly out of his wits Then when she rang the bell he trotted in just as proud hanging down his head as meek as could be He thought she rang the bell for him as much as any of the rest of the scholars His seat was right by the stove on the floor it wasn t a seat I mean and he just lay there the whole living time and slept and snored you see he was so old auntie But then we all loved him we just loved him so O dear me it s as much as I can do to keep from crying and I don t know how any body could help it What was I talking about O he used to walk round under the seats just as sly sometimes and put his nose into the dinner baskets I tell you he liked cake that dog did and he liked meat and mince pie You see he could smell for his nose was as good as ever it was and the girls used to cry sometimes when he picked out the nice things But then we just loved him so you know auntie Why we thought he was just as good as any body He never bit nor growled that dog didn t not a mite There wasn t one of us but he loved specially Miss All n Now wasn t it too bad missus Snell made such a fuss She didn t love that dog one speck I don t know as she ever saw him and she didn t care whether he was dead or alive I just know she didn t I ll tell you how it was Sometimes he got locked up all night He d be asleep you know by the stove or else under the seats and Miss All n would forget and suppose he was gone with the rest of the scholars Well he was a darling old dog if he did chew up the books I just about know he got hungry in the night or he never would have thought of it How did he know it was wrong he didn t know one letter from another He spoiled Jenny Snell s spelling book I know and lots of readers and things but what if he did auntie now what of it I ain t crying any thing about that I wouldn t have you to think But you see missus Snell made a great fuss and went to her husband and told him he ought to be shot That mister Snell ought to be shot Now Susy I shouldn t think you d feel like laughing or making fun The dog of course and they sent for the city marshal You know mister Garvin Horace Yes the man that scowls so with the scar on his nose and a horse whip in his hand Miss All n cried She lifted up the lid of her desk and hid her head but we all knew she was crying You see we had such a time about it We thought he was going to carry the dog off to some place and take care of him like he was his master or may be shut him up or something that way but do you believe he just shot that dog right in the yard How dreadful Yes auntie I reckon it was We all cried like we should kill ourselves and put our fingers in our ears for we heard the man when he fired the gun I mean we heard the gun when the man fired it and then it was of no use but we stopped our ears and Miss All n hid her face and cried and cried and cried O dear me it did seem like we didn t any of us want to go to school any more if we couldn t see our old dog coming to meet us and rub his head against our dresses And it was just as lonesome now it was so auntie Poor old doggie sighed aunt Madge It wasn t you was it Pincher cried Horace seizing his dog by both ears I reckon if they tried to shoot you they d catch it Now Susy it s your turn said Grace No Horace s he s the oldest Pshaw returned Horace who had been the very first one to propose stories I d like to get shut of it Pshaw I can t think of nothin But you must you know Horace so it s no use to grumble O shucks Has it got to be true Don t say shucks Horace said Grace gently You can tell a true story or make it up as you go along Come hurry I know what I m goin to tell whispered Prudy to Horace Well said the boy thinking a moment I ll tell my story double quick and be done with it You d ought to see my pa s horse out West auntie there ain t a Yankee horse can hold a candle to him I ll leave it to Pincher His name is Sancho and my ma sends him to market mornings early with the basket and puts some money in and a note to the butcher and that horse comes back sir just as fast as he can trot sir and he has the meat there all wrapped up and just has the basket in his teeth this way Why Horace Clifford cried Grace in surprise why what a story Of course it s a story You wanted me to tell a story didn t you I was just a blowin Well there tell something nice can t you please I ve told all the story I m a goin to said Horace firmly Now it s Susy s turn You talk about something else a while replied Susy and let me be a thinkin I ll tell one cried Prudy let me now Once there was goin to be three balls and Cindrilla didn t have no mother and her father didn t have no wife so he married him one And there was goin to be three great big balls and Cindrilla asked her mother if she couldn t go and her mother said No indeed she hadn t nothin to wear And then they started off and her grandma came O I forgot the woman was wicked and she made her little girls sit in the parlor all dressed up spandy clean and she made Cindrilla sit in the coal hod And then she told her to get a great punkin and it turned into a gold hack and she went off into the back shed and got the rat trap and it turned into two footmens and the king s son O no And then there was some bugs round there and they was six horses and she got in and rode on to the ball and her shoes come off and then the king married her and she had the other shoe in her pocket and he married her right off and they re all safe now All safe said aunt Madge laughing what do you mean by that O now she ll have a good father and a good mother and won t sit in the coal hod no more Now it s your turn Susy O dear suz I was going to tell a story a fairy story It was going to be a real good one about The Bravest of Lion s Castle and I couldn t think of a thing to say and now Prudy has drove it all out of my head Well children said aunt Madge suppose we give Susy a little more time and excuse her for to night It s time for pleasant dreams now and kisses all round CHAPTER XI

6733-97084-0009	train-other-500	They had such a pleasant walk through the streets of the beautiful village in the sunshine calm and sweet Grace thought the trees met overhead just as if they were clasping hands and playing a game of King s Cruise for every body to march through
6733-97084-0010	train-other-500	When they had almost reached aunt Martha s house aunt Louise stopped them saying Now tell me if you are going to be good children so I shan t be ashamed of you Why yes auntie said Grace looking quite grieved and surprised O auntie said Susy

6733-97084-0014	train-other-500	I m sure I hope you ll do the very best you can sighed aunt Louise and not make any body crazy By this time they had gone up the nice gravel walk and aunt Martha had come to the door opening her arms as if she wanted to embrace them all at once
6733-97084-0015	train-other-500	Dear little souls said she come right into the house and let me take off your things
none	none	 I ve been looking for you these two hours 
6733-97084-0016	train-other-500	This is my little nephew Lonnie Adams Shake hands with the little girls my dear Lonnie was a fair haired sickly little boy seven years old The children very soon felt at ease with him
6733-97084-0017	train-other-500	It was so pleasant in aunt Martha s shaded parlor and the children took such delight in looking at the books and pictures that they were all sorry when aunt Louise got nervous and thought it was time they went off somewhere to play Very well said dear aunt Martha
6733-97084-0018	train-other-500	they may go all over the house and grounds if they like with Lonnie So all over the house and grounds they went in a very few minutes and at last came to a stand still in Bridget s chamber over the kitchen
6733-97084-0019	train-other-500	tired enough to sit down a while all but Prudy who didn t have any kind of tiredness about her Look here Prudy Parlin said Grace you mustn t open that drawer Who owns it said Prudy putting in both hands

6733-97084-0023	train-other-500	It s yours going gone for a ninepence Knocked off to Miss Parlin
none	none	 Somehow in knocking it off out came the stopper and over went the ink on Susy s fair white apron 
6733-97084-0024	train-other-500	Lonnie was dreadfully frightened
none	none	 Don t tell that I did it cried he You know I didn t mean any harm Won t you promise not to tell Yes I will said Susy but she ought not to have promised any such thing 
6733-97084-0025	train-other-500	O dear O dear What is to be done
none	none	 Little black streams were trickling down the apron on to the dress Grace pulled Susy to the washing stand and Prudy thought she meant to lift her into it and tried to help 
6733-97084-0026	train-other-500	I guess this honey soap will take it out said Susy
none	none	 but with all their washing and rinsing they could not make black white any more than the poor negro 
6733-97084-0027	train-other-500	who scoured his face Stop a minute cried Grace Soap makes it worse ma puts on milk O dear I wish we had some said Susy how can we get it
6733-97084-0028	train-other-500	I ll tell you what we ll do said Grace we ll send Prudy down stairs to Bridget to ask for some milk to drink I like milk and water the best said Prudy with sugar in
none	none	 Well get that said Grace it s just as good and come right back with it and don t tell about the ink Aunt Martha and Bridget were taking up the dinner when Prudy went down into the kitchen 
6733-97084-0029	train-other-500	calling out O Bridget may I have some white tea White tay said Bridget and what may that be now O some white tea in a cup you know with sugar They let me have it every little once in a while
6733-97084-0030	train-other-500	Milk and water I suppose said aunt Martha Can t you wait till dinner my dear But the girls can t wait replied Prudy they want it now O it s for the girls is it
6733-97084-0031	train-other-500	Yes but when they ve washed the apron I can drink the rest with white sugar in The apron said aunt Martha what apron

6733-97084-0032	train-other-500	Ink spilled cried aunt Martha and she stopped beating the turnip
none	none	 O I ain t goin to tell cried Prudy beginning to tremble I didn t did I they won t low me to tell Aunt Louise passing through the kitchen caught some of the last words and rushed up stairs two steps at a time O Susy Parlin you naughty naughty child 
6733-97084-0033	train-other-500	what have you been into Who spilled that ink It got tipped over answered Susy in a fright but not forgetting her promise
6733-97084-0034	train-other-500	Of course it got tipped over but not without hands you careless girl Do you get your shaker and march home as quick as ever you can I must go with you I suppose
none	none	 Lonnie ought to have come forward now like a little gentleman and told the whole story 
6733-97084-0035	train-other-500	but he had run away O auntie said Grace she wasn t to blame It Don t say a word said aunt Louise briskly If she was my little girl I d have her sent to bed That dress and apron ought to be soaking this very minute
6733-97084-0036	train-other-500	Bridget listened at the foot of the stairs in a very angry mood muttering It s not much like the child s mother she is A mother can pass it by when the childers does such capers and wait till they get more sinse Poor little Susy had to go home
6733-97084-0037	train-other-500	in the noonday sun hanging down her head like a guilty child and crying all the way Some of the tears were for her soiled clothes
none	none	 some for her auntie s sharp words 
6733-97084-0038	train-other-500	and some for the nice dinner she had left O aunt Madge sobbed she when they had got home I kept as far behind aunt Louise as I could so nobody would think I was her little girl She was ashamed of me I looked so
6733-97084-0039	train-other-500	There there try not to cry
none	none	 said aunt Madge as she took off Susy s soiled clothes But I can t stop crying I feel so bad If there s any body gets into a fuss it s always me I m all the time making some kind of trouble 
6733-97084-0040	train-other-500	Sometimes I wish there wasn t any such girl as me Tears came into aunt Madge s kind gray eyes and she made up her mind that the poor child should be comforted So she quietly put away the silk dress she was so anxious to finish and after dinner took the fresh tidy
6733-97084-0041	train-other-500	happy little Susy across the fields to aunt Martha s again where the unlucky day was finished very happily after all The truth is Louise said aunt Madge that night after their return
none	none	 Lonnie spilled that ink and Susy was not at all to blame You scolded her without mercy for being careless and she bore it all because she would not break her promise to that cowardly boy 
6733-97084-0042	train-other-500	O how unjust I have been said aunt Louise who did not mean to be unkind in spite of her hasty way of speaking
none	none	 You have been unjust said aunt Madge 
6733-97084-0043	train-other-500	Only think what a trifling thing it is for a little child to soil her dress and what a great thing to have her keep her word
none	none	 Susy has a tender heart and it grieves her to be unjustly scolded but she would bear it all rather than tell a falsehood For my part I am proud of such a noble truthful little niece CHAPTER XII PRUDY TRYING TO HELP Prudy awoke one morning full of mischief At the second table she split her johnny cake and spread it open saying it was a singing book and began to sing out of it Little drops of water Little grains of sand Grandma heard her from the next room and came in very much surprised What shall I do with such a little girl as this said she shaking her finger at Prudy I think answered the child you ought to call me to you and say You been a singin to the table Prudy Then I ll say Yes m and you ll say Prudy go right out in the kitchen and don t let me see you till you come back pleasant Grandma put her head out of the window a moment for she didn t want any body to see her smile This is one of Prudy s days thought she I m really afraid I shall have to punish her before it s over Very soon after breakfast the doorbell rang and a little boy left a note directed to Miss Grace Clifford It said Miss Grace Clifford the Misses Parlin and mister Horace Clifford are respectfully invited to a gypsy supper in the Pines The children hardly knew what it meant What is jispies asked Prudy a little frightened Be they up in the Pines It means a picnic that s all said aunt Madge and a very nice time you will have A picnic screamed all the voices in chorus It was almost too good to believe Grace clapped her hands and laughed Susy ran about the room like a crazy thing Prudy hopped up and down and Horace tried to stand on his head Now scamper every one of you said aunt Madge for I must go right to cooking Let s see you shall have some cunning little sandwiches some hard boiled eggs and what else can you think of Louise Stop a minute said aunt Louise drawing on a long face I hope Susy and Prudy Tarts and plum cake cried Susy and Grace Oranges dates and figs said Horace And them little cookies you cut out of a thimble you know added Prudy anxious to put in a word Hear me speak said aunt Louise I hope Susy and Prudy don t think they are going to this picnic for the truth is they haven t been invited Not invited gasped Susy The note says the Misses Parlin said aunt Louise gravely That might mean your grandmother but it doesn t I take it to mean the young ladies Madge or Mig and Louise your beautiful aunties who are often called the Misses Parlin Of course it can t mean two little slips of girls in short dresses Susy burst into tears and tried to talk at the same time but nobody could understand her O O moaned Prudy burying her face in the roller towel if I can t go I shall just lay down my head and cry It s not true children not one word she s only joking said aunt Madge laughing and shaking the egg beater at her sister I m really ashamed of your aunt Louise for trying to tease you What do you suppose any body wants of old grown up folks at your nice little party There there don t laugh quite so loud Run away and stay away if you want me ever to do any thing In a few moments the children were playing out of doors in high spirits and Prudy had told the workmen in her pretty lisping way that every one of we children were invited to a jispy supper had a ticket come a purpose so of course we should have to go The children were too much excited to do their morning work properly Grandma could not tell by the looks of the piazza whether Susy had swept it or not and had to go and ask She s swept it off said Prudy speaking for her but she didn t sweep it way off I should judge not said grandma and here is Prudy with her bib on yet and Grace hasn t made her bed Do you think such children ought to go to a party O grandma cried Prudy you know we had a ticket come a purpose I m ashamed said Grace promptly Susy you and I are too big to act so Let s go and do up our work right nice and then see if we can t help grandma And off went the two little girls with beaming faces trying to make themselves useful What shall I do thought Prudy for every body was at work even Horace who was turning the grindstone for the men I ll dust the parlors that s what I ll do It does take aunt Madge so long So with the big feather duster Prudy made a great stir among the books and ornaments and at last knocked over a little pitcher and broke its nose You little meddlesome thing cried aunt Louise as soon as she knew it this is one of your days I should think I didn t mean to cried the child I was trying to help Don t say you didn t mean to you hadn t any business to touch the duster I shall have to snip your fingers I do believe Don t begged the child I ll snip my hands you needn t I ll snip my hands and get the naughty out They ought to be snipped from now till next Christmas said aunt Louise laughing in spite of herself to see the little one set to work with thumb and finger trying to do her own punishing There there go off and be a good girl Prudy s bright spirits rose again at these words and she thought she would keep on trying to make herself useful It was aunt Madge she wanted to help good aunt Madge who was so busy cooking for the gypsy supper Illustration PRUDY DUSTING I ll feed her bird thought the child he sings as if he was hungry Now aunt Madge had fed little Daffy before sunrise and he was as yellow and happy as a canary can be But silly little Prudy trotted off after a piece of sponge cake climbed into a chair opened the cage door and swung the cake before his eyes Of course Daffy flew out and one might suppose that was the last of him but it so happened that the windows were not up Prudy ran in great fright to tell aunt Madge and when she opened the door the cat got in and such a time as there was you may imagine Kitty rushed for the canary aunt Louise rushed for the kitty and aunt Madge for the bird At last Daffy was caught and safe in his little home with only the loss of a few tiny feathers I d give that child one sound whipping said aunt Louise Let Madge attend to her replied grandma she will do right for she knows how to keep her temper Louise said nothing but she felt the rebuke and as she left the room there was a bright color in her cheeks Prudy said aunt Madge gently you didn t mean to open the cage door did you Prudy remembered that she had been scolded before for saying I didn t mean to Yes m I did replied she in a choked voice I meant to do it a purpose I m really astonished cried aunt Madge raising both hands Then it s surely my duty to punish you You may sobbed Prudy You may shut me up and not let me have no dinner cause I ain t hungry I ve been eatin cake I think said aunt Madge it would be a better punishment to keep you home from the party O cried Prudy eagerly wouldn t you rather snip my hands You can snip em with a piece o whalebone you know and switch me all over with a switch and do every thing to me if you ll only let me go to the party I m afraid you ll forget unless you re kept at home Prudy O no no I ll promise truly I won t try to help again never never in my world Were you trying to help when you let out the bird Yes m I was He was singin for somethin to eat O I begin to understand said aunt Madge laughing heartily So you didn t mean to be a naughty girl after all I am very glad of that Prudy for I couldn t tell what to make of you But you must never touch the cage again Little girls that want to help must ask somebody to tell them what to do There now kiss me dear and I ll forgive you and we won t say any more about your being naughty if you ll only remember next time Prudy laughed and twinkled off the tears She was what aunt Madge called a bird child and was never unhappy but a little while at a time CHAPTER XIII THE GYPSY SUPPER After a great great while it was afternoon and the children went up to the Pines carrying a small market basket half full of nice things I don t know which felt most at home in those woods the birds or the children It wasn t at all like having a party in a parlor where there are chairs and rugs in the way and where you can t run and jump without being afraid of hurting something No there wasn t any danger of scratching the varnish off the trees nor any danger of soiling the soft carpet of the earth And if there hadn t been a party it was enough to make any body happy only to breathe the sweet air and look away down at the white village and away off at the blue hills doctor Gray s daughter Ruth a girl of fourteen was to have the care of Prudy and at first she followed the child about like her shadow You dear little pet said she don t walk so fast There now my sweet dovey let me take your hand Prudy looked down at her copper toed shoes with something like a pout and slowly gave her hand to the young girl Now you re a little pink of a dear said Ruth Let s see added she feeling anxious to say something for she thought Prudy would want to be amused do you love your aunt Madge any I think she s very good and nice Yes m said Prudy I ve kissed her so much that I love her a good deal Well I declare laughed Ruth that s a new way of learning to love any body I guess people call you a funny little monkey don t they No m they don t replied Prudy drawing away a little they think I m as cunning as I can be O my I know a little girl that thinks pretty well of herself Ah here comes Dedy Roberts does my little love know Dedy Yes m I went to see her once she lives in a dreadful ragged house Well you two little lammies can sit right down here and pick flowers and if you find a strawberry I ll give you a cent As if we was babies thought the little girls for they were wise enough to know that strawberries were gone long ago I don t like her said Prudy to Dedy when Ruth had turned away she calls me names all the whole time I guess she don t know my name is Prudy I wouldn t let her said Dedy What did she call you O monkeys and lammies and pinkies and things Don t you s pose she s most an April fool After watching Prudy to the child s vexation for about two hours Ruth forgot all about her and it so happened that the little thing strayed off with Horace and his friend Gilbert whom he called Grasshopper to a little clearing in the wood It is a sad fact that Grasshopper had a bunch of matches in his pocket and the boys meant to build a fire Horace gathered the dry sticks and crossed them so all Grasshopper had to do was to strike a match and the fire was soon crackling briskly How it pops said Prudy just like corn I reckon this is popple wood said Horace and they call it so because it pops in the fire Prudy did not doubt it She never doubted any thing Horace said She stood looking on with dumb surprise as he took out of the inside pocket of his raglan three small fishes Now said he if we can cook these for our supper won t we go a flyin Be they minnies asked Prudy O I know it s mack fishes She means mackerel you see said Horace with a wise look at Grasshopper No Prudy these are chubbs nice chubbs too I caught em myself How to cook a fish Horace had no idea but he was not a boy to give up at trifles If I put em into the fire they ll burn up said he but if I hold em over the fire they ll cook now won t they Your hand will cook too I guess said lazy Grasshopper sitting down and looking on Horace said no more but went quietly to work and whittled some long splinters on which he stuck the fish and set them to roasting True they got badly scorched and dreadfully smoked but that was not all that happened A spark flying out caught Prudy s gingham dress and set it in flames in a second Whether the boys would have known what to do I can t say but just then Sam Walker a good natured colored man came up and put out the flames before Prudy fairly knew there were any Then he brought water from a spring and drowned the bonfire and gave the boys a piece of his mind All the while poor Prudy was running off into the thickest part of the wood crying bitterly Sam ran after her and caught her up as if she had been a stray lamb and though she struggled hard he carried her to the picnic ground where the large girls were just spreading the table for supper You d better look out for these here young ones said Sam This one would have been roasted sure if I hadn t a happened along in the nick of time Ruth Gray dropped the paper of candy she was untying and turned very pale She had been too busy playing games to remember that she had the care of any body O you little ducky darling cried she seizing Prudy in her arms don t you cry and you shall have a pocket full of candy You didn t get burnt a mite did you honey No m I ain t cryin sobbed Prudy I ain t crying any thing about that and every word seemed to be shaken out as if there was a little earthquake at her heart there is black folks O he is just as black Is that all said Grace stroking Prudy s hair Didn t she ever see any negroes any nice black negro men before Susy I thought she had why we have em in the streets at Portland lots and lots of em After much soothing and a good deal of candy Prudy was comforted and the supper went off famously The children were all polite and well behaved even the boys as Ruth said and though they all had keen appetites nobody was greedy By and by when it would not do to stay any longer they all started for home happy and tired Ruth held Prudy s little hand in a firm grasp and wished she had held it so all the afternoon for as she said to herself she s a very slippery child This had been a trying day for Prudy and when aunt Madge put her to bed her sweet blue eyes wouldn t stay shut Where do they grow auntie said she them black folks Be they the jispies O they grow any where replied aunt Madge laughing just like any body They are not gypsies but negroes I should think they d wash their faces O they do but our Heavenly Father made them black Did he cried Prudy raising her head from the pillow And did he know how they was goin to look when he made em That man that catched me up why how he must feel He was very kind said aunt Madge trembling as she thought of the child s danger O Prudy did you thank him No I didn t replied Prudy I didn t know as he could hear any thing O mayn t I go up to the jispy Pines to morrow and thank him We ll see but now it s time you went to sleep Well I will said Prudy I ll go in a minute but auntie he s good ain t he He ain t black all through He s quite a good man answered aunt Madge trying not to smile and has had a great deal of trouble I can t stop to tell you and you wouldn t understand but I dare say he has cried ever so much Prudy and felt worse than you can think all because he is black and some people don t like black men I should think they d be ashamed cried the child Why I love him cause he can t wash it off Mayn t I put him in my prayer Then Prudy had to get out of bed and kneel down and say her prayer over again It followed the Lord s Prayer and was in her own words O God please bless every body Bless all the big children and the little children and the little mites o babies And bless all the men and ladies that live in the whole o the houses And now she added And won t you please to bless that black man that catched me up and bless all the black folks forever amen CHAPTER XIV THE ANGEL BABY The beautiful summer was passing away very fast Only a few days more till autumn A little longer and the cousins must separate so for the time that was left they clung all the more closely together I have called it a beautiful summer so it was but there is one sorrowful thing I have not said much about There was one trouble which always made the children feel sad when they stopped to think of it While they were playing in the hay field or taking supper up in the trees now and then they would hear the tired cry of the darling sick baby Then Grace would clasp her hands together in her quick way and say O dear dear I wish the doctor would get Harry well Poh said Horace the doctors they have East ain t no count are they though Gracie Of course they don t know so much as doctor De Bruler replied Grace very decidedly I ll tell you how they make doctors spoke up little Prudy they take a man and put him in a bear s buffalo coat and that makes a doctor And a gig said Horace and some sharp things and lots of little bottles What children said Grace looking down upon them with a lofty smile Why Prudy what have you got in your pocket O I don t know said Prudy throwing her hands behind her Goodness won t hurt me will it Susy I guess you ain t good enough to hurt Well grandma says not to eat green apples said the child but she d be willing I could chew em and get the good all out don t you s pose she would I don t know I m sure replied Susy you must ask Well I never teased for any Horace gave em to me and I shan t swallow em O what a little snipe cried Grace laughing your pocket is stuffed so full it s going to burst open and you ll be sick again now you see Sick repeated Prudy looking frightened for she did not forget her severe illness then I ll throw em away I don t love such sour things anyhow I was only hung buggin And Prudy went down the wooden stairs which led from the trees and walked slowly towards the house dropping the green apples one by one into the grass At the kitchen door she met her aunt Madge who was in tears O auntie said she I m going to wash my hands spandy clean and then are you willing there is any thing I can have to eat Cookies if you like my dear O auntie cried Prudy eager with a new thought won t you tell me where them raisins is the ones you didn t put in the pudding Tell me O do do If you will I won t touch em true as the world Then why do you want to know where they are said aunt Madge a faint smile flitting across her face and then dying out again O cause said Prudy then I can tell Susy and she can get em You can each of you have a handful said aunt Madge reaching down the box You may have some for I know you wouldn t take them without leave and Susy wouldn t either you funny child Now said she putting the raisins in Prudy s apron I want you to go out of doors and keep very still Why do you cry so my dearest auntie in the world said Prudy climbing into a chair and throwing her arms around her auntie s neck while the raisins dropped to the floor is mister Gustus Allen dead No said aunt Madge hugging little Prudy as if she was good for the heartache the baby is a great deal worse darling Tell the children I will send them some dinner up in the trees and don t let Horace come into the house You know he means to keep still but his boots make so much noise Prudy gathered up the raisins and went out quietly her happy little face looking very sober But the bird child could not be sad long at a time and she had hardly climbed the steps into the trees and given away the clusters of raisins before the sick baby was almost forgotten There said Horace suddenly I must go right into the house and see Harry I haven t seen him to day O no no cried Prudy holding him back and speaking very fast he s a great deal wusser and auntie said your boots was so big she d send the dinner out here and then she cried like every thing O said Grace I m so afraid the baby won t get well Aunt Madge didn t say any thing about dying about Harry s dying did she Prudy No replied Prudy stopping a moment to think she said he was wusser a great deal wusser darling And then she talked about Horace s boots and that s all The darling little baby He used to love me before he got so sick and all the way coming East I held him ever so much you know Horace Well he liked me too said Horace looking very sober and I ve played with him the most and let him spoil lots of my things So you have said Grace I heard ma say the other day you d always been good to little brother O Susy you ought to have seen how Harry used to jump when he d hear Horace open the door he always expected a frolic Didn t we have times cried Horace dropping his eyes which were full of tears O Susy said Grace do you suppose any one that s sick all summer ever gets well I don t know sighed Susy mother says if God is willing they ll get well and if he isn t they ll die God knows what is best Yes chimed in little Prudy God knows a great deal more n I do And so the children chatted and played quietly all day long sometimes breaking off in the midst of a game to talk about the baby It seemed like a very strange day The sky looked so calm and peaceful that you could almost fancy it was keeping still to listen to something a great way off The quiet trees might have been dreaming of heaven Susy thought Horace begged her now to tell that fairy story about The Bravest of Lion s Castle but Susy said it made her feel wicked to think of fairy stories that day though she couldn t tell why When the children went into the house at supper time it was very still Nobody was to be seen but aunt Madge who gave them some bowls of bread and milk and said the family had taken tea A kind of awe crept over Grace as she looked at the tearful face of her auntie and she dared not ask about the baby After they had finished their supper aunt Madge said You may all follow me into the nursery I have something to tell you Our dear little pale baby who has been sick day and night all this long summer will never feel sick or cry any more God has taken him to heaven to be a little angel All but Prudy knew that she spoke of death Grace flung herself on the floor and wept aloud Horace rushed up stairs into the back chamber without saying a word to any body and Susy buried her face in the sofa pillows whispering O God don t let it be so it isn t true is it But Prudy only opened her blue eyes in wonder When she saw the pure little form of the baby lying on the bed in a soft crimson dress she smiled and said O he looks as if he was asleep and he is asleep But see he doesn t breathe whispered Susy No said Prudy he don t breathe because he don t want to He was sick and it made him too tired to breathe so much Why every body should weep was more than Prudy could tell but she thought it must be right to do as the rest did and by bedtime she was sobbing as if her heart would break She afterwards said to Susy I tried as hard as I could to cry and when I got to crying I cried as tight as I could spring But when aunt Madge wanted to put Prudy to bed she was unwilling to go O no said she I want to wait and see the baby go up See what said aunt Madge See God take the baby up to heaven sobbed the child But he is in heaven now replied aunt Madge O no he hasn t gone a single step I saw him on the bed They haven t put his wings on yet Aunt Madge was puzzled and hardly knew what to say for it is not easy to make such very little children know the difference between the body which goes back to dust and the spirit which goes to God who gave it She talked a long while but I doubt if Prudy understood one word for when the casket which held the form of little Harry was buried in the garden she cried because the earth was heaped over it What makes em do it she asked he can t get to heaven through all that dirt But by and by when days passed and there was no longer a baby in the house Prudy began to think of him as one of the angels And one morning she told a beautiful dream which she thought she had had though she sometimes called her thoughts dreams O said she I dreamed about my angel He had stars all round his head and he flowed in the air like a bird There was ever so many little angels with him and some of em sang They didn t sing sorry they was singing The Little Boy that died And aunt Ria I guess you wouldn t cry if you could see how happy they were No no sobbed poor aunt Ria holding Prudy close in her arms which she said felt so empty now it can t be right to cry can it Prudy when I know my baby is so happy in heaven CHAPTER XV GOING HOME It was now autumn The trees couldn t keep green any longer for their time had come so they just made the best of it like sad faces laughing through tears and glowed and flushed in a perfect blaze of glory making believe they were having splendid times all by themselves and didn t care for what was coming The Parlin children had stayed a great deal longer than their parents at first meant they should stay and now they must really go back to Portland The little cousins were sorry to part for you know they had learned to love one another dearly Grace and Susy clung together till the last moment O Susy sobbed Grace don t you forget these good times Remember to write no matter how it looks I wish I hadn t got to go way off out West I never did have such times in any place as we ve had here at grandma s Nor I either said Susy looking sorrowfully at the barn the seat in the trees and the clover patch Remember you re coming back in just two years Won t it be splendid O dear but two years is most forever added Susy suddenly breaking down Good by Prudy said Horace climbing into the stage coach quite out of breath He had run all the way to the post office just for the sake of seeing her again Good by Prudy You re the cunningest little spud If you lived out West I d just go a flyin Nobody knew whether Horace cried or not for nobody saw him till dinner time but then he looked very sober indeed He and Grasshopper had been building a fort he said and after he had told so much he seemed not to care about talking He felt captain of a little company and such a brave soldier that he would not even say he felt sorry Prudy was gone Grace talked a great deal about Susy and asked her mamma if she might not invite her to go out West some time missus Clifford said she should be very glad indeed to have a visit from both the children and who knew but it might happen so for mister Parlin Susy s father often took journeys out West on business This idea struck Grace very pleasantly and she had a strong hope of the visit in a minute In two minutes she had a firm belief in it and the last we see of Grace and Horace in this book they are sitting on the piazza eagerly talking about the next winter when they shall both go to the cars to meet uncle Edward and the children They ll be there my birthday what ll you bet said Horace I shall wear my tippet when we go to the depot and have a new hood said Grace I don t know what my dress will be though I ll make a bow arrow and a gun and a steamboat for Prudy And I ll give Susy my large doll and make a blue dress for it with flowing sleeves She shall put all her things into my cabinet What ll we have to eat Pecans and simmons and raisins and figs O we shall have plenty to eat Horace we always do We ll give em canned peaches with cream Susy likes cream as well as a cat I d like to see Prudy eat a simmon a green one I mean cried Horace laughing aloud Seems like I can see her mouth puckering up now Susy and Prudy all this while were riding home in the cars under the care of the conductor O sighed Susy I wish we were going backwards just the other way Grandma is going to let Grace boil some candy to night and put oilnuts in it I guess they ll want me to help em pull it said Prudy There now we ve got to Brunswick murmured Susy I don t like to get so far away from the folks at grandma s Don t it seem real lonesome No indeed replied Prudy I m glad we re goin home to see mother and the rest of em What do you s pose the baby ll say But their speech was cut short by some large pieces of sponge cake which the smiling conductor brought to them wrapped in a newspaper Susy and Prudy reached home safely and there is nothing more to be said about them at present I think I will copy the letter which Prudy wrote to her dear friend mister Allen or which she got aunt Madge to write the next time she went to Portland CHRISTMAS DAY DEAR mister GUSTUS ALLEN When you went off to the wars aunt Madge cried some for I saw her wiping her eyes You asked me if I loved you for the candy but I didn t I loved you for the nuts and oranges I think you was real good to write me a letter I had just as lief kiss you as

She asked me if I forgot to wish it but I didn t Good by From PRUDY PARLIN SOPHIE MAY S LITTLE FOLKS BOOKS DOTTY DIMPLE AT HER GRANDMOTHER S Sophie May s excellent pen has perhaps never written

that she thought there d be nobody left in any of the houses she offers to hold somebody s baby and when it begins to cry she stuffs pop corn into its mouth nearly choking it to death Afterwards in pulling a man s hair she is horrified at seeing his wig come off and gasps out Oh dear dear dear I didn t know your hair was so tender Altogether she is the cunningest chick that ever lived Oxford Press DOTTY DIMPLE AT HOME This little book is as full of spice as any of its predecessors and well sustains the author s reputation as the very cleverest of all writers of this species of children s books Were there any doubt on this point the matter might be easily tested by inquiry in half the households in the city where the book is being revelled over Boston Home Journal DOTTY DIMPLE AT SCHOOL Miss Dotty is a peremptory little body with a great deal of human nature in her who wins our hearts by her comic speeches and funny ways She complains of being bewitched by people and the wind

and is presented with a baby sister come down from heaven with lots of smart and funny sayings Boston Traveller LITTLE GRANDMOTHER Grandmother Parlen when a little girl is the subject Of course that was ever so long ago when there were no lucifer matches and steel and tinder were used to light fires when soda and saleratus had never been heard of but people made their pearl ash by soaking burnt crackers in water when the dressmaker and the tailor and the shoemaker went from house to house twice a year to make the dresses and coats of the family Transcript LITTLE GRANDFATHER The story of Grandfather Parlen s little boy life of the days of knee breeches and cocked hats full of odd incidents queer and quaint sayings and the customs of ye olden time These stories of Sophie May s are so

Patchwork FLAXIE FRIZZLE Flaxie Frizzle is the successor of Dotty Dimple Little Prudy Flyaway and the other charming child creations of that inimitable writer for children Sophie May There never was a healthy fun loving child born into this world that at one stage or another of its growth wouldn t be entertained with Sophie May s books For that matter it is not safe for older folks to look into them unless they intend to read them through Flaxie Frizzle will be found as bright and pleasant reading as the others Boston Journal FLAXIE S DOCTOR PAPA Sophie May understands children Her books are not books about them merely She seems to know precisely how they feel and she sets them before us living and breathing in her pages Flaxie Frizzle is a darling and her sisters brothers and cousins are just the sort of little folks with whom careful mothers would like their boys and girls to associate The story is a bright breezy wholesome narrative and it is full of mirth and gayety while its moral teaching is excellent Sunday School Times FLAXIE S LITTLE PITCHERS Little Flaxie will secure a warm place in the hearts of all at once Here is her little picture Her name was Mary Gray but they called her Flaxie Frizzle because she had light curly hair that frizzled and she had a curly nose that is her nose curled up at the end a wee bit just enough to make it look cunning Her cheeks were rosy red and she was so fat that when mister Snow the postmaster saw her he said How d ye do Mother Bunch Boston Home Journal FLAXIE S TWIN COUSINS Another of those sweet natural child stories in which the heroine does and says just such things as actual live flesh children do is the one before us And what is still better each incident points a moral The illustrations are a great addition to the delight of the youthful reader It is just such beautiful books as this which bring to our minds in severe contrast the youth s literature of our early days the good little boy who died young and the bad little boy who went fishing on Sunday and died in prison et cetera to the end of the threadbare improbable chapter Rural New Yorker FLAXIE S KITTYLEEN Kittyleen one of the Flaxie Frizzle series is a genuinely helpful as well as delightfully entertaining story The nine year old Flaxie is worried beloved and disciplined by a bewitching three year old tormenter whose accomplished mother allows her to prey upon the neighbors Everybody felt the care of missus Garland s children There were six of them and their mother was always painting china She did it beautifully with graceful vines trailing over it and golden butterflies ready to alight on sprays of lovely flowers Sometimes the neighbors thought it would be a fine thing if she would keep her little ones at home rather more but if she had done that she could not have painted china Chicago Tribune FLAXIE GROWING UP No more charming stories for the little ones were ever written than those comprised in the three series which have for several years past been from time to time added to juvenile literature by Sophie May They have received the unqualified praise of many of the most practical scholars of New England for their charming simplicity and purity of sentiment The delightful story shows the gradual improvement of dear little Flaxie s character under the various disciplines of child life and the sweet influence of a good and happy home The illustrations are charming pictures Home Journal PENN SHIRLEY S BOOKS PENN SHIRLEY S STORIES FOR THE LITTLE ONES Miss Penn Shirley is a very graceful interpreter of child life She thoroughly understands how to reach out to the tender chord of the little one s feelings and to interest her in the noble life of her young companions Her stories are full of bright lessons but they do not take on the character of moralizing sermons Her keen observation and ready sympathy teach her how to deal with the little ones in helping them to understand the lessons of life Her stories are simple and unaffected Boston Herald THE LITTLE MISS WEEZY SERIES Three volumes Illustrated Boxed each seventy five cents LITTLE MISS WEEZY One of the freshest and most delightful because the most natural of the stories of the year for children is Little Miss Weezy by Penn Shirley It relates the oddities the mischief the adventures and the misadventures of a tiny two year old maiden full of life and spirit and capable of the most unexpected freaks and pranks The book is full of humor and is written with a delicate sympathy with the feelings of children which will make it pleasing to children and parents alike Really good child literature is not over plenty despite the multitude of books that come daily from the press and it is pleasing to welcome a new author whose first volume like this one of Penn Shirley adds promise of future good work to actual present merit Boston Courier LITTLE MISS WEEZY S BROTHER This is a good story for young children bringing in the same characters as Little Miss Weezy of last year and continuing the history of a very natural and wide awake family of children The doings and the various scrapes of Kirke the brother form a prominent feature of the book and are such as we may see any day in the school or home life of a well cared for and good intentioned little boy There are several quite pleasing full page illustrations The Dial We should like to see the person who thinks it easy enough to write for children attempt a book like the Miss Weezy stories Excepting Sophie May s childish classics we don t know of anything published as bright as the sayings and doings of the little Louise and her friends Their pranks and capers are no more like Dotty Dimple s than those of one bright child are like another s but they are just as cute as those of the little folks that play in your yard or around your neighbor s doorsteps Journal of Education LITTLE MISS WEEZY S SISTER It is one of the best of the series and will please every child who reads it It is brought out just at the holiday time and is brimful of good things Every character in it is true to nature and the doings of a bright lot of children in which Miss Mary Rowe

outdated equipment Many small donations one dollar to five thousand dollars are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all fifty states of the United States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance
