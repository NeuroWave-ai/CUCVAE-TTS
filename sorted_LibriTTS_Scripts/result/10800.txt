Moynihan and Distributed Proofreaders Introduction to the Project Gutenberg Edition This edition of The Anatomy of Melancholy is based on a nineteenth century edition that modernized Burton s spelling and typographic conventions In preparing this electronic version it became evident that the editor had made a variety of mistakes in this modernization some words were left in their original spelling unusual words were a particular problem portions of book titles were mistaken for proper names proper names were mistaken for book titles or Latin words et cetera A certain number of misprints were also introduced into the Latin As a result I have re edited the text checking it against images of the sixteen thirty eight edition and correcting all errors not present in the earlier edition I have continued to follow the general editorial practice of the base text for quotation marks italics et cetera Rare words have been normalized according to their primary spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary When Burton spells a person s name in several ways I have normalized the names to the most common spelling or to modern practice if well known In a few cases mistakes present in both the sixteen thirty eight edition and the base text have been corrected These are always minor reference errors e g an incorrect or missing section number in the synopses or misnumbered footnotes Incorrect citations to other texts Burton seems to quote by memory and sometimes gets it wrong have not been changed if they are wrong in both editions To display some symbols astrological signs et cetera the

had an extraordinary fate At the time of its original publication it obtained a great celebrity which continued more than half a century During that period few books were more read or more deservedly applauded It was the delight of the learned the solace of the indolent and the refuge of the uninformed It passed through at least eight editions by which the bookseller as WOOD records got an estate and notwithstanding the objection sometimes opposed against it of a quaint style and too great an accumulation of authorities the fascination of its wit fancy and sterling sense have borne down all censures and extorted praise from the first Writers in the English language The grave JOHNSON has praised it in the warmest terms and the ludicrous STERNE has interwoven many parts of it into his own popular performance MILTON did not disdain to build two of his finest poems on it and a host of inferior writers have embellished their works with beauties not their own culled from a performance which they had not the justice even to mention Change of times and the frivolity of fashion suspended in some degree that fame which had lasted near a century and the succeeding generation affected indifference towards an author who at length was only looked into by the plunderers of literature the poachers in obscure volumes The plagiarisms of Tristram Shandy so successfully brought to light by doctor FERRIAR at length drew the attention of the public towards a writer who though then little known might without impeachment of modesty lay claim to every mark of respect and inquiry proved beyond a doubt that the calls of justice had been little attended to by others as well as the facetious YORICK WOOD observed more than a century ago that several authors had unmercifully stolen matter from BURTON without any acknowledgment The time however at length arrived when the merits of the Anatomy of Melancholy were to receive their due praise The book was again sought for and read and again it became an applauded performance Its excellencies once more stood confessed in the increased price which every copy offered for sale produced and the increased demand pointed out the necessity of a new edition This is now presented to the public in a manner not disgraceful to the memory of the author and the publisher relies with confidence that so valuable a repository of amusement and information will continue to hold the rank to which it has been restored firmly supported by its own merit and safe from the influence and blight of any future caprices of fashion To open its valuable mysteries to those who have not had the advantage of a classical education translations of the countless quotations from ancient writers which occur in the work are now for the first time given and obsolete orthography is in all instances modernized ACCOUNT OF THE AUTHOR Robert Burton was the son of Ralph Burton of an ancient and genteel family at Lindley in Leicestershire and was born there on the eighth of February fifteen seventy six one He received the first rudiments of learning at the free school of Sutton Coldfield in Warwickshire two from whence he was at the age of seventeen in the long vacation fifteen ninety three sent to Brazen Nose College in the condition of a commoner where he made considerable progress in logic and philosophy In fifteen ninety nine he was elected student of Christ Church and for form s sake was put under the tuition of doctor John Bancroft afterwards Bishop of Oxford In sixteen fourteen he was admitted to the reading of the Sentences and on the twenty ninth of November sixteen sixteen had the vicarage of saint Thomas in the west suburb of Oxford conferred on him by the dean and canons of Christ Church which with the rectory of Segrave in Leicestershire given to him in the year sixteen thirty six by George Lord Berkeley he kept to use the words of the Oxford antiquary with much ado to his dying day He seems to have been first beneficed at Walsby in Lincolnshire through the munificence of his noble patroness Frances Countess Dowager of Exeter but resigned the same as he tells us for some special reasons At his vicarage he is remarked to have always given the sacrament in wafers Wood s character of him is that he was an exact mathematician a curious calculator of nativities a general read scholar a thorough paced philologist and one that understood the surveying of lands well As he was by many accounted a severe student a devourer of authors a melancholy and humorous person so by others who knew him well a person of great honesty plain dealing and charity I have heard some of the ancients of Christ Church often say that his company was very merry facete and juvenile and no man in his time did surpass him for his ready and dexterous interlarding his common discourses among them with verses from the poets or sentences from classic authors which being then all the fashion in the University made his company the more acceptable He appears to have been a universal reader of all kinds of books and availed himself of his multifarious studies in a very extraordinary manner From the information of Hearne we learn that John Rouse the Bodleian librarian furnished him with choice books for the prosecution of his work The subject of his labour and amusement seems to have been adopted from the infirmities of his own habit and constitution mister Granger says He composed this book with a view of relieving his own melancholy but increased it to such a degree that nothing could make him laugh but going to the bridge foot and hearing the ribaldry of the bargemen which rarely failed to throw him into a violent fit of laughter Before he was overcome with this horrid disorder he in the intervals of his vapours was esteemed one of the most facetious companions in the University His residence was chiefly at Oxford where in his chamber in Christ Church College he departed this life at or very near the time which he had some years before foretold from the calculation of his own nativity and which says Wood being exact several of the students did not forbear to whisper among themselves that rather than there should be a mistake in the calculation he sent up his soul to heaven through a slip about his neck Whether this suggestion is founded in truth we have no other evidence than an obscure hint in the epitaph hereafter inserted which was written by the author himself a short time before his death His body with due solemnity was buried near that of doctor Robert Weston in the north aisle which joins next to the choir of the cathedral of Christ Church on the twenty seventh of January sixteen thirty nine forty Over his grave was soon after erected a comely monument on the upper pillar of the said aisle with his bust painted to the life On the right hand is the following calculation of his nativity Illustration R natus B fifteen seventy six eight Feb hor three scrup sixteen long twenty two deg

work our author executed was that now reprinted which probably was the principal employment of his life doctor Ferriar says it was originally published in the year sixteen seventeen but this is evidently a mistake five the first edition was that printed in fourto sixteen twenty one a copy of which is at present in the collection of John Nichols esquire the indefatigable illustrator of the History of Leicestershire to whom and to Isaac Reed esquire of Staple Inn this account is greatly indebted for its accuracy The other impressions of it were in sixteen twenty four sixteen twenty eight

reprinted is that of sixteen fifty one two at the conclusion of which is the following address TO THE READER Be pleased to know Courteous Reader that since the last Impression of this Book the ingenuous Author of it is deceased leaving a Copy of it exactly corrected with several considerable Additions by his own hand this Copy he committed to my care and custody with directions to have those Additions inserted in the next Edition which in order to his command and the Publicke Good is faithfully performed in this last Impression H C i e HEN CRIPPS The following testimonies of various authors will serve to show the estimation in which this work has been held The ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY wherein the author hath piled up variety of much excellent learning Scarce any book of philology in our land hath in so short a time passed so many editions Fuller s Worthies fol sixteen Tis a book so full of variety of reading that gentlemen who have lost their time and are put to a push for invention may furnish themselves with matter for common or scholastical discourse and writing Wood s Athenae Oxoniensis vol i p six hundred twenty eight twod edit If you never saw BURTON UPON MELANCHOLY printed sixteen seventy six I pray look into it and read the ninth page of his Preface Democritus to the Reader There is something there which touches the point we are upon but I mention the author to you as the pleasantest the most learned and the most full of sterling sense The wits of Queen Anne s reign and the beginning of George the First were not a little beholden to him Archbishop Herring s Letters twelvemo seventeen seventy seven p one hundred forty nine BURTON S ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY he doctor Johnson said was the only book that ever took him out of bed two hours sooner than he wished to rise Boswell s Life of Johnson vol i p five hundred eighty eightvo edit BURTON S ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY is a valuable book said doctor Johnson It is perhaps overloaded with quotation But there is great spirit and great power in what Burton says when he writes from his own mind Ibid vol ii p three hundred twenty five It will be no detraction from the powers of Milton s original genius and invention to remark that he seems to have borrowed the subject of L Allegro and Il Penseroso together with some particular thoughts expressions and rhymes more especially the idea of a contrast between these two dispositions from a forgotten poem prefixed to the first edition of BURTON S ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY entitled The Author s Abstract of Melancholy or A Dialogue between Pleasure and Pain Here pain is melancholy It was written as I conjecture about the year sixteen hundred I will make no apology for abstracting and citing as much of this poem as will be sufficient to prove to a discerning reader how far it had taken possession of Milton s mind The measure will appear to be the same and that our author was at least an attentive reader of Burton s book may be already concluded from the traces of resemblance which I have incidentally noticed in passing through the L Allegro and Il Penseroso After extracting the lines mister Warton adds as to the very elaborate work to which these visionary verses are no unsuitable introduction the writer s variety of learning his quotations from scarce and curious books his pedantry sparkling with rude wit and shapeless elegance miscellaneous matter intermixture of agreeable tales and illustrations and perhaps above all the singularities of his feelings clothed in an uncommon quaintness of style have contributed to render it even to modern readers a valuable repository of amusement and information Warton s Milton twod edit p ninety four THE ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY is a book which has been universally read and admired This work is for the most part what the author himself styles it a cento but it is a very ingenious one His quotations which abound in every page are pertinent but if he had made more use of his invention and less of his commonplace book his work would perhaps have been more valuable than it is He is generally free from the affected language and ridiculous metaphors which disgrace most of the books of his time Granger s Biographical History BURTON S ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY a book once the favourite of the learned and the witty and a source of surreptitious learning though written on a regular plan consists chiefly of quotations the author has honestly termed it a cento He collects under every division the opinions of a multitude of writers without regard to chronological order and has too often the modesty to decline the interposition of his own sentiments Indeed the bulk of his materials generally overwhelms him In the course of his folio he has contrived to treat a great variety of topics that seem very loosely connected with the general subject and like Bayle when he starts a favourite train of quotations he does not scruple to let the digression outrun the principal question Thus from the doctrines of religion to military discipline from inland navigation to the morality of dancing schools every thing is discussed and determined Ferriar s Illustrations of Sterne p fifty eight The archness which BURTON displays occasionally and his indulgence of playful digressions from the most serious discussions often give his style an air of familiar conversation notwithstanding the laborious collections which supply his text He was capable of writing excellent poetry but he seems to have cultivated this talent too little The English verses prefixed to his book which possess beautiful imagery and great sweetness of versification have been frequently published His Latin elegiac verses addressed to his book shew a very agreeable turn for raillery Ibid p fifty eight When the force of the subject opens his own vein of prose we discover valuable sense and brilliant expression Such is his account of the first feelings of melancholy persons written probably from his own experience See p one hundred fifty four of the present edition Ibid p sixty During a pedantic age like that in which BURTON S production appeared it must have been eminently serviceable to writers of many descriptions Hence the unlearned might furnish themselves with appropriate scraps of Greek and Latin whilst men of letters would find their enquiries shortened by knowing where they might look for what both ancients and moderns had advanced on the subject of human passions I confess my inability to point out any other English author who has so largely dealt in apt and original quotation Manuscript note of the late George Steevens esquire in his copy of THE ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY DEMOCRITUS JUNIOR AD LIBRUM SUUM Vade liber qualis non

my sole plague to be alone I am a beast a monster grown I will no light nor company I find it now my misery The scene is turn d my joys are gone Fear discontent and sorrows come All my griefs to this are jolly Naught so fierce as melancholy I ll not change life with any king I ravisht am can the world bring More joy than still to laugh and smile In pleasant toys time to beguile Do not O do not trouble me So sweet content I feel and see All my joys to this are folly None so divine as melancholy I ll change my state with any wretch Thou canst from gaol or dunghill fetch My pain s past cure another hell I may not in this torment dwell Now desperate I hate my life Lend me a halter or a knife All my griefs to this are jolly Naught so damn d as melancholy DEMOCRITUS JUNIOR TO THE READER Gentle reader I presume thou wilt be very inquisitive to know what antic or personate actor this is that so insolently intrudes upon this common theatre to the world s view arrogating another man s name whence he is why he doth it and what he hath to say although as seven he said Primum si noluero non respondebo quis coacturus est I am a free man born and may choose whether I will tell who can compel me If I be urged I will as readily reply as that Egyptian in eight Plutarch when a curious fellow would needs know what he had in his basket Quum vides velatam quid inquiris in rem absconditam It was therefore covered because he should not know what was in it Seek not after that which is hid if the contents please thee nine and be for thy use suppose the Man in the Moon or whom thou wilt to be the author I would not willingly be known Yet in some sort to give thee satisfaction which is more than I need I will show a reason both of this usurped name title and subject And first of the name of Democritus lest any man by reason of it should be deceived expecting a pasquil a satire some ridiculous treatise as I myself should have done some prodigious tenet or paradox of the earth s motion of infinite worlds in infinito vacuo ex fortuita atomorum collisione in an infinite waste so caused by an accidental collision of motes in the sun all which Democritus held Epicurus and their master Lucippus of old maintained and are lately revived by Copernicus Brunus and some others Besides it hath been always an ordinary custom as ten Gellius observes for later writers and impostors to broach many absurd and insolent fictions under the name of so noble a philosopher as Democritus to get themselves credit and by that means the more to be respected as artificers usually do Novo qui marmori ascribunt Praxatilem suo Tis not so with me eleven Non hic Centaurus non Gorgonas Harpyasque Invenies hominem pagina nostra sapit No Centaurs here or Gorgons look to find My subject is of man and human kind Thou thyself art the subject of my discourse twelve Quicquid agunt homines votum timor ira voluptas Gaudia discursus nostri farrago libelli Whate er men do vows fears in ire in sport Joys wand rings are the sum of my report My intent is no otherwise to use his name than Mercurius Gallobelgicus Mercurius Britannicus use the name of Mercury thirteen Democritus Christianus c although there be some other circumstances for which I have masked myself under this vizard and some peculiar respect which I cannot so well express until I have set down a brief character of this our Democritus what he was with an epitome of his life Democritus as he is described by fourteen Hippocrates and fifteen Laertius was a little wearish old man very melancholy by nature averse from company in his latter days sixteen and much given to solitariness a famous philosopher in his age seventeen coaevus with Socrates wholly addicted to his studies at the last and to a private life wrote many excellent works a great divine according to the divinity of those times an expert physician a politician an excellent mathematician as eighteen Diacosmus and the rest of his works do witness He was much delighted with the studies of husbandry saith nineteen Columella and often I find him cited by twenty Constantinus and others treating of that subject He knew the natures differences of all beasts plants fishes birds and as some say could twenty one understand the tunes and voices of them In a word he was omnifariam doctus a general scholar a great student and to the intent he might better contemplate twenty two I find it related by some that he put out his eyes and was in his old age voluntarily blind yet saw more than all Greece besides and twenty three writ of every subject Nihil in toto opificio naturae de quo non scripsit twenty four A man of an excellent wit profound conceit and to attain knowledge the better in his younger years he travelled to Egypt and twenty five Athens to confer with learned men twenty six admired of some despised of others After a wandering life he settled at Abdera a town in Thrace and was sent for thither to be their lawmaker recorder or town clerk as some will or as others he was there bred and born Howsoever it was there he lived at last in a garden in the suburbs wholly betaking himself to his studies and a private life twenty seven saving that sometimes he would walk down to the haven twenty eight and laugh heartily at such variety of ridiculous objects which there he saw Such a one was Democritus But in the mean time how doth this concern me or upon what reference do I usurp his habit I confess indeed that to compare myself unto him for aught I have yet said were both impudency and arrogancy I do not presume to make any parallel Antistat mihi millibus trecentis twenty nine parvus sum nullus sum altum nec spiro nec spero Yet thus much I will say of myself and that I hope without all suspicion of pride or self conceit I have lived a silent sedentary solitary private life mihi et musis in the University as long almost as Xenocrates in Athens ad senectam fere to learn wisdom as he did penned up most part in my study For I have been brought up a student in the most flourishing college of Europe thirty augustissimo collegio and can brag with thirty one Jovius almost in ea luce domicilii Vacicani totius orbis celeberrimi per thirty seven annos multa opportunaque didici for thirty years I have continued having the use of as good thirty two libraries as ever he had a scholar and would be therefore loath either by living as a drone to be an unprofitable or unworthy member of so learned and noble a society or to write that which should be any way dishonourable to such a royal and ample foundation Something I have done though by my profession a divine yet turbine raptus ingenii as thirty three he said out of a running wit an unconstant unsettled mind I had a great desire not able to attain to a superficial skill in any to have some smattering in all to be aliquis in omnibus nullus in singulis thirty four which thirty five Plato commends out of him thirty six Lipsius approves and furthers as fit to be imprinted in all curious wits not to be a slave of one science or dwell altogether in one subject as most do but to rove abroad centum puer artium to have an oar in every man s boat to thirty seven taste of every dish and sip of every cup which saith thirty eight Montaigne was well performed by Aristotle and his learned countryman Adrian Turnebus This roving humour though not with like success I have ever had and like a ranging spaniel that barks at every bird he sees leaving his game I have followed all saving that which I should and may justly complain and truly qui ubique est nusquam est thirty nine which forty Gesner did in modesty that I have read many books but to little purpose for want of good method I have confusedly tumbled over divers authors in our libraries with small profit for want of art order memory judgment I never travelled but in map or card in which mine unconfined thoughts have freely expatiated as having ever been especially delighted with the study of Cosmography forty one Saturn was lord of my geniture culminating c and Mars principal significator of manners in partile conjunction with my ascendant both fortunate in their houses c I am not poor I am not rich nihil est nihil deest I have little I want nothing all my treasure is in Minerva s tower Greater preferment as I could never get so am I not in debt for it I have a competence laus Deo from my noble and munificent patrons though I live still a collegiate student as Democritus in his garden and lead a monastic life ipse mihi theatrum sequestered from those tumults and troubles of the world Et tanquam in specula positus forty two as he said in some high place above you all like Stoicus Sapiens omnia saecula praeterita presentiaque videns uno velut intuitu I hear and see what is done abroad how others forty three run ride turmoil and macerate themselves in court and country far from those wrangling lawsuits aulia vanitatem fori ambitionem ridere mecum soleo I laugh at all forty four only secure lest my suit go amiss my ships perish corn and cattle miscarry trade decay I have no wife nor children good or bad to provide for A mere spectator of other men s fortunes and adventures and how they act their parts which methinks are diversely presented unto me as from a common theatre or scene I hear new news every day and those ordinary rumours of war plagues fires inundations thefts murders massacres meteors comets spectrums prodigies apparitions of towns taken cities besieged in France Germany Turkey Persia Poland c daily musters and preparations and such like which these tempestuous times afford battles fought so many men slain monomachies shipwrecks piracies and sea fights peace leagues stratagems and fresh alarms A vast confusion of vows wishes actions edicts petitions lawsuits pleas laws proclamations complaints grievances are daily brought to our ears New books every day pamphlets corantoes stories whole catalogues of volumes of all sorts new paradoxes opinions schisms heresies controversies in philosophy religion c Now come tidings of weddings maskings mummeries entertainments jubilees embassies tilts and tournaments trophies triumphs revels sports plays then again as in a new shifted scene treasons cheating tricks robberies enormous villainies in all kinds funerals burials deaths of princes new discoveries expeditions now comical then tragical matters Today we hear of new lords and officers created tomorrow of some great men deposed and then again of fresh honours conferred one is let loose another imprisoned one purchaseth another breaketh he thrives his neighbour turns bankrupt now plenty then again dearth and famine one runs another rides wrangles laughs weeps c This I daily hear and such like both private and public news amidst the gallantry and misery of the world jollity pride perplexities and cares simplicity and villainy subtlety knavery candour and integrity mutually mixed and offering themselves I rub on privus privatus as I have still lived so I now continue statu quo prius left to a solitary life and mine own domestic discontents saving that sometimes ne quid mentiar as Diogenes went into the city and Democritus to the haven to see fashions I did for my recreation now and then walk abroad look into the world and could not choose but make some little observation non tam sagax observator ac simplex recitator forty five not as they did to scoff or laugh at all but with a mixed passion forty six Bilem saepe jocum vestri movere tumultus Ye wretched mimics whose fond heats have been How oft the objects of my mirth and spleen I did sometime laugh and scoff with Lucian and satirically tax with Menippus lament with Heraclitus sometimes again I was forty seven petulanti splene chachinno and then again forty eight urere bilis jecur I was much moved to see that abuse which I could not mend In which passion howsoever I may sympathise with him or them tis for no such respect I shroud myself under his name but either in an unknown habit to assume a little more liberty and freedom of speech or if you will needs know for that reason and only respect which Hippocrates relates at large in his Epistle to Damegetus wherein he doth express how coming to visit him one day he found Democritus in his garden at Abdera in the suburbs forty nine under a shady bower fifty with a book on his knees busy at his study sometimes writing sometimes walking The subject of his book was melancholy and madness about him lay the carcases of many several beasts newly by him cut up and anatomised not that he did contemn God s creatures as he told Hippocrates but to find out the seat of this atra bilis or melancholy whence it proceeds and how it was engendered in men s bodies to the intent he might better cure it in himself and by his writings and observation fifty one teach others how to prevent and avoid it Which good intent of his Hippocrates highly commended Democritus Junior is therefore bold to imitate and because he left it imperfect and it is now lost quasi succenturiator Democriti to revive again prosecute and finish in this treatise You have had a reason of the name If the title and inscription offend your gravity were it a sufficient justification to accuse others I could produce many sober treatises even sermons themselves which in their fronts carry more fantastical names Howsoever it is a kind of policy in these days to prefix a fantastical title to a book which is to be sold for as larks come down to a day net many vain readers will tarry and stand gazing like silly passengers at an antic picture in a painter s shop that will not look at a judicious piece And indeed as fifty two Scaliger observes nothing more invites a reader than an argument unlooked for unthought of and sells better than a scurrile pamphlet tum maxime cum novitas excitat fifty three palatum Many men saith Gellius are very conceited in their inscriptions and able as fifty four Pliny quotes out of Seneca to make him loiter by the way that went in haste to fetch a midwife for his daughter now ready to lie down For my part I have honourable fifty five precedents for this which I have done I will cite one for all Anthony Zara Pap Epis his Anatomy of Wit in four sections members subsections c to be read in our libraries If any man except against the matter or manner of treating of this my subject and will demand a reason of it I can allege more than one I write of melancholy by being busy to avoid melancholy There is no greater cause of melancholy than idleness no better cure than business as fifty six Rhasis holds and howbeit stultus labor est ineptiarum to be busy in toys is to small purpose yet hear that divine Seneca aliud agere quam nihil better do to no end than nothing I wrote therefore and busied myself in this playing labour oliosaque diligentia ut vitarem torporum feriandi with Vectius in Macrobius atque otium in utile verterem negatium fifty seven Simul et jucunda et idonea dicere vita Lectorem delectando simul atque monendo Poets would profit or delight mankind And with the pleasing have th instructive joined Profit and pleasure then to mix with art T inform the judgment nor offend the heart Shall gain all votes To this end I write like them saith Lucian that recite to trees and declaim to pillars for want of auditors as fifty eight Paulus Aegineta ingenuously confesseth not that anything was unknown or omitted but to exercise myself which course if some took I think it would be good for their bodies and much better for their souls or peradventure as others do for fame to show myself Scire tuum nihil est nisi te scire hoc sciat alter I might be of Thucydides opinion fifty nine to know a thing and not to express it is all one as if he knew it not When I first took this task in hand et quod ait sixty ille impellents genio negotium suscepi this I aimed at sixty one vel ut lenirem animum scribendo to ease my mind by writing for I had gravidum cor foetum caput a kind of imposthume in my head which I was very desirous to be unladen of and could imagine no fitter evacuation than this Besides I might not well refrain for ubi dolor ibi digitus one must needs scratch where it itches I was not a little offended with this malady shall I say my mistress Melancholy my Aegeria or my malus genius and for that cause as he that is stung with a scorpion I would expel clavum clavo sixty two comfort one sorrow with another idleness with idleness ut ex vipera Theriacum make an antidote out of that which was the prime cause of my disease Or as he did of whom sixty three Felix Plater speaks that thought he had some of Aristophanes frogs in his belly still crying Breec okex coax coax oop oop and for that cause studied physic seven years and travelled over most part of Europe to ease himself To do myself good I turned over such physicians as our libraries would afford or my sixty four private friends impart and have taken this pains And why not Cardan professeth he wrote his book De Consolatione after his son s death to comfort himself so did Tully write of the same subject with like intent after his daughter s departure if it be his at least or some impostor s put out in his name which Lipsius probably suspects Concerning myself I can peradventure affirm with Marius in Sallust sixty five that which others hear or read of I felt and practised myself they get their knowledge by books I mine by melancholising Experto crede Roberto Something I can speak out of experience aerumnabilis experientia me docuit and with her in the poet sixty six Haud ignara mali miseris succurrere disco I would help others out of a fellow feeling and as that virtuous lady did of old sixty seven being a leper herself bestow all her portion to build an hospital for lepers I will spend my time and knowledge which are my greatest fortunes for the common good of all Yea but you will infer that this is sixty eight actum agere an unnecessary work cramben bis coctam apponnere the same again and again in other words To what purpose sixty nine Nothing is omitted that may well be said so thought Lucian in the like theme How many excellent physicians have written just volumes and elaborate tracts of this subject No news here that which I have is stolen from others seventy Dicitque mihi mea pagina fur es If that severe doom of seventy one Synesius be true it is a greater offence to steal dead men s labours than their clothes what shall become of most writers I hold up my hand at the bar among others and am guilty of felony in this kind habes confitentem reum I am content to be pressed with the rest Tis most true tenet insanabile multos scribendi cacoethes and seventy two there is no end of writing of books as the wiseman found of old in this seventy three scribbling age especially wherein seventy four the number of books is without number as a worthy man saith presses be oppressed and out of an itching humour that every man hath to show himself seventy five desirous of fame and honour scribimus indocti doctique he will write no matter what and scrape together it boots not whence seventy six Bewitched with this desire of fame etiam mediis in morbis to the disparagement of their health and scarce able to hold a pen they must say something seventy seven and get themselves a name saith Scaliger though it be to the downfall and ruin of many others To be counted writers scriptores ut salutentur to be thought and held polymaths and polyhistors apud imperitum vulgus ob ventosae nomen artis to get a paper kingdom nulla spe quaestus sed ampla famae in this precipitate ambitious age nunc ut est saeculum inter immaturam eruditionem ambitiosum et praeceps tis seventy eight Scaliger s censure and they that are scarce auditors vix auditores must be masters and teachers before they be capable and fit hearers They will rush into all learning togatam armatam divine human authors rake over all indexes and pamphlets for notes as our merchants do strange havens for traffic write great tomes Cum non sint re vera doctiores sed loquaciores whereas they are not thereby better scholars but greater praters They commonly pretend public good but as seventy nine Gesner observes tis pride and vanity that eggs them on no news or aught worthy of note but the same in other terms Ne feriarentur fortasse typographi vel ideo scribendum est aliquid ut se vixisse testentur As apothecaries we make new mixtures everyday pour out of one vessel into another and as those old Romans robbed all the cities of the world to set out their bad sited Rome we skim off the cream of other men s wits pick the choice flowers of their tilled gardens to set out our own sterile plots Castrant alios ut libros suos per se graciles alieno adipe suffarciant so eighty Jovius inveighs They lard their lean books with the fat of others works Ineruditi fures c A fault that every writer finds as I do now and yet faulty themselves eighty one Trium literarum homines all thieves they pilfer out of old writers to stuff up their new comments scrape Ennius dunghills and out of eighty two Democritus pit as I have done By which means it comes to pass eighty three that not only libraries and shops are full of our putrid papers but every close stool and jakes Scribunt carmina quae legunt cacantes they serve to put under pies to eighty four lap spice in and keep roast meat from burning With us in France saith eighty five Scaliger every man hath liberty to write but few ability eighty six Heretofore learning was graced by judicious scholars but now noble sciences are vilified by base and illiterate scribblers that either write for vainglory need to get money or as Parasites to flatter and collogue with some great men they put cut eighty seven burras quisquiliasque ineptiasque eighty eight Amongst so many thousand authors you shall scarce find one by reading of whom you shall be any whit better but rather much worse quibus inficitur potius quam perficitur by which he is rather infected than any way perfected eighty nine Qui talia legit Quid didicit tandem quid scit nisi somnia nugas So that oftentimes it falls out which Callimachus taxed of old a great book is a great mischief ninety Cardan finds fault with Frenchmen and Germans for their scribbling to no purpose non inquit ab edendo deterreo modo novum aliquid inveniant he doth not bar them to write so that it be some new invention of their own but we weave the same web still twist the same rope again and again or if it be a new invention tis but some bauble or toy which idle fellows write for as idle fellows to read and who so cannot invent ninety one He must have a barren wit that in this scribbling age can forge nothing ninety two Princes show their armies rich men vaunt their buildings soldiers their manhood and scholars vent their toys they must read they must hear whether they will or no ninety three Et quodcunque semel

Frankfort Marts our domestic Marts brought out Twice a year ninety five Proferunt se nova ingenia et ostentant we stretch our wits out and set them to sale magno conatu nihil agimus So that which

can read them As already we shall have a vast chaos and confusion of books we are ninety seven oppressed with them ninety eight our eyes ache with reading our fingers with turning For my part I am one of the number nos numerus sumus we are mere ciphers I do not deny it I have only this of Macrobius to say for myself Omne meum nihil meum tis all mine and none mine As a good housewife out of divers fleeces weaves one piece of cloth a bee gathers wax and honey out of many flowers and makes a new bundle of all Floriferis ut apes in saltibus omnia libant I have laboriously ninety nine collected this cento out of divers writers and that sine injuria I have wronged no authors but given every man his own which one hundred Hierom so much commends in Nepotian he stole not whole verses pages tracts as some do nowadays concealing their authors names but still said this was Cyprian s that Lactantius that Hilarius so said Minutius Felix so Victorinus thus far Arnobius I cite and quote mine authors which howsoever some illiterate scribblers account pedantical as a cloak of ignorance and opposite to their affected fine style I must and will use sumpsi non suripui and what Varro lib six de

gratias et multorum one hundred twenty two bene laudatorum laudes sum inde promeritus as I have been honoured by some worthy men so have I been vilified by others and shall be At the first publishing of this book which one hundred twenty three Probus of Persius satires editum librum continuo mirari homines atque avide deripere caeperunt I may in some sort apply to this my work The first second and third edition were suddenly gone eagerly read and as I have said not so much approved by some as scornfully rejected by others But it was Democritus his fortune Idem admirationi et one hundred twenty four irrisioni habitus Twas Seneca s fate that superintendent of wit learning judgment one hundred twenty five ad stuporem doctus the best of Greek and Latin writers in Plutarch s opinion that renowned corrector of vice as one hundred twenty six Fabius terms him and painful omniscious philosopher that writ so excellently and admirably well could not please all parties or escape censure How is he vilified by one hundred twenty seven Caligula Agellius Fabius and Lipsius himself his chief propugner In eo pleraque pernitiosa saith the same Fabius many childish tracts and sentences he hath sermo illaboratus too negligent often and remiss as Agellius observes oratio vulgaris et protrita dicaces et ineptae sententiae eruditio plebeia an homely shallow writer as he is In partibus spinas et fastidia habet saith one hundred twenty eight Lipsius and as in all his other works so especially in his epistles aliae in argutiis et ineptiis occupantur intricatus alicubi et parum compositus sine copia rerum hoc fecit he jumbles up many things together immethodically after the Stoics fashion parum ordinavit multa accumulavit c If Seneca be thus lashed and many famous men that I could name what shall I expect How shall I that am vix umbra tanti philosophi hope to please No man so absolute one hundred twenty nine Erasmus holds to satisfy all except antiquity prescription c set a bar But as I have proved in Seneca this will not always take place how shall I evade Tis the common doom of all writers I must I say abide it I seek not applause one hundred thirty Non ego ventosa venor suffragia plebis again non sum adeo informis I would not be one hundred thirty one vilified one hundred thirty two laudatus abunde Non fastiditus si tibi lector ero I fear good men s censures and to their favourable acceptance I submit my labours one hundred thirty three et linguas mancipiorum Contemno As the barking of a dog I securely contemn those malicious and scurrile obloquies flouts calumnies of railers and detractors I scorn the rest What therefore I have said pro tenuitate mea I have said One or two things yet I was desirous to have amended if I could concerning the manner of handling this my subject for which I must apologise deprecari and upon better advice give the friendly reader notice it was not mine intent to prostitute my muse in English or to divulge secreta Minervae but to have exposed this more contract in Latin if I could have got it printed Any scurrile pamphlet is welcome to our mercenary stationers in English they print all cuduntque libellos In quorum foliis vix simia nuda cacaret But in Latin they will not deal which is one of the reasons one hundred thirty four Nicholas Car in his oration of the paucity of English writers gives that so many flourishing wits are smothered in oblivion lie dead and buried in this our nation Another main fault is that I have not revised the copy and amended the style which now flows remissly as it was first conceived but my leisure would not permit Feci nec quod potui nec quod volui I confess it is neither as I would nor as it should be one hundred thirty five Cum relego scripsisse pudet quia plurima cerno Me quoque quae fuerant judice digna lini When I peruse this tract which I have writ I am abash d and much I hold unfit Et quod gravissimum in the matter itself many things I disallow at this present which when I writ one hundred thirty six Non eadem est aetas non mens I would willingly retract much c but tis too late I can only crave pardon now for what is amiss I might indeed had I wisely done observed that precept of the poet nonumque prematur in annum and have taken more care or as Alexander the physician would have done by lapis lazuli fifty times washed before it be used I should have revised corrected and amended this tract but I had not as I said that happy leisure no amanuenses or assistants Pancrates in one hundred thirty seven Lucian wanting a servant as he went from Memphis to Coptus in Egypt took a door bar and after some superstitious words pronounced Eucrates the relator was then present made it stand up like a serving man fetch him water turn the spit serve in supper and what work he would besides and when he had done that service he desired turned his man to a stick again I have no such skill to make new men at my pleasure or means to hire them no whistle to call like the master of a ship and bid them run c I have no such authority no such benefactors as that noble one hundred thirty eight Ambrosius was to Origen allowing him six or seven amanuenses to write out his dictates I must for that cause do my business myself and was therefore enforced as a bear doth her whelps to bring forth this confused lump I had not time to lick it into form as she doth her young ones but even so to publish it as it was first written quicquid in buccam venit in an extemporean style as one hundred thirty nine I do commonly all other exercises effudi quicquid dictavit genius meus out of a confused company of notes and writ with as small deliberation as I do ordinarily speak without all affectation of big words fustian phrases jingling terms tropes strong lines that like one hundred forty Acesta s arrows caught fire as they flew strains of wit brave heats elegies hyperbolical exornations elegancies c which many so much affect I am one hundred forty one aquae potor drink no wine at all which so much improves our modern wits a loose plain rude writer ficum voco ficum et ligonem ligonem and as free as loose idem calamo quod in mente one hundred forty two I call a spade a spade animis haec scribo non auribus I respect matter not words remembering that of Cardan verba propter res non res propter verba and seeking with Seneca quid scribam non quemadmodum rather what than how to write for as Philo thinks one hundred forty three He that is conversant about matter neglects words and those that excel in this art of speaking have no profound learning one hundred forty four Verba nitent phaleris at nullus verba medullas Intus habent Besides it was the observation of that wise Seneca one hundred forty five when you see a fellow careful about his words and neat in his speech know this for a certainty that man s mind is busied about toys there s no solidity in him Non est ornamentum virile concinnitas as he said of a nightingale vox es praeterea nihil c I am therefore in this point a professed disciple of one hundred forty six Apollonius a scholar of Socrates I neglect phrases and labour wholly to inform my reader s understanding not to please his ear tis not my study or intent to compose neatly which an orator requires but to express myself readily and plainly as it happens So that as a river runs sometimes precipitate and swift then dull and slow now direct then per ambages now deep then shallow now muddy then clear now broad then narrow doth my style flow now serious then light now comical then satirical now more elaborate then remiss as the present subject required or as at that time I was affected And if thou vouchsafe to read this treatise it shall seem no otherwise to thee than the way to an ordinary traveller sometimes fair sometimes foul here champaign there enclosed barren in one place better soil in another by woods groves hills dales plains c I shall lead thee per ardua montium et lubrica valllum et roscida cespitum et one hundred forty seven glebosa camporum through variety of objects that which thou shalt like and surely dislike For the matter itself or method if it be faulty consider I pray you that of Columella Nihil perfectum aut a singulari consummatum industria no man can observe all much is defective no doubt may be justly taxed altered and avoided in Galen Aristotle those great masters Boni venatoris one hundred forty eight one holds plures feras capere non omnes he is a good huntsman can catch some not all I have done my endeavour Besides I dwell not in this study Non hic sulcos ducimus non hoc pulvere desudamus I am but a smatterer I confess a stranger one hundred forty nine here and there I pull a flower I do easily grant if a rigid censurer should criticise on this which I have writ he should not find three sole faults as Scaliger in Terence but three hundred So many as he hath done in Cardan s subtleties as many notable errors as one hundred fifty Gul Laurembergius a late professor of Rostock discovers in that anatomy of Laurentius or Barocius the Venetian in Sacro boscus And although this be a sixth edition in which I should have been more accurate corrected all those former escapes yet it was magni laboris opus so difficult and tedious that as carpenters do find out of experience tis much better build a new sometimes than repair an old house I could as soon write as much more as alter that which is written If aught therefore be amiss as I grant there is I require a friendly admonition no bitter invective one hundred fifty one Sint musis socii Charites Furia omnis abesto otherwise as in ordinary controversies funem contentionis nectamus sed cui bono We may contend and likely misuse each other but to what purpose We are both scholars say one hundred fifty two Arcades ambo Et Cantare pares et respondere parati Both young Arcadians both alike inspir d To sing and answer as the song requir d If we do wrangle what shall we get by it Trouble and wrong ourselves make sport to others If I be convict of an error I will yield I will amend Si quid bonis moribus si quid veritati dissentaneum in sacris vel humanis literis a me dictum sit id nec dictum esto In the mean time I require a favourable censure of all faults omitted harsh compositions pleonasms of words tautological repetitions though Seneca bear me out nunquam nimis dicitur quod nunquam satis dicitur perturbations of tenses numbers printers faults c My translations are sometimes rather paraphrases than interpretations non ad verbum but as an author I use more liberty and that s only taken which was to my purpose Quotations are often inserted in the text which makes the style more harsh or in the margin as it happened Greek authors Plato Plutarch Athenaeus c I have cited out of their interpreters because the original was not so ready I have mingled sacra prophanis but I hope not profaned and in repetition of authors names ranked them per accidens not according to chronology sometimes neoterics before ancients as my memory suggested Some things are here altered expunged in this sixth edition others amended much added because many good one hundred fifty three authors in all kinds are come to my hands since and tis no prejudice no such indecorum or oversight one hundred fifty four Nunquam ita quicquam bene subducta ratione ad vitam fuit Quin res aetas usus semper aliquid apportent novi Aliquid moneant ut illa quae scire te credas nescias Et quae tibi putaris prima in exercendo ut repudias Ne er was ought yet at first contriv d so fit But use age or something would alter it Advise thee better and upon peruse Make thee not say and what thou tak saint refuse But I am now resolved never to put this treatise out again Ne quid nimis I will not hereafter add alter or retract I have done The last and greatest exception is that I being a divine have meddled with physic one hundred fifty five Tantumne est ab re tua otii tibi Aliena ut cures eaque nihil quae ad te attinent Which Menedemus objected to Chremes have I so much leisure or little business of mine own as to look after other men s matters which concern me not What have I to do with physic Quod medicorum est promittant medici The one hundred fifty six Lacedaemonians were once in counsel about state matters a debauched fellow spake excellent well and to the purpose his speech was generally approved a grave senator steps up and by all means would have it repealed though good because dehonestabatur pessimo auctore it had no better an author let some good man relate the same and then it should pass This counsel was embraced factum est and it was registered forthwith Et sic bona sententia mansit malus auctor mutatus est Thou sayest as much of me stomachosus as thou art and grantest peradventure this which I have written in physic not to be amiss had another done it a professed physician or so but why should I meddle with this tract Hear me speak There be many other subjects I do easily grant both in humanity and divinity fit to be treated of of which had I written ad ostentationem only to show myself I should have rather chosen and in which I have been more conversant I could have more willingly luxuriated and better satisfied myself and others but that at this time I was fatally driven upon this rock of melancholy and carried away by this by stream which as a rillet is deducted from the main channel of my studies in which I have pleased and busied myself at idle hours as a subject most necessary and commodious Not that I prefer it before divinity which I do acknowledge to be the queen of professions and to which all the rest are as handmaids but that in divinity I saw no such great need For had I written positively there be so many books in that kind so many commentators treatises pamphlets expositions sermons that whole teams of oxen cannot draw them and had I been as forward and ambitious as some others I might have haply printed a sermon at Paul s Cross a sermon in saint Marie s Oxon a sermon in Christ Church or a sermon before the right honourable right reverend a sermon before the right worshipful a sermon in Latin in English a sermon with a name a sermon without a sermon a sermon c But I have been ever as desirous to suppress my labours in this kind as others have been to press and publish theirs To have written in controversy had been to cut off an hydra s head one hundred fifty seven Lis litem generat one begets another so many duplications triplications and swarms of questions In sacro bello hoc quod stili mucrone agitur that having once begun I should never make an end One had much better as one hundred fifty eight Alexander the sixth pope long since observed provoke a great prince than a begging friar a Jesuit or a seminary priest I will add for inexpugnabile genus hoc hominum they are an irrefragable society they must and will have the last word and that with such eagerness impudence abominable lying falsifying and bitterness in their questions they proceed that as he one hundred fifty nine said furorne caecus an rapit vis acrior an culpa responsum date Blind fury or error or rashness or what it is that eggs them I know not I am sure many times which one hundred sixty Austin perceived long since tempestate contentionis serenitas charitatis obnubilatur with this tempest of contention the serenity of charity is overclouded and there be too many spirits conjured up already in this kind in all sciences and more than we can tell how to lay which do so furiously rage and keep such a racket that as one hundred sixty one Fabius said It had been much better for some of them to have been born dumb and altogether illiterate than so far to dote to their own destruction At melius fuerat non scribere namque tacere Tutum semper erit one hundred sixty two Tis a general fault so Severinus the Dane complains one hundred sixty three in physic unhappy men as we are we spend our days in unprofitable questions and disputations intricate subtleties de lana caprina about moonshine in the water leaving in the mean time those chiefest treasures of nature untouched wherein the best medicines for all manner of diseases are to be found and do not only neglect them ourselves but hinder condemn forbid and scoff at others that are willing to inquire after them These motives at this present have induced me to make choice of this medicinal subject If any physician in the mean time shall infer Ne sutor ultra crepidam and find himself grieved that I have intruded into his profession I will tell him in brief I do not otherwise by them than they do by us If it be for their advantage I know many of their sect which have taken orders in hope of a benefice tis a common transition and why may not a melancholy divine that can get nothing but by simony profess physic Drusianus an Italian Crusianus but corruptly Trithemius calls him one hundred sixty four because he was not fortunate in his practice forsook his profession and writ afterwards in divinity Marcilius Ficinus was semel et simul a priest and a physician at once and one hundred sixty five T Linacer in his old age took orders The Jesuits profess both at this time divers of them permissu superiorum chirurgeons panders bawds and midwives c Many poor country vicars for want of other means are driven to their shifts to turn mountebanks quacksalvers empirics and if our greedy patrons hold us to such hard conditions as commonly they do they will make most of us work at some trade as Paul did at last turn taskers maltsters costermongers graziers sell ale as some have done or worse Howsoever in undertaking this task I hope I shall commit no great error or indecorum if all be considered aright I can vindicate myself with Georgius Braunus and Hieronymus Hemingius those two learned divines who to borrow a line or two of mine one hundred sixty six elder brother drawn by a natural love the one of pictures and maps prospectives and chorographical delights writ that ample theatre of cities the other to the study of genealogies penned theatrum genealogicum Or else I can excuse my studies with one hundred sixty seven Lessius the Jesuit in like case It is a disease of the soul on which I am to treat and as much appertaining to a divine as to a physician and who knows not what an agreement there is betwixt these two professions A good divine either is or ought to be a good physician a spiritual physician at least as our Saviour calls himself and was indeed Mat iv twenty three Luke v eighteen Luke vii eight They differ but in object the one of the body the other of the soul and use divers medicines to cure one amends animam per corpus the other corpus per animam as one hundred sixty eight our Regius Professor of physic well informed us in a learned lecture of his not long since One helps the vices and passions of the soul anger lust desperation pride presumption c by applying that spiritual physic as the other uses proper remedies in bodily diseases Now this being a common infirmity of body and soul and such a one that hath as much need of spiritual as a corporal cure I could not find a fitter task to busy myself about a more apposite theme so necessary so commodious and generally concerning all sorts of men that should so equally participate of both and require a whole physician A divine in this compound mixed malady can do little alone a physician in some kinds of melancholy much less both make an absolute cure one hundred sixty nine Alterius sic altera poscit opem when in friendship joined A mutual succour in each other find And tis proper to them both and I hope not unbeseeming me who am by my profession a divine and by mine inclination a physician I had Jupiter in my sixth house I say with one hundred seventy Beroaldus non sum medicus nec medicinae prorsus expers in the theory of physic I have taken some pains not with an intent to practice but to satisfy myself which was a cause likewise of the first undertaking of this subject If these reasons do not satisfy thee good reader as Alexander Munificus that bountiful prelate sometimes bishop of Lincoln when he had built six castles ad invidiam operis eluendam saith one hundred seventy one mister Camden to take away the envy of his work which very words Nubrigensis hath of Roger the rich bishop of Salisbury who in king Stephen s time built Shirburn castle and that of Devises to divert the scandal or imputation which might be thence inferred built so many religious houses If this my discourse be over medicinal or savour too much of humanity I promise thee that I will hereafter make thee amends in some treatise of divinity But this I hope shall suffice when you have more fully considered of the matter of this my subject rem substratam melancholy madness and of the reasons following which were my chief motives the generality of the disease the necessity of the cure and the commodity or common good that will arise to all men by the knowledge of it as shall at large appear in the ensuing preface And I doubt not but that in the end you will say with me that to anatomise this humour aright through all the members of this our Microcosmus is as great a task as to reconcile those chronological errors in the Assyrian monarchy find out the quadrature of a circle the creeks and sounds of the north east or north west passages and all out as good a discovery as that hungry one hundred seventy two Spaniard s of Terra Australis Incognita as great trouble as to perfect the motion of Mars and Mercury which so crucifies our astronomers or to rectify the Gregorian Calendar I am so affected for my part and hope as one hundred seventy three Theophrastus did by his characters That our posterity O friend Policles shall be the better for this which we have written by correcting and rectifying what is amiss in themselves by our examples and applying our precepts and cautions to their own use And as that great captain Zisca would have a drum made of his skin when he was dead because he thought the very noise of it would put his enemies to flight I doubt not but that these following lines when they shall be recited or hereafter read will drive away melancholy though I be gone as much as Zisca s drum could terrify his foes Yet one caution let me give by the way to my present or my future reader who is actually melancholy that he read not the one hundred seventy four symptoms or prognostics in this following tract lest by applying that which he reads to himself aggravating appropriating things generally spoken to his own person as melancholy men for the most part do he trouble or hurt himself and get in conclusion more harm than good I advise them therefore warily to peruse that tract Lapides loquitur so said one hundred seventy five Agrippa de occ Phil et caveant lectores ne cerebrum iis excutiat The rest I doubt not they may securely read and to their benefit But I am over tedious I proceed Of the necessity and generality of this which I have said if any man doubt I shall desire him to make a brief survey of the world as one hundred seventy six Cyprian adviseth Donat supposing himself to be transported to the top of some high mountain and thence to behold the tumults and chances of this wavering world he cannot choose but either laugh at or pity it S Hierom out of a strong imagination being in the wilderness conceived with himself that he then saw them dancing in Rome and if thou shalt either conceive or climb to see thou shalt soon perceive that all the world is mad that it is melancholy dotes that it is which Epichthonius Cosmopolites expressed not many years since in a map made like a fool s head with that motto Caput helleboro dignum a crazed head cavea stultorum a fool s paradise or as Apollonius a common prison of gulls cheaters flatterers c and needs to be reformed Strabo in the ninth book of his geography compares Greece to the picture of a man which comparison of his Nic Gerbelius in his exposition of Sophianus map approves the breast lies open from those Acroceraunian hills in Epirus to the Sunian promontory in Attica Pagae and Magaera are the two shoulders that Isthmus of Corinth the neck and Peloponnesus the head If this allusion hold tis sure a mad head Morea may be Moria and to speak what I think the inhabitants of modern Greece swerve as much from reason and true religion at this day as that Morea doth from the picture of a man Examine the rest in like sort and you shall find that kingdoms and provinces are melancholy cities and families all creatures vegetal sensible and rational that all sorts sects ages conditions are out of tune as in Cebes table omnes errorem bibunt before they come into the world they are intoxicated by error s cup from the highest to the lowest have need of physic and those particular actions in one hundred seventy seven Seneca where father and son prove one another mad may be general Porcius Latro shall plead against us all For indeed who is not a fool melancholy mad one hundred seventy eight Qui nil molitur inepte who is not brain sick Folly melancholy madness are but one disease Delirium is a common name to all Alexander Gordonius Jason Pratensis Savanarola Guianerius Montaltus confound them as differing secundum magis et minus so doth David Psal xxxvii five I said unto the fools deal not so madly and twas an old Stoical paradox omnes stultos insanire one hundred seventy nine all fools are mad though some madder than others And who is not a fool who is free from melancholy Who is not touched more or less in habit or disposition If in disposition ill dispositions beget habits if they persevere saith one hundred eighty Plutarch habits either are or turn to diseases Tis the same which Tully maintains in the second of his Tusculans omnium insipientum animi in morbo sunt et perturbatorum fools are sick and all that are troubled in mind for what is sickness but as one hundred eighty one Gregory Tholosanus defines it A dissolution or perturbation of the bodily league which health combines and who is not sick or ill disposed in whom doth not passion anger envy discontent fear and sorrow reign Who labours not of this disease Give me but a little leave and you shall see by what testimonies confessions arguments I will evince it that most men are mad that they had as much need to go a pilgrimage to the Anticyrae as in one hundred eighty two Strabo s time they did as in our days they run to Compostella our Lady of Sichem or Lauretta to seek for help that it is like to be as prosperous a voyage as that of Guiana and that there is much more need of hellebore than of tobacco That men are so misaffected melancholy mad giddy headed hear the testimony of Solomon Eccl ii twelve And I turned to behold wisdom madness and folly c And ver twenty three All his days are sorrow his travel grief and his heart taketh no rest in the night So that take melancholy in what sense you will properly or improperly in disposition or habit for pleasure or for pain dotage discontent fear sorrow madness for part or all truly or metaphorically tis all one Laughter itself is madness according to Solomon and as saint Paul hath it Worldly sorrow brings death The hearts of the sons of men are evil and madness is in their hearts while they live Eccl ix three Wise men themselves are no better Eccl i eighteen In the multitude of wisdom is much grief and he that increaseth wisdom increaseth sorrow chap ii seventeen He hated life itself nothing pleased him he hated his labour all as one hundred eighty three he concludes is sorrow grief vanity vexation of spirit And though he were the wisest man in the world sanctuarium sapientiae and had wisdom in abundance he will not vindicate himself or justify his own actions Surely I am more foolish than any man and have not the understanding of a man in me Prov xxx two Be they Solomon s words or the words of Agur the son of Jakeh they are canonical David a man after God s own heart confesseth as much of himself Psal xxxvii twenty one twenty two So foolish was I and ignorant I was even as a beast before thee And condemns all for fools Psal xciii xxxii nine xlix twenty He compares them to beasts horses and mules in which there is no understanding The apostle Paul accuseth himself in like sort two Cor ix twenty one I would you would suffer a little my foolishness I speak foolishly The whole head is sick saith Esay and the heart is heavy cap i five And makes lighter of them than of oxen and asses the ox knows his owner c read Deut xxxii six Jer iv Amos iii one Ephes v six Be not mad be not deceived foolish Galatians who hath bewitched you How often are they branded with this epithet of madness and folly No word so frequent amongst the fathers of the Church and divines you may see what an opinion they had of the world and how they valued men s actions I know that we think far otherwise and hold them most part wise men that are in authority princes magistrates one hundred eighty four rich men they are wise men born all politicians and statesmen must needs be so for who dare speak against them And on the other so corrupt is our judgment we esteem wise and honest men fools Which Democritus well signified in an epistle of his to Hippocrates one hundred eighty five the Abderites account virtue madness and so do most men living Shall I tell you the reason of it one hundred eighty six Fortune and Virtue Wisdom and Folly their seconds upon a time contended in the Olympics every man thought that Fortune and Folly would have the worst and pitied their cases but it fell out otherwise Fortune was blind and cared not where she stroke nor whom without laws Audabatarum instar c Folly rash and inconsiderate esteemed as little what she said or did Virtue and Wisdom gave one hundred eighty seven place were hissed out and exploded by the common people Folly and Fortune admired and so are all their followers ever since knaves and fools commonly fare and deserve best in worldlings eyes and opinions Many good men have no better fate in their ages Achish one Sam xxi fourteen held David for a madman one hundred eighty eight Elisha and the rest were no otherwise esteemed David was derided of the common people Ps ix seven I am become a monster to many And generally we are accounted fools for Christ one Cor xiv We fools thought his life madness and his end without honour Wisd v four Christ and his Apostles were censured in like sort John x Mark iii Acts xxvi And so were all Christians in one hundred eighty nine Pliny s time fuerunt et alii similis dementiae c And called not long after one hundred ninety Vesaniae sectatores eversores hominum polluti novatores fanatici canes malefici venefici Galilaei homunciones c Tis an ordinary thing with us to account honest devout orthodox divine religious plain dealing men idiots asses that cannot or will

ambage felicem reddunt hominem et vere sapientem apud nos that cannot temporise as other men do one hundred ninety one hand and take bribes c but fear God and make a conscience of their doings But the Holy Ghost that knows better how to judge he calls them fools The fool hath said in his heart Psal liii one And their ways utter their folly Psal xlix fourteen one hundred ninety two For what can be more mad than for a little worldly pleasure to procure unto themselves eternal punishment As Gregory and others inculcate unto us Yea even all those great philosophers the world hath ever had in admiration whose works we do so much esteem that gave precepts of wisdom to others inventors of Arts and Sciences Socrates the wisest man of his time by the Oracle of Apollo whom his two scholars one hundred ninety three Plato and one hundred ninety four Xenophon so much extol and magnify with those honourable titles best and wisest of all mortal men the happiest and most just and as one hundred ninety five Alcibiades incomparably commends him Achilles was a worthy man but Bracides and others were as worthy as himself Antenor and Nestor were as good as Pericles and so of the rest but none present before or after Socrates nemo veterum neque eorum qui nunc sunt were ever such will match or come near him Those seven wise men of Greece those Britain Druids Indian Brachmanni Ethiopian Gymnosophist Magi of the Persians Apollonius of whom Philostratus Non doctus sed natus sapiens wise from his cradle Epicurus so much admired by his scholar Lucretius Qui genus humanum ingenio superavit et omnes Perstrinxit stellas exortus ut aetherius sol Whose wit excell d the wits of men as far As the sun rising doth obscure a star Or that so much renowned Empedocles one hundred ninety six Ut vix humana videatur stirpe creatus All those of whom we read such one hundred ninety seven hyperbolical eulogiums as of Aristotle that he was wisdom itself in the abstract one hundred ninety eight a miracle of nature breathing libraries as Eunapius of Longinus lights of nature giants for wit quintessence of wit divine spirits eagles in the clouds fallen from heaven gods spirits lamps of the world dictators Nulla ferant talem saecla futura virum monarchs miracles superintendents of wit and learning oceanus phoenix atlas monstrum portentum hominis orbis universi musaeum ultimus humana naturae donatus naturae maritus merito cui doctior orbis Submissis defert fascibus imperium As Aelian writ of Protagoras and Gorgias we may say of them all tantum a sapientibus abfuerunt quantum a viris pueri they were children in respect infants not eagles but kites novices illiterate Eunuchi sapientiae And although they were the wisest and most admired in their age as he censured Alexander I do them there were ten thousand in his army as worthy captains had they been in place of command as valiant as himself there were myriads of men wiser in those days and yet all short of what they ought to be one hundred ninety nine Lactantius in his book of wisdom proves them to be dizzards fools asses madmen so full of absurd and ridiculous tenets and brain sick positions that to his thinking never any old woman or sick person doted worse two hundred Democritus took all from Leucippus and left saith he the inheritance of his folly to Epicurus two hundred one insanienti dum sapientiae c The like he holds of Plato Aristippus and the rest making no difference two hundred two betwixt them and beasts saving that they could speak two hundred three Theodoret in his tract De cur grec affect manifestly evinces as much of Socrates whom though that Oracle of Apollo confirmed to be the wisest man then living and saved him from plague whom two thousand years have admired of whom some will as soon speak evil as of Christ yet re vera he was an illiterate idiot as two hundred four Aristophanes calls him irriscor et ambitiosus as his master Aristotle terms him scurra Atticus as Zeno an two hundred five enemy to all arts and sciences as Athaeneus to philosophers and travellers an opiniative ass a caviller a kind of pedant for his manners as Theod Cyrensis describes him a two hundred six sodomite an atheist so convict by Anytus iracundus et ebrius dicax c a pot companion by two hundred seven Plato s own confession a sturdy drinker and that of all others he was most sottish a very madman in his actions and opinions Pythagoras was part philosopher part magician or part witch If you desire to hear more of Apollonius a great wise man sometime paralleled by Julian the apostate to Christ I refer you to that learned tract of Eusebius against Hierocles and for them all to Lucian s Piscator Icaromenippus Necyomantia their actions opinions in general were so prodigious absurd ridiculous which they broached and maintained their books and elaborate treatises were full of dotage which Tully ad Atticum long since observed delirant plerumque scriptores in libris suis their lives being opposite to their words they commended poverty to others and were most covetous themselves extolled love and peace and yet persecuted one another with virulent hate and malice They could give precepts for verse and prose but not a man of them as two hundred eight Seneca tells them home could moderate his affections Their music did show us flebiles modos c how to rise and fall but they could not so contain themselves as in adversity not to make a lamentable tone They will measure ground by geometry set down limits divide and subdivide but cannot yet prescribe quantum homini satis or keep within compass of reason and discretion They can square circles but understand not the state of their own souls describe right lines and crooked c but know not what is right in this life quid in vita rectum sit ignorant so that as he said Nescio an Anticyram ratio illis destinet omnem I think all the Anticyrae will not restore them to their wits two hundred nine if these men now that held two hundred ten Xenodotus heart Crates liver Epictetus lantern were so sottish and had no more brains than so many beetles what shall we think of the commonalty what of the rest Yea but you will infer that is true of heathens if they be conferred with Christians one Cor iii nineteen The wisdom of this world is foolishness with God earthly and devilish as James calls it iii fifteen They were vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was full of darkness Rom i twenty one twenty two When they professed themselves wise became fools Their witty works are admired here on earth whilst their souls are tormented in hell fire In some sense Christiani Crassiani Christians are Crassians and if compared to that wisdom no better than fools Quis est sapiens Solus Deus two hundred eleven Pythagoras replies God is only wise Rom xvi Paul determines only good as Austin well contends and no man living can be justified in his sight God looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if any did understand Psalm liii two three but all are corrupt err Rom iii twelve None doeth good no not one Job aggravates this iv eighteen Behold he found no steadfastness in his servants and laid folly upon his angels nineteen How much more on them that dwell in houses of clay In this sense we are all fools and the two hundred twelve Scripture alone is arx Minervae we and our writings are shallow and imperfect But I do not so mean even in our ordinary dealings we are no better than fools All our actions as two hundred thirteen Pliny told Trajan upbraid us of folly our whole course of life is but matter of laughter we are not soberly wise and the world itself which ought at least to be wise by reason of his antiquity as two hundred fourteen Hugo de Prato Florido will have it semper stultizat is every day more foolish than other the more it is whipped the worse it is and as a child will still be crowned with roses and flowers We are apish in it asini bipedes and every place is full inversorum Apuleiorum of metamorphosed and two legged asses inversorum Silenorum childish pueri instar bimuli tremula patris dormientis in ulna Jovianus Pontanus Antonio Dial brings in some laughing at an old man that by reason of his age was a little fond but as he admonisheth there Ne mireris mi hospes de hoc sene marvel not at him only for tota haec civitas delirium all our town dotes in like sort two hundred fifteen we are a company of fools Ask not with him in the poet two hundred sixteen Larvae hunc intemperiae insaniaeque agitant senem What madness ghosts this old man but what madness ghosts us all For we are ad unum omnes all mad semel insanivimus omnes not once but alway so et semel et simul et semper ever and altogether as bad as he and not senex bis puer delira anus but say it of us all semper pueri young and old all dote as Lactantius proves out of Seneca and no difference betwixt us and children saving that majora ludimus et grandioribus pupis they play with babies of clouts and such toys we sport with greater baubles We cannot accuse or condemn one another being faulty ourselves deliramenta loqueris you talk idly or as two hundred seventeen Mitio upbraided Demea insanis auferte for we are as mad our own selves and it is hard to say which is the worst Nay tis universally so two hundred eighteen Vitam regit fortuna non sapientia When two hundred nineteen Socrates had taken great pains to find out a wise man and to that purpose had consulted with philosophers poets artificers he concludes all men were fools and though it procured him both anger and much envy yet in all companies he would openly profess it When two hundred twenty Supputius in Pontanus had travelled all over Europe to confer with a wise man he returned at last without his errand and could find none two hundred twenty one Cardan concurs with him Few there are for aught I can perceive well in their wits So doth two hundred twenty two Tully I see everything to be done foolishly and unadvisedly Ille sinistrorsum hic dextrorsum unus utrique Error sed variis illudit partibus omnes One reels to this another to that wall Tis the same error that deludes them all two hundred twenty three They dote all but not alike Greek Mania gar pasin homoia not in the same kind One is covetous a second lascivious a third ambitious a fourth envious c as Damasippus the Stoic hath well illustrated in the poet two hundred twenty four Desipiunt omnes aeque ac tu And they who call you fool with equal claim May plead an ample title to the name Tis an inbred malady in every one of us there is seminarium stultitiae a seminary of folly which if it be stirred up or get ahead will run in infinitum and infinitely varies as we ourselves are severally addicted saith two hundred twenty five Balthazar Castilio and cannot so easily be rooted out it takes such fast hold as Tully holds altae radices stultitiae two hundred twenty six so we are bred and so we continue Some say there be two main defects of wit error and ignorance to which all others are reduced by ignorance we know not things necessary by error we know them falsely Ignorance is a privation error a positive act From ignorance comes vice from error heresy c But make how many kinds you will divide and subdivide few men are free or that do not impinge on some one kind or other two hundred twenty seven Sic plerumque agitat stultos inscitia as he that examines his own and other men s actions shall find two hundred twenty eight Charon in Lucian as he wittily feigns was conducted by Mercury to such a place where he might see all the world at once after he had sufficiently viewed and looked about Mercury would needs know of him what he had observed He told him that he saw a vast multitude and a promiscuous their habitations like molehills the men as emmets he could discern cities like so many hives of bees wherein every bee had a sting and they did nought else but sting one another some domineering like hornets bigger than the rest some like filching wasps others as drones Over their heads were hovering a confused company of perturbations hope fear anger avarice ignorance c and a multitude of diseases hanging which they still pulled on their pates Some were brawling some fighting riding running sollicite ambientes callide litigantes for toys and trifles and such momentary things Their towns and provinces mere factions rich against poor poor against rich nobles against artificers they against nobles and so the rest In conclusion he condemned them all for madmen fools idiots asses O stulti quaenam haec est amentia O fools O madmen he exclaims insana studia insani labores c Mad endeavours mad actions mad mad mad two hundred twenty nine O saeclum insipiens et infacetum a giddy headed age Heraclitus the philosopher out of a serious meditation of men s lives fell a weeping and with continual tears bewailed their misery madness and folly Democritus on the other side burst out a laughing their whole life seemed to him so ridiculous and he was so far carried with this ironical passion that the citizens of Abdera took him to be mad and sent therefore ambassadors to Hippocrates the physician that he would exercise his skill upon him But the story is set down at large by Hippocrates in his epistle to Damogetus which because it is not impertinent to this discourse I will insert verbatim almost as it is delivered by Hippocrates himself with all the circumstances belonging unto it When Hippocrates was now come to Abdera the people of the city came flocking about him some weeping some intreating of him that he would do his best After some little repast he went to see Democritus the people following him whom he found as before in his garden in the suburbs all alone two hundred thirty sitting upon a stone under a plane tree without hose or shoes with a book on his knees cutting up several beasts and busy at his study The multitude stood gazing round about to see the congress Hippocrates after a little pause saluted him by his name whom he resaluted ashamed almost that he could not call him likewise by his or that he had forgot it Hippocrates demanded of him what he was doing he told him that he was two hundred thirty one busy in cutting up several beasts to find out the cause of madness and melancholy Hippocrates commended his work admiring his happiness and leisure And why quoth Democritus have not you that leisure Because replied Hippocrates domestic affairs hinder necessary to be done for ourselves neighbours friends expenses diseases frailties and mortalities which happen wife children servants and such business which deprive us of our time At this speech Democritus profusely laughed his friends and the people standing by weeping in the mean time and lamenting his madness Hippocrates asked the reason why he laughed He told him at the vanities and the fopperies of the time to see men so empty of all virtuous actions to hunt so far after gold having no end of ambition to take such infinite pains for a little glory and to be favoured of men to make such deep mines into the earth for gold and many times to find nothing with loss of their lives and fortunes Some to love dogs others horses some to desire to be obeyed in many provinces two hundred thirty two and yet themselves will know no obedience two hundred thirty three Some to love their wives dearly at first and after a while to forsake and hate them begetting children with much care and cost for their education yet when they grow to man s estate two hundred thirty four to despise neglect and leave them naked to the world s mercy two hundred thirty five Do not these behaviours express their intolerable folly When men live in peace they covet war detesting quietness two hundred thirty six deposing kings and advancing others in their stead murdering some men to beget children of their wives How many strange humours are in men When they are poor and needy they seek riches and when they have them they do not enjoy them but hide them under ground or else wastefully spend them O wise Hippocrates I laugh at such things being done but much more when no good comes of them and when they are done to so ill purpose There is no truth or justice found amongst them for they daily plead one against another two hundred thirty seven the son against the father and the mother brother against brother kindred and friends of the same quality and all this for riches whereof after death they cannot be possessors And yet notwithstanding they will defame and kill one another commit all unlawful actions contemning God and men friends and country They make great account of many senseless things esteeming them as a great part of their treasure statues pictures and such like movables dear bought and so cunningly wrought as nothing but speech wanteth in them two hundred thirty eight and yet they hate living persons speaking to them two hundred thirty nine Others affect difficult things if they dwell on firm land they will remove to an island and thence to land again being no way constant to their desires They commend courage and strength in wars and let themselves be conquered by lust and avarice they are in brief as disordered in their minds as Thersites was in his body And now methinks O most worthy Hippocrates you should not reprehend my laughing perceiving so many fooleries in men two hundred forty for no man will mock his own folly but that which he seeth in a second and so they justly mock one another The drunkard calls him a glutton whom he knows to be sober Many men love the sea others husbandry briefly they cannot agree in their own trades and professions much less in their lives and actions When Hippocrates heard these words so readily uttered without premeditation to declare the world s vanity full of ridiculous contrariety he made answer that necessity compelled men to many such actions and divers wills ensuing from divine permission that we might not be idle being nothing is so odious to them as sloth and negligence Besides men cannot foresee future events in this uncertainty of human affairs they would not so marry if they could foretell the causes of their dislike and separation or parents if they knew the hour of their children s death so tenderly provide for them or an husbandman sow if he thought there would be no increase or a merchant adventure to sea if he foresaw shipwreck or be a magistrate if presently to be deposed Alas worthy Democritus every man hopes the best and to that end he doth it and therefore no such cause or ridiculous occasion of laughter Democritus hearing this poor excuse laughed again aloud perceiving he wholly mistook him and did not well understand what he had said concerning perturbations and tranquillity of the mind Insomuch that if men would govern their actions by discretion and providence they would not declare themselves fools as now they do and he should have no cause of laughter but quoth he they swell in this life as if they were immortal and demigods for want of understanding It were enough to make them wise if they would but consider the mutability of this world and how it wheels about nothing being firm and sure He that is now above tomorrow is beneath he that sate on this side today tomorrow is hurled on the other and not considering these matters they fall into many inconveniences and troubles coveting things of no profit and thirsting after them tumbling headlong into many calamities So that if men would attempt no more than what they can bear they should lead contented lives and learning to know themselves would limit their ambition two hundred forty one they would perceive then that nature hath enough without seeking such superfluities and unprofitable things which bring nothing with them but grief and molestation As a fat body is more subject to diseases so are rich men to absurdities and fooleries to many casualties and cross inconveniences There are many that take no heed what happeneth to others by bad conversation and therefore overthrow themselves in the same manner through their own fault not foreseeing dangers manifest These are things O more than mad quoth he that give me matter of laughter by suffering the pains of your impieties as your avarice envy malice enormous villainies mutinies unsatiable desires conspiracies and other incurable vices besides your two hundred forty two dissimulation and hypocrisy bearing deadly hatred one to the other and yet shadowing it with a good face flying out into all filthy lusts and transgressions of all laws both of nature and civility Many things which they have left off after a while they fall to again husbandry navigation and leave again fickle and inconstant as they are When they are young they would be old and old young two hundred forty three Princes commend a private life private men itch after honour a magistrate commends a quiet life a quiet man would be in his office and obeyed as he is and what is the cause of all this but that they know not themselves Some delight to destroy two hundred forty four one to build another to spoil one country to enrich another and himself two hundred forty five In all these things they are like children in whom is no judgment or counsel and resemble beasts saving that beasts are better than they as being contented with nature two hundred forty six When shall you see a lion hide gold in the ground or a bull contend for better pasture When a boar is thirsty he drinks what will serve him and no more and when his belly is full ceaseth to eat but men are immoderate in both as in lust they covet carnal copulation at set times men always ruinating thereby the health of their bodies And doth it not deserve laughter to see an amorous fool torment himself for a wench weep howl for a misshapen slut a dowdy sometimes that might have his choice of the finest beauties Is there any remedy for this in physic I do anatomise and cut up these poor beasts two hundred forty seven to see these distempers vanities and follies yet such proof were better made on man s body if my kind nature would endure it two hundred forty eight who from the hour of his birth is most miserable weak and sickly when he sucks he is guided by others when he is grown great practiseth unhappiness two hundred forty nine and is sturdy and when old a child again and repenteth him of his life past And here being interrupted by one that brought books he fell to it again that all were mad careless stupid To prove my former speeches look into courts or private houses two hundred fifty Judges give judgment according to their own advantage doing manifest wrong to poor innocents to please others Notaries alter sentences and for money lose their deeds Some make false monies others counterfeit false weights Some abuse their parents yea corrupt their own sisters others make long libels and pasquils defaming men of good life and extol such as are lewd and vicious Some rob one some another two hundred fifty one magistrates make laws against thieves and are the veriest thieves themselves Some kill themselves others despair not obtaining their desires Some dance sing laugh feast and banquet whilst others sigh languish mourn and lament having neither meat drink nor clothes two hundred fifty two Some prank up their bodies and have their minds full of execrable vices Some trot about two hundred fifty three to bear false witness and say anything for money and though judges know of it yet for a bribe they wink at it and suffer false contracts to prevail against equity Women are all day a dressing to pleasure other men abroad and go like sluts at home not caring to please their own husbands whom they should Seeing men are so fickle so sottish so intemperate why should not I laugh at those to whom two hundred fifty four folly seems wisdom will not be cured and perceive it not It grew late Hippocrates left him and no sooner was he come away but all the citizens came about flocking to know how he liked him He told them in brief that notwithstanding those small neglects of his attire body diet two hundred fifty five the world had not a wiser a more learned a more honest man and they were much deceived to say that he was mad Thus Democritus esteemed of the world in his time and this was the cause of his laughter and good cause he had two hundred fifty six Olim jure quidem nunc plus Democrite ride Quin rides vita haec nunc mage ridicula est Democritus did well to laugh of old Good cause he had but now much more This life of ours is more ridiculous Than that of his or long before Never so much cause of laughter as now never so many fools and madmen Tis not one two hundred fifty seven Democritus will serve turn to laugh in these days we have now need of a Democritus to laugh at Democritus one jester to flout at another one fool to fleer at another a great stentorian Democritus as big as that Rhodian Colossus For now as two hundred fifty eight Salisburiensis said in his time totus mundus histrionem agit the whole world plays the fool we have a new theatre a new scene a new comedy of errors a new company of personate actors volupiae sacra as Calcagninus willingly feigns in his Apologues are celebrated all the world over two hundred fifty nine where all the actors were madmen and fools and every hour changed habits or took that which came next He that was a mariner today is an apothecary tomorrow a smith one while a philosopher another in his volupiae ludis a king now with his crown robes sceptre attendants by and by drove a loaded ass before him like a carter c If Democritus were alive now he should see strange alterations a new company of counterfeit vizards whifflers Cumane asses maskers mummers painted puppets outsides fantastic shadows gulls monsters giddy heads butterflies And so many of them are indeed two hundred sixty if all be true that I have read For when Jupiter and Juno s wedding was solemnised of old the gods were all invited to the feast and many noble men besides Amongst the rest came Crysalus a Persian prince bravely attended rich in golden attires in gay robes with a majestical presence but otherwise an ass The gods seeing him come in such pomp and state rose up to give him place ex habitu hominem metientes two hundred sixty one but Jupiter perceiving what he was a light fantastic idle fellow turned him and his proud followers into butterflies and so they continue still for aught I know to the contrary roving about in pied coats and are called chrysalides by the wiser sort of men that is golden outsides drones and flies and things of no worth Multitudes of such c two hundred sixty two ubique invenies Stultos avaros sycopliantas prodigos Many additions much increase of madness folly vanity should Democritus observe were he now to travel or could get leave of Pluto to come see fashions as Charon did in Lucian to visit our cities of Moronia Pia and Moronia Felix sure I think he would break the rim of his belly with laughing two hundred sixty three Si foret in terris rideret Democritus seu c A satirical Roman in his time thought all vice folly and madness were all at full sea two hundred sixty four Omne in praecipiti vitium stetit two hundred sixty five Josephus the historian taxeth his countrymen Jews for bragging of their vices publishing their follies and that they did contend amongst themselves who should be most notorious in villainies but we flow higher in madness far beyond them two hundred sixty six Mox daturi progeniem vitiosorem And yet with crimes to us unknown Our sons shall mark the coming age their own and the latter end you know whose oracle it is is like to be worse Tis not to be denied the world alters every day Ruunt urbes regna transferuntur c variantur habitus leges innovantur as two hundred sixty seven Petrarch observes we change language habits laws customs manners but not vices not diseases not the symptoms of folly and madness they are still the same And as a river we see keeps the like name and place but not water and yet ever runs two hundred sixty eight Labitur et labetur in omne volubilis aevum our times and persons alter vices are the same and ever will be look how nightingales sang of old cocks crowed kine lowed sheep bleated sparrows chirped dogs barked so they do still we keep our madness still play the fools still nec dum finitus Orestes we are of the same humours and inclinations as our predecessors were you shall find us all alike much at one we and our sons Et nati natorum et qui nascuntur ab illis And so shall our posterity continue to the last But to speak of times present If Democritus were alive now and should but see the superstition of our age our two hundred sixty nine religious madness as two hundred seventy Meteran calls it Religiosam insaniam so many professed Christians yet so few imitators of Christ so much talk of religion so much science so little conscience so much knowledge so many preachers so little practice such variety of sects such have and hold of all sides two hundred seventy one obvia signis Signa c such absurd and ridiculous traditions and ceremonies If he should meet a two hundred seventy two Capuchin a Franciscan a Pharisaical Jesuit a man serpent a shave crowned Monk in his robes a begging Friar or see their three crowned Sovereign Lord the Pope poor Peter s successor servus servorum Dei to depose kings with his foot to tread on emperors necks make them stand barefoot and barelegged at his gates hold his bridle and stirrup c O that Peter and Paul were alive to see this If he should observe a two hundred seventy three prince creep so devoutly to kiss his toe and those red cap cardinals poor parish priests of old now princes companions what would he say Coelum ipsum petitur stultitia Had he met some of our devout pilgrims going barefoot to Jerusalem our lady of Lauretto Rome S Iago S Thomas Shrine to creep to those counterfeit and maggot eaten relics had he been present at a mass and seen such kissing of paxes crucifixes cringes duckings their several attires and ceremonies pictures of saints two hundred seventy four indulgences pardons vigils fasting feasts crossing knocking kneeling at Ave Marias bells with many such jucunda rudi spectacula plebi two hundred seventy five praying in gibberish and mumbling of beads Had he heard an old woman say her prayers in Latin their sprinkling of holy water and going a procession two hundred seventy six incedunt monachorum agmina mille Quid momerem vexilla cruces idolaque culta c Their breviaries bulls hallowed beans exorcisms pictures curious crosses fables and baubles Had he read the Golden Legend the Turks Alcoran or Jews Talmud the Rabbins Comments what would he have thought How dost thou think he might have been affected Had he more particularly examined a Jesuit s life amongst the rest he should have seen an hypocrite profess poverty two hundred seventy seven and yet possess more goods and lands than many princes to have infinite treasures and revenues teach others to fast and play the gluttons themselves like watermen that row one way and look another two hundred seventy eight Vow virginity talk of holiness and yet indeed a notorious bawd and famous fornicator lascivum pecus a very goat Monks by profession two hundred seventy nine such as give over the world and the vanities of it and yet a Machiavellian rout two hundred eighty interested in all manner of state holy men peace makers and yet composed of envy lust ambition hatred and malice firebrands adulta patriae pestis traitors assassinats hac itur ad astra and this is to supererogate and merit heaven for themselves and others Had he seen on the adverse side some of our nice and curious schismatics in another extreme abhor all ceremonies and rather lose their lives and livings than do or admit anything Papists have formerly used though in things indifferent they alone are the true Church sal terrae cum sint omnium insulsissimi Formalists out of fear and base flattery like so many weather cocks turn round a rout of temporisers ready to embrace and maintain all that is or shall be proposed in hope of preferment another Epicurean company lying at lurch as so many vultures watching for a prey of Church goods and ready to rise by the downfall of any as two hundred eighty one Lucian said in like case what dost thou think Democritus would have done had he been spectator of these things Or had he but observed the common people follow like so many sheep one of their fellows drawn by the horns over a gap some for zeal some for fear quo se cunque rapit tempestas to credit all examine nothing and yet ready to die before they will adjure any of those ceremonies to which they have been accustomed others out of hypocrisy frequent sermons knock their breasts turn up their eyes pretend zeal desire reformation and yet professed usurers gripers monsters of men harpies devils in their lives to express nothing less What would he have said to see hear and read so many bloody battles so many thousands slain at once such streams of blood able to turn mills unius ob noxam furiasque or to make sport for princes without any just cause two hundred eighty two for vain titles saith Austin precedency some wench or such like toy or out of desire of domineering vainglory malice revenge folly madness goodly causes all ob quas universus orbis bellis et

mischief they procure so that they may enrich themselves for the present they will so long blow the coals of contention till all the world be consumed with fire The two hundred eighty four siege of

devil could invent to do mischief with two million five hundred thousand iron bullets shot of forty pounds weight three or four millions of gold consumed two hundred eighty eight Who saith mine author can be sufficiently amazed at their flinty hearts obstinacy fury blindness who without any likelihood of good success hazard poor soldiers and lead them without pity to the slaughter which may justly be called the rage of furious beasts that run without reason upon their own deaths two hundred eighty nine quis malus genius quae furia quae pestis c what plague what fury brought so devilish so

adds So many myriads of the commons were butchered up with sword famine war tanto odio utrinque ut barbari ad abhorrendam lanienam obstupescerent with such feral hatred the world was amazed at it or at our late Pharsalian fields in the time of Henry the Sixth betwixt the houses of Lancaster and York a hundred thousand men slain three hundred one one writes three hundred two another ten thousand

insaniae suae memoriam pro perpetuo teste relinquunt posteritati which leave so frequent battles as perpetual memorials of their madness to all succeeding ages Would this think you have enforced our Democritus to laughter or rather made him turn his tune alter his tone and weep with three hundred eleven Heraclitus or rather howl three hundred twelve roar and tear his hair in commiseration stand amazed or as the poets feign that Niobe was for grief quite stupefied and turned to a stone I have not yet said the worst that which is more absurd and three hundred thirteen mad in their tumults seditions civil and unjust wars three hundred fourteen quod stulte sucipitur impie geritur misere finitur Such wars I mean for all are not to be condemned as those fantastical Anabaptists vainly conceive Our Christian tactics are all out as necessary as the Roman acies or Grecian phalanx to be a soldier is a most noble and honourable profession as the world is not to be spared they are our best walls and bulwarks and I do therefore acknowledge that of three hundred fifteen Tully to be most true All our civil affairs all our studies all our pleading industry and commendation lies under the protection of warlike virtues and whensoever there is any suspicion of tumult all our arts cease wars are most behoveful et bellatores agricolis civitati sunt utiliores as three hundred sixteen

pass that daily so many voluntaries offer themselves leaving their sweet wives children friends for sixpence if they can get it a day prostitute their lives and limbs desire to enter upon breaches lie

marched to meet Alexander at Issus Void of all fear they run into imminent dangers cannon s mouth c ut vulneribus suis ferrum hostium hebetent saith three hundred nineteen Barletius to get a name of valour humour and applause which lasts not either for it is but a mere flash this fame and like a rose intra diem unum extinguitur tis gone in an instant Of fifteen thousand proletaries slain in a battle scarce fifteen are recorded in history or one alone the General perhaps and after a while his and their names are likewise blotted out the whole battle itself is forgotten Those Grecian orators summa vi ingenii et eloquentiae set out the renowned overthrows at Thermopylae Salamis Marathon Micale Mantinea Cheronaea Plataea The Romans record their battle at Cannas and Pharsalian fields but they do but record and we scarce hear of them And yet this supposed honour popular applause desire of immortality by this means pride and vainglory spur them on many times rashly and unadvisedly to make away themselves and multitudes of others Alexander was sorry because there were no more worlds for him to conquer he is admired by some for it animosa vox videtur et regia twas spoken like a Prince but as wise three hundred twenty Seneca censures him twas vox inquissima et stultissima twas spoken like a Bedlam fool and that sentence which the same three hundred twenty one Seneca appropriates to his father Philip and him I apply to them all Non minores fuere pestes mortalium quam inundatio quam conflagratio quibus c they did as much mischief to mortal men as fire and water those merciless elements when they rage three hundred twenty two Which is yet more to be lamented they persuade them this hellish course of life is holy they promise heaven to such as venture their lives bello sacro and that by these bloody wars as Persians Greeks and Romans of old as modern Turks do now their commons to encourage them to fight ut cadant infeliciter If they die in the field they go directly to heaven and shall be canonised for saints O diabolical invention put in the Chronicles in perpetuam rei memoriam to their eternal memory when as in truth as three hundred twenty three some hold it were much better since wars are the scourge of God for sin by which he punisheth mortal men s peevishness and folly such brutish stories were suppressed because ad morum institutionem nihil habent they conduce not at all to manners or good life But they will have it thus nevertheless and so they put note of three hundred twenty four divinity upon the most cruel and pernicious plague of human kind adore such men with grand titles degrees statues images three hundred twenty five honour applaud and highly reward them for their good service no greater glory than to die in the field So Africanus is extolled by Ennius Mars and three hundred twenty six Hercules and I know not how many besides of old were deified went this way to heaven that were indeed bloody butchers wicked destroyers and troublers of the world prodigious monsters hell hounds feral plagues devourers common executioners of human kind as Lactantius truly proves and Cyprian to Donat such as were desperate in wars and precipitately made away themselves like those Celts in Damascen with ridiculous valour ut dedecorosum putarent muro ruenti se subducere a disgrace to run away for a rotten wall now ready to fall on their heads such as will not rush on a sword s point or seek to shun a cannon s shot are base cowards and no valiant men By which means Madet orbis mutuo sanguine the earth wallows in her

instances as motes in the sun Quantum est in rebus inane How much vanity there is in things And who can speak of all Crimine ab uno disce omnes take this for a taste But these are obvious to sense trivial and well known easy to be discerned How would Democritus have been moved had he seen three hundred eighty seven the secrets of their hearts If every man had a window in his breast which Momus would have had in Vulcan s man or that which Tully so much wished it were written in every man s forehead Quid quisque de republica sentiret what he thought or that it could be effected in an instant which Mercury did by Charon in Lucian by touching of his eyes to make him discern semel et simul rumores et susurros Spes hominum caecas morbos votumque labores Et passim toto volitantes aethere curas Blind hopes and wishes their thoughts and affairs Whispers and rumours and those flying cares That he could cubiculorum obductas foras recludere et secreta cordium penetrare which three hundred eighty eight Cyprian desired open doors and locks shoot bolts as Lucian s Gallus did with a feather of his tail or Gyges invisible ring or some rare perspective glass or Otacousticon which would so multiply species that a man might hear and see all at once as three hundred eighty nine Martianus Capella s Jupiter did in a spear which he held in his hand which did present unto him all that was daily done upon the face of the earth observe cuckolds horns forgeries of alchemists the philosopher s stone new projectors c and all those works of darkness foolish vows hopes fears and wishes what a deal of laughter would it have afforded He should have seen windmills in one man s head an hornet s nest in another Or had he been present with Icaromenippus in Lucian at Jupiter s whispering place three hundred ninety and heard one pray for rain another for fair weather one for his wife s another for his father s death c to ask that at God s hand which they are abashed any man should hear How would he have been confounded Would he think you or any man else say that these men were well in their wits Haec sani esse hominis quis sanus juret Orestes Can all the hellebore in the Anticyrae cure these men No sure three hundred ninety one an acre of hellebore will not do it That which is more to be lamented they are mad like Seneca s blind woman and will not acknowledge or three hundred ninety two seek for any cure of it for pauci vident morbum suum omnes amant If our leg or arm offend us we covet by all means possible to redress it three hundred ninety three and if we labour of a bodily disease we send for a physician but for the diseases of the mind we take no notice of them three hundred ninety four Lust harrows us on the one side envy anger ambition on the other We are torn in pieces by our passions as so many wild horses one in disposition another in habit one is melancholy another mad three hundred ninety five and which of us all seeks for help doth acknowledge his error or knows he is sick As that stupid fellow put out the candle because the biting fleas should not find him he shrouds himself in an unknown habit borrowed titles because nobody should discern him Every man thinks with himself Egomet videor mihi sanus I am well I am wise and laughs at others And tis a general fault amongst them all that three hundred ninety six which our forefathers have approved diet apparel opinions humours customs manners we deride and reject in our time as absurd Old men account juniors all fools when they are mere dizzards and as to sailors terraeque urbesque recedunt they move the land stands still the world hath much more wit they dote themselves Turks deride us we them Italians Frenchmen accounting them light headed fellows the French scoff again at Italians and at their several customs Greeks have condemned all the world but themselves of barbarism the world as much vilifies them now we account Germans heavy dull fellows explode many of their fashions they as contemptibly think of us Spaniards laugh at all and all again at them So are we fools and ridiculous absurd in our actions carriages diet apparel customs and consultations we three hundred ninety seven scoff and point one at another when as in conclusion all are fools three hundred ninety eight and they the veriest asses that hide their ears most A private man if he be resolved with himself or set on an opinion accounts all idiots and asses that are not affected as he is three hundred ninety nine nil rectum nisi quod placuit sibi ducit that are not so minded four hundred quodque volunt homines se bene velle putant all fools that think not as he doth he will not say with Atticus Suam quisque sponsam mihi meam let every man enjoy his own spouse but his alone is fair suus amor c and scorns all in respect of himself four hundred one will imitate none hear none four hundred two but himself as Pliny said a law and example to himself And that which Hippocrates in his epistle to Dionysius reprehended of old is verified in our times Quisque in alio superfluum esse censet ipse quod non habet nec curat that which he hath not himself or doth not esteem he accounts superfluity an idle quality a mere foppery in another like Aesop s fox when he had lost his tail would have all his fellow foxes cut off theirs The Chinese say that we Europeans have one eye they themselves two all the world else is blind though four hundred three Scaliger accounts them brutes too merum pecus so thou and thy sectaries are only wise others indifferent the rest beside themselves mere idiots and asses Thus not acknowledging our own errors and imperfections we securely deride others as if we alone were free and spectators of the rest accounting it an excellent thing as indeed it is Aliena optimum frui insania to make ourselves merry with other men s obliquities when as he himself is more faulty than the rest mutato nomine de te fabula narratur he may take himself by the nose for a fool and which one calls maximum stultitiae specimen to be ridiculous to others and not to perceive or take notice of it as Marsyas was when he contended with Apollo non intelligens se deridiculo haberi saith four hundred four Apuleius tis his own cause he is a convicted madman as four hundred five Austin well infers in the eyes of wise men and angels he seems like one that to our thinking walks with his heels upwards So thou laughest at me and I at thee both at a third and he returns that of the poet upon us again four hundred six Hei mihi insanire me aiunt quum ipsi ultro insaniant We accuse others of madness of folly and are the veriest dizzards ourselves For it is a great sign and property of a fool which Eccl x three points at out of pride and self conceit to insult vilify condemn censure and call other men fools Non videmus manticae quod a tergo est to tax that in others of which we are most faulty teach that which we follow not ourselves For an inconstant man to write of constancy a profane liver prescribe rules of sanctity and piety a dizzard himself make a treatise of wisdom or with Sallust to rail downright at spoilers of countries and yet in four hundred seven office to be a most grievous poller himself This argues weakness and is an evident sign of such parties indiscretion four hundred eight Peccat uter nostrum cruce dignius Who is the fool now Or else peradventure in some places we are all mad for company and so tis not seen Satietas erroris et dementiae pariter absurditatem et admirationem tollit Tis with us as it was of old in four hundred nine Tully s censure at least with C Pimbria in Rome a bold hair brain mad fellow and so esteemed of all such only excepted that were as mad as himself now in such a case there is four hundred ten no notice taken of it Nimirum insanus paucis videatur eo quod Maxima pars hominum morbo jactatur eodem When all are mad where all are like opprest Who can discern one mad man from the rest But put case they do perceive it and some one be manifestly convicted of madness four hundred eleven he now takes notice of his folly be it in action gesture speech a vain humour he hath in building bragging jangling spending gaming courting scribbling prating for which he is ridiculous to others four hundred twelve on which he dotes he doth acknowledge as much yet with all the rhetoric thou hast thou canst not so recall him but to the contrary notwithstanding he will persevere in his dotage Tis amabilis insania et mentis gratissimus error so pleasing so delicious that he four hundred thirteen cannot leave it He knows his error but will not seek to decline it tell him what the event will be beggary sorrow sickness disgrace shame loss madness yet four hundred fourteen an angry man will prefer vengeance a lascivious his whore a thief his booty a glutton his belly before his welfare Tell an epicure a covetous man an ambitious man of his irregular course wean him from it a little pol me occidistis amici he cries anon you have undone him and as four hundred fifteen a dog to his vomit he returns to it again no persuasion will take place no counsel say what thou canst Clames licet et mare coelo Confundas surdo narras four hundred sixteen demonstrate as Ulysses did to four hundred seventeen Elpenor and Gryllus and the rest of his companions those swinish men he is irrefragable in his humour he will be a hog still bray him in a mortar he will be the same If he be in an heresy or some perverse opinion settled as some of our ignorant Papists are convince his understanding show him the several follies and absurd fopperies of that sect force him to say veris vincor make it as clear as the sun four hundred eighteen he will err still peevish and obstinate as he is and as he said four hundred nineteen si in hoc erro libenter erro nec hunc errorem auferri mihi volo I will do as I have done as my predecessors have done four hundred twenty and as my friends now do I will dote for company Say now are these men four hundred twenty one mad or no four hundred twenty two Heus age responde are they ridiculous cedo quemvis arbitrum are they sanae mentis sober wise and discreet have they common sense four hundred twenty three uter est insanior horum I am of Democritus opinion for my part I hold them worthy to be laughed at a company of brain sick dizzards as mad as four hundred twenty four Orestes and Athamas that they may go ride the ass and all sail along to the Anticyrae in the ship of fools for company together I need not much labour to prove this which I say otherwise than thus make any solemn protestation or swear I think you will believe me without an oath say at a word are they fools I refer it to you though you be likewise fools and madmen yourselves and I as mad to ask the question for what said our comical Mercury four hundred twenty five Justum ab injustis petere insipientia est I ll stand to your censure yet what think you But forasmuch as I undertook at first that kingdoms provinces families were melancholy as well as private men I will examine them in particular and that which I have hitherto dilated at random in more general terms I will particularly insist in prove with more special and evident arguments testimonies illustrations and that in brief four hundred twenty six Nunc accipe quare desipiant omnes aeque ac tu My first argument is borrowed from Solomon an arrow drawn out of his sententious quiver Pro iii seven Be not wise in thine own eyes And xxvi twelve Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit more hope is of a fool than of him Isaiah pronounceth a woe against such men cap v twenty one that are wise in their own eyes and prudent in their own sight For hence we may gather that it is a great offence and men are much deceived that think too well of themselves an especial argument to convince them of folly Many men saith four hundred twenty seven Seneca had been without question wise had they not had an opinion that they had attained to perfection of knowledge already even before they had gone half way too forward too ripe praeproperi too quick and ready four hundred twenty eight cito prudentes cito pii cito mariti cito patres cito sacerdotes cito omnis officii capaces et curiosi they had too good a conceit of themselves and that marred all of their worth valour skill art learning judgment eloquence their good parts all their geese are swans and that manifestly proves them to be no better than fools In former times they had but seven wise men now you can scarce find so many fools Thales sent the golden tripos which the fishermen found and the oracle commanded to be four hundred twenty nine given to the wisest to Bias Bias to Solon c If such a thing were now found we should all fight for it as the three goddesses did for the golden apple we are so wise we have women politicians children metaphysicians every silly fellow can square a circle make perpetual motions find the philosopher s stone interpret Apocalypses make new Theories a new system of the world new Logic new Philosophy c Nostra utique regio saith four hundred thirty Petronius our country is so full of deified spirits divine souls that you may sooner find a God than a man amongst us we think so well of ourselves and that is an ample testimony of much folly My second argument is grounded upon the like place of Scripture which though before mentioned in effect yet for some reasons is to be repeated and by Plato s good leave I may do it four hundred thirty one Greek dis to kalon raethen ouden blaptei Fools saith David by reason of their transgressions c Psal cvii seventeen Hence Musculus infers all transgressors must needs be fools So we read Rom ii Tribulation and anguish on the soul of every man that doeth evil but all do evil And Isaiah lxv fourteen My servant shall sing for joy and four hundred thirty two ye shall cry for sorrow of heart and vexation of mind Tis ratified by the common consent of all philosophers Dishonesty saith Cardan is nothing else but folly and madness four hundred thirty three Probus quis nobiscum vivit Show me an honest man Nemo malus qui non stultus tis Fabius aphorism to the same end If none honest none wise then all fools And well may they be so accounted for who will account him otherwise Qui iter adornat in occidentem quum properaret in orientem that goes backward all his life westward when he is bound to the east or hold him a wise man saith four hundred thirty four Musculus that prefers momentary pleasures to eternity that spends his master s goods in his absence forthwith to be condemned for it Nequicquam sapit qui sibi non sapit who will say that a sick man is wise that eats and drinks to overthrow the temperature of his body Can you account him wise or discreet that would willingly have his health and yet will do nothing that should procure or continue it four hundred thirty five Theodoret out of Plotinus the Platonist holds it a ridiculous thing for a man to live after his own laws to do that which is offensive to God and yet to hope that he should save him and when he voluntarily neglects his own safety and contemns the means to think to be delivered by another who will say these men are wise A third argument may be derived from the precedent four hundred thirty six all men are carried away with passion discontent lust pleasures c they generally hate those virtues they should love and love such vices they should hate Therefore more than melancholy quite mad brute beasts and void of reason so Chrysostom contends or rather dead and buried alive as four hundred thirty seven Philo Judeus concludes it for a certainty of all such that are carried away with passions or labour of any disease of the mind Where is fear and sorrow there four hundred thirty eight Lactantius stiffly maintains wisdom cannot dwell qui cupiet metuet quoque porro Qui metuens vivit liber mihi non erit unquam four hundred thirty nine Seneca and the rest of the stoics are of opinion that where is any the least perturbation wisdom may not be found What more ridiculous as four hundred forty Lactantius urges than to hear how Xerxes whipped the Hellespont threatened the Mountain Athos and the like To speak ad rem who is free from passion four hundred forty one Mortalis nemo est quem non attingat dolor morbusve as four hundred forty two Tully determines out of an old poem no mortal men can avoid sorrow and sickness and sorrow is an inseparable companion from melancholy four hundred forty three Chrysostom pleads farther yet that they are more than mad very beasts stupefied and void of common sense For how saith he shall I know thee to be a man when thou kickest like an ass neighest like a horse after women ravest in lust like a bull ravenest like a bear stingest like a scorpion rakest like a wolf as subtle as a fox as impudent as a dog Shall I say thou art a man that hast all the symptoms of a beast How shall I know thee to be a man by thy shape That affrights me more when I see a beast in likeness of a man four hundred forty four Seneca calls that of Epicurus magnificam vocem an heroical speech A fool still begins to live and accounts it a filthy lightness in men every day to lay new foundations of their life but who doth otherwise One travels another builds one for this another for that business and old folks are as far out as the rest O dementem senectutem Tully exclaims Therefore young old middle age are all stupid and dote four hundred forty five Aeneas Sylvius amongst many other sets down three special ways to find a fool by He is a fool that seeks that he cannot find he is a fool that seeks that which being found will do him more harm than good he is a fool that having variety of ways to bring him to his journey s end takes that which is worst If so methinks most men are fools examine their courses and you shall soon perceive what dizzards and mad men the major part are Beroaldus will have drunkards afternoon men and such as more than ordinarily delight in drink to be mad The first pot quencheth thirst so Panyasis the poet determines in Athenaeus secunda gratiis horis et Dyonisio the second makes merry the third for pleasure quarta ad insaniam the fourth makes them mad If this position be true what a catalogue of mad men shall we have what shall they be that drink four times four Nonne supra omnem furorem supra omnem insanian reddunt insanissimos I am of his opinion they are more than mad much worse than mad The four hundred forty six Abderites condemned Democritus for a mad man because he was sometimes sad and sometimes again profusely merry Hac Patria saith Hippocrates ob risum furere et insanire dicunt his countrymen hold him mad because he laughs four hundred forty seven and therefore he desires him to advise all his friends at Rhodes that they do not laugh too much or be over sad Had those Abderites been conversant with us and but seen what four hundred forty eight fleering and grinning there is in this age they would certainly have concluded we had been all out of our wits Aristotle in his Ethics holds felix idemque sapiens to be wise and happy are reciprocal terms bonus idemque sapiens honestus Tis four hundred forty nine Tully s paradox wise men are free but fools are slaves liberty is a power to live according to his own laws as we will ourselves who hath this liberty who is free four hundred fifty sapiens sibique imperiosus Quem neque pauperis neque mors neque vincula terrent Responsare cupidinibus contemnere honores Fortis et in seipso totus teres atque rotundus He is wise that can command his own will Valiant and constant to himself still Whom poverty nor death nor bands can fright Checks his desires scorns honours just and right But where shall such a man be found If no where then e diametro we are all slaves senseless or worse Nemo malus felix But no man is happy in this life none good therefore no man wise four hundred fifty one Rari quippe boni For one virtue you shall find ten vices in the same party pauci Promethei multi Epimethei We may peradventure usurp the name or attribute it to others for favour as Carolus Sapiens Philippus Bonus Lodovicus Pius c and describe the properties of a wise man as Tully doth an orator Xenophon Cyrus Castilio a courtier Galen temperament an aristocracy is described by politicians But where shall such a man be found Vir bonus et sapiens qualem vix repperit unum Millibus e multis hominum consultus Apollo A wise a good man in a million Apollo consulted could scarce find one A man is a miracle of himself but Trismegistus adds Maximum miraculum homo sapiens a wise man is a wonder multi Thirsigeri pauci Bacchi Alexander when he was presented with that rich and costly casket of king Darius and every man advised him what to put in it he reserved it to keep Homer s works as the most precious jewel of human wit and yet four hundred fifty two Scaliger upbraids Homer s muse Nutricem insanae sapientiae a nursery of madness four hundred fifty three impudent as a court lady that blushes at nothing Jacobus Mycillus Gilbertus Cognatus Erasmus and almost all posterity admire Lucian s luxuriant wit yet Scaliger rejects him in his censure and calls him the Cerberus of the muses Socrates whom all the world so much magnified is by Lactantius and Theodoret condemned for a fool Plutarch extols Seneca s wit beyond all the Greeks nulli secundus yet four hundred fifty four Seneca saith of himself when I would solace myself with a fool I reflect upon myself and there I have him Cardan in his Sixteenth Book of Subtleties reckons up twelve supereminent acute philosophers for worth subtlety and wisdom Archimedes Galen Vitruvius Architas Tarentinus Euclid Geber that first inventor of Algebra Alkindus the Mathematician both Arabians with others But his triumviri terrarum far beyond the rest are Ptolomaeus Plotinus Hippocrates Scaliger exercitat two hundred twenty four scoffs at this censure of his calls some of them carpenters and mechanicians he makes Galen fimbriam Hippocratis a skirt of Hippocrates and the said four hundred fifty five Cardan himself elsewhere condemns both Galen and Hippocrates for tediousness obscurity confusion Paracelsus will have them both mere idiots infants in physic and philosophy Scaliger and Cardan admire Suisset the Calculator qui pene modum excessit humani ingenii and yet four hundred fifty six Lod Vives calls them nugas Suisseticas and Cardan opposite to himself in another place contemns those ancients in respect of times present four hundred fifty seven Majoresque nostros ad presentes collatos juste pueros appellari In conclusion the said four hundred fifty eight Cardan and Saint Bernard will admit none into this catalogue of wise men four hundred fifty nine but only prophets and apostles how they esteem themselves you have heard before We are worldly wise admire ourselves and seek for applause

fool to thyself I may not deny but that there is some folly approved a divine fury a holy madness even a spiritual drunkenness in the saints of God themselves sanctum insanium Bernard calls it though not as blaspheming four hundred sixty one Vorstius would infer it as a passion incident to God himself but familiar to good men as that of Paul two Cor he was a fool c and Rom ix he wisheth himself to be anathematised for them Such is that drunkenness which Ficinus speaks of when the soul is elevated and ravished with a divine taste of that heavenly nectar which poets deciphered by the sacrifice of Dionysius and in this sense with the poet four hundred sixty two insanire lubet as Austin exhorts us ad ebrietatem se quisque paret let s all be mad and four hundred sixty three drunk But we commonly mistake and go beyond our commission we reel to the opposite part four hundred sixty four we are not capable of it four hundred sixty five and as he said of the Greeks Vos Graeci semper pueri vos Britanni Galli Germani Itali c you are a company of fools Proceed now a partibus ad totum or from the whole to parts and you shall find no other issue the parts shall be sufficiently dilated in this

accounts true is most part false they are still opposite to wise men but all the world is of this humour vulgus and thou thyself art de vulgo one of the commonalty and he and he and so are all the rest and therefore as Phocion concludes to be approved in nought you say or do mere idiots and asses Begin then where you will go backward or forward choose out of the whole pack wink and choose you shall find them all alike never a barrel better herring Copernicus Atlas his successor is of opinion the earth is a planet moves and shines to others as the moon doth to us Digges Gilbert Keplerus Origanus and others defend this hypothesis of his in sober sadness and that the moon is inhabited if it be so that the earth is a moon then are we also giddy vertiginous and lunatic within this sublunary maze I could produce such arguments till dark night if you should hear the rest Ante diem clauso component vesper Olimpo Through such a train of words if I should run The day would sooner than the tale be done but according to my promise I will descend to particulars This melancholy extends itself not to men only but even to vegetals and sensibles I speak not of those creatures which are saturnine melancholy by nature as lead and such like minerals or those plants rue cypress c and hellebore itself of which four hundred sixty eight Agrippa treats fishes birds and beasts hares conies dormice c owls bats nightbirds but that artificial which is perceived in them all Remove a plant it will pine away which is especially perceived in date trees as you may read at large in Constantine s husbandry that antipathy betwixt the vine and the cabbage vine and oil Put a bird in a cage he will die for sullenness or a beast in a pen or take his young ones or companions from him and see what effect it will cause But who perceives not these common passions of sensible creatures fear sorrow c Of all other dogs are most subject to this malady insomuch some hold they dream as men do and through violence of melancholy run mad I could relate many stories of dogs that have died for grief and pined away for loss of their masters but they are common in every four hundred sixty nine author Kingdoms provinces and politic bodies are likewise sensible and subject to this disease as four hundred seventy Boterus in his politics hath proved at large As in human bodies saith he there be divers alterations proceeding from humours so be there many diseases in a commonwealth which do as diversely happen from several distempers as you may easily perceive by their particular symptoms For where you shall see the people civil obedient to God and princes judicious peaceable and quiet rich fortunate four hundred seventy one and flourish to live in peace in unity and concord a country well tilled many fair built and populous cities ubi incolae nitent as old four hundred seventy two Cato said the people are neat polite and terse ubi bene beateque vivunt which our politicians make the chief end of a commonwealth and which four hundred seventy three Aristotle Polit lib three cap four calls Commune bonum Polybius lib six optabilem et selectum statum that country is free from melancholy as it was in Italy in the time of Augustus now in China now in many other flourishing kingdoms of Europe But whereas you shall see many discontents common grievances complaints poverty barbarism beggary plagues wars rebellions seditions mutinies contentions idleness riot epicurism the land lie untilled waste full of bogs fens deserts c cities decayed base and poor towns villages depopulated the people squalid ugly uncivil that kingdom that country must needs be discontent melancholy hath a sick body and had need to be reformed Now that cannot well be effected till the causes of these maladies be first removed which commonly proceed from their own default or some accidental inconvenience as to be situated in a bad clime too far north sterile in a barren place as the desert of Libya deserts of Arabia places void of waters as those of Lop and Belgian in Asia or in a bad air as at Alexandretta Bantam Pisa Durrazzo S John de Ulloa c or in danger of the sea s continual inundations as in many places of the Low Countries and elsewhere or near some bad neighbours as Hungarians to Turks Podolians to Tartars or almost any bordering countries they live in fear still and by reason of hostile incursions are oftentimes left desolate So are cities by reason four hundred seventy four of wars fires plagues inundations four hundred seventy five wild beasts decay of trades barred havens the sea s violence as Antwerp may witness of late Syracuse of old Brundusium in Italy Rye and Dover with us and many that at this day suspect the sea s fury and rage and labour against it as the Venetians to their inestimable charge But the most frequent maladies are such as proceed from themselves as first when religion and God s service is neglected innovated or altered where they do not fear God obey their prince where atheism epicurism sacrilege simony c and all such impieties are freely committed that country cannot prosper When Abraham came to Gerar and saw a bad land he said sure the fear of God was not in that place four hundred seventy six Cyprian Echovius a Spanish chorographer above all other cities of Spain commends Borcino in which there was no beggar no man poor c but all rich and in good estate and he gives the reason because they were more religious than their neighbours why was Israel so often spoiled by their enemies led into captivity c but for their idolatry neglect of God s word for sacrilege even for one Achan s fault And what shall we except that have such multitudes of Achans church robbers simoniacal patrons c how can they hope to flourish that neglect divine duties that live most part like Epicures Other common grievances are generally noxious to a body politic alteration of laws and customs breaking privileges general oppressions seditions c observed by four hundred seventy seven Aristotle Bodin Boterus Junius Arniscus c I will only point at some of chiefest four hundred seventy eight Impotentia gubernandi ataxia confusion ill government which proceeds from unskilful slothful griping covetous unjust rash or tyrannizing magistrates when they are fools idiots children proud wilful partial indiscreet oppressors giddy heads tyrants not able or unfit to manage such offices four hundred seventy nine many noble cities and flourishing kingdoms by that means are desolate the whole body groans under such heads and all the members must needs be disaffected as at this day those goodly provinces in Asia Minor c groan under the burthen of a Turkish government and those vast kingdoms of Muscovia Russia four hundred eighty under a tyrannizing duke Who ever heard of more civil and rich populous countries than those of Greece Asia Minor abounding with all four hundred eighty one wealth multitudes of inhabitants force power splendour and magnificence and that miracle of countries four hundred eighty two the Holy Land that in so small a compass of ground could maintain so many towns cities produce so many fighting men Egypt another paradise now barbarous and desert and almost waste by the despotical government of an imperious Turk intolerabili servitutis jugo premitur four hundred eighty three one saith not only fire and water goods or lands sed ipse spiritus ab insolentissimi victoris pendet nutu such is their slavery their lives and souls depend upon his insolent will and command A tyrant that spoils all wheresoever he comes insomuch that an four hundred eighty four historian complains if an old inhabitant should now see them he would not know them if a traveller or stranger it would grieve his heart to behold them Whereas four hundred eighty five Aristotle notes Novae exactiones nova onera imposita new burdens and exactions daily come upon them like those of which Zosimus lib two so grievous ut viri uxores patres filios prostituerent ut exactoribus e questu c they must needs be discontent hinc civitatum gemitus et ploratus as four hundred eighty six Tully holds hence come those complaints and tears of cities poor miserable rebellious and desperate subjects as four hundred eighty seven Hippolitus adds and four hundred eighty eight as a judicious countryman of ours observed not long since in a survey of that great Duchy of Tuscany the people lived much grieved and discontent as appeared by their manifold and manifest complainings in that kind That the state was like a sick body which had lately taken physic whose humours are not yet well settled and weakened so much by purging that nothing was left but melancholy Whereas the princes and potentates are immoderate in lust hypocrites epicures of no religion but in show Quid hypocrisi fragilius what so brittle and unsure what sooner subverts their estates than wandering and raging lusts on their subjects wives daughters to say no worse That they should facem praeferre lead the way to all virtuous actions are the ringleaders oftentimes of all mischief and dissolute courses and by that means their countries are plagued four hundred eighty nine and they themselves often ruined banished or murdered by conspiracy of their subjects as Sardanapalus was Dionysius Junior Heliogabalus Periander Pisistratus Tarquinius Timocrates Childericus Appius Claudius Andronicus Galeacius Sforza Alexander Medices c Whereas the princes or great men are malicious envious factious ambitious emulators they tear a commonwealth asunder as so many Guelfs and Gibelines disturb the quietness of it four hundred ninety and with mutual murders let it bleed to death our histories are too full of such barbarous inhumanities and the miseries that issue from them Whereas they be like so many horseleeches hungry griping corrupt four hundred ninety one covetous avaritice mancipia ravenous as wolves for as Tully writes qui praeest prodest et qui pecudibus praeest debet eorum utilitati inservire or such as prefer their private before the public good For as four hundred ninety two he said long since res privatae publicis semper officere Or whereas they be illiterate ignorant empirics in policy ubi deest facultas four hundred ninety three virtus Aristot pol five cap eight et scientia wise only by inheritance and in authority by birthright favour or for their wealth and titles there must needs be a fault four hundred ninety four a great defect because as an four hundred ninety five old philosopher affirms such men are not always fit Of an infinite number few alone are senators and of those few fewer good and of that small number of honest good and noble men few that are learned wise discreet and sufficient able to discharge such places it must needs turn to the confusion of a state For as the four hundred ninety six Princes are so are the people Qualis Rex talis grex and which four hundred ninety seven Antigonus right well said of old qui Macedonia regem erudit omnes etiam subditos erudit he that teacheth the king of Macedon teacheth all his subjects is a true saying still For Princes are the glass the school the book Where subjects eyes do learn do read do look Velocius et citius nos Corrumpunt vitiorum exempla domestica magnis Cum subeant animos auctoribus four hundred ninety eight Their examples are soonest followed vices entertained if they be profane irreligious lascivious riotous epicures factious covetous ambitious illiterate so will the commons most part be idle unthrifts prone to lust drunkards and therefore poor and needy Greek hae penia stasin empoiei kai kakourgian for poverty begets sedition and villainy upon all occasions ready to mutiny and rebel discontent still complaining murmuring grudging apt to all outrages thefts treasons murders innovations in debt shifters cozeners outlaws Profligatae famae ac vitae It was an old four hundred ninety nine politician s aphorism They that are poor and bad envy rich hate good men abhor the present government wish for a new and would have all turned topsy turvy When Catiline rebelled in Rome he got a company of such debauched rogues together they were his familiars and coadjutors and such have been your rebels most part in all ages Jack Cade Tom Straw Kette and his companions Where they be generally riotous and contentious where there be many discords many laws many lawsuits many lawyers and many physicians it is a manifest sign of a distempered melancholy state as five hundred Plato long since maintained for where such kind of men swarm they will make more work for themselves and that body politic diseased which was otherwise sound A general mischief in these our times an insensible plague and never so many of them which are now multiplied saith Mat Geraldus five hundred one a lawyer himself as so many locusts not the parents but the plagues of the country and for the most part a supercilious bad covetous litigious generation of men five hundred two Crumenimulga natio c A purse milking nation a clamorous company gowned vultures five hundred three qui ex injuria

tintinabula monstra hominum mangones c that take upon them to make peace but are indeed the very disturbers of our peace a company of irreligious harpies scraping griping catchpoles I mean our common hungry pettifoggers five hundred four rabulas forenses love and honour in the meantime all good laws and worthy lawyers that are so many five hundred five oracles and pilots of a well governed commonwealth Without art without judgment that do more harm as five hundred six Livy said quam bella externa fames morbive than sickness wars hunger diseases and cause a most incredible destruction of a commonwealth saith five hundred seven Sesellius a famous civilian sometimes in Paris as ivy doth by an oak embrace it so long until it hath got the heart out of it so do they by such places they inhabit no counsel at all no justice no speech to be had nisi eum premulseris he must be fed still or else he is as mute as a fish better open an oyster without a knife Experto crede saith five hundred eight Salisburiensis in manus eorum millies incidi et Charon immitis qui nulli pepercit unquam his longe clementior est I speak out of experience I have been a thousand times amongst them and Charon himself is more gentle than they five hundred nine he is contented with his single pay but they multiply still they are never satisfied besides they have damnificas linguas as he terms it nisi funibus argenteis vincias they must be fed to say nothing and five hundred ten get more to hold their peace than we can to say our best They will speak their clients fair and invite them to their tables but as he follows it five hundred eleven of all injustice there is none so pernicious as that of theirs which when they deceive most will seem to be honest men They take upon them to be peacemakers et fovere causas humilium to help them to their right patrocinantur afflictis five hundred twelve but all is for their own good ut loculos pleniorom exhauriant they plead for poor men gratis but they are but as a stale to catch others If there be no jar five hundred thirteen they can make a jar out of the law itself find still some quirk or other to set them at odds and continue causes so long lustra aliquot I know not how many years before the cause is heard and when tis judged and determined by reason of some tricks and errors it is as fresh to begin after twice seven years sometimes as it was at first and so they prolong time delay suits till they have enriched themselves and beggared their clients And as five hundred fourteen Cato inveighed against Isocrates scholars we may justly tax our wrangling lawyers they do consenescere in litibus are so litigious and busy here on earth that I think they will plead their client s causes hereafter some of them in hell five hundred fifteen Simlerus complains amongst the Swissers of the advocates in his time that when they should make an end they began controversies and protract their causes many years persuading them their title is good till their patrimonies be consumed and that they have spent more in seeking than the thing is worth or they shall get by the recovery So that he that goes to law as the proverb is five hundred sixteen holds a wolf by the ears or as a sheep in a storm runs for shelter to a brier if he prosecute his cause he is consumed if he surcease his suit he loseth all five hundred seventeen what difference They had wont heretofore saith Austin to end matters per communes arbitros and so in Switzerland we are informed by five hundred eighteen Simlerus they had some common arbitrators or daysmen in every town that made a friendly composition betwixt man and man and he much wonders at their honest simplicity that could keep peace so well and end such great causes by that means At five hundred nineteen Fez in Africa they have neither lawyers nor advocates but if there be any controversies amongst them both parties plaintiff and defendant come to their Alfakins or chief judge and at once without any farther appeals or pitiful delays the cause is heard and ended Our forefathers as five hundred twenty a worthy chorographer of ours observes had wont pauculis cruculis aureis with a few golden crosses and lines in verse make all conveyances assurances And such was the candour and integrity of succeeding ages that a deed as I have oft seen to convey a whole manor was implicite contained in some twenty lines or thereabouts like that scede or Sytala Laconica so much renowned of old in all contracts which five hundred twenty one Tully so earnestly commends to Atticus Plutarch in his Lysander Aristotle polit Thucydides lib one five hundred twenty two Diodorus and Suidus approve and magnify for that laconic brevity in this kind and well they might for according to five hundred twenty three Tertullian certa sunt paucis there is much more certainty in fewer words And so was it of old throughout but now many skins of parchment will scarce serve turn he that buys and sells a house must have a house full of writings there be so many circumstances so many words such tautological repetitions of all particulars to avoid cavillation they say but we find by our woeful experience that to subtle wits it is a cause of much more contention and variance and scarce any conveyance so accurately penned by one which another will not find a crack in or cavil at if any one word be misplaced any little error all is disannulled That which is a law today is none tomorrow that which is sound in one man s opinion is most faulty to another that in conclusion here is nothing amongst us but contention and confusion we bandy one against another And that which long since five hundred twenty four Plutarch complained of them in Asia may be verified in our times These men here assembled come not to sacrifice to their gods to offer Jupiter their first fruits or merriments to Bacchus but an yearly disease exasperating Asia hath brought them hither to make an end of their controversies and lawsuits Tis multitudo perdentium et pereuntium a destructive rout that seek one another s ruin Such most part are our ordinary suitors termers clients new stirs every day mistakes errors cavils and at this present as I have heard in some one court I know not how many thousand causes no person free no title almost good with such bitterness in following so many slights procrastinations delays forgery such cost for infinite sums are inconsiderately spent violence and malice I know not by whose fault lawyers clients laws both or all but as Paul reprehended the five hundred twenty five Corinthians long since I may more positively infer now There is a fault amongst you and I speak it to your shame Is there not a five hundred twenty six wise man amongst you to judge between his brethren but that a brother goes to law with a brother And five hundred twenty seven Christ s counsel concerning lawsuits was never so fit to be inculcated as in this age five hundred twenty eight Agree with thine adversary quickly c Matth v twenty five I could repeat many such particular grievances which must disturb a body politic To shut up all in brief where good government is prudent and wise princes there all things thrive and prosper peace and happiness is in that land where it is otherwise all things are ugly to behold incult barbarous uncivil a paradise is turned to a wilderness This island amongst the rest our next neighbours the French and Germans may be a sufficient witness that in a short time by that prudent policy of the Romans was brought from barbarism see but what Caesar reports of us and Tacitus of those old Germans they were once as uncivil as they in Virginia yet by planting of colonies and good laws they became from barbarous outlaws five hundred twenty nine to be full of rich and populous cities as now they are and most flourishing kingdoms Even so might Virginia and those wild Irish have been civilised long since if that order had been heretofore taken which now begins of planting colonies c I have read a five hundred thirty discourse printed anno sixteen twelve Discovering the true causes why Ireland was never entirely subdued or brought under obedience to the crown of England until the beginning of his Majesty s happy reign Yet if his reasons were thoroughly scanned by a judicious politician I am afraid he would not altogether be approved but that it would turn to the dishonour of our nation to suffer it to lie so long waste Yea and if some travellers should see to come nearer home those rich united provinces of Holland Zealand c over against us those neat cities and populous towns full of most industrious artificers five hundred thirty one so much land recovered from the sea and so painfully preserved by those artificial inventions so wonderfully approved as that of Bemster in Holland ut nihil huic par aut simile invenias in toto orbe saith Bertius the geographer all the world cannot match it five hundred thirty two so many navigable channels from place to place made by men s hands c and on the other side so many thousand acres of our fens lie drowned our cities thin and those vile poor and ugly to behold in respect of theirs our trades decayed our still running rivers stopped and that beneficial use of transportation wholly neglected so many havens void of ships and towns so many parks and forests for pleasure barren heaths so many villages depopulated c I think sure he would find some fault I may not deny but that this nation of ours doth bene audire apud exteros is a most noble a most flourishing kingdom by common consent of all five hundred thirty three geographers historians politicians tis unica velut arx five hundred thirty four and which Quintius in Livy said of the inhabitants of Peloponnesus may be well applied to us we are testudines testa sua inclusi like so many tortoises in our shells safely defended by an angry sea as a wall on all sides Our island hath many such honourable eulogiums and as a learned countryman of ours right well hath it five hundred thirty five Ever since the Normans first coming into England this country both for military matters and all other of civility hath been paralleled with the most flourishing kingdoms of Europe and our Christian world a blessed a rich country and one of the fortunate isles and for some things five hundred thirty six preferred before other countries for expert seamen our laborious discoveries art of navigation true merchants they carry the bell away from all other nations even the Portugals and Hollanders themselves five hundred thirty seven without all fear saith Boterus furrowing the ocean winter and summer and two of their captains with no less valour than fortune have sailed round about the world five hundred thirty eight We have besides many particular blessings which our neighbours want the Gospel truly preached church discipline established long peace and quietness free from exactions foreign fears invasions domestical seditions well manured five hundred thirty nine fortified by art and nature and now most happy in that fortunate union of England and Scotland which our forefathers have laboured to effect and desired to see But in which we excel all others a wise learned religious king another Numa a second Augustus a true Josiah most worthy senators a learned clergy an obedient commonalty c Yet amongst many roses some thistles grow some bad weeds and enormities which much disturb the peace of this body politic eclipse the honour and glory of it fit to be rooted out and with all speed to be reformed The first is idleness by reason of which we have many swarms of rogues and beggars thieves drunkards and discontented persons whom Lycurgus in Plutarch calls morbos reipublicae the boils of the commonwealth many poor people in all our towns Civitates ignobiles as five hundred forty Polydore calls them base built cities inglorious poor small rare in sight ruinous and thin of inhabitants Our land is fertile we may not deny full of all good things and why doth it not then abound with cities as well as Italy France Germany the Low Countries because their policy hath been otherwise and we are not so thrifty circumspect industrious Idleness is the malus genius of our nation For as five hundred forty one Boterus justly argues fertility of a country is not enough except art and industry be joined unto it according to Aristotle riches are either natural or artificial natural are good land fair mines c artificial are manufactures coins c Many kingdoms are fertile but thin of inhabitants as that Duchy of Piedmont in Italy which Leander Albertus so much magnifies for corn wine fruits c yet nothing near so populous as those which are more barren five hundred forty two England saith he London only excepted hath never a populous city and yet a fruitful country I find forty six cities and walled towns in Alsatia a small province in Germany fifty castles an infinite number of villages no ground idle no not rocky places or tops of hills are untilled as five hundred forty three Munster informeth us In five hundred forty four Greichgea a small territory on the Necker twenty four Italian miles over I read of twenty walled towns innumerable villages each one containing one hundred fifty houses most part besides castles and noblemen s palaces I observe in five hundred forty five Turinge in Dutchland twelve miles over by their scale twelve counties and in them one hundred forty four cities two thousand villages one hundred forty four towns two hundred fifty castles In five hundred forty six Bavaria thirty four cities forty six towns c five hundred forty seven Portugallia interamnis a small plot of ground hath fourteen sixty parishes one hundred thirty monasteries two hundred bridges Malta a barren island yields twenty thousand inhabitants But of all the rest I admire Lues Guicciardine s relations of the Low Countries Holland hath twenty six cities four hundred great villages Zealand ten cities one hundred two parishes Brabant twenty six cities one hundred two parishes Flanders twenty eight cities ninety towns eleven fifty four villages besides abbeys castles c The Low Countries generally have three cities at least for one of ours and those far more populous and rich and what is the cause but their industry and excellency in all manner of trades Their commerce which is maintained by a multitude of tradesmen so many excellent channels made by art and opportune havens to which they build their cities all which we have in like measure or at least may have But their chiefest loadstone which draws all manner of commerce and merchandise which maintains their present estate is not fertility of soil but industry that enricheth them the gold mines of Peru or Nova Hispania may not compare with them They have neither gold nor silver of their own wine nor oil or scarce any corn growing in those united provinces little or no wood tin lead iron silk wool any stuff almost or metal and yet Hungary Transylvania that brag of their mines fertile England cannot compare with them I dare boldly say that neither France Tarentum Apulia Lombardy or any part of Italy Valentia in Spain or that pleasant Andalusia with their excellent fruits wine and oil two harvests no not any part of Europe is so flourishing so rich so populous so full of good ships of well built cities so abounding with all things necessary for the use of man Tis our Indies an epitome of China and all by reason of their industry good policy and commerce Industry is a loadstone to draw all good things that alone makes countries flourish cities populous five hundred forty eight and will enforce by reason of much manure which necessarily follows a barren soil to be fertile and good as sheep saith five hundred forty nine Dion mend a bad pasture Tell me politicians why is that fruitful Palestina noble Greece Egypt Asia Minor so much decayed and mere carcases now fallen from that they were The ground is the same but the government is altered the people are grown slothful idle their good husbandry policy and industry is decayed Non fatigata aut effaeta humus as five hundred fifty Columella well informs Sylvinus sed nostra fit inertia c May a man believe that which Aristotle in his politics Pausanias Stephanus Sophianus Gerbelius relate of old Greece I find heretofore seventy cities in Epirus overthrown by Paulus Aemilius a goodly province in times past five hundred fifty one now left desolate of good towns and almost inhabitants Sixty two cities in Macedonia in Strabo s time I find thirty in Laconia but now scarce so many villages saith Gerbelius If any man from Mount Taygetus should view the country round about and see tot delicias tot urbes per Peloponesum dispersas so many delicate and brave built cities with such cost and exquisite cunning so neatly set out in Peloponnesus five hundred fifty two he should perceive them now ruinous and overthrown burnt waste desolate and laid level with the ground Incredibile dictu c And as he laments Quis talia fando Temperet a lachrymis Quis tam durus aut ferreus so he prosecutes it five hundred fifty three Who is he that can sufficiently condole and commiserate these ruins Where are those four thousand cities of Egypt those one hundred cities in Crete Are they now come to two What saith Pliny and Aelian of old Italy There were in former ages eleven sixty six cities Blondus and Machiavel both grant them now nothing near so populous and full of good towns as in the time of Augustus for now Leander Albertus can find but three hundred at most and if we may give credit to five hundred fifty four Livy not then so strong and puissant as of old They mustered seventy Legions in former times which now the known world will scarce yield Alexander built seventy cities in a short space for his part our sultans and Turks demolish twice as many and leave all desolate Many will not believe but that our island of Great Britain is now more populous than ever it was yet let them read Bede Leland and others they shall find it most flourished in the Saxon Heptarchy and in the Conqueror s time was far better inhabited than at this present See that Doomsday Book and show me those thousands of parishes which are now decayed cities ruined villages depopulated c The lesser the territory is commonly the richer it is Parvus sed bene cultus ager As those Athenian Lacedaemonian Arcadian Aelian Sycionian Messenian c commonwealths of Greece make ample proof as those imperial cities and free states of Germany may witness those Cantons of Switzers Rheti Grisons Walloons Territories of Tuscany Luke and Senes of old Piedmont Mantua Venice in Italy Ragusa c That prince therefore as five hundred fifty five Boterus adviseth that will have a rich country and fair cities let him get good trades privileges painful inhabitants artificers and suffer no rude matter unwrought as tin iron wool lead c to be transported out of his country five hundred fifty six a thing in part seriously attempted amongst us but not effected And because industry of men and multitude of trade so much avails to the ornament and enriching of a kingdom those ancient five hundred fifty seven Massilians would admit no man into their city that had not some trade Selym the first Turkish emperor procured a thousand good artificers to be brought from Tauris to Constantinople The Polanders indented with Henry Duke of Anjou their new chosen king to bring with him an hundred families of artificers into Poland James the first in Scotland as five hundred fifty eight Buchanan writes sent for the best artificers he could get in Europe and gave them great rewards to teach his subjects their several trades Edward the Third our most renowned king to his eternal memory brought clothing first into this island transporting some families of artificers from Gaunt hither How many goodly cities could I reckon up that thrive wholly by trade where thousands of inhabitants live singular well by their fingers ends As Florence in Italy by making cloth of gold great Milan by silk and all curious works Arras in Artois by those fair hangings many cities in Spain many in France Germany have none other maintenance especially those within the land five hundred fifty nine Mecca in Arabia Petraea stands in a most unfruitful country that wants water amongst the rocks as Vertomannus describes it and yet it is a most elegant and pleasant city by reason of the traffic of the east and west Ormus in Persia is a most famous mart town hath nought else but the opportunity of the haven to make it flourish Corinth a noble city Lumen Greciae Tully calls it the Eye of Greece by reason of Cenchreas and Lecheus those excellent ports drew all that traffic of the Ionian and Aegean seas to it and yet the country about it was curva et superciliosa as five hundred sixty Strabo terms it rugged and harsh We may say the same of Athens Actium Thebes Sparta and most of those towns in Greece Nuremberg in Germany is sited in a most barren soil yet a noble imperial city by the sole industry of artificers and cunning trades they draw the riches of most countries to them so expert in manufactures that as Sallust long since gave out of the like Sedem animae in extremis digitis habent their soul or intellectus agens was placed in their fingers end and so we may say of Basil Spire Cambray Frankfurt c It is almost incredible to speak what some write of Mexico and the cities adjoining to it no place in the world at their first discovery more populous five hundred sixty one Mat Riccius the Jesuit and some others relate of the industry of the Chinese most populous countries not a beggar or an idle person to be seen and how by that means they prosper and flourish We have the same means able bodies pliant wits matter of all sorts wool flax iron tin lead wood c many excellent subjects to work upon only industry is wanting We send our best commodities beyond the seas which they make good use of to their necessities set themselves a work about and severally improve sending the same to us back at dear rates or else make toys and baubles of the tails of them which they sell to us again at as great a reckoning as the whole In most of our cities some few excepted like five hundred sixty two Spanish loiterers we live wholly by tippling inns and alehouses Malting are their best ploughs their greatest traffic to sell ale five hundred sixty three Meteran and some others object to us that we are no whit so industrious as the Hollanders Manual trades saith he which are more curious or troublesome are wholly exercised by strangers they dwell in a sea full of fish but they are so idle they will not catch so much as shall serve their own turns but buy it of their neighbours Tush five hundred sixty four Mare liberum they fish under our noses and sell it to us when they have done at their own prices Pudet haec opprobria nobis Et dici potuisse et non potuisse refelli I am ashamed to hear this objected by strangers and know not how to answer it Amongst our towns there is only five hundred sixty five London that bears the face of a city five hundred sixty six Epitome Britanniae a famous emporium second to none beyond seas a noble mart but sola crescit decrescentibus aliis and yet in my slender judgment defective in many things The rest five hundred sixty seven some few excepted are in mean estate ruinous most part poor and full of beggars by reason of their decayed trades neglected or bad policy idleness of their inhabitants riot which had rather beg or loiter and be ready to starve than work I cannot deny but that something may be said in defence of our cities five hundred sixty eight that they are not so fair built for the sole magnificence of this kingdom concerning buildings hath been of old in those Norman castles and religious houses so rich thick sited populous as in some other countries besides the reasons Cardan gives Subtil Lib eleven we want wine and oil their two harvests we dwell in a colder air and for that cause must a little more liberally five hundred sixty nine feed of flesh as all northern countries do our provisions will not therefore extend to the maintenance of so many yet notwithstanding we have matter of all sorts an open sea for traffic as well as the rest goodly havens And how can we excuse our negligence our riot drunkenness c and such enormities that follow it We have excellent laws enacted you will say severe statutes houses of correction c to small purpose it seems it is not houses will serve but cities of correction five hundred seventy our trades generally ought to be reformed wants supplied In other countries they have the same grievances I confess but that doth not excuse us five hundred seventy one wants defects enormities idle drones tumults discords contention lawsuits many laws made against them to repress those innumerable brawls and lawsuits excess in apparel diet decay of tillage depopulations five hundred seventy two especially against rogues beggars Egyptian vagabonds so termed at least which have five hundred seventy three swarmed all over Germany France Italy Poland as you may read in five hundred seventy four Munster Cranzius and Aventinus as those Tartars and Arabians at this day do in the eastern countries yet such has been the iniquity of all ages as it seems to small purpose Nemo in nostra civitate mendicus esto five hundred seventy five saith Plato he will have them purged from a five hundred seventy six commonwealth five hundred seventy seven as a bad humour from the body that are like so many ulcers and boils and must be cured before the melancholy body can be eased What Carolus Magnus the Chinese the Spaniards the duke of Saxony and many other states have decreed in this case read Arniseus cap nineteen Boterus libro eight cap two Osorius de Rubus gest Eman lib eleven When a country is overstocked with people as a pasture is oft overlaid with cattle they had wont in former times to disburden themselves by sending out colonies or by wars as those old Romans or by employing them at home about some public buildings as bridges roadways for which those Romans were famous in this island as Augustus Caesar did in Rome the Spaniards in their Indian mines as at Potosi in Peru where some thirty thousand men are still at work six thousand furnaces ever boiling c five hundred seventy eight aqueducts bridges havens those stupend works of Trajan Claudius at five hundred seventy nine Ostium Dioclesiani Therma Fucinus Lacus that Piraeum in Athens made by Themistocles ampitheatrums of curious marble as at Verona Civitas Philippi and Heraclea in Thrace those Appian and Flaminian ways prodigious works all may witness and rather than they should be five hundred eighty idle as those five hundred eighty one Egyptian Pharaohs Maris and Sesostris did to task their subjects to build unnecessary pyramids obelisks labyrinths channels lakes gigantic works all to divert them from rebellion riot drunkenness five hundred eighty two Quo scilicet alantur et ne vagando laborare desuescant Another eyesore is that want of conduct and navigable rivers a great blemish as five hundred eighty three Boterus five hundred eighty four Hippolitus a Collibus and other politicians hold if it be neglected in a commonwealth Admirable cost and charge is bestowed in the Low Countries on this behalf in the duchy of Milan territory of Padua in five hundred eighty five France Italy China and so likewise about corrivations of water to moisten and refresh barren grounds to drain fens bogs and moors Massinissa made many inward parts of Barbary and Numidia in Africa before his time incult and horrid fruitful and bartable by this means Great industry is generally used all over the eastern countries in this kind especially in Egypt about Babylon and Damascus as Vertomannus and five hundred eighty six Gotardus Arthus relate about Barcelona Segovia Murcia and many other places of Spain Milan in Italy by reason of which their soil is much impoverished and infinite commodities arise to the inhabitants The Turks of late attempted to cut that Isthmus betwixt Africa and Asia which five hundred eighty seven Sesostris and Darius and some Pharaohs of Egypt had formerly undertaken but with ill success as five hundred eighty eight Diodorus Siculus records and Pliny for that Red Sea being three five hundred eighty nine cubits higher than Egypt would have drowned all the country caepto destiterant they left off yet as the same five hundred ninety Diodorus writes Ptolemy renewed the work many years after and absolved in it a more opportune place That Isthmus of Corinth was likewise undertaken to be made navigable by Demetrius by Julius Caesar Nero Domitian Herodes Atticus to make a speedy five hundred ninety one passage and less dangerous from the Ionian and Aegean seas but because it could not be so well effected the Peloponnesians built a wall like our Picts wall about Schaenute where Neptune s temple stood and in the shortest cut over the Isthmus of which Diodorus lib eleven Herodotus lib eight Uran Our latter writers call it Hexamilium which Amurath the Turk demolished the Venetians anno fourteen fifty three repaired in fifteen days with thirty thousand men Some saith Acosta would have a passage cut from Panama to Nombre de Dios in America but Thuanus and Serres the French historians speak of a famous aqueduct in France intended in Henry the Fourth s time from the Loire to the Seine and from Rhodanus to the Loire The like to which was formerly assayed by Domitian the emperor five hundred ninety two from Arar to Moselle which Cornelius Tacitus speaks of in the thirteen of his annals after by Charles the Great and others Much cost hath in former times been bestowed in either new making or mending channels of rivers and their passages as Aurelianus did by Tiber to make it navigable to Rome to convey corn from Egypt to the city vadum alvei tumentis effodit saith Vopiscus et Tiberis ripas extruxit he cut fords made banks c decayed havens which Claudius the emperor with infinite pains and charges attempted at Ostia as I have said the Venetians at this day to preserve their city many excellent means to enrich their territories have been fostered invented in most provinces of Europe as planting some Indian plants amongst us silkworms five hundred ninety three the very mulberry leaves in the plains of Granada yield thirty thousand crowns per annum to the king of Spain s coffers besides those many trades and artificers that are busied about them in the kingdom of Granada Murcia and all over Spain In France a great benefit is raised by salt c whether these things might not be as happily attempted with us and with like success it may be controverted silkworms I mean vines fir trees c Cardan exhorts Edward the Sixth to plant olives and is fully persuaded they would prosper in this island With us navigable rivers are most part neglected our streams are not great I confess by reason of the narrowness of the island yet they run smoothly and even not headlong swift or amongst rocks and shelves as foaming Rhodanus and Loire in France Tigris in Mesopotamia violent Durius in Spain with cataracts and whirlpools as the Rhine and Danubius about Shaffausen Lausenburgh Linz and Cremmes to endanger navigators or broad shallow as Neckar in the Palatinate Tibris in Italy but calm and fair as Arar in France Hebrus in Macedonia Eurotas in Laconia they gently glide along and might as well be repaired many of them I mean Wye Trent Ouse Thamisis at Oxford the defect of which we feel in the mean time as the river of Lee from Ware to London B Atwater of old or as some will Henry I five hundred ninety four made a channel from Trent to Lincoln navigable which now saith mister Camden is decayed and much mention is made of anchors and such like monuments found about old five hundred ninety five Verulamium good ships have formerly come to Exeter and many such places whose channels havens ports are now barred and rejected We contemn this benefit of carriage by waters and are therefore compelled in the inner parts of this island because portage is so dear to eat up our commodities ourselves and live like so many boars in a sty for want of vent and utterance We have many excellent havens royal havens Falmouth Portsmouth Milford c equivalent if not to be preferred to that Indian Havana old Brundusium in Italy Aulis in Greece Ambracia in Acarnia Suda in Crete which have few ships in them little or no traffic or trade which have scarce a village on them able to bear great cities sed viderint politici I could here justly tax many other neglects abuses errors defects among us and in other countries depopulations riot drunkenness c and many such quae nunc in aurem susurrare non libet But I must take heed ne quid gravius dicam that I do not overshoot myself Sus Minervam I am forth of my element as you peradventure suppose and sometimes veritas odium parit as he said verjuice and oatmeal is good for a parrot For as Lucian said of an historian I say of a politician He that will freely speak and write must be for ever no subject under no prince or law but lay out the matter truly as it is not caring what any can will like or dislike We have good laws I deny not to rectify such enormities and so in all other countries but it seems not always to good purpose We had need of some general visitor in our age that should reform what is amiss a just army of Rosy cross men for they will amend all matters they say religion policy manners with arts sciences c Another Attila Tamerlane Hercules to strive with Achelous Augeae stabulum purgare to subdue tyrants as five hundred ninety six he did Diomedes and Busiris to expel thieves as he did Cacus and Lacinius to vindicate poor captives as he did Hesione to pass the torrid zone the deserts of Libya and purge the world of monsters and Centaurs or another Theban Crates to reform our manners to compose quarrels and controversies as in his time he did and was therefore adored for a god in Athens As Hercules five hundred ninety seven purged the world of monsters and subdued them so did he fight against envy lust anger avarice c and all those feral vices and monsters of the mind It were to be wished we had some such visitor or if wishing would serve one had such a ring or rings as Timolaus desired in five hundred ninety eight Lucian by virtue of which he should be as strong as ten thousand men or an army of giants go invisible open gates and castle doors have what treasure he would transport himself in an instant to what place he desired alter affections cure all manner of diseases that he might range over the world and reform all distressed states and persons as he would himself He might reduce those wandering Tartars in order that infest China on the one side Muscovy Poland on the other and tame the vagabond Arabians that rob and spoil those eastern countries that they should never use more caravans or janissaries to conduct them He might root out barbarism out of America and fully discover Terra Australis Incognita find out the north east and north west passages drain those mighty Maeotian fens cut down those vast Hircinian woods irrigate those barren Arabian deserts c cure us of our epidemical diseases scorbutum plica morbus Neapolitanus c end all our idle controversies cut off our tumultuous desires inordinate lusts root out atheism impiety heresy schism and superstition which now so crucify the world catechise gross ignorance purge Italy of luxury and riot Spain of superstition and jealousy Germany of drunkenness all our northern country of gluttony and intemperance castigate our hard hearted parents masters tutors lash disobedient children negligent servants correct these spendthrifts and prodigal sons enforce idle persons to work drive drunkards off the alehouse repress thieves visit corrupt and tyrannizing magistrates c But as L Licinius taxed Timolaus you may us These are vain absurd and ridiculous wishes not to be hoped all must be as it is five hundred ninety nine Bocchalinus may cite commonwealths to come before Apollo and seek to reform the world itself by commissioners but there is no remedy it may not be redressed desinent homines tum demum stultescere quando esse desinent so long as they can wag their beards they will play the knaves and fools Because therefore it is a thing so difficult impossible and far beyond Hercules labours to be performed let them be rude stupid ignorant incult lapis super lapidem sedeat and as the six hundred apologist will resp tussi et graveolentia laboret mundus vitio let them be barbarous as they are let them six hundred one tyrannise epicurise oppress luxuriate consume themselves with factions superstitions lawsuits wars and contentions live in riot poverty want misery rebel wallow as so many swine in their own dung with Ulysses companions stultos jubeo esse libenter I will yet to satisfy and please myself make an Utopia of mine own a new Atlantis a poetical commonwealth of mine own in which I will freely domineer build cities make laws statutes as I list myself And why may I not six hundred two Pictoribus atque poetis c You know what liberty poets ever had and besides my predecessor Democritus was a politician a recorder of Abdera a law maker as some say and why may not I presume so much as he did Howsoever I will adventure For the site if you will needs urge me to it I am not fully resolved it may be in Terra Australi Incognita there is room enough for of my knowledge neither that hungry Spaniard six hundred three nor Mercurius Britannicus have yet discovered half of it or else one of these floating islands in Mare del Zur which like the Cyanian isles in the Euxine sea alter their place and are accessible only at set times and to some few persons or one of the fortunate isles for who knows yet where or which they are there is room enough in the inner parts of America and northern coasts of Asia But I will choose a site whose latitude shall be forty five degrees I respect not minutes in the midst of the temperate zone or perhaps under the equator that six hundred four paradise of the world ubi semper virens laurus c where is a perpetual spring the longitude for some reasons I will conceal Yet be it known to all men by these presents that if any honest gentleman will send in so much money as Cardan allows an astrologer for casting a nativity he shall be a sharer I will acquaint him with my project or if any worthy man will stand for any temporal or spiritual office or dignity for as he said of his archbishopric of Utopia tis sanctus ambitus and not amiss to be sought after it shall be freely given without all intercessions bribes letters c his own worth shall be the best spokesman and because we shall admit of no deputies or advowsons if he be sufficiently qualified and as able as willing to execute the place himself be shall have present possession It shall be divided into twelve or thirteen provinces and those by hills rivers roadways or some more eminent limits exactly bounded Each province shall have a metropolis which shall be so placed as a centre almost in a circumference and the rest at equal distances some twelve Italian miles asunder or thereabout and in them shall be sold all things necessary for the use of man statis horis et diebus no market towns markets or fairs for they do but beggar cities no village shall stand above six seven or eight miles from a city except those emporiums which are by the sea side general staples marts as Antwerp Venice Bergen of old London c cities most part shall be situated upon navigable rivers or lakes creeks havens and for their form regular round square or long square six hundred five with fair broad and straight six hundred six streets houses uniform built of brick and stone like Bruges Brussels Rhegium Lepidi Berne in Switzerland Milan Mantua Crema Cambalu in Tartary described by M Polus or that Venetian Palma I will admit very few or no suburbs and those of baser building walls only to keep out man and horse except it be in some frontier towns or by the sea side and those to be fortified six hundred seven after the latest manner of fortification and situated upon convenient havens or opportune places In every so built city I will have convenient churches and separate places to bury the dead in not in churchyards a citadella in some not all to command it prisons for offenders opportune market places of all sorts for corn meat cattle fuel fish commodious courts of justice public halls for all societies bourses meeting places armouries six hundred eight in which shall be kept engines for quenching of fire artillery gardens public walks theatres and spacious fields allotted for all gymnastic sports and honest recreations hospitals of all kinds for children orphans old folks sick men mad men soldiers pest houses c not built precario or by gouty benefactors who when by fraud and rapine they have extorted all their lives oppressed whole provinces societies c give something to pious uses build a satisfactory alms house school or bridge c at their last end or before perhaps which is no otherwise than to steal a goose and stick down a feather rob a thousand to relieve ten and those hospitals so built and maintained not by collections benevolences donaries for a set number as in ours just so many and no more at such a rate but for all those who stand in need be they more or less and that ex publico aerario and so still maintained non nobis solum nati sumus c I will have conduits of sweet and good water aptly disposed in each town common six hundred nine granaries as at Dresden in Misnia Stetein in Pomerland Noremberg c Colleges of mathematicians musicians and actors as of old at Labedum in Ionia six hundred ten alchemists physicians artists and philosophers that all arts and sciences may sooner be perfected and better learned and public historiographers as amongst those ancient six hundred eleven Persians qui in commentarios referebant quae memoratu digna gerebantur informed and appointed by the state to register all famous acts and not by each insufficient scribbler partial or parasitical pedant as in our times I will provide public schools of all kinds singing dancing fencing c especially of grammar and languages not to be taught by those tedious precepts ordinarily used but by use example conversation six hundred twelve as travellers learn abroad and nurses teach their children as I will have all such places so will I ordain six hundred thirteen public governors fit officers to each place treasurers aediles quaestors overseers of pupils widows goods and all public houses c and those once a year to make strict accounts of all receipts expenses to avoid confusion et sic fiet ut non absumant as Pliny to Trajan quad pudeat dicere They shall be subordinate to those higher officers and governors of each city which shall not be poor tradesmen and mean artificers but noblemen and gentlemen which shall be tied to residence in those towns they dwell next at such set times and seasons for I see no reason which six hundred fourteen Hippolitus complains of that it should be more dishonourable for noblemen to govern the city than the country or unseemly to dwell there now than of old six hundred fifteen I will have no bogs fens marshes vast woods deserts heaths commons but all enclosed yet not depopulated and therefore take heed you mistake me not for that which is common and every man s is no man s the richest countries are still enclosed as Essex Kent with us c Spain Italy and where enclosures are least in quantity they are best six hundred sixteen husbanded as about Florence in Italy Damascus in Syria c which are liker gardens than fields I will not have a barren acre in all my territories not so much as the tops of mountains where nature fails it shall be supplied by art six hundred seventeen lakes and rivers shall not be left desolate All common highways bridges banks corrivations of waters aqueducts channels public works buildings c out of a six hundred eighteen common stock curiously maintained and kept in repair no depopulations engrossings alterations of wood arable but by the consent of some supervisors that shall be appointed for that purpose to see what reformation ought to be had in all places what is amiss how to help it et quid quaeque ferat regio et quid quaeque recuset what ground is aptest for wood what for corn what for cattle gardens orchards fishponds c with a charitable division in every village not one domineering house greedily to swallow up all which is too common with us what for lords six hundred nineteen what for tenants and because they shall be better encouraged to improve such lands they hold manure plant trees drain fence c they shall have long leases a known rent and known fine to free them from those intolerable exactions of tyrannizing landlords These supervisors shall likewise appoint what quantity of land in each manor is fit for the lord s demesnes six hundred twenty what for holding of tenants how it ought to be husbanded ut six hundred twenty one magnetis equis Minyae gens cognita remis how to be manured tilled rectified six hundred twenty two hic segetes veniunt illic felicius uvae arborei foetus alibi atque injussa virescunt Gramina and what proportion is fit for all callings because private professors are many times idiots ill husbands oppressors covetous and know not how to improve their own or else wholly respect their own and not public good Utopian parity is a kind of government to be wished for six hundred twenty three rather than effected Respub Christianopolitana Campanella s city of the Sun and that new Atlantis witty fictions but mere chimeras and Plato s community in many things is impious absurd and ridiculous it takes away all splendour and magnificence I will have several orders degrees of nobility and those hereditary not rejecting younger brothers in the mean time for they shall be sufficiently provided for by pensions or so qualified brought up in some honest calling they shall be able to live of themselves I will have such a proportion of ground belonging to every barony he that buys the land shall buy the barony he that by riot consumes his patrimony and ancient demesnes shall forfeit his honours six hundred twenty four As some dignities shall be hereditary so some again by election or by gift besides free officers pensions annuities like our bishoprics prebends the Bassa s palaces in Turkey the six hundred twenty five procurator s houses and offices in Venice which like the golden apple shall be given to the worthiest and best deserving both in war and peace as a reward of their worth and good service as so many goals for all to aim at honos alit artes and encouragements to others For I hate these severe unnatural harsh German French and Venetian decrees which exclude plebeians from honours be they never so wise rich virtuous valiant and well qualified they must not be patricians but keep their own rank this is naturae bellum inferre odious to God and men I abhor it My form of government shall be monarchical six hundred twenty six nunquam libertas gratior extat Quam sub Rege pio c few laws but those severely kept plainly put down and in the mother tongue that every man may understand Every city shall have a peculiar trade or privilege by which it shall be chiefly maintained six hundred twenty seven and parents shall teach their children one of three at least bring up and instruct them in the mysteries of their own trade In each town these several tradesmen shall be so aptly disposed as they shall free the rest from danger or offence fire trades as smiths forge men brewers bakers metal men c shall dwell apart by themselves dyers tanners fellmongers and such as use water in convenient places by themselves noisome or fulsome for bad smells as butchers slaughterhouses chandlers curriers in remote places and some back lanes Fraternities and companies I approve of as merchants bourses colleges of druggists physicians musicians c but all trades to be rated in the sale of wares as our clerks of the market do bakers and brewers corn itself what scarcity soever shall come not to extend such a price Of such wares as are transported or brought in six hundred twenty eight if they be necessary commodious and such as nearly concern man s life as corn wood coal c and such provision we cannot want I will have little or no custom paid no taxes but for such things as are for pleasure delight or ornament as wine spice tobacco silk velvet cloth of gold lace jewels c a greater impost I will have certain ships sent out for new discoveries every year six hundred twenty nine and some discreet men appointed to travel into all neighbouring kingdoms by land which shall observe what artificial inventions and good laws are in other countries customs alterations or aught else concerning war or peace which may tend to the common good Ecclesiastical discipline penes Episcopos subordinate as the other No impropriations no lay patrons of church livings or one private man but common societies corporations c and those rectors of benefices to be chosen out of the Universities examined and approved as the literati in China No parish to contain above a thousand auditors If it were possible I would have such priest as should imitate Christ charitable lawyers should love their neighbours as themselves temperate and modest physicians politicians contemn the world philosophers should know themselves noblemen live honestly tradesmen leave lying and cozening magistrates corruption c but this is impossible I must get such as I may I will therefore have six hundred thirty of lawyers judges advocates physicians chirurgeons c a set number six hundred thirty one and every man if it be possible to plead his own cause to tell that tale to the judge which he doth to his advocate as at Fez in Africa Bantam Aleppo Ragusa suam quisque causam dicere tenetur Those advocates chirurgeons and six hundred thirty two physicians which are allowed to be maintained out of the six hundred thirty three common treasury no fees to be given or taken upon pain of losing their places or if they do very small fees and when the six hundred thirty four cause is fully ended six hundred thirty five He that sues any man shall put in a pledge which if it be proved he hath wrongfully sued his adversary rashly or maliciously he shall forfeit and lose Or else before any suit begin the plaintiff shall have his complaint approved by a set delegacy to that purpose if it be of moment he shall be suffered as before to proceed if otherwise they shall determine it All causes shall be pleaded suppresso nomine the parties names concealed if some circumstances do not otherwise require Judges and other officers shall be aptly disposed in each province villages cities as common arbitrators to hear causes and end all controversies and those not single but three at least on the bench at once to determine or give sentence and those again to sit by turns or lots and not to continue still in the same office No controversy to depend above a year but without all delays and further appeals to be speedily despatched and finally concluded in that time allotted These and all other inferior magistrates to be chosen six hundred thirty six as the literati in China or by those exact suffrages of the six hundred thirty seven Venetians and such again not to be eligible or capable of magistracies honours offices except they be sufficiently six hundred thirty eight qualified for learning manners and that by the strict approbation of deputed examiners six hundred thirty nine first scholars to take place then soldiers for I am of Vigetius his opinion a scholar deserves better than a soldier because Unius aetatis sunt quae fortiter fiunt quae vero pro utilitate Reipub scribuntur aeterna a soldier s work lasts for an age a scholar s for ever If they six hundred forty misbehave themselves they shall be deposed and accordingly punished and whether their offices be annual six hundred forty one or otherwise once a year they shall be called in question and give an account for men are partial and passionate merciless covetous corrupt subject to love hate fear favour c omne sub regno graviore regnum like Solon s Areopagites or those Roman Censors some shall visit others and six hundred forty two be visited invicem themselves six hundred forty three they shall oversee that no prowling officer under colour of authority shall insult over his inferiors as so many wild beasts oppress domineer flea grind or trample on be partial or corrupt but that there be aequabile jus justice equally done live as friends and brethren together and which six hundred forty four Sesellius would have and so much desires in his kingdom of France a diapason and sweet harmony of kings princes nobles and plebeians so mutually tied and involved in love as well as laws and authority as that they never disagree insult or encroach one upon another If any man deserve well in his office he shall be rewarded quis enim virtutem amplectitur ipsam Proemia si tollas six hundred forty five He that invents anything for public good in any art or science writes a treatise six hundred forty six or performs any noble exploit at home or abroad six hundred forty seven shall be accordingly enriched six hundred forty eight honoured and preferred I say with Hannibal in Ennius Hostem qui feriet erit mihi Carthaginensis let him be of what condition he will in all offices actions he that deserves best shall have best Tilianus in Philonius out of a charitable mind no doubt wished all his books were gold and silver jewels and precious stones six hundred forty nine to redeem captives set free prisoners and relieve all poor distressed souls that wanted means religiously done I deny not but to what purpose Suppose this were so well done within a little after though a man had Croesus wealth to bestow there would be as many more Wherefore I will suffer no six hundred fifty beggars rogues vagabonds or idle persons at all that cannot give an account of their lives how they six hundred fifty one maintain themselves If they be impotent lame blind and single they shall be sufficiently maintained in several hospitals built for that purpose if married and infirm past work or by inevitable loss or some such like misfortune cast behind by distribution of six hundred fifty two corn house rent free annual pensions or money they shall be relieved and highly rewarded for their good service they have formerly done if able they shall be enforced to work six hundred fifty three For I see no reason as six hundred fifty four he said why an epicure or idle drone a rich glutton a usurer should live at ease and do nothing live in honour in all manner of pleasures and oppress others when as in the meantime a poor labourer a smith a carpenter an husbandman that hath spent his time in continual labour as an ass to carry burdens to do the commonwealth good and without whom we cannot live shall be left in his old age to beg or starve and lead a miserable life worse than a jument As six hundred fifty five all conditions shall be tied to their task so none shall be overtired but have their set times of recreations and holidays indulgere genio feasts and merry meetings even to the meanest artificer or basest servant once a week to sing or dance though not all at once or do whatsoever he shall please like six hundred fifty six that Saccarum festum amongst the Persians those Saturnals in Rome as well as his master six hundred fifty seven If any be drunk he shall drink no more wine or strong drink in a twelvemonth after A bankrupt shall be six hundred fifty eight Catademiatus in Amphitheatro publicly shamed and he that cannot pay his debts if by riot or negligence he have been impoverished shall be for a twelvemonth imprisoned if in that space his creditors be not satisfied six hundred fifty nine he shall be hanged He six hundred sixty that commits sacrilege shall lose his hands he that bears false witness or is of perjury convicted shall have his tongue cut out except he redeem it with his head Murder six hundred sixty one adultery shall be punished by death six hundred sixty two but not theft except it be some more grievous offence or notorious offenders otherwise they shall be condemned to the galleys mines be his slaves whom they have offended during their lives I hate all hereditary slaves and that duram Persarum legem as six hundred sixty three Brisonius calls it or as six hundred sixty four Ammianus impendio formidatas et abominandas leges per quas ob noxam unius omnis propinquitas perit hard law that wife and children friends and allies should suffer for the father s offence No man shall marry until he six hundred sixty five be twenty five no woman till she be twenty six hundred sixty six nisi alitur dispensatum fuerit If one six hundred sixty seven die the other party shall not marry till six months after and because many families are compelled to live niggardly exhaust and undone by great dowers six hundred sixty eight none shall be given at all or very little and that by supervisors rated they that are foul shall have a greater portion if fair none at all or very little six hundred sixty nine howsoever not to exceed such a rate as those supervisors shall think fit And when once they come to those years poverty shall hinder no man from marriage or any other respect six hundred seventy but all shall be rather enforced than hindered six hundred seventy one except they be six hundred seventy two dismembered or grievously deformed infirm or visited with some enormous hereditary disease in body or mind in such cases upon a great pain or mulct six hundred seventy three man or woman shall not marry other order shall be taken for them to their content If people overabound they shall be eased by six hundred seventy four colonies six hundred seventy five No man shall wear weapons in any city The same attire shall be kept and that proper to several callings by which they shall be distinguished six hundred seventy six Luxus funerum shall be taken away that intempestive expense moderated and many others Brokers takers of pawns biting usurers I will not admit yet because hic cum hominibus non cum diis agitur we converse here with men not with gods and for the hardness of men s hearts I will tolerate some kind of usury six hundred seventy seven If we were honest I confess si probi essemus we should have no use of it but being as it is we must necessarily admit it Howsoever most divines contradict it dicimus inficias sed vox ea sola reperta est it must be winked at by politicians And yet some great doctors approve of it Calvin Bucer Zanchius P Martyr because by so many grand lawyers decrees of emperors princes statutes customs of commonwealths churches approbations it is permitted c I will therefore allow it But to no private persons nor to every man that will to orphans only maids widows or such as by reason of their age sex education ignorance of trading know not otherwise how to employ it and those so approved not to let it out apart but to bring their money to a six hundred seventy eight common bank which shall be allowed in every city as in Genoa Geneva Nuremberg Venice at six hundred seventy nine five six seven not above eight per centum as the supervisors or aerarii praefecti shall think fit six hundred eighty And as it shall not be lawful for each man to be an usurer that will so shall it not be lawful for all to take up money at use not to prodigals and spendthrifts but to merchants young tradesmen such as stand in need or know honestly how to employ it whose necessity cause and condition the said supervisors shall approve of I will have no private monopolies to enrich one man and beggar a multitude six hundred eighty one multiplicity of offices of supplying by deputies weights and measures the same throughout and those rectified by the Primum mobile and sun s motion threescore miles to a degree according to observation one thousand geometrical paces to a mile five foot to a pace twelve inches to a foot c and from measures known it is an easy matter to rectify weights c to cast up all and resolve bodies by algebra stereometry I hate wars if they be not ad populi salutem upon urgent occasion six hundred eighty two odimus accipitrim quia semper vivit in armis six hundred eighty three offensive wars except the cause be very just I will not allow of For I do highly magnify that saying of Hannibal to Scipio in six hundred eighty four Livy It had been a blessed thing for you and us if God had given that mind to our predecessors that you had been content with Italy we with Africa For neither Sicily nor Sardinia are worth such cost and pains so many fleets and armies or so many famous Captains lives Omnia prius tentanda fair means shall first be tried six hundred eighty five Peragit tranquilla potestas Quod violenta nequit I will have them proceed with all moderation but hear you Fabius my general not Minutius nam six hundred eighty six qui Consilio nititur plus hostibus nocet quam qui sini animi ratione viribus And in such wars to abstain as much as is possible from six hundred eighty seven depopulations burning of towns massacring of infants c For defensive wars I will have forces still ready at a small warning by land and sea a prepared navy soldiers in procinctu et quam six hundred eighty eight Bonfinius apud Hungaros suos vult virgam ferream and money which is nerves belli still in a readiness and a sufficient revenue a third part as in old six hundred eighty nine Rome and Egypt reserved for the commonwealth to avoid those heavy taxes and impositions as well to defray this charge of wars as also all other public defalcations expenses fees pensions reparations chaste sports feasts donaries rewards and entertainments All things in this nature especially I will have maturely done and with great six hundred ninety deliberation ne quid six hundred ninety one temere ne quid remisse ac timide fiat Sid quo feror hospes To prosecute the rest would require a volume Manum de tabella I have been over tedious in this subject I could have here willingly ranged but these straits wherein I am included will not permit From commonwealths and cities I will descend to families which have as many corsives and molestations as frequent discontents as the rest Great affinity there is betwixt a political and economical body they differ only in magnitude and proportion of business so Scaliger six hundred ninety two writes as they have both likely the same period as six hundred ninety three Bodin and six hundred ninety four Peucer hold out of Plato six or seven hundred years so many times they have the same means of their vexation and overthrows as namely riot a common ruin of both riot in building riot in profuse spending riot in apparel c be it in what kind soever it produceth the same effects A six hundred ninety five chorographer of ours speaking obiter of ancient families why they are so frequent in the north continue so long are so soon extinguished in the south and so few gives no other reason but this luxus omnia dissipavit riot hath consumed all fine clothes and curious buildings came into this island as he notes in his annals not so many years since non sine dispendio hospitalitatis to the decay of hospitality Howbeit many times that word is mistaken and under the name of bounty and hospitality is shrouded riot and prodigality and that which is commendable in itself well used hath been mistaken heretofore is become by his abuse the bane and utter ruin of many a noble family For some men live like the rich glutton consuming themselves and their substance by continual feasting and invitations with six hundred ninety six Axilon in Homer keep open house for all comers giving entertainment to such as visit them six hundred ninety seven keeping a table beyond their means and a company of idle servants though not so frequent as of old are blown up on a sudden and as Actaeon was by his hounds devoured by their kinsmen friends and multitude of followers six hundred ninety eight It is a wonder that Paulus Jovius relates of our northern countries what an infinite deal of meat we consume on our tables that I may truly say tis not bounty not hospitality as it is often abused but riot and excess gluttony and prodigality a mere vice it brings in debt want and beggary hereditary diseases consumes their fortunes and overthrows the good temperature of their bodies To this I might here well add their inordinate expense in building those fantastical houses turrets walks parks c gaming excess of pleasure and that prodigious riot in apparel by which means they are compelled to break up house and creep into holes Sesellius in his commonwealth of six hundred ninety nine France gives three reasons why the French nobility were so frequently bankrupts First because they had so many lawsuits and contentions one upon another which were tedious and costly by which means it came to pass that commonly lawyers bought them out of their possessions A second cause was their riot they lived beyond their means and were therefore swallowed up by merchants La Nove a French writer yields five reasons of his countrymen s poverty to the same effect almost and thinks verily if the gentry of France were divided into ten parts eight of them would be found much impaired by sales mortgages and debts or wholly sunk in their estates The last was immoderate excess in apparel which consumed their revenues How this concerns and agrees with our present state look you But of this elsewhere As it is in a man s body if either head heart stomach liver spleen or any one part be misaffected all the rest suffer with it so is it with this economical body If the head be naught a spendthrift a drunkard a whoremaster a gamester how shall the family live at ease seven hundred Ipsa si cupiat solus servare prorsus non potest hanc familiam as Demea said in the comedy Safety herself cannot save it A good honest painful man many times hath a shrew to his wife a sickly dishonest slothful foolish careless woman to his mate a proud peevish flirt a liquorish prodigal quean and by that means all goes to ruin or if they differ in nature he is thrifty she spends all he wise she sottish and soft what agreement can there be what friendship Like that of the thrush and swallow in Aesop instead of mutual love kind compellations whore and thief is heard they fling stools at one another s heads seven hundred one Quae intemperies vexat hanc familiam All enforced marriages commonly produce such effects or if on their behalves it be well as to live and agree lovingly together they may have disobedient and unruly children that take ill courses to disquiet them seven hundred two their son is a thief a spendthrift their daughter a whore a step seven hundred three mother or a daughter in law distempers all seven hundred four or else for want of means many torturers arise debts dues fees dowries jointures legacies to be paid annuities issuing out by means of which they have not wherewithal to maintain themselves in that pomp as their predecessors have done bring up or bestow their children to their callings to their birth and quality seven hundred five and will not descend to their present fortunes Oftentimes too to aggravate the rest concur many other inconveniences unthankful friends decayed friends bad neighbours negligent servants seven hundred six servi furaces Versipelles callidi occlusa sibi mille clavibus reserant furtimque raptant consumunt liguriunt casualties taxes mulcts chargeable offices vain expenses entertainments loss of stock enmities emulations frequent invitations losses suretyship sickness death of friends and that which is the gulf of all improvidence ill husbandry disorder and confusion by which means they are drenched on a sudden in their estates and at unawares precipitated insensibly into an inextricable labyrinth of debts cares woes want grief discontent and melancholy itself I have done with families and will now briefly run over some few sorts and conditions of men The most secure happy jovial and merry in the world s esteem are princes and great men free from melancholy but for their cares miseries suspicions jealousies discontents folly and madness I refer you to Xenophon s Tyrannus where king Hieron discourseth at large with Simonides the poet of this subject Of all others they are most troubled with perpetual fears anxieties insomuch that as he said in seven hundred seven Valerius if thou knewest with what cares and miseries this robe were stuffed thou wouldst not stoop to take it up Or put case they be secure and free from fears and discontents yet they are void seven hundred eight of reason too oft and precipitate in their actions read all our histories quos de stultis prodidere stulti Iliades Aeneides Annales and what is the subject Stultorum regum et populorum continet aestus The giddy tumults and the foolish rage Of kings and people How mad they are how furious and upon small occasions rash and inconsiderate in their proceedings how they dote every page almost will witness delirant reges plectuntur Achivi When doting monarchs urge Unsound resolves their subjects feel the scourge Next in place next in miseries and discontents in all manner of hair brain actions are great men procul a Jove procul a fulmine the nearer the worse If they live in court they are up and down ebb and flow with their princes favours Ingenium vultu statque caditque suo now aloft tomorrow down as seven hundred nine Polybius describes them like so many casting counters now of gold tomorrow of silver that vary in worth as the computant will now they stand for units tomorrow for thousands now before all and anon behind Beside they torment one another with mutual factions emulations one is ambitious another enamoured a third in debt a prodigal overruns his fortunes a fourth solicitous with cares gets nothing c But for these men s discontents anxieties I refer you to Lucian s Tract de mercede conductis seven hundred ten Aeneas Sylvius libidinis et stultitiae servos he calls them Agrippa and many others Of philosophers and scholars priscae sapientiae dictatores I have already spoken in general terms those superintendents of wit and learning men above men those refined men minions of the muses seven hundred eleven mentemque habere queis bonam Et esse seven hundred twelve corculis datum est seven hundred thirteen These acute and subtle sophisters so much honoured have as much need of hellebore as others seven hundred fourteen O medici mediam pertundite venam Read Lucian s Piscator and tell how he esteemed them Agrippa s Tract of the vanity of Sciences nay read their own works their absurd tenets prodigious paradoxes et risum teneatis amici You shall find that of Aristotle true nullum magnum ingenium sine mixtura dementiae they have a worm as well as others you shall find a fantastical strain a fustian a bombast a vainglorious humour an affected style c like a prominent thread in an uneven woven cloth run parallel throughout their works And they that teach wisdom patience meekness are the veriest dizzards harebrains and most discontent seven hundred fifteen In the multitude of wisdom is grief and he that increaseth wisdom increaseth sorrow I need not quote mine author they that laugh and contemn others condemn the world of folly deserve to be mocked are as giddy headed and lie as open as any other seven hundred sixteen Democritus that common flouter of folly was ridiculous himself barking Menippus scoffing Lucian satirical Lucilius Petronius Varro Persius c may be censured with the rest Loripedem rectus derideat

agitant out of their volubility of tongue will talk much to no purpose orators can persuade other men what they will quo volunt unde volunt move pacify c but cannot settle their own brains what saith Tully Malo indisertam prudentiam quam loquacem stultitiam and as seven hundred twenty two Seneca seconds him a wise man s oration should not be polite or solicitous seven hundred twenty three Fabius esteems no better of most of them either in speech action gesture than as men beside themselves insanos declamatores so doth Gregory Non mihi sapit qui sermone sed qui factis sapit Make the best of

for a man may with more facility avoid him that circumvents by money than him that deceives with glozing terms which made seven hundred twenty six Socrates so much abhor and explode them seven hundred twenty seven Fracastorius a famous poet freely grants all poets to be mad so doth seven hundred twenty eight Scaliger and who doth not Aut insanit homo aut versus facit He s mad or making verses Hor Sat vii l two Insanire lubet i versus componere Virg three Ecl so Servius interprets it all poets are mad a company of bitter satirists detractors or else parasitical applauders and what is poetry itself but as Austin holds Vinum erroris ab ebriis doctoribus propinatum You may give that censure of them in general which Sir Thomas More once did of Germanus Brixius poems in particular vehuntur In rate stultitiae sylvam habitant Furiae seven hundred twenty nine Budaeus in an epistle of his to Lupsetus will have civil law to be the tower of wisdom another honours physic the quintessence of nature a third tumbles them both down and sets up the flag of his own peculiar science Your supercilious critics grammatical triflers note makers curious antiquaries find out all the ruins of wit ineptiarum delicias amongst the rubbish of old writers seven hundred thirty Pro stultis habent nisi aliquid sufficiant invenire quod in aliorum scriptis vertant vitio all fools with them that cannot find fault they correct others and are hot in a cold cause puzzle themselves to find out how many streets in Rome houses gates towers Homer s country Aeneas s mother Niobe s daughters an Sappho

Rome what shoes how they sat where they went to the close stool how many dishes in a mess what sauce which for the present for an historian to relate seven hundred thirty three according to Lodovic Vives is very ridiculous is to them most precious elaborate stuff they admired for it and as proud as triumphant in the meantime for this discovery as if they had won a city or conquered a province as rich as if they had found a mine of gold ore Quosvis auctores absurdis commentis suis percacant et stercorant one saith they bewray and daub a company of books and good authors with their absurd comments correctorum sterquilinia seven hundred thirty four Scaliger calls them and show their wit in censuring others a company of foolish note makers humble bees dors or beetles inter stercora ut

their deleaturs alii legunt sic meus codex sic habet with their postremae editiones annotations castigations c make books dear themselves ridiculous and do nobody good yet if any man dare oppose or contradict they are mad up in arms on a sudden how many sheets are written in defence how bitter invectives what apologies seven hundred thirty six Epiphilledes hae sunt ut merae nugae But I dare say no more of for with or against them because I am liable to their lash as well as others Of these and the rest of our artists and philosophers I will generally conclude they are a kind of madmen as seven hundred thirty seven Seneca esteems of them to make doubts and scruples how to read them truly to mend old authors but will not mend their own lives or teach us ingevia sanare memoriam officiorum ingerere ac fidem in rebus humanis retinere to keep our wits in order or rectify our manners Numquid tibi demens videtur si istis operam impenderit Is not he mad that draws lines with Archimedes whilst his house is ransacked and his city besieged when the whole world is in combustion or we whilst our souls are in danger mors sequitur vita fugit to spend our time in toys idle questions and things of no worth That seven hundred thirty eight lovers are mad I think no man will deny Amare simul et sapere ipsi Jovi non datur Jupiter himself cannot intend both at once seven

together seven hundred forty Est orcus ille vis est immedicabilis est rabies insana love is madness a hell an incurable disease inpotentem et insanam libidinem seven hundred forty one Seneca calls it an impotent and raging lust I shall dilate this subject apart in the meantime let lovers sigh out the rest seven hundred forty two Nevisanus the lawyer holds it for an axiom most women are fools seven

opinion of seven hundred forty six rich men wealth and wisdom cannot dwell together stultitiam patiuntur opes seven hundred forty seven and they do commonly seven hundred forty eight infatuare cor hominis besot men and as we see it fools have fortune seven hundred forty nine Sapientia non invenitur in terra suaviter viventium For beside a natural contempt of learning which accompanies such kind of men innate idleness for they will take no pains and which seven hundred fifty Aristotle observes ubi mens plurima ibi minima fortuna ubi plurima fortuna ibi mens perexigua great wealth and little wit go commonly together they have as much brains some of them in their heads as in their heels besides this inbred neglect of liberal sciences and all arts which should excolere mentem polish the mind they have most part some gullish humour or other by which they are led one is an Epicure an Atheist a second a gamester a third a whoremaster fit subjects all for a satirist to work upon seven

had two distinct persons in him I will determine of them all they are like these double or turning pictures stand before which you see a fair maid on the one side an ape on the other an owl look upon them at the first sight all is well but farther examine you shall find them wise on the one side and fools on the other in some few things praiseworthy in the rest incomparably faulty I will say nothing of their diseases emulations discontents wants and such miseries let poverty plead the rest in Aristophanes Plutus Covetous men amongst others are most mad seven hundred fifty six they have

they come whither they would go and those men are maddest of all that go to sea for one fool at home they find forty abroad He was a madman that said it and thou peradventure as mad to read it seven

were struck by Samson with the jaw bone of an ass Or from Deucalion and Pyrrha s stones for durum genus sumus seven hundred seventy marmorei sumus we are stony hearted and savour too much of the stock

seventy one or landed in the mad haven in the Euxine sea of Daphnis insana which had a secret quality to dementate they are a company of giddy heads afternoon men it is Midsummer moon still and the dog days last all the year long they are all mad Whom shall I then except Ulricus Huttenus seven hundred seventy two nemo nam nemo omnibus horis sapit Nemo nascitur sine vitiis Crimine Nemo caret Nemo

taciturnity Whom in a third all senators magistrates for all fortunate men are wise and conquerors valiant and so are all great men non est bonum ludere cum diis they are wise by authority good by

though he be wrinkled sand blind toothless and deformed yet he is most beautiful and like a god a king in conceit though not worth a groat He never dotes never mad never sad drunk because virtue cannot be taken away as seven hundred seventy six Zeno holds by reason of strong apprehension but he was mad to say so seven hundred seventy seven Anticyrae caelo huic est opus aut dolabra he had need to be bored and so had all his fellows as wise as they would seem to be Chrysippus himself liberally grants them to be fools as well as others at certain times upon some occasions amitti virtutem ait per ebrietatem aut atribilarium morbum it may be lost by drunkenness or melancholy he may be sometimes crazed as well as the rest seven hundred seventy eight ad summum sapiens nisi quum pituita molesta I should here except some Cynics Menippus Diogenes that Theban Crates or to descend to these times that omniscious only wise fraternity seven hundred seventy nine of the Rosicrucians those great theologues politicians philosophers physicians philologers artists c of whom S Bridget Albas Joacchimus Leicenbergius and such divine spirits have prophesied and made promise to the world if at least there be any such Hen seven hundred eighty Neuhusius makes a doubt of it seven hundred eighty one Valentinus Andreas and others or an Elias artifex their Theophrastian master whom though Libavius and many deride and carp at yet some will have to be the seven hundred eighty two renewer of all arts and sciences reformer of the world and now living for so Johannes Montanus Strigoniensis that great patron of Paracelsus contends and certainly avers seven hundred eighty three a most divine man and the quintessence of wisdom wheresoever he is for he his fraternity friends c are all seven hundred eighty four betrothed to wisdom if we may believe their disciples and followers I must needs except Lipsius and the Pope and expunge their name out of the catalogue of fools For besides that parasitical testimony of Dousa A Sole exoriente Maeotidas usque paludes Nemo est qui justo se aequiparare queat seven hundred eighty five Lipsius saith of himself that he was seven hundred eighty six humani generis quidem paedagogus voce et stylo a grand signior a master a tutor of us all and for thirteen years he brags how he sowed wisdom in the Low Countries as Ammonius the philosopher sometimes did in Alexandria seven hundred eighty seven cum humanitate literas et sapientiam cum prudentia antistes sapientiae he shall be Sapientum Octavus The Pope is more than a man as seven hundred eighty eight his parrots often make him a demigod and besides his holiness cannot err in Cathedra belike and yet some of them have been magicians Heretics Atheists children and as Platina saith of John twenty two Et si vir literatus multa stoliditatem et laevitatem prae se ferentia egit stolidi et socordis vir ingenii a scholar sufficient yet many things he did foolishly lightly I can say no more than in particular but in general terms to the rest they are all mad their wits are evaporated and as Ariosto feigns l thirty four kept in jars above the moon Some lose their wits with love some with ambition Some following seven hundred eighty nine Lords and men of high condition Some in fair jewels rich and costly set Others in Poetry their wits forget Another thinks to be an Alchemist Till all be spent and that his number s mist Convicted fools they are madmen upon record and I am afraid past cure many of them seven hundred ninety crepunt inguina the symptoms are manifest they are all of Gotam parish seven hundred ninety one Quum furor haud dubius quum sit manifesta phrenesis Since madness is indisputable since frenzy is obvious what remains then seven hundred ninety two but to send for Lorarios those officers to carry them all together for company to Bedlam and set Rabelais to be their physician If any man shall ask in the meantime who I am that so boldly censure others tu nullane habes vitia have I no faults seven hundred ninety three Yes more than thou hast whatsoever thou art Nos numerus sumus I confess it again I am as foolish as mad as any one seven hundred ninety four Insanus vobis videor non deprecor ipse Quo minus insanus I do not deny it demens de populo dematur My comfort is I have more fellows and those of excellent note And though I be not so right or so discreet as I should be yet not so mad so bad neither as thou perhaps takest me to be To conclude this being granted that all the world is melancholy or mad dotes and every member of it I have ended my task and sufficiently illustrated that which I took upon me to demonstrate at first At this present I have no more to say His sanam mentem Democritus I can but wish myself and them a good physician and all of us a better mind And although for the above named reasons I had a just cause to undertake this subject to point at these particular species of dotage that so men might acknowledge their imperfections and seek to reform what is amiss yet I have a more serious intent at this time and to omit all impertinent digressions to say no more of such as are improperly melancholy or metaphorically mad lightly mad or in disposition as stupid angry drunken silly sottish sullen proud vainglorious ridiculous beastly peevish obstinate impudent extravagant dry doting dull desperate harebrain c mad frantic foolish heteroclites which no new seven hundred ninety five hospital can hold no physic help my purpose and endeavour is in the following discourse to anatomise this humour of melancholy through all its parts and species as it is an habit or an ordinary disease and that philosophically medicinally to show the causes symptoms and several cures of it that it may be the better avoided Moved thereunto for the generality of it and to do good it being a disease so frequent as seven hundred ninety six Mercurialis observes in these our days so often happening saith seven hundred ninety seven Laurentius in our miserable times as few there are that feel not the smart of it Of the same mind is Aelian Montaltus seven hundred ninety eight Melancthon and others seven hundred ninety nine Julius Caesar Claudinus calls it the fountain of all other diseases and so common in this crazed age of ours that scarce one of a thousand is free from it and that splenetic hypochondriacal wind especially which proceeds from the spleen and short ribs Being then a disease so grievous so common I know not wherein to do a more general service and spend my time better than to prescribe means how to prevent and cure so universal a malady an epidemical disease that so often so much crucifies the body and mind If I have overshot myself in this which hath been hitherto said or that it is which I am sure some will object too fantastical too light and comical for a Divine too satirical for one of my profession I will presume to answer with eight hundred Erasmus in like case tis not I but Democritus Democritus dixit you must consider what it is to speak in one s own or another s person an assumed habit and name a difference betwixt him that affects or acts a prince s a philosopher s a magistrate s a fool s part and him that is so indeed and what liberty those old satirists have had it is a cento collected from others not I but they that say it eight hundred one Dixero si quid forte jocosius hoc mihi juris Cum venia dabis Yet some indulgence I may justly claim If too familiar with another s fame Take heed you mistake me not If I do a little forget myself I hope you will pardon it And to say truth why should any man be offended or take exceptions at it Licuit semperque licebit Parcere personis dicere de vitiis It lawful was of old and still will be To speak of vice but let the name go free I hate their vices not their persons If any be displeased or take aught unto himself let him not expostulate or cavil with him that said it so did eight hundred two Erasmus excuse himself to Dorpius si parva licet componere magnis and so do I but let him be angry with himself that so betrayed and opened his own faults in applying it to himself eight hundred three if he be guilty and deserve it let him amend whoever he is and not be angry He that hateth correction is a fool Prov xii one If he be not guilty it concerns him not it is not my freeness of speech but a guilty conscience a galled back of his own that makes him wince Suspicione si quis errabit sua Et rapiet ad se quod erit commune omnium Stulte nudabit animi conscientiam eight hundred four I deny not this which I have said savours a little of Democritus eight hundred five Quamvis ridentem dicere verum quid velat one may speak in jest and yet speak truth It is somewhat tart I grant it acriora orexim excitant embammata as he said sharp sauces increase appetite eight hundred six nec cibus ipse juvat morsu fraudatus aceti Object then and cavil what thou wilt I ward all with eight hundred seven Democritus s buckler his medicine shall salve it strike where thou wilt and when Democritus dixit Democritus will answer it It was written by an idle fellow at idle times about our Saturnalian or Dionysian feasts when as he said nullum libertati periculum est servants in old Rome had liberty to say and do what them list When our countrymen sacrificed to their goddess eight hundred eight Vacuna and sat tippling by their Vacunal fires I writ this and published this Greek houtis helegen it is neminis nihil The time place persons and all circumstances apologise for me and why may not I then be idle with others speak my mind freely If you deny me this liberty upon these presumptions I will take it I say again I will take it eight hundred nine Si quis est qui dictum in se inclementius Existimavit esse sic existimet If any man take exceptions let him turn the buckle of his girdle I care not I owe thee nothing Reader I look for no favour at thy hands I am independent I fear not No I recant I will not I care I fear I confess my fault acknowledge a great offence motos praestat componere fluctus let s first assuage the troubled waves I have overshot myself I have spoken foolishly rashly unadvisedly absurdly I have anatomised mine own folly And now methinks upon a sudden I am awaked as it were out of a dream I have had a raving fit a fantastical fit ranged up and down in and out I have insulted over the most kind of men abused some offended others wronged myself and now being recovered and perceiving mine error cry with eight hundred ten Orlando Solvite me pardon o boni that which is past and I will make you amends in that which is to come I promise you a more sober discourse in my following treatise If through weakness folly passion eight hundred eleven discontent ignorance I have said amiss let it be forgotten and forgiven I acknowledge that of eight hundred twelve Tacitus to be true Asperae facetiae ubi nimis ex vero traxere acrem sui memoriam relinquunt a bitter jest leaves a sting behind it and as an honourable man observes eight hundred thirteen They fear a satirist s wit he their memories I may justly suspect the worst and though I hope I have wronged no man yet in Medea s words I will crave pardon Illud jam voce extrema peto Ne si qua noster dubius effudit dolor Maneant in animo verba sed melior tibi Memoria nostri subeat haec irae data Obliterentur And in my last words this I do desire That what in passion I have said or ire May be forgotten and a better mind Be had of us hereafter as you find I earnestly request every private man as Scaliger did Cardan not to take offence I will conclude in his lines Si me cognitum haberes non solum donares nobis has facetias nostras sed etiam indignum duceres tam humanum aninum lene ingenium vel minimam suspicionem deprecari oportere If thou knewest my eight hundred fourteen modesty and simplicity thou wouldst easily pardon and forgive what is here amiss or by thee misconceived If hereafter anatomizing this surly humour my hand slip as an unskilful prentice I lance too deep and cut through skin and all at unawares make it smart or cut awry eight hundred fifteen pardon a rude hand an unskilful knife tis a

discreet friend the same remark the people of Abdera did from Hippocrates of their meritorious and popular fellow citizen whom they had looked on as a madman It is not that you Democritus that art wise but that the people of Abdera are fools and madmen You have yourself an Abderitian soul and having just given you gentle reader these few words of admonition farewell Heraclite fleas misero sic

PARTITION THE FIRST SECTION MEMBER SUBSECTION Man s Excellency Fall Miseries Infirmities The causes of them Man s Excellency Man the most excellent and noble creature of the world the principal and mighty work of God wonder of Nature as Zoroaster calls him audacis naturae miraculum the eight hundred twenty marvel of marvels as Plato the eight hundred twenty one abridgment and epitome of the world as Pliny microcosmus a little world a model of the world eight hundred twenty two sovereign lord of the earth viceroy of the world sole commander and governor of all the creatures in it to whose empire they are subject in particular and yield obedience far surpassing all the rest not in body only but in soul eight hundred twenty three imaginis imago eight hundred twenty four created to God s own eight hundred twenty five image to that immortal and incorporeal substance with all the faculties and powers belonging unto it was at first pure divine perfect happy eight hundred twenty six created after God in true holiness and righteousness Deo congruens free from all manner of infirmities and put in Paradise to know God to praise and glorify him to do his will Ut diis consimiles parturiat deos as an old poet saith to propagate the church Man s Fall and Misery But this most noble creature Heu tristis et lachrymosa commutatio eight hundred twenty seven one exclaims O pitiful change is fallen from that he was and forfeited his estate become miserabilis homuncio a castaway a caitiff one of the most miserable creatures of the world if he be considered in his own nature an unregenerate man and so much obscured by his fall that some few relics excepted he is inferior to a beast eight hundred twenty eight Man in honour that understandeth not is like unto beasts that perish so David esteems him a monster by stupend metamorphoses eight hundred twenty nine a fox a dog a hog what not Quantum mutatus ab illo How much altered from that he was before blessed and happy now miserable and accursed eight hundred thirty He must eat his meat in sorrow subject to death and all manner of infirmities all kind of calamities A Description of Melancholy eight hundred thirty one Great travail is created for all men and an heavy yoke on the sons of Adam from the day that they go out of their mother s womb unto that day they return to the mother of all things Namely their thoughts and fear of their hearts and their imagination of things they wait for and the day of death From him that sitteth in the glorious throne to him that sitteth beneath in the earth and ashes from him that is clothed in blue silk and weareth a crown to him that is clothed in simple linen Wrath envy trouble and unquietness and fear of death and rigour and strife and such things come to both man and beast but sevenfold to the ungodly All this befalls him in this life and peradventure eternal misery in the life to come Impulsive Cause of Man s Misery and Infirmities The impulsive cause of these miseries in man this privation or destruction of God s image the cause of death and diseases of all temporal and eternal punishments was the sin of our first parent Adam eight hundred thirty two in eating of the forbidden fruit by the devil s instigation and allurement His disobedience pride ambition intemperance incredulity curiosity from whence proceeded original sin and that general corruption of mankind as from a fountain flowed all bad inclinations and actual transgressions which cause our several calamities inflicted upon us for our sins And this belike is that which our fabulous poets have shadowed unto us in the tale of eight hundred thirty three Pandora s box which being opened through her curiosity filled the world full of all manner of diseases It is not curiosity alone but those other crying sins of ours which pull these several plagues and miseries upon our heads For Ubi peccatum ibi procella as eight hundred thirty four Chrysostom well observes eight hundred thirty five Fools by reason of their transgression and because of their iniquities are afflicted eight hundred thirty six Fear cometh like sudden desolation and destruction like a whirlwind affliction and anguish because they did not fear God eight hundred thirty seven Are you shaken with wars as Cyprian well urgeth to Demetrius are you molested with dearth and famine is your health crushed with raging diseases is mankind generally tormented with epidemical maladies tis all for your sins Hag i nine ten Amos i Jer vii God is angry punisheth and threateneth because of their obstinacy and stubbornness they will not turn unto him eight hundred thirty eight If the earth be barren then for want of rain if dry and squalid it yield no fruit if your fountains be dried up your wine corn and oil blasted if the air be corrupted and men troubled with diseases tis by reason of their sins which like the blood of Abel cry loud to heaven for vengeance Lam v fifteen That we have sinned therefore our hearts are heavy Isa lix eleven twelve We roar like bears and mourn like doves and want health c for our sins and trespasses But this we cannot endure to hear or to take notice of Jer ii thirty We are smitten in vain and receive no correction and cap v three Thou hast stricken them but they have not sorrowed they have refused to receive correction they have not returned Pestilence he hath sent but they have not turned to him Amos iv eight hundred thirty nine Herod could not abide John Baptist nor eight hundred forty Domitian endure Apollonius to tell the causes of the plague at Ephesus his injustice incest adultery and the like To punish therefore this blindness and obstinacy of ours as a concomitant cause and principal agent is God s just judgment in bringing these calamities upon us to chastise us I say for our sins and to satisfy God s wrath For the law requires obedience or punishment as you may read at large Deut xxviii fifteen If they will not obey the Lord and keep his commandments and ordinances then all these curses shall come upon them eight hundred forty one Cursed in the town and in the field c eight hundred forty two Cursed in the fruit of the body c eight hundred forty three The Lord shall send thee trouble and shame because of thy wickedness And a little after eight hundred forty four The Lord shall smite thee with the botch of Egypt and with emerods and scab and itch and thou canst not be healed eight hundred forty five with madness blindness and astonishing of heart This Paul seconds Rom ii nine Tribulation and anguish on the soul of every man that doeth evil Or else these chastisements are inflicted upon us for our humiliation to exercise and try our patience here in this life to bring us home to make us to know God ourselves to inform and teach us wisdom eight hundred forty six Therefore is my people gone into captivity because they had no knowledge therefore is the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people and he hath stretched out his hand upon them He is desirous of our salvation eight hundred forty seven Nostrae salutis avidus saith Lemnius and for that cause pulls us by the ear many times to put us in mind of our duties That they which erred might have understanding as Isaiah speaks xxix twenty four and so to be reformed eight hundred forty eight I am afflicted and at the point of death so David confesseth of himself Psal lxxxviii v fifteen v nine Mine eyes are sorrowful through mine affliction and that made him turn unto God Great Alexander in the midst of all his prosperity by a company of parasites deified and now made a god when he saw one of his wounds bleed remembered that he was but a man and remitted of his pride In morbo recolligit se animus eight hundred forty nine as eight hundred fifty Pliny well perceived In sickness the mind reflects upon itself with judgment surveys itself and abhors its former courses insomuch that he concludes to his friend Marius eight hundred fifty one that it were the period of all philosophy if we could so continue sound or perform but a part of that which we promised to do being sick Whoso is wise then will consider these things as David did Psal cxliv verse last and whatsoever fortune befall him make use of it If he be in sorrow need sickness or any other adversity seriously to recount with himself why this or that malady misery this or that incurable disease is inflicted upon him it may be for his good eight hundred fifty two sic expedit as Peter said of his daughter s ague Bodily sickness is for his soul s health periisset nisi periisset had he not been visited he had utterly perished for eight hundred fifty three the Lord correcteth him whom he loveth even as a father doth his child in whom he delighteth If he be safe and sound on the other side and free from all manner of infirmity eight hundred fifty four et cui Gratia forma valetudo contingat abunde Et mundus victus non deficiente crumena And that he have grace beauty favour health A cleanly diet and abound in wealth Yet in the midst of his prosperity let him remember that caveat of Moses eight hundred fifty five Beware that he do not forget the Lord his God that he be not puffed up but acknowledge them to be his good gifts and benefits and eight hundred fifty six the more he hath to be more thankful as Agapetianus adviseth and use them aright Instrumental Causes of our Infirmities Now the instrumental causes of these our infirmities are as diverse as the infirmities themselves stars heavens elements c And all those creatures which God hath made are armed against sinners They were indeed once good in themselves and that they are now many of them pernicious unto us is not in their nature but our corruption which hath caused it For from the fall of our first parent Adam they have been changed the earth accursed the influence of stars altered the four elements beasts birds plants are now ready to offend us The principal things for the use of man are water fire iron salt meal wheat honey milk oil wine clothing good to the godly to the sinners turned to evil Ecclus xxxix twenty six Fire and hail and famine and dearth all these are created for vengeance Ecclus xxxix twenty nine The heavens threaten us with their comets stars planets with their great conjunctions eclipses oppositions quartiles and such unfriendly aspects The air with his meteors thunder and lightning intemperate heat and cold mighty winds tempests unseasonable weather from which proceed dearth famine plague and all sorts of epidemical diseases consuming infinite myriads of men At Cairo in Egypt every third year as it is related by eight hundred fifty seven Boterus and others three hundred thousand die of the plague and two hundred thousand in Constantinople every fifth or seventh at the utmost How doth the earth terrify and oppress us with terrible earthquakes which are most frequent in eight hundred fifty eight China Japan and those eastern climes swallowing up sometimes six cities at once How doth the water rage with his inundations irruptions flinging down towns cities villages bridges c besides shipwrecks whole islands are sometimes suddenly overwhelmed with all their inhabitants in eight hundred fifty nine Zealand Holland and many parts of the continent drowned as the eight hundred sixty lake Erne in Ireland eight hundred sixty one Nihilque praeter arcium cadavera patenti cernimus freto In the fens of Friesland twelve thirty by reason of tempests eight hundred sixty two the sea drowned multa hominum millia et jumenta sine numero all the country almost men and cattle in it How doth the fire rage that merciless element consuming in an instant whole cities What town of any antiquity or note hath not been once again and again by the fury of this merciless element defaced ruinated and left desolate In a word eight hundred sixty three Ignis pepercit unda mergit aeris Vis pestilentis aequori ereptum necat Bello superstes tabidus morbo perit Whom fire spares sea doth drown whom sea Pestilent air doth send to clay Whom war scapes sickness takes away To descend to more particulars how many creatures are at deadly feud with men Lions wolves bears c Some with hoofs horns tusks teeth nails How many noxious serpents and venomous creatures ready to offend us with stings breath sight or quite kill us How many pernicious fishes plants gums fruits seeds flowers c could I reckon up on a sudden which by their very smell many of them touch taste cause some grievous malady if not death itself Some make mention of a thousand several poisons but these are but trifles in respect The greatest enemy to man is man who by the devil s instigation is still ready to do mischief his own executioner a wolf a devil to himself and others eight hundred sixty four We are all brethren in Christ or at least should be members of one body servants of one lord and yet no fiend can so torment insult over tyrannise vex as one man doth another Let me not fall therefore saith David when wars plague famine were offered into the hands of men merciless and wicked men eight hundred sixty five Vix sunt homines hoc nomine digni Quamque lupi saevae plus feritatis habent We can most part foresee these epidemical diseases and likely avoid them Dearths tempests plagues our astrologers foretell us Earthquakes inundations ruins of houses consuming fires come by little and little or make some noise beforehand but the knaveries impostures injuries and villainies of men no art can avoid We can keep our professed enemies from our cities by gates walls and towers defend ourselves from thieves and robbers by watchfulness and weapons but this malice of men and their pernicious endeavours no caution can divert no vigilancy foresee we have so many secret plots and devices to mischief one another Sometimes by the devil s help as magicians eight hundred sixty six witches sometimes by impostures mixtures poisons stratagems single combats wars we hack and hew as if we were ad internecionem nati like Cadmus soldiers born to consume one another Tis an ordinary thing to read of a hundred and two hundred thousand men slain in a battle Besides all manner of tortures brazen bulls racks wheels strappadoes guns engines c eight hundred sixty seven Ad unum corpus humanum supplicia plura quam membra We have invented more torturing instruments than there be several members in a man s body as Cyprian well observes To come nearer yet our own parents by their offences indiscretion and intemperance are our mortal enemies eight hundred sixty eight The fathers have eaten sour grapes and the children s teeth are set on edge They cause our grief many times and put upon us hereditary diseases inevitable infirmities they torment us and we are ready to injure our posterity eight hundred sixty nine mox daturi progeniem vitiosiorem And yet with crimes to us unknown Our sons shall mark the coming age their own and the latter end of the world as eight hundred seventy Paul foretold is still like to be the worst We are thus bad by nature bad by kind but far worse by art every man the greatest enemy unto himself We study many times to undo ourselves abusing those good gifts which God hath bestowed upon us health wealth strength wit learning art memory to our own destruction eight hundred seventy one Perditio tua ex te As eight hundred seventy two Judas Maccabeus killed Apollonius with his own weapons we arm ourselves to our own overthrows and use reason art judgment all that should help us as so many instruments to undo us Hector gave Ajax a sword which so long as he fought against enemies served for his help and defence but after he began to hurt harmless creatures with it turned to his own hurtless bowels Those excellent means God hath bestowed on us well employed cannot but much avail us but if otherwise perverted they ruin and confound us and so by reason of our indiscretion and weakness they commonly do we have too many instances This saint Austin acknowledgeth of himself in his humble confessions promptness of wit memory eloquence they were God s good gifts but he did not use them to his glory If you will particularly know how and by what means consult physicians and they will tell you that it is in offending in some of those six non natural things of which I shall eight hundred seventy three dilate more at large they are the causes of our infirmities our surfeiting and drunkenness our immoderate insatiable lust and prodigious riot Plures crapula quam gladius is a true saying the board consumes more than the sword Our intemperance it is that pulls so many several incurable diseases upon our heads that hastens eight hundred seventy four old age perverts our temperature and brings upon us sudden death And last of all that which crucifies us most is our own folly madness quos Jupiter perdit dementat by subtraction of his assisting grace God permits it weakness want of government our facility and proneness in yielding to several lusts in giving way to every passion and perturbation of the mind by which means we metamorphose ourselves and degenerate into beasts All which that prince of eight hundred seventy five poets observed of Agamemnon that when he was well pleased and could moderate his passion he was os oculosque Jovi par like Jupiter in feature Mars in valour Pallas in wisdom another god but when he became angry he was a lion a tiger a dog c there appeared no sign or likeness of Jupiter in him so we as long as we are ruled by reason correct our inordinate appetite and conform ourselves to God s word are as so many saints but if we give reins to lust anger ambition pride and follow our own ways we degenerate into beasts transform ourselves overthrow our constitutions eight hundred seventy six provoke God to anger and heap upon us this of melancholy and all kinds of incurable diseases as a just and deserved punishment of our sins SUBSECT II The Definition Number Division of Diseases What a disease is almost every physician defines eight hundred seventy seven Fernelius calleth it an affection of the body contrary to nature eight hundred seventy eight Fuschius and Crato an hindrance hurt or alteration of any action of the body or part of it eight hundred seventy nine Tholosanus a dissolution of that league which is between body and soul and a perturbation of it as health the perfection and makes to the preservation of it eight hundred eighty Labeo in Agellius an ill habit of the body opposite to nature hindering the use of it Others otherwise all to this effect Number of Diseases How many diseases there are is a question not yet determined eight hundred eighty one Pliny reckons up three hundred from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot elsewhere he saith morborum infinita multitudo their number is infinite Howsoever it was in those times it boots not in our days I am sure the number is much augmented eight hundred eighty two macies et nova febrium Terris incubit cohors For besides many epidemical diseases unheard of and altogether unknown to Galen and Hippocrates as scorbutum small pox plica sweating sickness morbus Gallicus c we have many proper and peculiar almost to every part No man free from some Disease or other No man amongst us so sound of so good a constitution that hath not some impediment of body or mind Quisque suos patimur manes we have all our infirmities first or last more or less There will be peradventure in an age or one of a thousand like Zenophilus the musician in eight hundred eighty three Pliny that may happily live one hundred five years without any manner of impediment a Pollio Romulus that can preserve himself eight hundred eighty four with wine and oil a man as fortunate as Q Metellus of whom Valerius so much brags a man as healthy as Otto Herwardus a senator of Augsburg in Germany whom eight hundred eighty five Leovitius the astrologer brings in for an example and instance of certainty in his art who because he had the significators in his geniture fortunate and free from the hostile aspects of Saturn and Mars being a very cold man eight hundred eighty six could not remember that ever he was sick eight hundred eighty seven Paracelsus may brag that he could make a man live four hundred years or more if he might bring him up from his infancy and diet him as he list and some physicians hold that there is no certain period of man s life but it may still by temperance and physic be prolonged We find in the meantime by common experience that no man can escape but that of eight hundred eighty eight Hesiod is true Greek pleiae men gar gaia kakon pleiae de thalassa nousoid anthropoi ein eph haemerae aed epi nukti Hautomatoi phoitosi Th earth s full of maladies and full the sea Which set upon us both by night and day Division of Diseases If you require a more exact division of these ordinary diseases which are incident to men I refer you to physicians eight hundred eighty nine they will tell you of acute and chronic first and secondary lethals salutares errant fixed simple compound connexed or consequent belonging to parts or the whole in habit or in disposition c My division at this time as most befitting my purpose shall be into those of the body and mind For them of the body a brief catalogue of which Fuschius hath made Institut lib three sect one cap eleven I refer you to the voluminous tomes of Galen Areteus Rhasis Avicenna Alexander Paulus Aetius Gordonerius and those exact Neoterics Savanarola Capivaccius Donatus Altomarus Hercules de Saxonia Mercurialis Victorius Faventinus Wecker Piso c that have methodically and elaborately written of them all Those of the mind and head I will briefly handle and apart SUBSECT III Division of the Diseases of the Head These diseases of the mind forasmuch as they have their chief seat and organs in the head which are commonly repeated amongst the diseases of the head which are divers and vary much according to their site For in the head as there be several parts so there be divers grievances which according to that division of eight hundred ninety Heurnius which he takes out of Arculanus are inward or outward to omit all others which pertain to eyes and ears nostrils gums teeth mouth palate tongue weezle chops face c belonging properly to the brain as baldness falling of hair furfur lice c eight hundred ninety one Inward belonging to the skins next to the brain called dura and pia mater as all headaches c or to the ventricles caules kells tunicles creeks and parts of it and their passions as caro vertigo incubus apoplexy falling sickness The diseases of the nerves cramps stupor convulsion tremor palsy or belonging to the excrements of the brain catarrhs sneezing rheums distillations or else those that pertain to the substance of the brain itself in which are conceived frenzy lethargy melancholy madness weak memory sopor or Coma Vigilia et vigil Coma Out of these again I will single such as properly belong to the phantasy or imagination or reason itself which eight hundred ninety two Laurentius calls the disease of the mind and Hildesheim morbos imaginationis aut rationis laesae diseases of the imagination or of injured reason which are three or four in number frenzy madness melancholy dotage and their kinds as hydrophobia lycanthropia Chorus sancti viti morbi daemoniaci saint Vitus s dance possession of devils which I will briefly touch and point at insisting especially in this of melancholy as more eminent than the rest and that through all his kinds causes symptoms prognostics cures as Lonicerus hath done de apoplexia and many other of such particular diseases Not that I find fault with those which have written of this subject before as Jason Pratensis Laurentius Montaltus T Bright c they have done very well in their several kinds and methods yet that which one omits another may haply see that which one contracts another may enlarge To conclude with eight hundred ninety three Scribanius that which they had neglected or perfunctorily handled we may more thoroughly examine that which is obscurely delivered in them may be perspicuously dilated and amplified by us and so made more familiar and easy for every man s capacity and the common good which is the chief end of my discourse SUBSECT IV Dotage Frenzy Madness Hydrophobia Lycanthropia Chorus sancti Viti Extasis Delirium Dotage Dotage fatuity or folly is a common name to all the following species as some will have it eight hundred ninety four Laurentius and eight hundred ninety five Altomarus comprehended madness melancholy and the rest under this name and call it the summum genus of them all If it be distinguished from them it is natural or ingenite which comes by some defect of the organs and overmuch brain as we see in our common fools and is for the most part intended or remitted in particular men and thereupon some are wiser than others or else it is acquisite an appendix or symptom of some other disease which comes or goes or if it continue a sign of melancholy itself Frenzy Phrenitis which the Greeks derive from the word Greek phraen is a disease of the mind with a continual madness or dotage which hath an acute fever annexed or else an inflammation of the brain or the membranes or kells of it with an acute fever which causeth madness and dotage It differs from melancholy and madness because their dotage is without an ague this continual with waking or memory decayed c Melancholy is most part silent this clamorous and many such like differences are assigned by physicians Madness Madness frenzy and melancholy are confounded by Celsus and many writers others leave out frenzy and make madness and melancholy but one disease which eight hundred ninety six Jason Pratensis especially labours and that they differ only secundam majus or minus in quantity alone the one being a degree to the other and both proceeding from one cause They differ intenso et remisso gradu saith eight hundred ninety seven Gordonius as the humour is intended or remitted Of the same mind is eight hundred ninety eight Areteus Alexander Tertullianus Guianerius Savanarola Heurnius and Galen himself writes promiscuously of them both by reason of their affinity but most of our neoterics do handle them apart whom I will follow in this treatise Madness is therefore defined to be a vehement dotage or raving without a fever far more violent than melancholy full of anger and clamour horrible looks actions gestures troubling the patients with far greater vehemency both of body and mind without all fear and sorrow with such impetuous force and boldness that sometimes three or four men cannot hold them Differing only in this from frenzy that it is without a fever and their memory is most part better It hath the same causes as the other as choler adust and blood incensed brains inflamed c eight hundred ninety nine Fracastorius adds a due time and full age to this definition to distinguish it from children and will have it confirmed impotency to separate it from such as accidentally come and go again as by taking henbane nightshade wine c Of this fury there be divers kinds nine hundred ecstasy which is familiar with some persons as Cardan saith of himself he could be in one when he list in which the Indian priests deliver their oracles and the witches in Lapland as Olaus Magnus writeth l three cap eighteen Extasi omnia praedicere answer all questions in an ecstasis you will ask what your friends do where they are how they fare c The other species of this fury are enthusiasms revelations and visions so often mentioned by Gregory and Bede in their works obsession or possession of devils sibylline prophets and poetical furies such as come by eating noxious herbs tarantulas stinging c which some reduce to this The most known are these lycanthropia hydrophobia chorus sancti Viti Lycanthropia Lycanthropia which Avicenna calls cucubuth others lupinam insaniam or wolf madness when men run howling about graves and fields in the night and will not be persuaded but that they are wolves or some such beasts nine hundred one Aetius and nine hundred two Paulus call it a kind of melancholy but I should rather refer it to madness as most do Some make a doubt of it whether there be any such disease nine hundred three Donat ab Altomari saith that he saw two of them in his time nine hundred four Wierus tells a story of such a one at Padua fifteen forty one that would not believe to the contrary but that he was a wolf He hath another instance of a Spaniard who thought himself a bear nine hundred five Forrestus confirms as much by many examples one amongst the rest of which he was an eyewitness at Alcmaer in Holland a poor husbandman that still hunted about graves and kept in churchyards of a pale black ugly and fearful look Such belike or little better were king Praetus nine hundred six daughters that thought themselves kine And Nebuchadnezzar in Daniel as some interpreters hold was only troubled with this kind of madness This disease perhaps gave occasion to that bold assertion of nine hundred seven Pliny some men were turned into wolves in his time and from wolves to men again and to that fable of Pausanias of a man that was ten years a wolf and afterwards turned to his former shape to nine hundred eight Ovid s tale of Lycaon c He that is desirous to hear of this disease or more examples let him read Austin in his eighteenth book de Civitate Dei cap five Mizaldus cent five seventy seven Sckenkius lib one Hildesheim spicel two de Mania Forrestus lib ten de morbis cerebri Olaus Magnus Vincentius Bellavicensis spec met lib thirty one c one hundred twenty two Pierius Bodine Zuinger Zeilger Peucer Wierus Spranger c This malady saith Avicenna troubleth men most in February and is nowadays frequent in Bohemia and Hungary according to nine hundred nine Heurnius Scheretzius will have it common in Livonia They lie hid most part all day and go abroad in the night barking howling at graves and deserts nine hundred ten they have usually hollow eyes scabbed legs and thighs very dry and pale nine hundred eleven saith Altomarus he gives a reason there of all the symptoms and sets down a brief cure of them Hydrophobia is a kind of madness well known in every village which comes by the biting of a mad dog or scratching saith nine hundred twelve Aurelianus touching or smelling alone sometimes as nine hundred thirteen Sckenkius proves and is incident to many other creatures as well as men so called because the parties affected cannot endure the sight of water or any liquor supposing still they see a mad dog in it And which is more wonderful though they be very dry as in this malady they are they will rather die than drink nine hundred fourteen de Venenis Caelius Aurelianus an ancient writer makes a doubt whether this Hydrophobia be a passion of the body or the mind The part affected is the brain the cause poison that comes from the mad dog which is so hot and dry that it consumes all the moisture in the body nine hundred fifteen Hildesheim relates of some that died so mad and being cut up had no water scarce blood or any moisture left in them To such as are so affected the fear of water begins at fourteen days after they are bitten to some again not till forty or sixty days after commonly saith Heurnius they begin to rave fly water and glasses to look red and swell in the face about twenty days after if some remedy be not taken in the meantime to lie awake to be pensive sad to see strange visions to bark and howl to fall into a swoon and oftentimes fits of the falling sickness nine hundred sixteen Some say little things like whelps will be seen in their urine If any of these signs appear they are past recovery Many times these symptoms will not appear till six or seven months after saith nine hundred seventeen Codronchus and sometimes not till seven or eight years as Guianerius twelve as Albertus six or eight months after as Galen holds Baldus the great lawyer died of it an Augustine friar and a woman in Delft that were nine hundred eighteen Forrestus patients were miserably consumed with it The common cure in the country for such at least as dwell near the seaside is to duck them over head and ears in sea water some use charms every good wife can prescribe medicines But the best cure to be had in such cases is from the most approved physicians they that will read of them may consult with Dioscorides lib six c thirty seven Heurnius Hildesheim Capivaccius Forrestus Sckenkius and before all others Codronchus an Italian who hath lately written two exquisite books on the subject Chorus sancti Viti or saint Vitus s dance the lascivious dance nine hundred nineteen Paracelsus calls it because they that are taken from it can do nothing but dance till they be dead or cured It is so called for that the parties so troubled were wont to go to saint Vitus for help and after they had danced there awhile they were nine hundred twenty certainly freed Tis strange to hear how long they will dance and in what manner over stools forms tables even great bellied women sometimes and yet never hurt their children will dance so long that they can stir neither hand nor foot but seem to be quite dead One in red clothes they cannot abide Music above all things they love and therefore magistrates in Germany will hire musicians to play to them and some lusty sturdy companions to dance with them This disease hath been very common in Germany as appears by those relations of nine hundred twenty one Sckenkius and Paracelsus in his book of Madness who brags how many several persons he hath cured of it Felix Plateras de mentis alienat cap three reports of a woman in Basil whom he saw that danced a whole month together The Arabians call it a kind of palsy Bodine in his fifth book de Repub cap one speaks of this infirmity Monavius in his last epistle to Scoltizius and in another to Dudithus where you may read more of it The last kind of madness or melancholy is that demoniacal if I may so call it obsession or possession of devils which Platerus and others would have to be preternatural stupend things are said of them their actions gestures contortions fasting prophesying speaking languages they were never taught c Many strange stories are related of them which because some will not allow for Deacon and Darrel have written large volumes on this subject pro and con I voluntarily omit nine hundred twenty two Fuschius Institut lib three sec one cap eleven Felix Plater nine hundred twenty three Laurentius add to these another fury that proceeds from love and another from study another divine or religious fury but these more properly belong to melancholy of all which I will speak nine hundred twenty four apart intending to write a whole book of them SUBSECT V Melancholy in Disposition improperly so called Equivocations Melancholy the subject of our present discourse is either in disposition or habit In disposition is that transitory melancholy which goes and comes upon every small occasion of sorrow need sickness trouble fear grief passion or perturbation of the mind any manner of care discontent or thought which causeth anguish dullness heaviness and vexation of spirit any ways opposite to pleasure mirth joy delight causing frowardness in us or a dislike In which equivocal and improper sense we call him melancholy that is dull sad sour lumpish ill disposed solitary any way moved or displeased And from these melancholy dispositions nine hundred twenty five no man living is free no stoic none so wise none so happy none so patient so generous so godly so divine that can vindicate himself so well composed but more or less some time or other he feels the smart of it Melancholy in this sense is the character of mortality nine hundred twenty six Man that is born of a woman is of short continuance and full of trouble Zeno Cato Socrates himself whom nine hundred twenty seven Aelian so highly commends for a moderate temper that nothing could disturb him but going out and coming in still Socrates kept the same serenity of countenance what misery soever befell him if we may believe Plato his disciple was much tormented with it Q Metellus in whom nine hundred twenty eight Valerius gives instance of all happiness the most fortunate man then living born in that most flourishing city of Rome of noble parentage a proper man of person well qualified healthful rich honourable a senator a consul happy in his wife happy in his children c yet this man was not void of melancholy he had his share of sorrow nine hundred twenty nine Polycrates Samius that flung his ring into the sea because he would participate of discontent with others and had it miraculously restored to him again shortly after by a fish taken as he angled was not free from melancholy dispositions No man can cure himself the very gods had bitter pangs and frequent passions as their own nine hundred thirty poets put upon them In general nine hundred thirty one as the heaven so is our life sometimes fair sometimes overcast tempestuous and serene as in a rose flowers and prickles in the year itself a temperate summer sometimes a hard winter a drought and then again pleasant showers so is our life intermixed with joys hopes fears sorrows calumnies Invicem cedunt dolor et voluptas there is a succession of pleasure and pain nine hundred thirty two medio de fonte leporum Surgit amari aliquid in ipsis floribus angat Even in the midst of laughing there is sorrow as nine hundred thirty three Solomon holds even in the midst of all our feasting and jollity as nine hundred thirty four Austin infers in his Com on the forty first Psalm there is grief and discontent Inter delicias semper aliquid saevi nos strangulat for a pint of honey thou shalt here likely find a gallon of gall for a dram of pleasure a pound of pain for an inch of mirth an ell of moan as ivy doth an oak these miseries encompass our life And it is most absurd and ridiculous for any mortal man to look for a perpetual tenure of happiness in his life Nothing so prosperous and pleasant but it hath nine hundred thirty five some bitterness in it some complaining some grudging it is all Greek glukupikron a mixed passion and like a chequer table black and white men families cities have their falls and wanes now trines sextiles then quartiles and oppositions We are not here as those angels celestial powers and bodies sun and moon to finish our course without all offence with such constancy to continue for so many ages but subject to infirmities miseries interrupted tossed and tumbled up and down carried about with every small blast often molested and disquieted upon each slender occasion nine hundred thirty six uncertain brittle and so is all that we trust unto nine hundred thirty seven And he that knows not this is not armed to endure it is not fit to live in this world as one condoles our time he knows not the condition of it where with a reciprocalty pleasure and pain are still united and succeed one another in a ring Exi e mundo get thee gone hence if thou canst not brook it there is no way to avoid it but to arm thyself with patience with magnanimity to nine hundred thirty eight oppose thyself unto it to suffer affliction as a good soldier of Christ as nine hundred thirty nine Paul adviseth constantly to bear it But forasmuch as so few can embrace this good council of his or use it aright but rather as so many brute beasts give away to their passion voluntary subject and precipitate themselves into a labyrinth of cares woes miseries and suffer their souls to be overcome by them cannot arm themselves with that patience as they ought to do it falleth out oftentimes that these dispositions become habits and many affects contemned as nine hundred forty Seneca notes make a disease Even as one distillation not yet grown to custom makes a cough but continual and inveterate causeth a consumption of the lungs so do these our melancholy provocations and according as the humour itself is intended or remitted in men as their temperature of body or rational soul is better able to make resistance so are they more or less affected For that which is but a flea biting to one causeth insufferable torment to another and which one by his singular moderation and well composed carriage can happily overcome a second is no whit able to sustain but upon every small occasion of misconceived abuse injury grief disgrace loss cross humour c if solitary or idle yields so far to passion that his complexion is altered his digestion hindered his sleep gone his spirits obscured and his heart heavy his hypochondries misaffected wind crudity on a sudden overtake him and he himself overcome with melancholy As it is with a man imprisoned for debt if once in the gaol every creditor will bring his action against him and there likely hold him If any discontent seize upon a patient in an instant all other perturbations for qua data porta ruunt will set upon him and then like a lame dog or broken winged goose he droops and pines away and is brought at last to that ill habit or malady of melancholy itself So that as the philosophers make nine hundred forty one eight degrees of heat and cold we may make eighty eight of melancholy as the parts affected are diversely seized with it or have been plunged more or less into this infernal gulf or waded deeper into it But all these melancholy fits howsoever pleasing at first or displeasing violent and tyrannizing over those whom they seize on for the time yet these fits I say or men affected are but improperly so called because they continue not but come and go as by some objects they aye moved This melancholy of which we are to treat is a habit mosbus sonticus or chronicus a chronic or continuate disease a settled humour as nine hundred forty two Aurelianus and nine hundred forty three others call it not errant but fixed and as it was long increasing so now being pleasant or painful grown to an habit it will hardly be removed SECT I MEMB II SUBSECT I Digression of Anatomy Before I proceed to define the disease of melancholy what it is or to discourse farther of it I hold it not impertinent to make a brief digression of the anatomy of the body and faculties of the soul for the better understanding of that which is to follow because many hard words will often occur as mirach hypocondries emerods c imagination reason humours spirits vital natural animal nerves veins arteries chylus pituita which by the vulgar will not so easily be perceived what they are how cited and to what end they serve And besides it may peradventure give occasion to some men to examine more accurately search further into this most excellent subject and thereupon with that royal nine hundred forty four prophet to praise God for a man is fearfully and wonderfully made and curiously wrought that have time and leisure enough and are sufficiently informed in all other worldly businesses as to make a good bargain buy and sell to keep and make choice of a fair hawk hound horse c But for such matters as concern the knowledge of themselves they are wholly ignorant and careless they know not what this body and soul are how combined of what parts and faculties they consist or how a man differs from a dog And what can be more ignominious and filthy as nine hundred forty five Melancthon well inveighs than for a man not to know the structure and composition of his own body especially since the knowledge of it tends so much to the preservation of his health and information of his manners To stir them up therefore to this study to peruse those elaborate works of nine hundred forty six Galen Bauhines Plater Vesalius Falopius Laurentius Remelinus c which have written copiously in Latin or that which some of our industrious countrymen have done in our mother tongue not long since as that translation of nine hundred forty seven Columbus and nine hundred forty eight Microcosmographia in thirteen books I have made this brief digression Also because nine hundred forty nine Wecker nine hundred fifty Melancthon nine hundred fifty one Fernelius nine hundred fifty two Fuschius and those tedious Tracts de Anima which have more compendiously handled and written of this matter are not at all times ready to be had to give them some small taste or notice of the rest let this epitome suffice SUBSECT II Division of the Body Humours Spirits Of the parts of the body there may be many divisions the most approved is that of nine hundred fifty three Laurentius out of Hippocrates which is into parts contained or containing Contained are either humours or spirits Humours A humour is a liquid or fluent part of the body comprehended in it for the preservation of it and is either innate or born with us or adventitious and acquisite The radical or innate is daily supplied by nourishment which some call cambium and make those secondary humours of ros and gluten to maintain it or acquisite to maintain these four first primary humours coming and proceeding from the first concoction in the liver by which means chylus is excluded Some divide them into profitable and excrementitious But nine hundred fifty four Crato out of Hippocrates will have all four to be juice and not excrements without which no living creature can be sustained which four though they be comprehended in the mass of blood yet they have their several affections by which they are distinguished from one another and from those adventitious peccant or nine hundred fifty five diseased humours as Melancthon calls them Blood Blood is a hot sweet temperate red humour prepared in the mesaraic veins and made of the most temperate parts of the chylus in the liver whose office is to nourish the whole body to give it strength and colour being dispersed by the veins through every part of it And from it spirits are first begotten in the heart which afterwards by the arteries are communicated to the other parts Pituita or phlegm is a cold and moist humour begotten of the colder part of the chylus or white juice coming out of the meat digested in the stomach in the liver his office is to nourish and moisten the members of the body which as the tongue are moved that they be not over dry Choler is hot and dry bitter begotten of the hotter parts of the chylus and gathered to the gall it helps the natural heat and senses and serves to the expelling of excrements Melancholy Melancholy cold and dry thick black and sour begotten of the more feculent part of nourishment and purged from the spleen is a bridle to the other two hot humours blood and choler preserving them in the blood and nourishing the bones These four humours have some analogy with the four elements and to the four ages in man Serum Sweat Tears To these humours you may add serum which is the matter of urine and those excrementitious humours of the third concoction sweat and tears Spirits Spirit is a most subtle vapour which is expressed from the blood and the instrument of the soul to perform all his actions a common tie or medium between the body and the soul as some will have it or as nine hundred fifty six Paracelsus a fourth soul of itself Melancthon holds the fountain of those spirits to be the heart begotten there and afterward conveyed to the brain they take another nature to them Of these spirits there be three kinds according to the three principal parts brain heart liver natural vital animal The natural are begotten in the liver and thence dispersed through the veins to perform those natural actions The vital spirits are made in the heart of the natural which by the arteries are transported to all the other parts if the spirits cease then life ceaseth as in a syncope or swooning The animal spirits formed of the vital brought up to the brain and diffused by the nerves to the subordinate members give sense and motion to them all SUBSECT III Similar Parts Similar Parts Containing parts by reason of their more solid substance are either homogeneal or heterogeneal similar or dissimilar so Aristotle divides them lib one cap one de Hist Animal Laurentius cap twenty lib one Similar or homogeneal are such as if they be divided are still severed into parts of the same nature as water into water Of these some be spermatical some fleshy or carnal nine hundred fifty seven Spermatical are such as are immediately begotten of the seed which are bones gristles ligaments membranes nerves arteries veins skins fibres or strings fat Bones The bones are dry and hard begotten of the thickest of the seed to strengthen and sustain other parts some say there be three hundred four some three hundred seven or three hundred thirteen in man s body They have no nerves in them and are therefore without sense A gristle is a substance softer than bone and harder than the rest flexible and serves to maintain the parts of motion Ligaments are they that tie the bones together and other parts to the bones with their subserving tendons membranes office is to cover the rest Nerves or sinews are membranes without and full of marrow within they proceed from the brain and carry the animal spirits for sense and motion Of these some be harder some softer the softer serve the senses and there be seven pair of them The first be the optic nerves by which we see the second move the eyes the third pair serve for the tongue to taste the fourth pair for the taste in the palate the fifth belong to the ears the sixth pair is most ample and runs almost over all the bowels the seventh pair moves the tongue The harder sinews serve for the motion of the inner parts proceeding from the marrow in the back of whom there be thirty combinations seven of the neck twelve of the breast c Arteries Arteries are long and hollow with a double skin to convey the vital spirit to discern which the better they say that Vesalius the anatomist was wont to cut up men alive nine hundred fifty eight They arise in the left side of the heart and are principally two from which the rest are derived aorta and venosa aorta is the root of all the other which serve the whole body the other goes to the lungs to fetch air to refrigerate the heart Veins Veins are hollow and round like pipes arising from the liver carrying blood and natural spirits they feed all the parts Of these there be two chief Vena porta and Vena cava from which the rest are corrivated That Vena porta is a vein coming from the concave of the liver and receiving those mesaraical veins by whom he takes the chylus from the stomach and guts and conveys it to the liver The other derives blood from the liver to nourish all the other dispersed members The branches of that Vena porta are the mesaraical and haemorrhoids The branches of the cava are inward or outward Inward seminal or emulgent Outward in the head arms feet c and have several names Fibrae Fat Flesh Fibrae are strings white and solid dispersed through the whole member and right oblique transverse all which have their several uses Fat is a similar part moist without blood composed of the most thick and unctuous matter of the blood The nine hundred fifty nine skin covers the rest and hath cuticulum or a little skin tinder it Flesh is soft and ruddy composed of the congealing of blood c SUBSECT IV Dissimilar Parts Dissimilar parts are those which we call organical or instrumental and they be inward or outward The chiefest outward parts are situate forward or backward forward the crown and foretop of the head skull face forehead temples chin eyes ears nose c neck breast chest upper and lower part of the belly hypocondries navel groin flank c backward the hinder part of the head back shoulders sides loins hipbones os sacrum buttocks c Or joints arms hands feet legs thighs knees c Or common to both which because they are obvious and well known I have carelessly repeated eaque praecipua et grandiora tantum quod reliquum ex libris de anima qui volet accipiat Inward organical parts which cannot be seen are divers in number and have several names functions and divisions but that of nine hundred sixty Laurentius is most notable into noble or ignoble parts Of the noble there be three principal parts to which all the rest belong and whom they serve brain heart liver according to whose site three regions or a threefold division is made of the whole body As first of the head in which the animal organs are contained and brain itself which by his nerves give sense and motion to the rest and is as it were a privy counsellor and chancellor to the heart The second region is the chest or middle belly in which the heart as king keeps his court and by his arteries communicates life to the whole body The third region is the lower belly in which the liver resides as a Legat a latere with the rest of those natural organs serving for concoction nourishment expelling of excrements This lower region is distinguished from the upper by the midriff or diaphragma and is subdivided again by nine hundred sixty one some into three concavities or regions upper middle and lower The upper of the hypocondries in whose right side is the liver the left the spleen from which is denominated hypochondriacal melancholy The second of the navel and flanks divided from the first by the rim The last of the water course which is again subdivided into three other parts The Arabians make two parts of this region Epigastrium and Hypogastrium upper or lower Epigastrium they call Mirach from whence comes Mirachialis Melancholia sometimes mentioned of them Of these several regions I will treat in brief apart and first of the third region in which the natural organs are contained De Anima The Lower Region Natural Organs But you that are readers in the meantime Suppose you were now brought into some sacred temple or majestical palace as nine hundred sixty two Melancthon saith to behold not the matter only but the singular art workmanship and counsel of this our great Creator And it is a pleasant and profitable speculation if it be considered aright The parts of this region which present themselves to your consideration and view are such as serve to nutrition or generation Those of nutrition serve to the first or second concoction as the oesophagus or gullet which brings meat and drink into the stomach The ventricle or stomach which is seated in the midst of that part of the belly beneath the midriff the kitchen as it were of the first concoction and which turns our meat into chylus It hath two mouths one above another beneath The upper is sometimes taken for the stomach itself the lower and nether door as Wecker calls it is named Pylorus This stomach is sustained by a large kell or caul called omentum which some will have the same with peritoneum or rim of the belly From the stomach to the very fundament are produced the guts or intestina which serve a little to alter and distribute the chylus and convey away the excrements They are divided into small and great by reason of their site and substance slender or thicker the slender is duodenum or whole gut which is next to the stomach some twelve inches long saith nine hundred sixty three Fuschius Jejunum or empty gut continuate to the other which hath many mesaraic veins annexed to it which take part of the chylus to the liver from it Ilion the third which consists of many crinkles which serves with the rest to receive keep and distribute the chylus from the stomach The thick guts are three the blind gut colon and right gut The blind is a thick and short gut having one mouth in which the ilium and colon meet it receives the excrements and conveys them to the colon This colon hath many windings that the excrements pass not away too fast the right gut is straight and conveys the excrements to the fundament whose lower part is bound up with certain muscles called sphincters that the excrements may be the better contained until such time as a man be willing to go to the stool In the midst of these guts is situated the mesenterium or midriff composed of many veins arteries and much fat serving chiefly to sustain the guts All these parts serve the first concoction To the second which is busied either in refining the good nourishment or expelling the bad is chiefly belonging the liver like in colour to congealed blood the shop of blood situate in the right hypochondry in figure like to a half moon generosum membrum Melancthon styles it a generous part it serves to turn the chylus to blood for the nourishment of the body The excrements of it are either choleric or watery which the other subordinate parts convey The gall placed in the concave of the liver extracts choler to it the spleen melancholy which is situate on the left side over against the liver a spongy matter that draws this black choler to it by a secret virtue and feeds upon it conveying the rest to the bottom of the stomach to stir up appetite or else to the guts as an excrement That watery matter the two kidneys expurgate by those emulgent veins and ureters The emulgent draw this superfluous moisture from the blood the two ureters convey it to the bladder which by reason of his site in the lower belly is apt to receive it having two parts neck and bottom the bottom holds the water the neck is constringed with a muscle which as a porter keeps the water from running out against our will Members of generation are common to both sexes or peculiar to one which because they are impertinent to my purpose I do voluntarily omit Middle Region Next in order is the middle region or chest which comprehends the vital faculties and parts which as I have said is separated from the lower belly by the diaphragma or midriff which is a skin consisting of many nerves membranes and amongst other uses it hath is the instrument of laughing There is also a certain thin membrane full of sinews which covereth the whole chest within and is called pleura the seat of the disease called pleurisy when it is inflamed some add a third skin which is termed mediastinus which divides the chest into two parts right and left of this region the principal part is the heart which is the seat and fountain of life of heat of spirits of pulse and respiration the sun of our body the king and sole commander of it the seat and organ of all passions and affections Primum vivens ultimum moriens it lives first dies last in all creatures Of a pyramidical form and not much unlike to a pineapple a part worthy of nine hundred sixty four admiration that can yield such variety of affections by whose motion it is dilated or contracted to stir and command the humours in the body As in sorrow melancholy in anger choler in joy to send the blood outwardly in sorrow to call it in moving the humours as horses do a chariot This heart though it be one sole member yet it may be divided into two creeks right and left The right is like the moon increasing bigger than the other part and receives blood from vena cava distributing some of it to the lungs to nourish them the rest to the left side to engender spirits The left creek hath the form of a cone and is the seat of life which as a torch doth oil draws blood unto it begetting of it spirits and fire and as fire in a torch so are spirits in the blood and by that great artery called aorta it sends vital spirits over the body and takes air from the lungs by that artery which is called venosa so that both creeks have their vessels the right two veins the left two arteries besides those two common anfractuous ears which serve them both the one to hold blood the other air for several uses The lungs is a thin spongy part like an ox hoof saith nine hundred sixty five Fernelius the town clerk or crier nine hundred sixty six one terms it the instrument of voice as an orator to a king annexed to the heart to express their thoughts by voice That it is the instrument of voice is manifest in that no creature can speak or utter any voice which wanteth these lights It is besides the instrument of respiration or breathing and its office is to cool the heart by sending air unto it by the venosal artery which vein comes to the lungs by that aspera arteria which consists of many gristles membranes nerves taking in air at the nose and mouth and by it likewise exhales the fumes of the heart In the upper region serving the animal faculties the chief organ is the brain which is a soft marrowish and white substance engendered of the purest part of seed and spirits included by many skins and seated within the skull or brain pan and it is the most noble organ under heaven the dwelling house and seat of the soul the habitation of wisdom memory judgment reason and in which man is most like unto God and therefore nature hath covered it with a skull of hard bone and two skins or membranes whereof the one is called dura mater or meninx the other pia mater The dura mater is next to the skull above the other which includes and protects the brain When this is taken away the pia mater is to be seen a thin membrane the next and immediate cover of the brain and not covering only but entering into it The brain itself is divided into two parts the fore and hinder part the fore part is much bigger than the other which is called the little brain in respect of it This fore part hath many concavities distinguished by certain ventricles which are the receptacles of the spirits brought hither by the arteries from the heart and are there refined to a more heavenly nature to perform the actions of the soul Of these ventricles there are three right left and middle The right and left answer to their site and beget animal spirits if they be any way hurt sense and motion ceaseth These ventricles moreover are held to be the seat of the common sense The middle ventricle is a common concourse and cavity of them both and hath two passages the one to receive pituita and the other extends itself to the fourth creek in this they place imagination and cogitation and so the three ventricles of the fore part of the brain are used The fourth creek behind the head is common to the cerebel or little brain and marrow of the backbone the last and most solid of all the rest which receives the animal spirits from the other ventricles and conveys them to the marrow in the back and is the place where they say the memory is seated SUBSECT V Of the Soul and her Faculties According to nine hundred sixty seven Aristotle the soul is defined to be Greek entelecheia perfectio et actus primus corporis organici vitam habentis in potentia the perfection or first act of an organical body having power of life which most nine hundred sixty eight philosophers approve But many doubts arise about the essence subject seat distinction and subordinate faculties of it For the essence and particular knowledge of all other things it is most hard be it of man or beast to discern as nine hundred sixty nine Aristotle himself nine hundred seventy Tully nine hundred seventy one Picus Mirandula nine hundred seventy two Tolet and other neoteric philosophers confess nine hundred seventy three We can understand all things by her but what she is we cannot apprehend Some therefore make one soul divided into three principal faculties others three distinct souls Which question of late hath been much controverted by Picolomineus and Zabarel nine hundred seventy four Paracelsus will have four souls adding to the three grand faculties a spiritual soul which opinion of his Campanella in his book de sensu rerum nine hundred seventy five much labours to demonstrate and prove because carcasses bleed at the sight of the murderer with many such arguments And nine hundred seventy six some again one soul of all creatures whatsoever differing only in organs and that beasts have reason as well as men though for some defect of organs not in such measure Others make a doubt whether it be all in all and all in every part which is amply discussed in Zabarel amongst the rest The nine hundred seventy seven common division of the soul is into three principal faculties vegetal sensitive and rational which make three distinct kinds of living creatures vegetal plants sensible beasts rational men How these three principal faculties are distinguished and connected Humano ingenio inaccessum videtur is beyond human capacity as nine hundred seventy eight Taurellus Philip Flavins and others suppose The inferior may be alone but the superior cannot subsist without the other so sensible includes vegetal rational both which are contained in it saith Aristotle ut trigonus in tetragono as a triangle in a quadrangle Vegetal Soul Vegetal the first of the three distinct faculties is defined to be a substantial act of an organical body by which it is nourished augmented and begets another like unto itself In which definition three several operations are specified altrix auctrix procreatrix the first is nine hundred seventy nine nutrition whose object is nourishment meat drink and the like his organ the liver in sensible creatures in plants the root or sap His office is to turn the nutriment into the substance of the body nourished which he performs by natural heat This nutritive operation hath four other subordinate functions or powers belonging to it attraction retention digestion expulsion Attraction nine hundred eighty Attraction is a ministering faculty which as a loadstone doth iron draws meat into the stomach or as a lamp doth oil and this attractive power is very necessary in plants which suck up moisture by the root as another mouth into the sap as a like stomach Retention Retention keeps it being attracted unto the stomach until such time it be concocted for if it should pass away straight the body could not be nourished Digestion Digestion is performed by natural heat for as the flame of a torch consumes oil wax tallow so doth it alter and digest the nutritive matter Indigestion is opposite unto it for want of natural heat Of this digestion there be three differences maturation elixation assation Maturation Maturation is especially observed in the fruits of trees which are then said to be ripe when the seeds are fit to be sown again Crudity is opposed to it which gluttons epicures and idle persons are most subject unto that use no exercise to stir natural heat or else choke it as too much wood puts out a fire Elixation Elixation is the seething of meat in the stomach by the said natural heat as meat is boiled in a pot to which corruption or putrefaction is opposite Assation Assation is a concoction of the inward moisture by heat his opposite is semiustulation Order of Concoction fourfold Besides these three several operations of digestion there is a fourfold order of concoction mastication or chewing in the mouth chilification of this so chewed meat in the stomach the third is in the liver to turn this chylus into blood called sanguification the last is assimilation which is in every part Expulsion Expulsion is a power of nutrition by which it expels all superfluous excrements and relics of meat and drink by the guts bladder pores as by purging vomiting spitting sweating urine hairs nails c Augmentation As this nutritive faculty serves to nourish the body so doth the augmenting faculty the second operation or power of the vegetal faculty to the increasing of it in quantity according to all dimensions long broad thick and to make it grow till it come to his due proportion and perfect shape which hath his period of augmentation as of consumption and that most certain as the poet observes Stat sua cuique dies breve et irreparabile tempus Omnibus est vitae A term of life is set to every man Which is but short and pass it no one can Generation The last of these vegetal faculties is generation which begets another by means of seed like unto itself to the perpetual preservation of the species To this faculty they ascribe three subordinate operations the first to turn nourishment into seed c Life and Death concomitants of the Vegetal Faculties Necessary concomitants or affections of this vegetal faculty are life and his privation death To the preservation of life the natural heat is most requisite though siccity and humidity and those first qualities be not excluded This heat is likewise in plants as appears by their increasing fructifying c though not so easily perceived In all bodies it must have radical nine hundred eighty one moisture to preserve it that it be not consumed to which preservation our clime country temperature and the good or bad use of those six non natural things avail much For as this natural heat and moisture decays so doth our life itself and if not prevented before by some violent accident or interrupted through our own default is in the end dried up by old age and extinguished by death for want of matter as a lamp for defect of oil to maintain it SUBSECT VI Of the sensible Soul Next in order is the sensible faculty which is as far beyond the other in dignity as a beast is preferred to a plant having those vegetal powers included in it Tis defined an Act of an organical body by which it lives hath sense appetite judgment breath and motion His object in general is a sensible or passible quality because the sense is affected with it The general organ is the brain from which principally the sensible operations are derived This sensible soul is divided into two parts apprehending or moving By the apprehensive power we perceive the species of sensible things present or absent and retain them as wax doth the print of a seal By the moving the body is outwardly carried from one place to another or inwardly moved by spirits and pulse The apprehensive faculty is subdivided into two parts inward or outward Outward as the five senses of touching hearing seeing smelling tasting to which you may add Scaliger s sixth sense of titillation if you please or that of speech which is the sixth external sense according to Lullius Inward are three common sense phantasy memory Those five outward senses have their object in outward things only and such as are present as the eye sees no colour except it be at hand the ear sound Three of these senses are of commodity hearing sight and smell two of necessity touch and taste without which we cannot live Besides the sensitive power is active or passive Active in sight the eye sees the colour passive when it is hurt by his object as the eye by the sunbeams According to that axiom visibile forte destruit sensum nine hundred eighty two Or if the object be not pleasing as a bad sound to the ear a stinking smell to the nose c Sight Of these five senses sight is held to be most precious and the best and that by reason of his object it sees the whole body at once By it we learn and discern all things a sense most excellent for use to the sight three things are required the object the organ and the medium The object in general is visible or that which is to be seen as colours and all shining bodies The medium is the illumination of the air which comes from nine hundred eighty three light commonly called diaphanum for in dark we cannot see The organ is the eye and chiefly the apple of it which by those optic nerves concurring both in one conveys the sight to the common sense Between the organ and object a true distance is required that it be not too near or too far off Many excellent questions appertain to this sense discussed by philosophers as whether this sight be caused intra mittendo vel extra mittendo c by receiving in the visible species or sending of them out which nine hundred eighty four Plato nine hundred eighty five Plutarch nine hundred eighty six Macrobius nine hundred eighty seven Lactantius and others dispute And besides it is the subject of the perspectives of which Alhazen the Arabian Vitellio Roger Bacon Baptista Porta Guidus Ubaldus Aquilonius c have written whole volumes Hearing Hearing a most excellent outward sense by which we learn and get knowledge His object is sound or that which is heard the medium air organ the ear To the sound which is a collision of the air three things are required a body to strike as the hand of a musician the body struck which must be solid and able to resist as a bell lute string not wool or sponge the medium the air which is inward or outward the outward being struck or collided by a solid body still strikes the next air until it come to that inward natural air which as an exquisite organ is contained in a little skin formed like a drum head and struck upon by certain small instruments like drum sticks conveys the sound by a pair of nerves appropriated to that use to the common sense as to a judge of sounds There is great variety and much delight in them for the knowledge of which consult with Boethius and other musicians Smelling Smelling is an outward sense which apprehends by the nostrils drawing in air and of all the rest it is the weakest sense in men The organ in the nose or two small hollow pieces of flesh a little above it the medium the air to men as water to fish the object smell arising from a mixed body resolved which whether it be a quality fume vapour or exhalation I will not now dispute or of their differences and how they are caused This sense is an organ of health as sight and hearing saith nine hundred eighty eight Agellius are of discipline and that by avoiding bad smells as by choosing good which do as much alter and affect the body many times as diet itself Taste Taste a necessary sense which perceives all savours by the tongue and palate and that by means of a thin spittle or watery juice His organ is the tongue with his tasting nerves the medium a watery juice the object taste or savour which is a quality in the juice arising from the mixture of things tasted Some make eight species or kinds of savour bitter sweet sharp salt c all which sick men as in an ague cannot discern by reason of their organs misaffected Touching Touch the last of the senses and most ignoble yet of as great necessity as the other and of as much pleasure This sense is exquisite in men and by his nerves dispersed all over the body perceives any tactile quality His organ the nerves his object those first qualities hot dry moist cold and those that follow them hard soft thick thin c Many delightsome questions are moved by philosophers about these five senses their organs objects mediums which for brevity I omit SUBSECT VII Of the Inward Senses Common Sense Inner senses are three in number so called because they be within the brainpan as common sense phantasy memory Their objects are not only things present but they perceive the sensible species of things to come past absent such as were before in the sense This common sense is the judge or moderator of the rest by whom we discern all differences of objects for by mine eye I do not know that I see or by mine ear that I hear but by my common sense who judgeth of sounds and colours they are but the organs to bring the species to be censured so that all their objects are his and all their offices are his The fore part of the brain is his organ or seat Phantasy Phantasy or imagination which some call estimative or cogitative confirmed saith nine hundred eighty nine Fernelius by frequent meditation is an inner sense which doth more fully examine the species perceived by common sense of things present or absent and keeps them longer recalling them to mind again or making new of his own In time of sleep this faculty is free and many times conceive strange stupend absurd shapes as in sick men we commonly observe His organ is the middle cell of the brain his objects all the species communicated to him by the common sense by comparison of which he feigns infinite other unto himself In melancholy men this faculty is most powerful and strong and often hurts producing many monstrous and prodigious things especially if it be stirred up by some terrible object presented to it from common sense or memory In poets and painters imagination forcibly works as appears by their several fictions antics images as Ovid s house of sleep Psyche s palace in Apuleius c In men it is subject and governed by reason or at least should be but in brutes it hath no superior and is ratio brutorum all the reason they have Memory Memory lays up all the species which the senses have brought in and records them as a good register that they may be forthcoming when they are called for by phantasy and reason His object is the same with phantasy his seat and organ the back part of the brain Affections of the Senses sleep and waking The affections of these senses are sleep and waking common to all sensible creatures Sleep is a rest or binding of the outward senses and of the common sense for the preservation of body and soul as Scaliger nine hundred ninety defines it for when the common sense resteth the outward senses rest also The phantasy alone is free and his commander reason as appears by those imaginary dreams which are of divers kinds natural divine demoniacal c which vary according to humours diet actions objects c of which Artemidorus Cardanus and Sambucus with their several interpretators have written great volumes This litigation of senses proceeds from an inhibition of spirits the way being stopped by which they should come this stopping is caused of vapours arising out of the stomach filling the nerves by which the spirits should be conveyed When these vapours are spent the passage is open and the spirits perform their accustomed duties so that waking is the action and motion of the senses which the spirits dispersed over all parts cause SUBSECT VIII Of the Moving Faculty Appetite This moving faculty is the other power of the sensitive soul which causeth all those inward and outward animal motions in the body It is divided into two faculties the power of appetite and of moving from place to place This of appetite is threefold so some will have it natural as it signifies any such inclination as of a stone to fall downward and such actions as retention expulsion which depend not on sense but are vegetal as the appetite of meat and drink hunger and thirst Sensitive is common to men and brutes Voluntary the third or intellective which commands the other two in men and is a curb unto them or at least should be but for the most part is captivated and overruled by them and men are led like beasts by sense giving reins to their concupiscence and several lusts For by this appetite the soul is led or inclined to follow that good which the senses shall approve or avoid that which they hold evil his object being good or evil the one he embraceth the other he rejecteth according to that aphorism Omnia appetunt bonum all things seek their own good or at least seeming good This power is inseparable from sense for where sense is there are likewise pleasure and pain His organ is the same with the common sense and is divided into two powers or inclinations concupiscible or irascible or as one nine hundred ninety one translates it coveting anger invading or impugning Concupiscible covets always pleasant and delightsome things and abhors that which is distasteful harsh and unpleasant Irascible quasi nine hundred ninety two aversans per iram et odium as avoiding it with anger and indignation All affections and perturbations arise out of these two fountains which although the stoics make light of we hold natural and not to be resisted The good affections are caused by some object of the same nature and if present they procure joy which dilates the heart and preserves the body if absent they cause hope love desire and concupiscence The bad are simple or mixed simple for some bad object present as sorrow which contracts the heart macerates the soul subverts the good estate of the body hindering all the operations of it causing melancholy and many times death itself or future as fear Out of these two arise those mixed affections and passions of anger which is a desire of revenge hatred which is inveterate anger zeal which is offended with him who hurts that he loves and Greek epikairekakia a compound affection of joy and hate when we rejoice at other men s mischief and are grieved at their prosperity pride self love emulation envy shame c of which elsewhere Moving from place to place is a faculty necessarily following the other For in vain were it otherwise to desire and to abhor if we had not likewise power to prosecute or eschew by moving the body from place to place by this faculty therefore we locally move the body or any part of it and go from one place to another To the better performance of which three things are requisite that which moves by what it moves that which is moved That which moves is either the efficient cause or end The end is the object which is desired or eschewed as in a dog to catch a hare c The efficient cause in man is reason or his subordinate phantasy which apprehends good or bad objects in brutes imagination alone which moves the appetite the appetite this faculty which by an admirable league of nature and by meditation of the spirit commands the organ by which it moves and that consists of nerves muscles cords dispersed through the whole body contracted and relaxed as the spirits will which move the muscles or nine hundred ninety three nerves in the midst of them and draw the cord and so per consequens the joint to the place intended That which is moved is the body or some member apt to move The motion of the body is divers as going running leaping dancing sitting and such like referred to the predicament of situs Worms creep birds fly fishes swim and so of parts the chief of which is respiration or breathing and is thus performed The outward air is drawn in by the vocal artery and sent by mediation of the midriff to the lungs which dilating themselves as a pair of bellows reciprocally fetch it in and send it out to the heart to cool it and from thence now being hot convey it again still taking in fresh Such a like motion is that of the pulse of which because many have written whole books I will say nothing SUBSECT IX Of the Rational Soul In the precedent subsections I have anatomised those inferior faculties of the soul the rational remaineth a pleasant but a doubtful subject as nine hundred ninety four one terms it and with the like brevity to be discussed Many erroneous opinions are about the essence and original of it whether it be fire as Zeno held harmony as Aristoxenus number as Xenocrates whether it be organical or inorganical seated in the brain heart or blood mortal or immortal how it comes into the body Some hold that it is ex traduce as Phil one de Anima Tertullian Lactantius de opific Dei cap nineteen Hugo lib de Spiritu et Anima Vincentius Bellavic spec natural lib twenty three cap two et eleven Hippocrates Avicenna and many nine hundred ninety five late writers that one man begets another body and soul or as a candle from a candle to be produced from the seed otherwise say they a man begets but half a man and is worse than a beast that begets both matter and form and besides the three faculties of the soul must be together infused which is most absurd as they hold because in beasts they are begot the two inferior I mean and may not be well separated in men nine hundred ninety six Galen supposeth the soul crasin esse to be the temperature itself Trismegistus Musaeus Orpheus Homer Pindarus Phaerecides Syrus Epictetus with the Chaldees and Egyptians affirmed the soul to be immortal as did those British nine hundred ninety seven Druids of old The nine hundred ninety eight Pythagoreans defend Metempsychosis and Palingenesia that souls go from one body to another epota prius Lethes unda as men into wolves bears dogs hogs as they were inclined in their lives or participated in conditions nine hundred ninety nine inque ferinas Possumus ire domus pecudumque in corpora condi one thousand Lucian s cock was first Euphorbus a captain Ille ego nam memini Trojani tempore belli Panthoides Euphorbus eram a horse a man a sponge ten oh one Julian the Apostate thought Alexander s soul was descended into his body Plato in Timaeo and in his Phaedon for aught I can perceive differs not much from this opinion that it was from God at first and knew all but being enclosed in the body it forgets and learns anew which he calls reminiscentia or recalling and that it was put into the body for a punishment and thence it goes into a beast s or man s as appears by his pleasant fiction de sortitione animarum lib ten de rep and after ten oh two ten thousand years is to return into the former body again ten oh three post varios annos per mille figuras Rursus ad humanae fertur primordia vitae Others deny the immortality of it which Pomponatus of Padua decided out of Aristotle not long since Plinias Avunculus cap one lib two et lib seven cap fifty five Seneca lib seven epist ad Lucilium epist fifty five Dicearchus in Tull Tusc Epicurus Aratus Hippocrates Galen Lucretius lib one Praeterea gigni pariter cum corpore et una Cresere sentimus pariterque senescere mentem ten oh four Averroes and I know not how many Neoterics ten oh five This question of the immortality of the soul is diversely and wonderfully impugned and disputed especially among the Italians of late saith Jab Colerus lib de immort animae cap one The popes themselves have doubted of it Leo Decimus that Epicurean pope as ten oh six some record of him caused this question to be discussed pro and con before him and concluded at last as a profane and atheistical moderator with that verse of Cornelius Gallus Et redit in nihilum quod fuit ante nihil It began of nothing and in nothing it ends Zeno and his Stoics as ten oh seven Austin quotes him supposed the soul so long to continue till the body was fully putrified and resolved into materia prima but after that in fumos evanescere to be extinguished and vanished and in the meantime whilst the body was consuming it wandered all abroad et e longinquo multa annunciare and as that Clazomenian Hermotimus averred saw pretty visions and suffered I know not what ten oh eight Errant exangues sine corpore et ossibus umbrae Others grant the immortality thereof but they make many fabulous fictions in the meantime of it after the departure from the body like Plato s Elysian fields and that Turkey paradise The souls of good men they deified the bad saith ten oh nine Austin became devils as they supposed with many such absurd tenets which he hath confuted Hierome Austin and other Fathers of the church hold that the soul is immortal created of nothing and so infused into the child or embryo in his mother s womb six months after the ten ten conception not as those of brutes which are ex traduce and dying with them vanish into nothing To whose divine treatises and to the Scriptures themselves I rejourn all such atheistical spirits as Tully did Atticus doubting of this point to Plato s Phaedon Or if they desire philosophical proofs and demonstrations I refer them to Niphus Nic Faventinus tracts of this subject To Fran and John Picus in digress sup three de Anima Tholosanus Eugubinus To Soto Canas Thomas Peresius Dandinus Colerus to that elaborate tract in Zanchius to Tolet s Sixty Reasons and Lessius Twenty two Arguments to prove the immortality of the soul Campanella lib de sensu rerum is large in the same discourse Albertinus the Schoolman Jacob Nactantus tom two op handleth it in four questions Antony Brunus Aonius Palearius Marinus Marcennus with many others This reasonable soul which Austin calls a spiritual substance moving itself is defined by philosophers to be the first substantial act of a natural humane organical body by which a man lives perceives and understands freely doing all things and with election Out of which definition we may gather that this rational soul includes the powers and performs the duties of the two other which are contained in it and all three faculties make one soul which is inorganical of itself although it be in all parts and incorporeal using their organs and working by them It is divided into two chief parts differing in office only not in essence The understanding which is the rational power apprehending the will which is the rational power moving to which two all the other rational powers are subject and reduced SUBSECT X Of the Understanding Understanding is a power of the soul ten eleven by which we perceive know remember and judge as well singulars as universals having certain innate notices or beginnings of arts a reflecting action by which it judgeth of his own doings and examines them Out of this definition besides his chief office which is to apprehend judge all that he performs without the help of any instruments or organs three differences appear betwixt a man and a beast As first the sense only comprehends singularities the understanding universalities Secondly the sense hath no innate notions Thirdly brutes cannot reflect upon themselves Bees indeed make neat and curious works and many other creatures besides but when they have done they cannot judge of them His object is God ens all nature and whatsoever is to be understood which successively it apprehends The object first moving the understanding is some sensible thing after by discoursing the mind finds out the corporeal substance and from thence the spiritual His actions some say are apprehension composition division discoursing reasoning memory which some include in invention and judgment The common divisions are of the understanding agent and patient speculative and practical in habit or in act simple or compound The agent is that which is called the wit of man acumen or subtlety sharpness of invention when he doth invent of himself without a teacher or learns anew which abstracts those intelligible species from the phantasy and transfers them to the passive understanding ten twelve because there is nothing in the understanding which was not first in the sense That which the imagination hath taken from the sense this agent judgeth of whether it be true or false and being so judged he commits it to the passible to be kept The agent is a doctor or teacher the passive a scholar and his office is to keep and further judge of such things as are committed to his charge as a bare and rased table at first capable of all forms and notions Now these notions are twofold actions or habits actions by which we take notions of and perceive things habits which are durable lights and notions which we may use when we will Some reckon up eight kinds of them sense experience intelligence faith suspicion error opinion science to which are added art prudency wisdom as also ten thirteen synteresis dictamen rationis conscience so that in all there be fourteen species of the understanding of which some are innate as the three last mentioned the other are gotten by doctrine learning and use Plato will have all to be innate Aristotle reckons up but five intellectual habits two practical as prudency whose end is to practise to fabricate wisdom to comprehend the use and experiments of all notions and habits whatsoever Which division of Aristotle if it be considered aright is all one with the precedent for three being innate and five acquisite the rest are improper imperfect and in a more strict examination excluded Of all these I should more amply dilate but my subject will not permit Three of them I will only point at as more necessary to my following discourse Synteresis or the purer part of the conscience is an innate habit and doth signify a conversation of the knowledge of the law of God and Nature to know good or evil And as our divines hold it is rather in the understanding than in the will This makes the major proposition in a practical syllogism The dictamen rationis is that which doth admonish us to do good or evil and is the minor in the syllogism The conscience is that which approves good or evil justifying or condemning our actions and is the conclusion of the syllogism as in that familiar example of Regulus the Roman taken prisoner by the Carthaginians and suffered to go to Rome on that condition he should return again or pay so much for his ransom The synteresis proposeth the question his word oath promise is to be religiously kept although to his enemy and that by the law of nature ten fourteen Do not that to another which thou wouldst not have done to thyself Dictamen applies it to him and dictates this or the like Regulus thou wouldst not another man should falsify his oath or break promise with thee conscience concludes therefore Regulus thou dost well to perform thy promise and oughtest to keep thine oath More of this in Religious Melancholy SUBSECT XI Of the Will Will is the other power of the rational soul ten fifteen which covets or avoids such things as have been before judged and apprehended by the understanding If good it approves if evil it abhors it so that his object is either good or evil Aristotle calls this our rational appetite for as in the sensitive we are moved to good or bad by our appetite ruled and directed by sense so in this we are carried by reason Besides the sensitive appetite hath a particular object good or bad this an universal immaterial that respects only things delectable and pleasant this honest Again they differ in liberty The sensual appetite seeing an object if it be a convenient good cannot but desire it if evil avoid it but this is free in his essence ten sixteen much now depraved obscured and fallen from his first perfection yet in some of his operations still free as to go walk move at his pleasure and to choose whether it will do or not do steal or not steal Otherwise in vain were laws deliberations exhortations counsels precepts rewards promises threats and punishments and God should be the author of sin But in ten seventeen spiritual things we will no good prone to evil except we be regenerate and led by the Spirit we are egged on by our natural concupiscence and there is Greek ataxia a confusion in our powers ten eighteen our whole will is averse from God and his law not in natural things only as to eat and drink lust to which we are led headlong by our temperature and inordinate appetite ten nineteen Nec nos obniti contra nec tendere tantum Sufficimus we cannot resist our concupiscence is originally bad our heart evil the seat of our affections captivates and enforceth our will So that in voluntary things we are averse from God and goodness bad by nature by ten twenty ignorance worse by art discipline custom we get many bad habits suffering them to domineer and tyrannise over us and the devil is still ready at hand with his evil suggestions to tempt our depraved will to some ill disposed action to precipitate us to destruction except our will be swayed and counterpoised again with some divine precepts and good motions of the spirit which many times restrain hinder and check us when we are in the full career of our dissolute courses So David corrected himself when he had Saul at a vantage Revenge and malice were as two violent oppugners on the one side but honesty religion fear of God withheld him on the other The actions of the will are velle and nolle to will and nill which two words comprehend all and they are good or bad accordingly as they are directed and some of them freely performed by himself although the stoics absolutely deny it and will have all things inevitably done by destiny imposing a fatal necessity upon us which we may not resist yet we say that our will is free in respect of us and things contingent howsoever in respect of God s determinate counsel they are inevitable and necessary Some other actions of the will are performed by the inferior powers which obey him as the sensitive and moving appetite as to open our eyes to go hither and thither not to touch a book to speak fair or foul but this appetite is many times rebellious in us and will not be contained within the lists of sobriety and temperance It was as I said once well agreeing with reason and there was an excellent consent and harmony between them but that is now dissolved they often jar reason is overborne by passion Fertur equis auriga nec audit currus habenas as so many wild horses run away with a chariot and will not be curbed We know many times what is good but will not do it as she said ten twenty one Trahit invitum nova vis aliudque cupido Mens aliud suadet Lust counsels one thing reason another there is a new reluctancy in men ten twenty two Odi nec possum cupiens non esse quod odi We cannot resist but as Phaedra confessed to her nurse ten twenty three quae loqueris vera sunt sed furor suggerit sequi pejora she said well and true she did acknowledge it but headstrong passion and fury made her to do that which was opposite So David knew the filthiness of his fact what a loathsome foul crying sin adultery was yet notwithstanding he would commit murder and take away another man s wife enforced against reason religion to follow his appetite Those natural and vegetal powers are not commanded by will at all for who can add one cubit to his stature These other may but are not and thence come all those headstrong passions violent perturbations of the mind and many times vicious habits customs feral diseases because we give so much way to our appetite and follow our inclination like so many beasts The principal habits are two in number virtue and vice whose peculiar definitions descriptions differences and kinds are handled at large in the ethics and are indeed the subject of moral philosophy MEMB III SUBSECT I Definition of Melancholy Name Difference Having thus briefly anatomised the body and soul of man as a preparative to the rest I may now freely proceed to treat of my intended object to most men s capacity and after many ambages perspicuously define what this melancholy is show his name and differences The name is imposed from the matter and disease denominated from the material cause as Bruel observes Greek Melancholia quasi Greek Melainacholae from black choler And whether it be a cause or an effect a disease or symptom let Donatus Altomarus and Salvianus decide I will not contend about it It hath several descriptions notations and definitions ten twenty four Fracastorius in his second book of intellect calls those melancholy whom abundance of that same depraved humour of black choler hath so misaffected that they become mad thence and dote in most things or in all belonging to election will or other manifest operations of the understanding ten twenty five Melanelius out of Galen Ruffus Aetius describe it to be a bad and peevish disease which makes men degenerate into beasts Galen a privation or infection of the middle cell of the head c defining it from the part affected which ten twenty six Hercules de Saxonia approves lib one cap sixteen calling it a depravation of the principal function Fuschius lib one cap twenty three Arnoldus Breviar lib one cap eighteen Guianerius and others By reason of black choler Paulus adds Halyabbas simply calls it a commotion of the mind Aretaeus ten twenty seven a perpetual anguish of the soul fastened on one thing without an ague which definition of his Mercurialis de affect cap lib one cap ten taxeth but Aelianus Montaltus defends lib de morb cap one de Melan for sufficient and good The common sort define it to be a kind of dotage without a fever having for his ordinary companions fear and sadness without any apparent occasion So doth Laurentius cap four Piso lib one cap forty three Donatus Altomarus cap seven art medic Jacchinus in com in lib nine Rhasis ad Almansor cap fifteen Valesius exerc seventeen Fuschius institut three sec one c eleven c which common definition howsoever approved by most ten twenty eight Hercules de Saxonia will not allow of nor David Crucius Theat morb Herm lib two cap six he holds it insufficient as ten twenty nine rather showing what it is not than what it is as omitting the specific difference the phantasy and brain but I descend to particulars The summum genus is dotage or anguish of the mind saith Aretaeus of the principal parts Hercules de Saxonia adds to distinguish it from cramp and palsy and such diseases as belong to the outward sense and motions depraved ten thirty to distinguish it from folly and madness which Montaltus makes angor animi to separate in which those functions are not depraved but rather abolished without an ague is added by all to sever it from frenzy and that melancholy which is in a pestilent fever Fear and sorrow make it differ from madness without a cause is lastly inserted to specify it from all other ordinary passions of fear and sorrow We properly call that dotage as ten thirty one Laurentius interprets it when some one principal faculty of the mind as imagination or reason is corrupted as all melancholy persons have It is without a fever because the humour is most part cold and dry contrary to putrefaction Fear and sorrow are the true characters and inseparable companions of most melancholy not all as Her de Saxonia Tract de posthumo de Melancholia cap two well excepts for to some it is most pleasant as to such as laugh most part some are bold again and free from all manner of fear and grief as hereafter shall be declared SUBSECT II Of the part affected Affection Parties affected Some difference I find amongst writers about the principal part affected in this disease whether it be the brain or heart or some other member Most are of opinion that it is the brain for being a kind of dotage it cannot otherwise be but that the brain must be affected as a similar part be it by ten thirty two consent or essence not in his ventricles or any obstructions in them for then it would be an apoplexy or epilepsy as ten thirty three Laurentius well observes but in a cold dry distemperature of it in his substance which is corrupt and become too cold or too dry or else too hot as in madmen and such as are inclined to it and this ten thirty four Hippocrates confirms Galen the Arabians and most of our new writers Marcus de Oddis in a consultation of his quoted by ten thirty five Hildesheim and five others there cited are of the contrary part because fear and sorrow which are passions be seated in the heart But this objection is sufficiently answered by ten thirty six Montaltus who doth not deny that the heart is affected as ten thirty seven Melanelius proves out of Galen by reason of his vicinity and so is the midriff and many other parts They do compati and have a fellow feeling by the law of nature but forasmuch as this malady is caused by precedent imagination with the appetite to whom spirits obey and are subject to those principal parts the brain must needs primarily be misaffected as the seat of reason and then the heart as the seat of affection ten thirty eight Capivaccius and Mercurialis have copiously discussed this question and both conclude the subject is the inner brain and from thence it is communicated to the heart and other inferior parts which sympathise and are much troubled especially when it comes by consent and is caused by reason of the stomach or mirach as the Arabians term it whole body liver or ten thirty nine spleen which are seldom free pylorus mesaraic veins c For our body is like a clock if one wheel be amiss all the rest are disordered the whole fabric suffers with such admirable art and harmony is a man composed such excellent proportion as Ludovicus Vives in his Fable of Man hath elegantly declared As many doubts almost arise about the ten forty affection whether it be imagination or reason alone or both Hercules de Saxonia proves it out of Galen Aetius and Altomarus that the sole fault is in ten forty one imagination Bruel is of the same mind Montaltus in his two cap of Melancholy confutes this tenet of theirs and illustrates the contrary by many examples as of him that thought himself a shellfish of a nun and of a desperate monk that would not be persuaded but that he was damned reason was in fault as well as imagination which did not correct this error they make away themselves oftentimes and suppose many absurd and ridiculous things Why doth not reason detect the fallacy settle and persuade if she be free ten forty two Avicenna therefore holds both corrupt to whom most Arabians subscribe The same is maintained by ten forty three Areteus ten forty four Gorgonius Guianerius c To end the controversy no man doubts of imagination but that it is hurt and misaffected here for the other I determine with ten forty five Albertinus Bottonus a doctor of Padua that it is first in imagination and afterwards in reason if the disease be inveterate or as it is more or less of continuance but by accident as ten forty six Herc de Saxonia adds faith opinion discourse ratiocination are all accidentally depraved by the default of imagination Parties affected To the part affected I may here add the parties which shall be more opportunely spoken of elsewhere now only signified Such as have the moon Saturn Mercury misaffected in their genitures such as live in over cold or over hot climes such as are born of melancholy parents as offend in those six non natural things are black or of a high sanguine complexion ten forty seven that have little heads that have a hot heart moist brain hot liver and cold stomach have been long sick such as are solitary by nature great students given to much contemplation lead a life out of action are most subject to melancholy Of sexes both but men more often yet ten forty eight women misaffected are far more violent and grievously troubled Of seasons of the year the autumn is most melancholy Of peculiar times old age from which natural melancholy is almost an inseparable accident but this artificial malady is more frequent in such as are of a ten forty nine middle age Some assign forty years Gariopontus thirty Jubertus excepts neither young nor old from this adventitious Daniel Sennertus involves all of all sorts out of common experience ten fifty in omnibus omnino corporibus cujuscunque constitutionis dominatar Aetius and Aretius ten fifty one ascribe into the number not only ten fifty two discontented passionate and miserable persons swarthy black but such as are most merry and pleasant scoffers and high coloured Generally saith Rhasis ten fifty three the finest wits and most generous spirits are before other obnoxious to it I cannot except any complexion any condition sex or age but ten fifty four fools and stoics which according to ten fifty five Synesius are never troubled with any manner of passion but as Anacreon s cicada sine sanguine et dolore similes fere diis sunt Erasmus vindicates fools from this melancholy catalogue because they have most part moist brains and light hearts ten fifty six they are free from ambition envy shame and fear they are neither troubled in conscience nor macerated with cares to which our whole life is most subject SUBSECT III Of the Matter of Melancholy Of the matter of melancholy there is much question betwixt Avicen and Galen as you may read in ten fifty seven Cardan s Contradictions ten fifty eight Valesius Controversies Montanus Prosper Calenus Capivaccius ten fifty nine Bright ten sixty Ficinus that have written either whole tracts or copiously of it in their several treatises of this subject ten sixty one What this humour is or whence it proceeds how it is engendered in the body neither Galen nor any old writer hath sufficiently discussed as Jacchinus thinks the Neoterics cannot agree Montanus in his Consultations holds melancholy to be material or immaterial and so doth Arculanus the material is one of the four humours before mentioned and natural The immaterial or adventitious acquisite redundant unnatural artificial which ten sixty two Hercules de Saxonia will have reside in the spirits alone and to proceed from a hot cold dry moist distemperature which without matter alter the brain and functions of it Paracelsus wholly rejects and derides this division of four humours and complexions but our Galenists generally approve of it subscribing to this opinion of Montanus This material melancholy is either simple or mixed offending in quantity or quality varying according to his place where it settleth as brain spleen mesaraic veins heart womb and stomach or differing according to the mixture of those natural humours amongst themselves or four unnatural adust humours as they are diversely tempered and mingled If natural melancholy abound in the body which is cold and dry so that it be more ten sixty three than the body is well able to bear it must needs be distempered saith Faventius and diseased and so the other if it be depraved whether it arise from that other melancholy of choler adust or from blood produceth the like effects and is as Montaltus contends if it come by adustion of humours most part hot and dry Some difference I find whether this melancholy matter may be engendered of all four humours about the colour and temper of it Galen holds it may be engendered of three alone excluding phlegm or pituita whose true assertion ten sixty four Valesius and Menardus stiffly maintain and so doth ten sixty five Fuschius Montaltus ten sixty six Montanus How say they can white become black But Hercules de Saxonia lib post de mela c eight and ten sixty seven Cardan are of the opposite part it may be engendered of phlegm etsi raro contingat though it seldom come to pass so is ten sixty eight Guianerius and Laurentius c one with Melanct in his book de Anima and Chap of Humours he calls it asininam dull swinish melancholy and saith that he was an eyewitness of it so is ten sixty nine Wecker From melancholy adust ariseth one kind from choler another which is most brutish another from phlegm which is dull and the last from blood which is best Of these some are cold and dry others hot and dry ten seventy varying according to their mixtures as they are intended and remitted And indeed as Rodericus a Fons cons twelve l one determines ichors and those serous matters being thickened become phlegm and phlegm degenerates into choler choler adust becomes aeruginosa melancholia as vinegar out of purest wine putrified or by exhalation of purer spirits is so made and becomes sour and sharp and from the sharpness of this humour proceeds much waking troublesome thoughts and dreams c so that I conclude as before If the humour be cold it is saith ten seventy one Faventinus a cause of dotage and produceth milder symptoms if hot they are rash raving mad or inclining to it If the brain be hot the animal spirits are hot much madness follows with violent actions if cold fatuity and sottishness ten seventy two Capivaccius ten seventy three The colour of this mixture varies likewise according to the mixture be it hot or cold tis sometimes black sometimes not Altomarus The same ten seventy four Melanelius proves out of Galen and Hippocrates in his Book of Melancholy if at least it be his giving instance in a burning coal which when it is hot shines when it is cold looks black and so doth the humour This diversity of melancholy matter produceth diversity of effects If it be within the ten seventy five body and not putrified it causeth black jaundice if putrified a quartan ague if it break out to the skin leprosy if to parts several maladies as scurvy c If it trouble the mind as it is diversely mixed it produceth several kinds of madness and dotage of which in their place SUBSECT IV Of the species or kinds of Melancholy When the matter is divers and confused how should it otherwise be but that the species should be divers and confused Many new and old writers have spoken confusedly of it confounding melancholy and madness as ten seventy six Heurnius Guianerius Gordonius Salustius Salvianus Jason Pratensis Savanarola that will have madness no other than melancholy in extent differing as I have said in degrees Some make two distinct species as Ruffus Ephesius an old writer Constantinus Africanus Aretaeus ten seventy seven Aurelianus ten seventy eight Paulus Aegineta others acknowledge a multitude of kinds and leave them indefinite as Aetius in his Tetrabiblos ten seventy nine Avicenna lib three Fen one Tract four cap eighteen Arculanus cap sixteen in nine Rasis Montanus med part one ten eighty If natural melancholy be adust it maketh one kind if blood another if choler a third differing from the first and so many several opinions there are about the kinds as there be men themselves ten eighty one Hercules de Saxonia sets down two kinds material and immaterial one from spirits alone the other from humours and spirits Savanarola Rub eleven Tract six cap one de aegritud capitis will have the kinds to be infinite one from the mirach called myrachialis of the Arabians another stomachalis from the stomach another from the liver heart womb haemorrhoids ten eighty two one beginning another consummate Melancthon seconds him ten eighty three as the humour is diversely adust and mixed so are the species divers but what these men speak of species I think ought to be understood of symptoms and so doth ten eighty four Arculanus interpret himself infinite species id est symptoms and in that sense as Jo Gorrheus acknowledgeth in his medicinal definitions the species are infinite but they may be reduced to three kinds by reason of their seat head body and hypochrondries This threefold division is approved by Hippocrates in his Book of Melancholy if it be his which some suspect by Galen lib three de loc affectis cap six by Alexander lib one cap sixteen Rasis lib one Continent Tract nine lib one cap sixteen Avicenna and most of our new writers Th Erastus makes two kinds one perpetual which is head melancholy the other interrupt which comes and goes by fits which he subdivides into the other two kinds so that all comes to the same pass Some again make four or five kinds with Rodericus a Castro de morbis mulier lib two cap three and Lod Mercatus who in his second book de mulier affect cap four will have that melancholy of nuns widows and more ancient maids to be a peculiar species of melancholy differing from the rest some will reduce enthusiasts ecstatical and demoniacal persons to this rank adding ten eighty five love melancholy to the first and lycanthropia The most received division is into three kinds The first proceeds from the sole fault of the brain and is called head melancholy the second sympathetically proceeds from the whole body when the whole temperature is melancholy the third ariseth from the bowels liver spleen or membrane called mesenterium named hypochondriacal or windy melancholy which ten eighty six Laurentius subdivides into three parts from those three members hepatic splenetic mesaraic Love melancholy which Avicenna calls ilishi and Lycanthropia which he calls cucubuthe are commonly included in head melancholy but of this last which Gerardus de Solo calls amoreus and most knight melancholy with that of religious melancholy virginum et viduarum maintained by Rod a Castro and Mercatus and the other kinds of love melancholy I will speak of apart by themselves in my third partition The three precedent species are the subject of my present discourse which I will anatomise and treat of through all their causes symptoms cures together and apart that every man that is in any measure affected with this malady may know how to examine it in himself and apply remedies unto it It is a hard matter I confess to distinguish these three species one from the other to express their several causes symptoms cures being that they are so often confounded amongst themselves having such affinity that they can scarce be discerned by the most accurate physicians and so often intermixed with other diseases that the best experienced have been plunged Montanus consil twenty six names a patient that had this disease of melancholy and caninus appetitus both together and consil twenty three with vertigo ten eighty seven Julius Caesar Claudinus with stone gout jaundice Trincavellius with an ague jaundice caninus appetitus c ten eighty eight Paulus Regoline a great doctor in his time consulted in this case was so confounded with a confusion of symptoms that he knew not to what kind of melancholy to refer it ten eighty nine Trincavellius Fallopius and Francanzanus famous doctors in Italy all three conferred with about one party at the same time gave three different opinions And in another place Trincavellius being demanded what he thought of a melancholy young man to whom he was sent for ingenuously confessed that he was indeed melancholy but he knew not to what kind to reduce it In his seventeenth consultation there is the like disagreement about a melancholy monk Those symptoms which others ascribe to misaffected parts and humours ten ninety Herc de Saxonia attributes wholly to distempered spirits and those immaterial as I have said Sometimes they cannot well discern this disease from others In Reinerus Solenander s counsels Sect consil five he and doctor Brande both agreed that the patient s disease was hypochondriacal melancholy doctor Matholdus said it was asthma and nothing else ten ninety one Solenander and Guarionius lately sent for to the melancholy Duke of Cleve with others could not define what species it was or agree amongst themselves The species are so confounded as in Caesar Claudinus his forty fourth consultation for a Polonian Count in his judgment ten ninety two he laboured of head melancholy and that which proceeds from the whole temperature both at once I could give instance of some that have had all three kinds semel et simul and some successively So that I conclude of our melancholy species as ten ninety three many politicians do of their pure forms of commonwealths monarchies aristocracies democracies are most famous in contemplation but in practice they are temperate and usually mixed so ten ninety four Polybius informeth us as the Lacedaemonian the Roman of old German now and many others What physicians say of distinct species in their books it much matters not since that in their patients bodies they are commonly mixed In such obscurity therefore variety and confused mixture of symptoms causes how difficult a thing is it to treat of several kinds apart to make any certainty or distinction among so many casualties distractions when seldom two men shall be like effected per omnia Tis hard I confess yet nevertheless I will adventure through the midst of these perplexities and led by the clue or thread of the best writers extricate myself out of a labyrinth of doubts and errors and so proceed to the causes SECT II MEMB I SUBSECT I Causes of Melancholy God a cause It is in vain to speak of cures or think of remedies until such time as we have considered of the causes so ten ninety five Galen prescribes Glauco and the common experience of others confirms that those cures must be imperfect lame and to no purpose wherein the causes have not first been searched as ten ninety six Prosper Calenius well observes in his tract de atra bile to Cardinal Caesius Insomuch that ten ninety seven Fernelius puts a kind of necessity in the knowledge of the causes and without which it is impossible to cure or prevent any manner of disease Empirics may ease and sometimes help but not thoroughly root out sublata causa tollitur effectus as the saying is if the cause be removed the effect is likewise vanquished It is a most difficult thing I confess to be able to discern these causes whence they are and in such ten ninety eight variety to say what the beginning was ten ninety nine He is happy that can perform it aright I will adventure to guess as near as I can and rip them all up from the first to the last general and particular to every species that so they may the better be described General causes are either supernatural or natural Supernatural are from God and his angels or by God s permission from the devil and his ministers That God himself is a cause for the punishment of sin and satisfaction of his justice many examples and testimonies of holy Scriptures make evident unto us Ps cvii seventeen Foolish men are plagued for their offence and by reason of their wickedness Gehazi was stricken with leprosy two Reg v twenty seven Jehoram with dysentery and flux and great diseases of the bowels two Chron xxi fifteen David plagued for numbering his people one Par twenty one Sodom and Gomorrah swallowed up And this disease is peculiarly specified Psalm cxxvii twelve He brought down their heart through heaviness Deut xxviii twenty eight He struck them with madness blindness and astonishment of heart eleven hundred An evil spirit was sent by the Lord upon Saul to vex him eleven oh one Nebuchadnezzar did eat grass like an ox and his heart was made like the beasts of the field Heathen stories are full of such punishments Lycurgus because he cut down the vines in the country was by Bacchus driven into madness so was Pentheus and his mother Agave for neglecting their sacrifice eleven oh two Censor Fulvius ran mad for untiling Juno s temple to cover a new one of his own which he had dedicated to Fortune eleven oh three and was confounded to death with grief and sorrow of heart When Xerxes would have spoiled eleven oh four Apollo s temple at Delphos of those infinite riches it possessed a terrible thunder came from heaven and struck four thousand men dead the rest ran mad eleven oh five A little after the like happened to Brennus lightning thunder earthquakes upon such a sacrilegious occasion If we may believe our pontifical writers they will relate unto us many strange and prodigious punishments in this kind inflicted by their saints How eleven oh six Clodoveus sometime king of France the son of Dagobert lost his wits for uncovering the body of saint Denis and how a eleven oh seven sacrilegious Frenchman that would have stolen a silver image of saint John at Birgburge became frantic on a sudden raging and tyrannising over his own flesh of a eleven oh eight Lord of Rhadnor that coming from hunting late at night put his dogs into saint Avan s church Llan Avan they called it and rising betimes next morning as hunters use to do found all his dogs mad himself being suddenly strucken blind Of Tyridates an eleven oh nine Armenian king for violating some holy nuns that was punished in like sort with loss of his wits But poets and papists may go together for fabulous tales let them free their own credits howsoever they feign of their Nemesis and of their saints or by the devil s means may be deluded we find it true that ultor a tergo Deus eleven ten He is God the avenger as David styles him and that it is our crying sins that pull this and many other maladies on our own heads That he can by his angels which are his ministers strike and heal saith eleven eleven Dionysius whom he will that he can plague us by his creatures sun moon and stars which he useth as his instruments as a husbandman saith Zanchius doth a hatchet hail snow winds c eleven twelve Et conjurati veniunt in classica venti as in Joshua s time as in Pharaoh s reign in Egypt they are but as so many executioners of his justice He can make the proudest spirits stoop and cry out with Julian the Apostate Vicisti Galilaee or with Apollo s priest in eleven thirteen Chrysostom O coelum o terra unde hostis hic What an enemy is this And pray with David acknowledging his power I am weakened and sore broken I roar for the grief of mine heart mine heart panteth c Psalm xxxviii eight O Lord rebuke me not in thine anger neither chastise me in thy wrath Psalm xxxviii one Make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice Psalm li eight and verse twelve Restore to me the joy of thy salvation and stablish me with thy free spirit For these causes belike eleven fourteen Hippocrates would have a physician take special notice whether the disease come not from a divine supernatural cause or whether it follow the course of nature But this is farther discussed by Fran Valesius de sacr philos cap eight eleven fifteen Fernelius and eleven sixteen J Caesar Claudinus to whom I refer you how this place of Hippocrates is to be understood Paracelsus is of opinion that such spiritual diseases for so he calls them are spiritually to be cured and not otherwise Ordinary means in such cases will not avail Non est reluctandum cum Deo we must not struggle with God When that monster taming Hercules overcame all in the Olympics Jupiter at last in an unknown shape wrestled with him the victory was uncertain till at length Jupiter descried himself and Hercules yielded No striving with supreme powers Nil juvat immensos Cratero promittere montes physicians and physic can do no good eleven seventeen we must submit ourselves unto the mighty hand of God acknowledge our offences call to him for mercy If he strike us una eademque manus vulnus opemque feret as it is with them that are wounded with the spear of Achilles he alone must help otherwise our diseases are incurable and we not to be relieved SUBSECT II A Digression of the nature of Spirits bad Angels or Devils and how they cause Melancholy How far the power of spirits and devils doth extend and whether they can cause this or any other disease is a serious question and worthy to be considered for the better understanding of which I will make a brief digression of the nature of spirits And although the question be very obscure according to eleven eighteen Postellus full of controversy and ambiguity beyond the reach of human capacity fateor excedere vires intentionis meae saith eleven nineteen Austin I confess I am not able to understand it finitum de infinito non potest statuere we can sooner determine with Tully de nat deorum quid non sint quam quid sint our subtle schoolmen Cardans Scaligers profound Thomists Fracastoriana and Ferneliana acies are weak dry obscure defective in these mysteries and all our quickest wits as an owl s eyes at the sun s light wax dull and are not sufficient to apprehend them yet as in the rest I will adventure to say something to this point In former times as we read Acts xxiii the Sadducees denied that there were any such spirits devils or angels So did Galen the physician the Peripatetics even Aristotle himself as Pomponatius stoutly maintains and Scaliger in some sort grants Though Dandinus the Jesuit com in lib two de anima stiffly denies it substantiae separatae and intelligences are the same which Christians call angels and Platonists devils for they name all the spirits daemones be they good or bad angels as Julius Pollux Onomasticon lib one cap one observes Epicures and atheists are of the same mind in general because they never saw them Plato Plotinus Porphyrius Jamblichus Proclus insisting in the steps of Trismegistus Pythagoras and Socrates make no doubt of it nor Stoics but that there are such spirits though much erring from the truth Concerning the first beginning of them the eleven twenty Talmudists say that Adam had a wife called Lilis before he married Eve and of her he begat nothing but devils The Turks eleven twenty one Alcoran is altogether as absurd and ridiculous in this point but the Scripture informs us Christians how Lucifer the chief of them with his associates eleven twenty two fell from heaven for his pride and ambition created of God placed in heaven and sometimes an angel of light now cast down into the lower aerial sublunary parts or into hell and delivered into chains of darkness two Pet ii four to be kept unto damnation Nature of Devils There is a foolish opinion which some hold that they are the souls of men departed good and more noble were deified the baser grovelled on the ground or in the lower parts and were devils the which with Tertullian Porphyrius the philosopher M Tyrius ser twenty seven maintains These spirits he eleven twenty three saith which we call angels and devils are nought but souls of men departed which either through love and pity of their friends yet living help and assist them or else persecute their enemies whom they hated as Dido threatened to persecute Aeneas Omnibus umbra locis adero dabis improbe poenas My angry ghost arising from the deep Shall haunt thee waking and disturb thy sleep At least my shade thy punishment shall know And Fame shall spread the pleasing news below They are as others suppose appointed by those higher powers to keep men from their nativity and to protect or punish them as they see cause and are called boni et mali Genii by the Romans Heroes lares if good lemures or larvae if bad by the stoics governors of countries men cities saith eleven twenty four Apuleius Deos appellant qui ex hominum numero juste ac prudenter vitae curriculo gubernato pro numine postea ab hominibus praediti fanis et ceremoniis vulgo admittuntur ut in Aegypto Osyris c Praestites Capella calls them which protected particular men as well as princes Socrates had his Daemonium Saturninum et ignium which of all spirits is best ad sublimes cogitationes animum erigentem as the Platonists supposed Plotinus his and we Christians our assisting angel as Andreas Victorellus a copious writer of this subject Lodovicus de La Cerda the Jesuit in his voluminous tract de Angelo Custode Zanchius and some divines think But this absurd tenet of Tyreus Proclus confutes at large in his book de Anima et daemone Psellus eleven twenty five a Christian and sometimes tutor saith Cuspinian to Michael Parapinatius Emperor of Greece a great observer of the nature of devils holds they are corporeal eleven twenty six and have aerial bodies that they are mortal live and die which Martianus Capella likewise maintains but our Christian philosophers explode that they eleven twenty seven are nourished and have excrements they feel pain if they be hurt which Cardan confirms and Scaliger justly laughs him to scorn for Si pascantur aere cur non pugnant ob puriorem aera c or stroken and if their bodies be cut with admirable celerity they come together again Austin in general lib iii lib arbit approves as much mutata casu corpora in deteriorem qualitatem aeris spissioris so doth Hierome Comment in epist ad Ephes cap three Origen Tertullian Lactantius and many ancient Fathers of the Church that in their fall their bodies were changed into a more aerial and gross substance Bodine lib four Theatri Naturae and David Crusius Hermeticae Philosophiae lib one cap four by several arguments proves angels and spirits to be corporeal quicquid continetur in loco corporeum est At spiritus continetur in loco ergo eleven twenty eight Si spiritus sunt quanti erunt corporei At sunt quanti ergo sunt finiti ergo quanti c Bodine eleven twenty nine goes farther yet and will have these Animae separatae genii spirits angels devils and so likewise souls of men departed if corporeal which he most eagerly contends to be of some shape and that absolutely round like Sun and Moon because that is the most perfect form quae nihil habet asperitatis nihil angulis incisum nihil anfractibus involutem nihil eminens sed inter corpora perfecta est perfectissimum eleven thirty therefore all spirits are corporeal he concludes and in their proper shapes round That they can assume other aerial bodies all manner of shapes at their pleasures appear in what likeness they will themselves that they are most swift in motion can pass many miles in an instant and so likewise eleven thirty one transform bodies of others into what shape they please and with admirable celerity remove them from place to place as the Angel did Habakkuk to Daniel and as Philip the deacon was carried away by the Spirit when he had baptised the eunuch so did Pythagoras and Apollonius remove themselves and others with many such feats that they can represent castles in the air palaces armies spectrums prodigies and such strange objects to mortal men s eyes eleven thirty two cause smells savours c deceive all the senses most writers of this subject credibly believe and that they can foretell future events and do many strange miracles Juno s image spake to Camillus and Fortune s statue to the Roman matrons with many such Zanchius Bodine Spondanus and others are of opinion that they cause a true metamorphosis as Nebuchadnezzar was really translated into a beast Lot s wife into a pillar of salt Ulysses companions into hogs and dogs by Circe s charms turn themselves and others as they do witches into cats dogs hares crows c Strozzius Cicogna hath many examples lib iii omnif mag cap four and five which he there confutes as Austin likewise doth de civ Dei lib xviii That they can be seen when and in what shape and to whom they will saith Psellus Tametsi nil tale viderim nec optem videre though he himself never saw them nor desired it and use sometimes carnal copulation as elsewhere I shall eleven thirty three prove more at large with women and men Many will not believe they can be seen and if any man shall say swear and stiffly maintain though he be discreet and wise judicious and learned that he hath seen them they account him a timorous fool a melancholy dizzard a weak fellow a dreamer a sick or a mad man they contemn him laugh him to scorn and yet Marcus of his credit told Psellus that he had often seen them And Leo Suavius a Frenchman c eight in Commentar l one Paracelsi de vita longa out of some Platonists will have the air to be as full of them as snow falling in the skies and that they may be seen and withal sets down the means how men may see them Si irreverberatus oculis sole splendente versus caelum continuaverint obtutus c eleven thirty four and saith moreover he tried it praemissorum feci experimentum and it was true that the Platonists said Paracelsus confesseth that he saw them divers times and conferred with them and so doth Alexander ab eleven thirty five Alexandro that he so found it by experience when as before he doubted of it Many deny it saith Lavater de spectris part one c two and part two c eleven because they never saw them themselves but as he reports at large all over his book especially c nineteen part one they are often seen and heard and familiarly converse with men as Lod Vives assureth us innumerable records histories and testimonies evince in all ages times places and eleven thirty six all travellers besides in the West Indies and our northern climes Nihil familiarius quam in agris et urbibus spiritus videre audire qui vetent jubeant c Hieronymus vita Pauli Basil ser forty Nicephorus Eusebius Socrates Sozomenus eleven thirty seven Jacobus Boissardus in his tract de spirituum apparitionibus Petrus Loyerus l de spectris Wierus l one have infinite variety of such examples of apparitions of spirits for him to read that farther doubts to his ample satisfaction One alone I will briefly insert A nobleman in Germany was sent ambassador to the King of Sweden for his name the time and such circumstances I refer you to Boissardus mine eleven thirty eight Author After he had done his business he sailed to Livonia on set purpose to see those familiar spirits which are there said to be conversant with men and do their drudgery works Amongst other matters one of them told him where his wife was in what room in what clothes what doing and brought him a ring from her which at his return non sine omnium admiratione he found to be true and so believed that ever after which before he doubted of Cardan l nineteen de subtil relates of his father Facius Cardan that after the accustomed solemnities An fourteen ninety one thirteen August he conjured up seven devils in Greek apparel about forty years of age some ruddy of complexion and some pale as he thought he asked them many questions and they made ready answer that they were aerial devils that they lived and died as men did save that they were far longer lived seven hundred or eight hundred eleven thirty nine years they did as much excel men in dignity as we do juments and were as far excelled again of those that were above them our eleven forty governors and keepers they are moreover which eleven forty one Plato in Critias delivered of old and subordinate to one another Ut enim homo homini sic daemon daemoni dominatur they rule themselves as well as us and the spirits of the meaner sort had commonly such offices as we make horse keepers neat herds and the basest of us overseers of our cattle and that we can no more apprehend their natures and functions than a horse a man s They knew all things but might not reveal them to men and ruled and domineered over us as we do over our horses the best kings amongst us and the most generous spirits were not comparable to the basest of them Sometimes they did instruct men and communicate their skill reward and cherish and sometimes again terrify and punish to keep them in awe as they thought fit Nihil magis cupientes saith Lysius Phis Stoicorum quam adorationem hominum eleven forty two The same Author Cardan in his Hyperchen out of the doctrine of Stoics will have some of these genii for so he calls them to be eleven forty three desirous of men s company very affable and familiar with them as dogs are others again to abhor as serpents and care not for them The same belike Tritemius calls Ignios et sublunares qui nunquam demergunt ad inferiora aut vix ullum habent in terris commercium eleven forty four Generally they far excel men in worth as a man the meanest worm though some of them are inferior to those of their own rank in worth as the blackguard in a prince s court and to men again as some degenerate base rational creatures are excelled of brute beasts That they are mortal besides these testimonies of Cardan Martianus c many other divines and philosophers hold post prolixum tempus moriuntur omnes The eleven forty five Platonists and some Rabbins Porphyrius and Plutarch as appears by that relation of Thamus eleven forty six The great God Pan is dead Apollo Pythius ceased and so the rest saint Hierome in the life of Paul the Hermit tells a story how one of them appeared to saint Anthony in the wilderness and told him as much eleven forty seven Paracelsus of our late writers stiffly maintains that they are mortal live and die as other creatures do Zozimus l two farther adds that religion and policy dies and alters with them The eleven forty eight Gentiles gods he saith were expelled by Constantine and together with them Imperii Romani majestas et fortuna interiit et profligata est The fortune and majesty of the Roman Empire decayed and vanished as that heathen in eleven forty nine Minutius formerly bragged when the Jews were overcome by the Romans the Jew s God was likewise captivated by that of Rome and Rabsakeh to the Israelites no God should deliver them out of the hands of the Assyrians But these paradoxes of their power corporeity mortality taking of shapes transposing bodies and carnal copulations are sufficiently confuted by Zanch c ten l four Pererius in his comment and Tostatus questions on the sixth of general Th Aquin saint Austin Wierus Th Erastus Delrio tom two l two quaest twenty nine Sebastian Michaelis c two de spiritibus D Reinolds Lect forty seven They may deceive the eyes of men yet not take true bodies or make a real metamorphosis but as Cicogna proves at large they are eleven fifty Illusoriae et praestigiatrices transformationes omnif mag lib four cap four mere illusions and cozenings like that tale of Pasetis obulus in Suidas or that of Autolicus Mercury s son that dwelt in Parnassus who got so much treasure by cozenage and stealth His father Mercury because he could leave him no wealth taught him many fine tricks to get means eleven fifty one for he could drive away men s cattle and if any pursued him turn them into what shapes he would and so did mightily enrich himself hoc astu maximam praedam est adsecutus This no doubt is as true as the rest yet thus much in general Thomas Durand and others grant that they have understanding far beyond men can probably conjecture and eleven fifty two foretell many things they can cause and cure most diseases deceive our senses they have excellent skill in all Arts and Sciences and that the most illiterate devil is Quovis homine scientior more knowing than any man as eleven fifty three Cicogna maintains out of others They know the virtues of herbs plants stones minerals c of all creatures birds beasts the four elements stars planets can aptly apply and make use of them as they see good perceiving the causes of all meteors and the like Dant se coloribus as eleven fifty four Austin hath it accommodant se figuris adhaerent sonis subjiciunt se odoribus infundunt se saporibus omnes sensus etiam ipsam intelligentiam daemones fallunt they deceive all our senses even our understanding itself at once eleven fifty five They can produce miraculous alterations in the air and most wonderful effects conquer armies give victories help further hurt cross and alter human attempts and projects Dei permissu as they see good themselves eleven fifty six When Charles the Great intended to make a channel betwixt the Rhine and the Danube look what his workmen did in the day these spirits flung down in the night Ut conatu Rex desisteret pervicere Such feats can they do But that which Bodine l four Theat nat thinks following Tyrius belike and the Platonists they can tell the secrets of a man s heart aut cogitationes hominum is most false his reasons are weak and sufficiently confuted by Zanch lib four cap nine Hierom lib two com in Mat ad cap fifteen Athanasius quaest twenty seven ad Antiochum Principem and others Orders As for those orders of good and bad devils which the Platonists hold is altogether erroneous and those Ethnics boni et mali Genii are to be exploded these heathen writers agree not in this point among themselves as Dandinus notes An sint eleven fifty seven mali non conveniunt some will have all spirits good or bad to us by a mistake as if an Ox or Horse could discourse he would say the Butcher was his enemy because he killed him the grazier his friend because he fed him a hunter preserves and yet kills his game and is hated nevertheless of his game nec piscatorem piscis amare potest c But Jamblichus Psellus Plutarch and most Platonists acknowledge bad et ab eorum maleficiis cavendum and we should beware of their wickedness for they are enemies of mankind and this Plato learned in Egypt that they quarrelled with Jupiter and were driven by him down to hell eleven fifty eight That which eleven fifty nine Apuleius Xenophon and Plato contend of Socrates Daemonium is most absurd That which Plotinus of his that he had likewise Deum pro Daemonio and that which Porphyry concludes of them all in general if they be neglected in their sacrifice they are angry nay more as Cardan in his Hipperchen will they feed on men s souls Elementa sunt plantis elementum animalibus plantae hominibus animalia erunt et homines aliis non autem diis nimis enim remota est eorum natura a nostra quapropter daemonibus and so belike that we have so many battles fought in all ages countries is to make them a feast and their sole delight but to return to that I said before if displeased they fret and chafe for they feed belike on the souls of beasts as we do on their bodies and send many plagues amongst us but if pleased then they do much good is as vain as the rest and confuted by Austin l nine c eight de Civ Dei Euseb l four praepar Evang c six and others Yet thus much I find that our schoolmen and other eleven sixty divines make nine kinds of bad spirits as Dionysius hath done of angels In the first rank are those false gods of the gentiles which were adored heretofore in several idols and gave oracles at Delphos and elsewhere whose prince is Beelzebub The second rank is of liars and equivocators as Apollo Pythius and the like The third are those vessels of anger inventors of all mischief as that Theutus in Plato Esay calls them eleven sixty one vessels of fury their prince is Belial The fourth are malicious revenging devils and their prince is Asmodaeus The fifth kind are cozeners such as belong to magicians and witches their prince is Satan The sixth are those aerial devils that eleven sixty two corrupt the air and cause plagues thunders fires c spoken of in the Apocalypse and Paul to the Ephesians names them the princes of the air Meresin is their prince The seventh is a destroyer captain of the furies causing wars tumults combustions uproars mentioned in the Apocalypse and called Abaddon The eighth is that accusing or calumniating devil whom the Greeks call Greek Diabolos that drives men to despair The ninth are those tempters in several kinds and their prince is Mammon Psellus makes six kinds yet none above the Moon Wierus in his Pseudo monarchia Daemonis out of an old book makes many more divisions and subordinations with their several names numbers offices c but Gazaeus cited by eleven sixty three Lipsius will have all places full of angels spirits and devils above and beneath the Moon eleven sixty four ethereal and aerial which Austin cites out of Varro l seven de Civ Dei c six The celestial devils above and aerial beneath or as some will gods above Semi dei or half gods beneath Lares Heroes Genii which climb higher if they lived well as the Stoics held but grovel on the ground as they were baser in their lives nearer to the earth and are Manes Lemures Lamiae c eleven sixty five They will have no place but all full of spirits devils or some other inhabitants Plenum Caelum aer aqua terra et omnia sub terra saith eleven sixty six Gazaeus though Anthony Rusca in his book de Inferno lib v cap seven would confine them to the middle region yet they will have them everywhere Not so much as a hair breadth empty in heaven earth or waters above or under the earth The air is not so full of flies in summer as it is at all times of invisible devils this eleven sixty seven Paracelsus stiffly maintains and that they have every one their several chaos others will have infinite worlds and each world his peculiar spirits gods angels and devils to govern and punish it Singula eleven sixty eight nonnulli credunt quoque sidera posse Dici orbes terramque appellant sidus opacum Cui minimus divum praesit Some persons believe each star to be a world and this earth an opaque star over which the least of the gods presides eleven sixty nine Gregorius Tholsanus makes seven kinds of ethereal spirits or angels according to the number of the seven planets Saturnine Jovial Martial of which Cardan discourseth lib twenty de subtil he calls them substantias primas Olympicos daemones Tritemius qui praesunt Zodiaco c and will have them to be good angels above devils beneath the Moon their several names and offices he there sets down and which Dionysius of Angels will have several spirits for several countries men offices c which live about them and as so many assisting powers cause their operations will have in a word innumerable as many of them as there be stars in the skies eleven seventy Marcilius Ficinus seems to second this opinion out of Plato or from himself I know not still ruling their inferiors as they do those under them again all subordinate and the nearest to the earth rule us whom we subdivide into good and bad angels call gods or devils as they help or hurt us and so adore love or hate but it is most likely from Plato for he relying wholly on Socrates quem mori potius quam mentiri voluisse scribit whom he says would rather die than tell a falsehood out of Socrates authority alone made nine kinds of them which opinion belike Socrates took from Pythagoras and he from Trismegistus he from Zoroastes first God second idea three Intelligences four Arch Angels five Angels six Devils seven Heroes eight Principalities nine Princes of which some were absolutely good as gods some bad some indifferent inter deos et homines as heroes and daemons which ruled men and were called genii or as eleven seventy one Proclus and Jamblichus will the middle betwixt God and men Principalities and princes which commanded and swayed kings and countries and had several places in the spheres perhaps for as every sphere is higher so hath it more excellent inhabitants which belike is that Galilaeus a Galileo and Kepler aims at in his nuncio Syderio when he will have eleven seventy two Saturnine and Jovial inhabitants and which Tycho Brahe doth in some sort touch or insinuate in one of his epistles but these things eleven seventy three Zanchius justly explodes cap three lib four P Martyr in four Sam twenty eight So that according to these men the number of ethereal spirits must needs be infinite for if that be true that some of our mathematicians say if a stone could fall from the starry heaven or eighth sphere and should pass every hour an hundred miles it would be sixty five years or more before it would come to ground by reason of the great distance of heaven from earth which contains as some say one hundred seventy millions eight hundred miles besides those other heavens whether they be crystalline or watery which Maginus adds which peradventure holds as much more how many such spirits may it contain And yet for all this eleven seventy four Thomas Albertus and most hold that there be far more angels than devils Sublunary devils and their kinds But be they more or less Quod supra nos nihil ad nos what is beyond our comprehension does not concern us Howsoever as Martianus foolishly supposeth Aetherii Daemones non curant res humanas they care not for us do not attend our actions or look for us those ethereal spirits have other worlds to reign in belike or business to follow We are only now to speak in brief of these sublunary spirits or devils for the rest our divines determine that the devil had no power over stars or heavens eleven seventy five Carminibus coelo possunt deducere lunam C by their charms verses they can seduce the moon from the heavens Those are poetical fictions and that they can eleven seventy six sistere aquam fluviis et vertere sidera retro c stop rivers and turn the stars backward in their courses as Canadia in Horace tis all false eleven seventy seven They are confined until the day of judgment to this sublunary world and can work no farther than the four elements and as God permits them Wherefore of these sublunary devils though others divide them otherwise according to their several places and offices Psellus makes six kinds fiery aerial terrestrial watery and subterranean devils besides those fairies satyrs nymphs c Fiery spirits or devils are such as commonly work by blazing stars fire drakes or ignes fatui which lead men often in flumina aut praecipitia saith Bodine lib two Theat Naturae fol two hundred twenty one Quos inquit arcere si volunt viatores clara voce Deum appellare aut pronam facie terram contingente adorare oportet et hoc amuletum majoribus nostris acceptum ferre debemus c whom if travellers wish to keep off they must pronounce the name of God with a clear voice or adore him with their faces in contact with the ground c likewise they counterfeit suns and moons stars oftentimes and sit on ship masts In navigiorum summitatibus visuntur and are called dioscuri as Eusebius l contra Philosophos c xlviii informeth us out of the authority of Zenophanes or little clouds ad motum nescio quem volantes which never appear saith Cardan but they signify some mischief or other to come unto men though some again will have them to pretend good and victory to that side they come towards in sea fights saint Elmo s fires they commonly call them and they do likely appear after a sea storm Radzivilius the Polonian duke calls this apparition Sancti Germani sidus and saith moreover that he saw the same after in a storm as he was sailing fifteen eighty two from Alexandria to Rhodes eleven seventy eight Our stories are full of such apparitions in all kinds Some think they keep their residence in that Hecla a mountain in Iceland Aetna in Sicily Lipari Vesuvius c These devils were worshipped heretofore by that superstitious Pyromanteia eleven seventy nine and the like Aerial spirits or devils are such as keep quarter most part in the eleven eighty air cause many tempests thunder and lightnings tear oaks fire steeples houses strike men and beasts make it rain stones as in Livy s time wool frogs c Counterfeit armies in the air strange noises swords c as at Vienna before the coming of the Turks and many times in Rome as Scheretzius l de spect c one part one Lavater de spect part one c seventeen Julius Obsequens an old Roman in his book of prodigies ab urb cond five hundred five eleven eighty one Machiavel hath illustrated by many examples and Josephus in his book de bello Judaico before the destruction of Jerusalem All which Guil Postellus in his first book c seven de orbis concordia useth as an effectual argument as indeed it is to persuade them that will not believe there be spirits or devils They cause whirlwinds on a sudden and tempestuous storms which though our meteorologists generally refer to natural causes yet I am of Bodine s mind Theat Nat l two they are more often caused by those aerial devils in their several quarters for Tempestatibus se ingerunt saith eleven eighty two Rich Argentine as when a desperate man makes away with himself which by hanging or drowning they frequently do as Kommanus observes de mirac mort part seven c seventy six tripudium agentes dancing and rejoicing at the death of a sinner These can corrupt the air and cause plagues sickness storms shipwrecks fires inundations At Mons Draconis in Italy there is a most memorable example in eleven eighty three Jovianus Pontanus and nothing so familiar if we may believe those relations of Saxo Grammaticus Olaus Magnus Damianus A Goes as for witches and sorcerers in Lapland Lithuania and all over Scandia to sell winds to mariners and cause tempests which Marcus Paulus the Venetian relates likewise of the Tartars These kind of devils are much eleven eighty four delighted in sacrifices saith Porphyry held all the world in awe and had several names idols sacrifices in Rome Greece Egypt and at this day tyrannise over and deceive those Ethnics and Indians being adored and worshipped for eleven eighty five gods For the Gentiles gods were devils as eleven eighty six Trismegistus confesseth in his Asclepius and he himself could make them come to their images by magic spells and are now as much respected by our papists saith eleven eighty seven Pictorius under the name of saints These are they which Cardan thinks desire so much carnal copulation with witches Incubi and Succubi transform bodies and are so very cold if they be touched and that serve magicians His father had one of them as he is not ashamed to relate eleven eighty eight an aerial devil bound to him for twenty and eight years As Agrippa s dog had a devil tied to his collar some think that Paracelsus or else Erastus belies him had one confined to his sword pummel others wear them in rings c Jannes and Jambres did many things of old by their help Simon Magus Cinops Apollonius Tianeus Jamblichus and Tritemius of late that showed Maximilian the emperor his wife after she was dead Et verrucam in collo ejus saith eleven eighty nine Godolman so much as the wart in her neck Delrio lib two hath divers examples of their feats Cicogna lib three cap three and Wierus in his book de praestig daemonum Boissardus de magis et veneficis Water devils are those Naiads or water nymphs which have been heretofore conversant about waters and rivers The water as Paracelsus thinks is their chaos wherein they live some call them fairies and say that Habundia is their queen these cause inundations many times shipwrecks and deceive men divers ways as Succuba or otherwise appearing most part saith Tritemius in women s shapes eleven ninety Paracelsus hath several stories of them that have lived and been married to mortal men and so continued for certain years with them and after upon some dislike have forsaken them Such a one as Aegeria with whom Numa was so familiar Diana Ceres c eleven ninety one Olaus Magnus hath a long narration of one Hotherus a king of Sweden that having lost his company as he was hunting one day met with these water nymphs or fairies and was feasted by them and Hector Boethius or Macbeth and Banquo two Scottish lords that as they were wandering in the woods had their fortunes told them by three strange women To these heretofore they did use to sacrifice by that Greek hydromanteia or divination by waters Terrestrial devils are those eleven ninety two Lares genii fauns satyrs eleven ninety three wood nymphs foliots fairies Robin Goodfellows trulli c which as they are most conversant with men so they do them most harm Some think it was they alone that kept the heathen people in awe of old and had so many idols and temples erected to them Of this range was Dagon amongst the Philistines Bel amongst the Babylonians Astartes amongst the Sidonians Baal amongst the Samaritans Isis and Osiris amongst the Egyptians c some put our eleven ninety four fairies into this rank which have been in former times adored with much superstition with sweeping their houses and setting of a pail of clean water good victuals and the like and then they should not be pinched but find money in their shoes and be fortunate in their enterprises These are they that dance on heaths and greens as eleven ninety five Lavater thinks with Tritemius and as eleven ninety six Olaus Magnus adds leave that green circle which we commonly find in plain fields which others hold to proceed from a meteor falling or some accidental rankness of the ground so nature sports herself they are sometimes seen by old women and children Hierom Pauli in his description of the city of Bercino in Spain relates how they have been familiarly seen near that town about fountains and hills Nonnunquam saith Tritemius in sua latibula montium simpliciores homines ducant stupenda mirantibus ostentes miracula nolarum sonitus spectacula c eleven ninety seven Giraldus Cambrensis gives instance in a monk of Wales that was so deluded eleven ninety eight Paracelsus reckons up many places in Germany where they do usually walk in little coats some two feet long A bigger kind there is of them called with us hobgoblins and Robin Goodfellows that would in those superstitious times grind corn for a mess of milk cut wood or do any manner of drudgery work They would mend old irons in those Aeolian isles of Lipari in former ages and have been often seen and heard eleven ninety nine Tholosanus calls them trullos and Getulos and saith that in his days they were common in many places of France Dithmarus Bleskenius in his description of Iceland reports for a certainty that almost in every family they have yet some such familiar spirits and Felix Malleolus in his book de crudel daemon affirms as much that these trolli or telchines are very common in Norway and twelve hundred seen to do drudgery work to draw water saith Wierus lib one cap twenty two dress meat or any such thing Another sort of these there are which frequent forlorn twelve oh one houses which the Italians call foliots most part innoxious twelve oh two Cardan holds They will make strange noises in the night howl sometimes pitifully and then laugh again cause great flame and sudden lights fling stones rattle chains shave men open doors and shut them fling down platters stools chests sometimes appear in the likeness of hares crows black dogs c of which read twelve oh three Pet Thyraeus the Jesuit in his Tract de locis infestis part one et cap four who will have them to be devils or the souls of damned men that seek revenge or else souls out of purgatory that seek ease for such examples peruse twelve oh four Sigismundus Scheretzius lib de spectris part one c one which he saith he took out of Luther most part there be many instances twelve oh five Plinius Secundus remembers such a house at Athens which Athenodorus the philosopher hired which no man durst inhabit for fear of devils Austin de Civ Dei lib twenty two cap one relates as much of Hesperius the Tribune s house at Zubeda near their city of Hippos vexed with evil spirits to his great hindrance Cum afflictione animalium et servorum suorum Many such instances are to be read in Niderius Formicar lib five cap xii three c Whether I may call these Zim and Ochim which Isaiah cap xiii twenty one speaks of I make a doubt See more of these in the said Scheretz lib one de spect cap four he is full of examples These kind of devils many times appear to men and affright them out of their wits sometimes walking at twelve oh six noonday sometimes at nights counterfeiting dead men s ghosts as that of Caligula which saith Suetonius was seen to walk in Lavinia s garden where his body was buried spirits haunted and the house where he died twelve oh seven Nulla nox sine terrore transacta donec incendio consumpta every night this happened there was no quietness till the house was burned About Hecla in Iceland ghosts commonly walk animas mortuorum simulantes saith Joh Anan lib three de nat daem Olaus lib two cap two Natal Tallopid lib de apparit spir Kornmannus de mirac mort part one cap forty four such sights are frequently seen circa sepulchra et monasteria saith Lavat lib one cap nineteen in monasteries and about churchyards loca paludinosa ampla aedificia solitaria et caede hominum notata c marshes great buildings solitary places or remarkable as the scene of some murder Thyreus adds ubi gravius peccatum est commissum impii pauperum oppressores et nequiter insignes habitant where some very heinous crime was committed there the impious and infamous generally dwell These spirits often foretell men s deaths by several signs as knocking groanings c twelve oh eight though Rich Argentine c eighteen de praestigiis daemonum will ascribe these predictions to good angels out of the authority of Ficinus and others prodigia in obitu principum saepius contingunt c prodigies frequently occur at the deaths of illustrious men as in the Lateran church in twelve oh nine Rome the popes deaths are foretold by Sylvester s tomb Near Rupes Nova in Finland in the kingdom of Sweden there is a lake in which before the governor of the castle dies a spectrum in the habit of Arion with his harp appears and makes excellent music like those blocks in Cheshire which they say presage death to the master of the family or that twelve ten oak in Lanthadran park in Cornwall which foreshows as much Many families in Europe are so put in mind of their last by such predictions and many men are forewarned if we may believe Paracelsus by familiar spirits in divers shapes as cocks crows owls which often hover about sick men s chambers vel quia morientium foeditatem sentiunt as twelve eleven Baracellus conjectures et ideo super tectum infirmorum crocitant because they smell a corse or for that as twelve twelve Bernardinus de Bustis thinketh God permits the devil to appear in the form of crows and such like creatures to scare such as live wickedly here on earth A little before Tully s death saith Plutarch the crows made a mighty noise about him tumultuose perstrepentes they pulled the pillow from under his head Rob Gaguinus hist Franc lib eight telleth such another wonderful story at the death of Johannes de Monteforti a French lord anno thirteen forty five tanta corvorum multitudo aedibus morientis insedit quantam esse in Gallia nemo judicasset a multitude of crows alighted on the house of the dying man such as no one imagined existed in France Such prodigies are very frequent in authors See more of these in the said Lavater Thyreus de locis infestis part three cap fifty eight Pictorius Delrio Cicogna lib three cap nine Necromancers take upon them to raise and lay them at their pleasures and so likewise those which Mizaldus calls ambulones that walk about midnight on great heaths and desert places which saith twelve thirteen Lavater draw men out of the way and lead them all night a byway or quite bar them of their way these have several names in several places we commonly call them Pucks In the deserts of Lop in Asia such illusions of walking spirits are often perceived as you may read in M Paulus the Venetian his travels if one lose his company by chance these devils will call him by his name and counterfeit voices of his companions to seduce him Hieronym Pauli in his book of the hills of Spain relates of a great twelve fourteen mount in Cantabria where such spectrums are to be seen Lavater and Cicogna have variety of examples of spirits and walking devils in this kind Sometimes they sit by the highway side to give men falls and make their horses stumble and start as they ride if you will believe the relation of that holy man Ketellus in twelve fifteen Nubrigensis that had an especial grace to see devils Gratiam divinitus collatam and talk with them Et impavidus cum spiritibus sermonem miscere without offence and if a man curse or spur his horse for stumbling they do heartily rejoice at it with many such pretty feats Subterranean devils are as common as the rest and do as much harm Olaus Magnus lib six cap nineteen make six kinds of them some bigger some less These saith twelve sixteen Munster are commonly seen about mines of metals and are some of them noxious some again do no harm The metal men in many places account it good luck a sign of treasure and rich ore when they see them Georgius Agricola in his book de subterraneis animantibus cap thirty seven reckons two more notable kinds of them which he calls twelve seventeen getuli and cobali both are clothed after the manner of metal men and will many times imitate their works Their office as Pictorius and Paracelsus think is to keep treasure in the earth that it be not all at once revealed and besides twelve eighteen Cicogna avers that they are the frequent causes of those horrible earthquakes which often swallow up not only houses but whole islands and cities in his third book cap eleven he gives many instances The last are conversant about the centre of the earth to torture the souls of damned men to the day of judgment their egress and regress some suppose to be about Etna Lipari Mons Hecla in Iceland Vesuvius Terra del Fuego c because many shrieks and fearful cries are continually heard thereabouts and familiar apparitions of dead men ghosts and goblins Their Offices Operations Study Thus the devil reigns and in a thousand several shapes as a roaring lion still seeks whom he may devour one Pet v by sea land air as yet unconfined though twelve nineteen some will have his proper place the air all that space between us and the moon for them that transgressed least and hell for the wickedest of them Hic velut in carcere ad finem mundi tunc in locum funestiorum

men s falls he labours all he can to bring them into the same pit of perdition with him For twelve twenty one men s miseries calamities and ruins are the devil s banqueting dishes By many temptations and several engines he seeks to captivate our souls The Lord of Lies saith twelve twenty two Austin as he was deceived himself he seeks to deceive others the ringleader to all naughtiness as he did by Eve and Cain Sodom and Gomorrah so would he do by all the world Sometimes he tempts by covetousness drunkenness pleasure pride c errs dejects saves kills protects and rides some men as they do their horses He studies our overthrow and generally seeks our destruction and although he pretend many times human good and vindicate himself for a god by curing of several diseases aegris sanitatem et

impurius scelestius nihil humano generi infestius nothing so impure nothing so pernicious as may well appear by their tyrannical and bloody sacrifices of men to Saturn and Moloch which are still in use among those barbarous Indians their several deceits and cozenings to keep men in obedience their false oracles sacrifices their superstitious impositions of fasts penury c Heresies superstitious observations of meats times c by which they twelve twenty three crucify the souls of mortal men as shall be showed in our Treatise of Religious Melancholy Modico adhuc tempore sinitur malignari as twelve twenty four Bernard expresseth it by God s permission he rageth a while hereafter to be confined to hell and darkness which is prepared for him and his angels Mat xxv How far their power doth extend it is hard to determine what the ancients held of their effects force and operations I will briefly show you Plato in Critias and after him his followers gave out that these spirits or devils were men s governors and keepers our lords and masters as we are of our cattle twelve twenty five They govern provinces and kingdoms by oracles auguries dreams rewards and punishments prophecies inspirations sacrifices and religious superstitions varied in as many forms as there be diversity of spirits they send wars plagues peace sickness health dearth plenty twelve twenty six Adstantes hic jam nobis spectantes et arbitrantes c as appears by those histories of Thucydides Livius Dionysius Halicarnassus with many others that are full of their wonderful stratagems and were therefore by those Roman and Greek commonwealths adored and worshipped for gods with prayers and sacrifices c twelve twenty seven In a word Nihil magis quaerunt quam metum et admirationem hominum twelve twenty eight and as another hath it Dici non potest quam impotenti ardore in homines dominium et Divinos cultus maligni spiritus affectent twelve twenty nine Tritemius in his book de septem secundis assigns names to such angels as are governors of particular provinces by what authority I know not and gives them several jurisdictions Asclepiades a Grecian Rabbi Achiba the Jew Abraham Avenezra and Rabbi Azariel Arabians as I find them cited by twelve thirty Cicogna farther add that they are not our governors only Sed ex eorum concordia et discordia boni et mali affectus promanant but as they agree so do we and our princes or disagree stand or fall Juno was a bitter enemy to Troy Apollo a good friend Jupiter indifferent Aequa Venus Teucris Pallas iniqua fuit some are for us still some against us

which was fought against King Philip for the liberty of Greece had deceitfully carried themselves long after in the very same place Diis Graeciae ultoribus saith mine author they were miserably slain by Metellus the Roman so likewise in smaller matters they will have things fall out as these boni and mali genii favour or dislike us Saturni non conveniunt Jovialibus c He that is Saturninus shall never likely be preferred twelve thirty three That base fellows are often advanced undeserving Gnathoes and vicious parasites whereas discreet wise virtuous and worthy men are neglected and unrewarded they refer to those domineering spirits or subordinate Genii as they are inclined or favour men so they thrive are ruled and overcome for as twelve thirty four Libanius supposeth in our ordinary conflicts and contentions Genius Genio cedit et obtemperat one genius yields and is overcome by another All particular events almost they refer to these private spirits and as Paracelsus adds they direct teach inspire and instruct men Never was any man extraordinary famous in any art action or great commander that had not familiarem daemonem to inform him as Numa Socrates and many such as Cardan illustrates cap one hundred twenty eight Arcanis prudentiae civilis twelve thirty five Speciali siquidem gratia se a Deo donari asserunt magi a Geniis caelestibus instrui ab iis doceri But these are most erroneous paradoxes ineptae et fabulosae nugae rejected by our divines and Christian churches Tis true they have by God s permission power over us and we find by experience that they

sine voce species sine visu envy lust anger c as he sees men inclined The manner how he performs it Biarmannus in his Oration against Bodine sufficiently declares twelve forty two He begins first with the phantasy and moves that so strongly that no reason is able to resist Now the phantasy he moves by mediation of humours although many physicians are of opinion that the devil can alter the mind and produce this disease of himself Quibusdam medicorum visum saith twelve forty three Avicenna quod Melancholia contingat a daemonio Of the same mind is Psellus and Rhasis the Arab lib one Tract nine Cont twelve forty four That this disease proceeds especially from the devil and from him alone Arculanus cap six in nine Rhasis Aelianus Montaltus in his nine cap Daniel Sennertus lib one part two cap eleven confirm as much that the devil can cause this disease by reason many times that the parties affected prophesy speak strange language but non sine interventu humoris not without the humour as he interprets himself no more doth Avicenna si contingat a daemonio sufficit nobis ut convertat complexionem ad choleram nigram et sit causa ejus propinqua cholera nigra the immediate cause is choler adust which twelve forty five Pomponatius likewise labours to make good Galgerandus of Mantua a famous physician so cured a demoniacal woman in his time that spake all languages by purging black choler and thereupon belike this humour of melancholy is called balneum diaboli the devil s bath the devil spying his opportunity of such humours drives them many times to despair fury rage c mingling himself among these humours This is that which Tertullian avers Corporibus infligunt acerbos casus animaeque repentinos membra distorquent occulte repentes c and which Lemnius goes about to prove Immiscent se mali Genii pravis humoribus atque atrae bili c And twelve forty six Jason Pratensis that the devil being a slender incomprehensible spirit can easily insinuate and wind himself into human bodies and cunningly couched in our bowels vitiate our healths terrify our souls with fearful dreams and shake our minds with furies And in another place These unclean spirits settled in our bodies and now mixed with our melancholy humours do triumph as it were and sport themselves as in another heaven Thus he argues and that they go in and out of our bodies as bees do in a hive and so provoke and tempt us as they perceive our temperature inclined of itself and most apt to be deluded twelve forty seven Agrippa and twelve forty eight Lavater are persuaded that this humour invites the devil to it wheresoever it is in extremity and of all other melancholy persons are most subject to diabolical temptations and illusions and most apt to entertain them and the Devil best able to work upon them But whether by obsession or possession or otherwise I will not determine tis a difficult question Delrio the Jesuit Tom three lib six Springer and his colleague mall malef Pet Thyreus the Jesuit

eighty six numb eight relates that he saw a wench possessed in Bononia with two devils by eating an unhallowed pomegranate as she did afterwards confess when she was cured by exorcisms And therefore our Papists do sign themselves so often with the sign of the cross Ne daemon ingredi ausit and exorcise all manner of meats as being unclean or accursed otherwise as Bellarmine defends Many such stories I find amongst pontifical writers to prove their assertions let them free their own credits some few I will recite in this kind out of most approved physicians Cornelius Gemma lib two de nat

fourteen days and after that she voided great balls of hair pieces of wood pigeon s dung parchment goose dung coals and after them two pounds of pure blood and then again coals and stones or which

express words affirms Multi fascinantur in melancholiam many are bewitched into melancholy out of his experience The same saith Danaeus lib three de sortiariis Vidi inquit qui Melancholicos morbos

physic could help solu tactu by touch alone Ruland in his three Cent Cura ninety one gives an instance of one David Helde a young man who by eating cakes which a witch gave him mox delirare coepit began to dote on a sudden and was instantly mad F H D in twelve seventy five Hildesheim consulted about a melancholy man thought his disease was partly magical and partly natural because he vomited pieces of iron and lead and spake such languages as he had never been taught but such examples are common in Scribanius Hercules de Saxonia and others The means by which they work are usually charms images as that in Hector Boethius of King Duffe characters stamped of sundry metals and at such and such constellations knots amulets words philters c which generally make the parties affected melancholy as twelve seventy six Monavius discourseth at large in an epistle of his to Acolsius giving instance in a Bohemian baron that was so troubled by a philter taken Not that there is any power at all in those spells charms characters and barbarous words but that the devil doth use such means to delude them Ut fideles inde magos saith twelve seventy seven Libanius in officio retineat tum in consortium malefactorum vocet SUBSECT IV Stars a cause Signs from Physiognomy Metoposcopy Chiromancy Natural causes are either primary and universal or secondary and more particular Primary causes are the heavens planets stars c by their influence as our astrologers hold producing this and such like effects I will not here stand to discuss obiter whether stars be causes or signs or to apologise for judical astrology If either Sextus Empericus Picus Mirandula Sextus ab Heminga Pererius Erastus Chambers c have so far prevailed with any man that he will attribute no virtue at all to the heavens or to sun or moon more than he doth to their signs at an innkeeper s post or tradesman s shop or generally condemn all such astrological aphorisms approved by experience I refer him to Bellantius Pirovanus Marascallerus Goclenius Sir Christopher Heidon c If thou shalt ask me what I think I must answer nam et doctis hisce erroribus versatus sum for I am conversant with these learned errors they do incline but not compel no necessity at all twelve seventy eight agunt non cogunt and so gently incline that a wise man may resist them sapiens dominabitur astris they rule us but God rules them All this methinks twelve seventy nine Joh de Indagine hath comprised in brief Quaeris a me quantum in nobis operantur astra c Wilt thou know how far the stars work upon us I say they do but incline and that so gently that if we will be ruled by reason they have no power over us but if we follow our own nature and be led by sense they do as much in us as in brute beasts and we are no better So that I hope I may justly conclude with twelve eighty Cajetan Coelum est vehiculum divinae virtutis c that the heaven is God s instrument by mediation of which he governs and disposeth these elementary bodies or a great book whose letters are the stars as one calls it wherein are written many strange things for such as can read twelve eighty one or an excellent harp made by an eminent workman on which he that can but play will make most admirable music But to the purpose twelve eighty two Paracelsus is of opinion that a physician without the knowledge of stars can neither understand the cause or cure of any disease either of this or gout not so much as toothache except he see the peculiar geniture and scheme of the party effected And for this proper malady he will have the principal and primary cause of it proceed from the heaven ascribing more to stars than humours twelve eighty three and that the constellation alone many times produceth melancholy all other causes set apart He gives instance in lunatic persons that are deprived of their wits by the moon s motion and in another place refers all to the ascendant and will have the true and chief cause of it to be sought from the stars Neither is it his opinion only but of many Galenists and philosophers though they do not so peremptorily maintain as much This variety of melancholy symptoms proceeds from the stars saith twelve eighty four Melancthon the most generous melancholy as that of Augustus comes from the conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in Libra the bad as that of Catiline s from the meeting of Saturn and the moon in Scorpio Jovianus Pontanus in his tenth book and thirteenth chapter de rebus coelestibus discourseth to this purpose at large Ex atra bile varii generantur morbi c twelve eighty five many diseases proceed from black choler as it shall be hot or cold and though it be cold in its own nature yet it is apt to be heated as water may be made to boil and burn as bad as fire or made cold as ice and thence proceed such variety of symptoms some mad some solitary some laugh some rage c The cause of all which intemperance he will have chiefly and primarily proceed from the heavens twelve eighty six from the position of Mars Saturn and Mercury His aphorisms be these twelve eighty seven Mercury in any geniture if he shall be found in Virgo or Pisces his opposite sign and that in the horoscope irradiated by those quartile aspects of Saturn or Mars the child shall be mad or melancholy Again twelve eighty eight He that shall have Saturn and Mars the one culminating the other in the fourth house when he shall be born shall be melancholy of which he shall be cured in time if Mercury behold them twelve eighty nine If the moon be in conjunction or opposition at the birth time with the sun Saturn or Mars or in a quartile aspect with them e malo coeli loco Leovitius adds many diseases are signified especially the head and brain is like to be misaffected with pernicious humours to be melancholy lunatic or mad Cardan adds quarta luna natos eclipses earthquakes Garcaeus and Leovitius will have the chief judgment to be taken from the lord of the geniture or where there is an aspect between the moon and Mercury and neither behold the horoscope or Saturn and Mars shall be lord of the present conjunction or opposition in Sagittarius or Pisces of the sun or moon such persons are commonly epileptic dote demoniacal melancholy but see more of these aphorisms in the above named Pontanus Garcaeus cap twenty three de Jud genitur Schoner lib one cap eight which he hath gathered out of twelve ninety Ptolemy Albubater and some other Arabians Junctine Ranzovius Lindhout Origen c But these men you will reject peradventure as astrologers and therefore partial judges then hear the testimony of physicians Galenists themselves twelve ninety one Carto confesseth the influence of stars to have a great hand to this peculiar disease so doth Jason Pratensis Lonicerius praefat de Apoplexia Ficinus Fernelius c twelve ninety two P Cnemander acknowledgeth the stars an universal cause the particular from parents and the use of the six non natural things Baptista Port mag l one c ten twelve fifteen will have them causes to every particular individium Instances and examples to evince the truth of those aphorisms are common amongst those astrologian treatises Cardan in his thirty seventh geniture gives instance in Matth Bolognius Camerar hor natalit centur seven genit six et seven of Daniel Gare and others but see Garcaeus cap thirty three Luc Gauricus Tract six de Azemenis c The time of this melancholy is when the significators of any geniture are directed according to art as the hor moon hylech c to the hostile beams or terms of Symbol Saturn and Symbol Mars especially or any fixed star of their nature or if Symbol Saturn by his revolution or transitus shall offend any of those radical promissors in the geniture Other signs there are taken from physiognomy metoposcopy chiromancy which because Joh de Indagine and Rotman the landgrave of Hesse his mathematician not long since in his Chiromancy Baptista Porta in his celestial Physiognomy have proved to hold great affinity with astrology to satisfy the curious I am the more willing to insert The general notions twelve ninety three physiognomers give be these black colour argues natural melancholy so doth leanness hirsuteness broad veins much hair on the brows saith twelve ninety four Gratanarolus cap seven and a little head out of Aristotle high sanguine red colour shows head melancholy they that stutter and are bald will be soonest melancholy as Avicenna supposeth by reason of the dryness of their brains but he that will know more of the several signs of humour and wits out of physiognomy let him consult with old Adamantus and Polemus that comment or rather paraphrase upon Aristotle s Physiognomy Baptista Porta s four pleasant books Michael Scot de secretis naturae John de Indagine Montaltus Antony Zara anat ingeniorum sect one memb thirteen et lib four Chiromancy hath these aphorisms to foretell melancholy Tasneir lib five cap two who hath comprehended the sum of John de Indagine Tricassus Corvinus and others in his book thus hath it twelve ninety five The Saturnine line going from the rascetta through the hand to Saturn s mount and there intersected by certain little lines argues melancholy so if the vital and natural make an acute angle Aphorism one hundred The saturnine hepatic and natural lines making a gross triangle in the hand argue as much which Goclenius cap five Chiros repeats verbatim out of him In general they conclude all that if Saturn s mount be full of many small lines and intersections twelve ninety six such men are most part melancholy miserable and full of disquietness care and trouble continually vexed with anxious and bitter thoughts always sorrowful fearful suspicious they delight in husbandry buildings pools marshes springs woods walks c Thaddaeus Haggesius in his Metoposcopia hath certain aphorisms derived from Saturn s lines in the forehead by which he collects a melancholy disposition and twelve ninety seven Baptista Porta makes observations from those other parts of the body as if a spot be over the spleen twelve ninety eight or in the nails if it appear black it signifieth much care grief contention and melancholy the reason he refers to the humours and gives instance in himself that for seven years space he had such black spots in his nails and all that while was in perpetual lawsuits controversies for his inheritance fear loss of honour banishment grief care c and when his miseries ended the black spots vanished Cardan in his book de libris propriis tells such a story of his own person that a little before his son s death he had a black spot which appeared in one of his nails and dilated itself as he came nearer to his end But I am over tedious in these toys which howsoever in some men s too severe censures they may be held absurd and ridiculous I am the bolder to insert as not borrowed from circumforanean rogues and gipsies but out of the writings of worthy philosophers and physicians yet living some of them and religious professors in famous universities who are able to patronise that which they have said and vindicate themselves from all cavillers and ignorant persons SUBSECT V Old age a cause Secondary peculiar causes efficient so called in respect of the other precedent are either congenitae internae innatae as they term them inward innate inbred or else outward and adventitious which happen to us after we are born congenite or born with us are either natural as old age or praeter naturam as twelve ninety nine Fernelius calls it that distemperature which we have from our parent s seed it being an hereditary disease The first of these which is natural to all and which no man living can avoid is thirteen hundred old age which being cold and dry and of the same quality as melancholy is must needs cause it by diminution of spirits and substance and increasing of adust humours therefore thirteen oh one Melancthon avers out of Aristotle as an undoubted truth Senes plerunque delirasse in senecta that old men familiarly dote ob atram bilem for black choler which is then superabundant in them and Rhasis that Arabian physician in his Cont lib one cap nine calls it thirteen oh two a necessary and inseparable accident to all old and decrepit persons After seventy years as the Psalmist saith thirteen oh three all is trouble and sorrow and common experience confirms the truth of it in weak and old persons especially such as have lived in action all their lives had great employment much business much command and many servants to oversee and leave off ex abrupto as thirteen oh four Charles the Fifth did to King Philip resign up all on a sudden they are overcome with melancholy in an instant or if they do continue in such courses they dote at last senex bis puer and are not able to manage their estates through common infirmities incident in their age full of ache sorrow and grief children again dizzards they carl many times as they sit and talk to themselves they are angry waspish displeased with every thing suspicious of all wayward covetous hard saith Tully self willed superstitious self conceited braggers and admirers of themselves as thirteen oh five Balthazar Castilio hath truly noted of them thirteen oh six This natural infirmity is most eminent in old women and such as are poor solitary live in most base esteem and beggary or such as are witches insomuch that Wierus Baptista Porta Ulricus Molitor Edwicus do refer all that witches are said to do to imagination alone and this humour of melancholy And whereas it is controverted whether they can bewitch cattle to death ride in the air upon a cowl staff out of a chimney top transform themselves into cats dogs c translate bodies from place to place meet in companies and dance as they do or have carnal copulation with the devil they ascribe all to this redundant melancholy which domineers in them to thirteen oh seven somniferous potions and natural causes the devil s policy Non laedunt omnino saith Wierus aut quid mirum faciunt de Lamiis lib three cap thirty six ut putatur solam vitiatam habent phantasiam they do no such wonders at all only their thirteen oh eight brains are crazed thirteen oh nine They think they are witches and can do hurt but do not But this opinion Bodine Erastus Danaeus Scribanius Sebastian Michaelis Campanella de Sensu rerum lib four cap nine thirteen ten Dandinus the Jesuit lib two de Animae explode thirteen eleven Cicogna confutes at large That witches are melancholy they deny not but not out of corrupt phantasy alone so to delude themselves and others or to produce such effects SUBSECT VI Parents a cause by Propagation That other inward inbred cause of Melancholy is our temperature in whole or part which we receive from our parents which thirteen twelve Fernelius calls Praeter naturam or unnatural it being an hereditary disease for as he justifies thirteen thirteen Quale parentum maxime patris semen obtigerit tales evadunt similares spermaticaeque paries quocunque etiam morbo Pater quum generat tenetur cum semine transfert in Prolem such as the temperature of the father is such is the son s and look what disease the father had when he begot him his son will have after him thirteen fourteen and is as well inheritor of his infirmities as of his lands And where the complexion and constitution of the father is corrupt there thirteen fifteen saith Roger Bacon the complexion and constitution of the son must needs be corrupt and so the corruption is derived from the father to the son Now this doth not so much appear in the composition of the body according to that of Hippocrates thirteen sixteen in habit proportion scars and other lineaments but in manners and conditions of the mind Et patrum in natos abeunt cum semine mores Seleucus had an anchor on his thigh so had his posterity as Trogus records lib fifteen Lepidus in Pliny l seven c seventeen was purblind so was his son That famous family of Aenobarbi were known of old and so surnamed from their red beards the Austrian lip and those Indian flat noses are propagated the Bavarian chin and goggle eyes amongst the Jews as thirteen seventeen Buxtorfius observes their voice pace gesture looks are likewise derived with all the rest of their conditions and infirmities such a mother such a daughter their very thirteen eighteen affections Lemnius contends to follow their seed and the malice and bad conditions of children are many times wholly to be imputed to their parents I need not therefore make any doubt of Melancholy but that it is an hereditary disease thirteen nineteen Paracelsus in express words affirms it lib de morb amentium to four tr one so doth thirteen twenty Crato in an Epistle of his to Monavius So doth Bruno Seidelius in his book de morbo incurab Montaltus proves cap eleven out of Hippocrates and Plutarch that such hereditary dispositions are frequent et hanc inquit fieri reor ob participatam melancholicam intemperantiam speaking of a patient I think he became so by participation of Melancholy Daniel Sennertus lib one part two cap nine will have his melancholy constitution derived not only from the father to the son but to the whole family sometimes Quandoque totis familiis hereditativam thirteen twenty one Forestus in his medicinal observations illustrates this point with an example of a merchant his patient that had this infirmity by inheritance so doth Rodericus a Fonseca tom one consul sixty nine by an instance of a young man that was so affected ex matre melancholica had a melancholy mother et victu melancholico and bad diet together Ludovicus Mercatus a Spanish physician in that excellent Tract which he hath lately written of hereditary diseases tom two oper lib five reckons up leprosy as those thirteen twenty two Galbots in Gascony hereditary lepers pox stone gout epilepsy c Amongst the rest this and madness after a set time comes to many which he calls a miraculous thing in nature and sticks for ever to them as an incurable habit And that which is more to be wondered at it skips in some families the father and goes to the son thirteen twenty three or takes every other and sometimes every third in a lineal descent and doth not always produce the same but some like and a symbolizing disease These secondary causes hence derived are commonly so powerful that as thirteen twenty four Wolfius holds saepe mutant decreta siderum they do often alter the primary causes and decrees of the heavens For these reasons belike the Church and commonwealth human and Divine laws have conspired to avoid hereditary diseases forbidding such marriages as are any whit allied and as Mercatus adviseth all families to take such si fieri possit quae maxime distant natura and to make choice of those that are most differing in complexion from them if they love their own and respect the common good And sure I think it hath been ordered by God s especial providence that in all ages there should be as usually there is once in thirteen twenty five six hundred years a transmigration of nations to amend and purify their blood as we alter seed upon our land and that there should be as it were an inundation of those northern Goths and Vandals and many such like people which came out of that continent of Scandia and Sarmatia as some suppose and overran as a deluge most part of Europe and Africa to alter for our good our complexions which were much defaced with hereditary infirmities which by our lust and intemperance we had contracted A sound generation of strong and able men were sent amongst us as those northern men usually are innocuous free from riot and free from diseases to qualify and make us as those poor naked Indians are generally at this day and those about Brazil as a late thirteen twenty six writer observes in the Isle of Maragnan free from all hereditary diseases or other contagion whereas without help of physic they live commonly one hundred twenty years or more as in the Orcades and many other places Such are the common effects of temperance and intemperance but I will descend to particular and show by what means and by whom especially this infirmity is derived unto us Filii ex senibus nati raro sunt firmi temperamenti old men s children are seldom of a good temperament as Scoltzius supposeth consult one hundred seventy seven and therefore most apt to this disease and as thirteen twenty seven Levinus Lemnius farther adds old men beget most part wayward peevish sad melancholy sons and seldom merry He that begets a child on a full stomach will either have a sick child or a crazed son as thirteen twenty eight Cardan thinks contradict med lib one contradict eighteen or if the parents be sick or have any great pain of the head or megrim headache Hieronymus Wolfius thirteen twenty nine doth instance in a child of Sebastian Castalio s if a drunken man get a child it will never likely have a good

menstruis c I spare to English this which I have said Another cause some give inordinate diet as if a man eat garlic onions fast overmuch study too hard be over sorrowful dull heavy dejected in mind perplexed in his thoughts fearful c their children saith thirteen thirty seven Cardan subtil lib eighteen will be much subject to madness and melancholy for if the spirits of the brain be fuzzled or misaffected by such means at such a time their children will be fuzzled in the brain they will be dull heavy timorous discontented all their lives Some are of opinion and maintain that paradox or problem that wise men beget commonly fools Suidas gives instance in Aristarchus the Grammarian duos reliquit Filios Aristarchum et Aristachorum ambos stultos and which thirteen thirty eight Erasmus urgeth in his Moria fools beget wise men Card subt l twelve gives this cause Quoniam spiritus sapientum ob studium resolvuntur et in cerebrum feruntur a corde because their natural spirits are resolved by study and turned into animal drawn from the heart and those other parts to the brain Lemnius subscribes to that of Cardan and assigns this reason Quod persolvant debitum languide et obscitanter unde foetus a parentum generositate desciscit they pay their debt as Paul calls it to their wives remissly by which means their children are weaklings and many times idiots and fools Some other causes are given which properly pertain and do proceed from the mother if she be over dull heavy angry peevish discontented and melancholy not only at the time of conception but even all the while she carries the child in her womb saith Fernelius path l one eleven her son will be so likewise affected and worse as thirteen thirty nine Lemnius adds l four c seven if she grieve overmuch be disquieted or by any casualty be affrighted and terrified by some fearful object heard or seen she endangers her child and spoils the temperature of it for the strange imagination of a woman works effectually upon her infant that as Baptista Porta proves Physiog caelestis l five c two she leaves a mark upon it which is most especially seen in such as prodigiously long for such and such meats the child will love those meats saith Fernelius and be addicted to like humours thirteen forty if a great bellied woman see a hare her child will often have a harelip as we call it Garcaeus de Judiciis geniturarum cap thirty three hath a memorable example of one Thomas Nickell born in the city of Brandeburg fifteen fifty one thirteen forty one that went reeling and staggering all the days of his life as if he would fall to the ground because his mother being great with child saw a drunken man reeling in the street Such another I find in Martin Wenrichius com de ortu monstrorum c seventeen I saw saith he at Wittenberg in Germany a citizen that looked like a carcass I asked him the cause he replied thirteen forty two His mother when she bore him in her womb saw a carcass by chance and was so sore affrighted with it that ex eo foetus ei assimilatus from a ghastly impression the child was like it So many several ways are we plagued and punished for our father s defaults insomuch that as Fernelius truly saith thirteen forty three It is the greatest part of our felicity to be well born and it were happy for human kind if only such parents as are sound of body and mind should be suffered to marry An husbandman will sow none but the best and choicest seed upon his land he will not rear a bull or a horse except he be right shapen in all parts or permit him to cover a mare except he be well assured of his breed we make choice of the best rams for our sheep rear the neatest kine and keep the best dogs Quanto id diligentius in procreandis liberis observandum And how careful then should we be in begetting of our children In former times some thirteen forty four countries have been so chary in this behalf so stern that if a child were crooked or deformed in body or mind they made him away so did the Indians of old by the relation of Curtius and many other well governed commonwealths according to the discipline of those times Heretofore in Scotland saith thirteen forty five Hect Boethius if any were visited with the falling sickness madness gout leprosy or any such dangerous disease which was likely to be propagated from the father to the son he was instantly gelded a woman kept from all company of men and if by chance having some such disease she were found to be with child she with her brood were buried alive and this was done for the common good lest the whole nation should be injured or corrupted A severe doom you will say and not to be used amongst Christians yet more to be looked into than it is For now by our too much facility in this kind in giving way for all to marry that will too much liberty and indulgence in tolerating all sorts there is a vast confusion of hereditary diseases no family secure no man almost free from some grievous infirmity or other when no choice is had but still the eldest must marry as so many stallions of the race or if rich be they fools or dizzards lame or maimed unable intemperate dissolute exhaust through riot as he said thirteen forty six jura haereditario sapere jubentur they must be wise and able by inheritance it comes to pass that our generation is corrupt we have many weak persons both in body and mind many feral diseases raging amongst us crazed families parentes peremptores our fathers bad and we are like to be worse MEMB II SUBSECT I Bad Diet a cause Substance Quality of Meats According to my proposed method having opened hitherto these secondary causes which are inbred with us I must now proceed to the outward and adventitious which happen unto us after we are born And those are either evident remote or inward antecedent and the nearest continent causes some call them These outward remote precedent causes are subdivided again into necessary and not necessary Necessary because we cannot avoid them but they will alter us as they are used or abused are those six non natural things so much spoken of amongst physicians which are principal causes of this disease For almost in every consultation whereas they shall come to speak of the causes the fault is found and this most part objected to the patient Peccavit circa res sex non naturales he hath still offended in one of those six Montanus consil twenty two consulted about a melancholy Jew gives that sentence so did Frisemelica in the same place and in his two hundred forty four counsel censuring a melancholy soldier assigns that reason of his malady thirteen forty seven he offended in all those six non natural things which were the outward causes from which came those inward obstructions and so in the rest These six non natural things are diet retention and evacuation which are more material than the other because they make new matter or else are conversant in keeping or expelling of it The other four are air exercise sleeping waking and perturbations of the mind which only alter the matter The first of these is diet which consists in meat and drink and causeth melancholy as it offends in substance or accidents that is quantity quality or the like And well it may be called a material cause since that as thirteen forty eight Fernelius holds it hath such a power in begetting of diseases and yields the matter and sustenance of them for neither air nor perturbations nor any of those other evident causes take place or work this effect except the constitution of body and preparation of humours do concur That a man may say this diet is the mother of diseases let the father be what he will and from this alone melancholy and frequent other maladies arise Many physicians I confess have written copious volumes of this one subject of the nature and qualities of all manner of meats as namely Galen Isaac the Jew Halyabbas Avicenna Mesue also four Arabians Gordonius Villanovanus Wecker Johannes Bruerinus sitologia de Esculentis et Poculentis Michael Savanarola Tract two c eight Anthony Fumanellus lib de regimine senum Curio in his comment on Schola Salerna Godefridus Steckius arte med Marcilius Cognatus Ficinus Ranzovius Fonseca Lessius Magninus regim sanitatis Frietagius Hugo Fridevallius c besides many other in thirteen forty nine English and almost every peculiar physician discourseth at large of all peculiar meats in his chapter of melancholy yet because these books are not at hand to every man I will briefly touch what kind of meats engender this humour through their several species and which are to be avoided How they alter and change the matter spirits first and after humours by which we are preserved and the constitution of our body Fernelius and others will show you I hasten to the thing itself and first of such diet as offends in substance Beef Beef a strong and hearty meat cold in the first degree dry in the second saith Gal l three c one de alim fac is condemned by him and all succeeding Authors to breed gross melancholy blood good for such as are sound and of a strong constitution for labouring men if ordered aright corned young of an ox for all gelded meats in every species are held best or if old thirteen fifty such as have been tired out with labour are preferred Aubanus and Sabellicus commend Portugal beef to be the most savoury best and easiest of digestion we commend ours but all is rejected and unfit for such as lead a resty life any ways inclined to melancholy or dry of complexion Tales Galen thinks de facile melancholicis aegritudinibus capiuntur Pork Pork of all meats is most nutritive in his own nature thirteen fifty one but altogether unfit for such as live at ease are any ways unsound of body or mind too moist full of humours and therefore noxia delicatis saith Savanarola ex earum usu ut dubitetur an febris quartana generetur naught for queasy stomachs insomuch that frequent use of it may

it yields gross nutriment a strong and great grained meat next unto a horse Which although some countries eat as Tartars and they of China yet thirteen fifty four Galen condemns Young foals are as commonly eaten in Spain as red deer and to furnish their navies about Malaga especially often used but such meats ask long baking or seething to qualify them and yet all will not serve Venison Fallow Deer All venison is melancholy and begets bad blood a pleasant meat in great esteem with us for we have more parks in England than there are in all Europe besides in our solemn feasts Tis somewhat better hunted than otherwise and well prepared by cookery but generally bad and seldom to be used Hare Hare a black meat melancholy and hard of digestion it breeds incubus often eaten and causeth fearful dreams so doth all venison and is condemned by a jury of physicians Mizaldus and some others say that hare is a merry meat and that it will make one fair as Martial s epigram testifies to Gellia but this is per accidens because of the good sport it makes merry company and good discourse that is commonly at the eating of it and not otherwise to be understood Conies thirteen fifty five Conies are of the nature of hares Magninus compares them to beef pig and goat Reg sanit part three c seventeen yet young rabbits by all men are approved to be good Generally all such meats as are hard

side disallowing tench approves of it so doth Dubravius in his Books of Fishponds Freitagius thirteen sixty three extols it for an excellent wholesome meat and puts it amongst the fishes of the best rank and so do most of our country gentlemen that store their ponds almost with no other fish But this controversy is easily decided in my judgment by Bruerinus l twenty two c thirteen The difference riseth from the site and nature of pools thirteen sixty four sometimes muddy sometimes sweet they are in taste as the place is from whence they be taken In like manner almost we may conclude of other fresh fish But see more in Rondoletius Bellonius Oribasius lib seven cap twenty two Isaac l one especially Hippolitus Salvianus who is instar omnium solus c Howsoever they may be wholesome and approved much use of them is not good P Forestus in his medicinal observations thirteen sixty five relates that Carthusian friars whose living is most part fish are more subject to melancholy than any other order and that he found by experience being sometimes their physician ordinary at Delft in Holland He exemplifies it with an instance of one Buscodnese a Carthusian of a ruddy colour and well

whole meadows into a platter And make no better of their guests than beeves With herbs and grass to feed them fatter Our Italians and Spaniards do make a whole dinner of herbs and salads which our said Plautus calls coenas terrestras Horace coenas sine sanguine by which means as he follows it thirteen sixty seven Hic homines tam brevem vitam colunt Qui herbas hujusmodi in alvum suum congerunt Formidolosum dictu non esu modo Quas herbas pecudes non edunt homines edunt Their lives that eat such herbs must needs be short And tis a fearful thing for to report That men should feed on such a kind of meat Which very juments would refuse to eat thirteen sixty eight They are windy and not fit therefore to be eaten of all men raw though qualified with oil but in broths or otherwise See more of these in every thirteen sixty nine husbandman and herbalist Roots Roots Etsi quorundam gentium opes sint saith Bruerinus the wealth of some countries and sole food are windy and bad or troublesome to the head as onions garlic scallions turnips carrots radishes parsnips Crato lib two consil eleven disallows all roots though thirteen seventy some approve of parsnips and potatoes thirteen seventy

Guianerius tract fifteen cap two complains of all manner of roots and so doth Bruerinus even parsnips themselves which are the best Lib nine cap fourteen Fruits Pastinacarum usus succos gignit improbos Crato consil twenty one lib one utterly forbids all manner of fruits as pears apples plums cherries strawberries nuts medlars serves c Sanguinem inficiunt saith Villanovanus they infect the blood and putrefy it Magninus holds and must not therefore be taken via cibi aut quantitate magna not to make a meal of or in any great quantity thirteen seventy three Cardan makes that a cause of their continual sickness at Fessa in Africa because they live so much on fruits eating them thrice a day Laurentius approves of many fruits in his Tract of Melancholy which others disallow and amongst the rest apples which some likewise commend sweetings pearmains pippins as good against melancholy but to him that is any way inclined to or touched with this malady thirteen seventy four Nicholas Piso in his Practics forbids all fruits as windy or to be sparingly eaten at least and not raw Amongst other fruits thirteen seventy five Bruerinus out of Galen excepts grapes and figs but I find them likewise rejected Pulse All pulse are naught beans peas vetches c they fill the brain saith Isaac with gross fumes breed black thick blood and cause troublesome dreams And therefore that which Pythagoras said to his scholars of old may be for ever applied to melancholy men A fabis abstinete eat no peas nor beans yet to such as will needs eat them I would give this counsel to prepare them according to those rules that Arnoldus Villanovanus and Frietagius prescribe for eating and dressing fruits herbs roots pulse c Spices Spices cause hot and head melancholy and are for that cause forbidden by our physicians to such men as are inclined to this malady as pepper ginger cinnamon cloves mace dates c honey and sugar thirteen seventy six Some except honey to those that are cold it may be tolerable but thirteen seventy seven Dulcia se in bilem vertunt sweets turn into bile they are obstructive Crato therefore forbids all spice in a consultation of his for a melancholy schoolmaster Omnia aromatica et quicquid sanguinem adurit so doth Fernelius consil forty five Guianerius tract fifteen cap two Mercurialis cons one hundred eighty nine To these I may add all sharp and sour things luscious and over sweet or fat as oil vinegar verjuice mustard salt as sweet things are obstructive so these are corrosive Gomesius in his books de sale l one c twenty one highly commends salt so doth Codronchus in his tract de sale Absynthii Lemn l three c nine de occult nat mir yet common experience finds salt and salt meats to be great procurers of this disease And for that cause belike those Egyptian priests abstained from salt even so much as in their bread ut sine perturbatione anima esset saith mine author that their souls might be free from perturbations Bread Bread that is made of baser grain as peas beans oats rye or thirteen seventy eight over hard baked crusty and black is often spoken against as causing melancholy juice and wind Joh Mayor in the first book of his History of Scotland contends much for the wholesomeness of oaten bread it was objected to him then living at Paris in France that his countrymen fed on oats and base grain as a disgrace but he doth ingenuously confess Scotland Wales and a third part of England did most part use that kind of bread that it was as wholesome as any grain and yielded as good nourishment And yet Wecker out of Galen calls it horsemeat and fitter for juments than men to feed on But read Galen himself Lib one De cibis boni et mali succi more largely discoursing of corn and bread Wine All black wines over hot compound strong thick drinks as Muscadine Malmsey Alicant Rumney Brownbastard Metheglen and the like of which they have thirty several kinds in Muscovy all such made drinks are hurtful in this case to such as are hot or of a sanguine choleric complexion young or inclined to head melancholy For many times the drinking of wine alone causeth it Arculanus c sixteen in nine Rhasis puts in thirteen seventy nine wine for a great cause especially if it be immoderately used Guianerius tract fifteen c two tells a story of two Dutchmen to whom he gave entertainment in his house that thirteen eighty in one month s space were both melancholy by drinking of wine one did nought but sing the other sigh Galen l de causis morb c three Matthiolus on Dioscorides and above all other Andreas Bachius l

doth Mercurialis grant consil twenty five in that case if the temperature be cold as to most melancholy men it is wine is much commended if it be moderately used Cider Perry Cider and perry are both cold and windy drinks and for that cause to be neglected and so are all those hot spiced strong drinks Beer Beer if it be over new or over stale over strong or not sodden smell of the cask sharp or sour is most unwholesome frets and galls c Henricus Ayrerus in a thirteen eighty one consultation of his for one that laboured of hypochondriacal melancholy discommends beer So doth thirteen eighty

The dregs are left within As that thirteen eighty four old poet scoffed calling it Stygiae monstrum conforme paludi a monstrous drink like the river Styx But let them say as they list to such as are accustomed unto it tis a most wholesome so thirteen eighty five Polydore Virgil calleth it and a pleasant drink it is more subtle and better for the hop that rarefies it hath an especial virtue against melancholy as our herbalists confess Fuchsius approves Lib two sec two instit cap eleven and many others Waters Standing waters thick and ill coloured such as come forth of pools and moats where hemp hath been steeped or slimy fishes live are most unwholesome putrefied and full of mites creepers slimy muddy unclean corrupt impure by reason of the sun s heat and still standing they cause foul distemperatures in the body and mind of man are unfit to make drink of to dress meat with or to be thirteen eighty six used about men inwardly or outwardly They are good for many domestic uses to wash horses water cattle c or in time of necessity but not otherwise Some are of opinion that such fat standing waters make the best beer and that seething doth defecate it as thirteen eighty seven Cardan holds Lib thirteen subtil It mends the substance and savour of it but it is a paradox Such beer may be stronger but not so wholesome as the other as thirteen eighty eight Jobertus truly justifieth out of Galen Paradox dec one Paradox five that the seething of such impure waters doth not purge or purify them Pliny lib thirty one c three is of the same tenet and P Crescentius agricult lib one et lib four c eleven et c forty five Pamphilius Herilachus l four de not aquarum such waters are naught not to be used and by the testimony of thirteen eighty nine Galen breed agues dropsies pleurisies splenetic and melancholy passions hurt the eyes cause a bad temperature and ill disposition of the whole body with bad colour This Jobertus stiffly maintains Paradox lib one part five that it causeth blear eyes bad colour and many loathsome diseases to such as use it this which they say stands with good reason for as geographers relate the water of Astracan breeds worms in such as drink it thirteen ninety Axius or as now called Verduri the fairest river in Macedonia makes all cattle black that taste of it Aleacman now Peleca another stream in Thessaly turns cattle most part white si polui ducas L Aubanus Rohemus refers that thirteen ninety one struma or poke of the Bavarians and Styrians to the nature of their waters as thirteen ninety two Munster doth that of Valesians in the Alps and thirteen ninety three Bodine supposeth the stuttering of some families in Aquitania about Labden to proceed from the same cause and that the filth is derived from the water to their bodies So that they that use filthy standing ill coloured thick muddy water must needs have muddy ill coloured impure and infirm bodies And because the body works upon the mind they shall have grosser understandings dull foggy melancholy spirits and be really subject to all manner of infirmities To these noxious simples we may reduce an infinite number of compound artificial made dishes of which our cooks afford us a great variety as tailors do fashions in our apparel Such are thirteen ninety four puddings stuffed with blood or otherwise composed baked meats soused indurate meats fried and broiled buttered meats condite powdered and over dried thirteen ninety five all cakes simnels buns cracknels made with butter spice c fritters pancakes pies sausages and those several sauces sharp or over sweet of which scientia popinae as Seneca calls it hath served those thirteen ninety six Apician tricks and perfumed dishes which Adrian the sixth Pope so much admired in the accounts of his predecessor Leo Decimus and which prodigious riot and prodigality have invented in this age These do generally engender gross humours fill the stomach with crudities and all those inward parts with obstructions Montanus consil twenty two gives instance in a melancholy Jew that by eating such tart sauces made dishes and salt meats with which he was overmuch delighted became melancholy and was evil affected Such examples are familiar and common SUBSECT II Quantity of Diet a Cause There is not so much harm proceeding from the substance itself of meat and quality of it in ill dressing and preparing as there is from the quantity disorder of time and place unseasonable use of it thirteen ninety seven intemperance overmuch or overlittle taking of it A true saying it is Plures crapula quam gladius This gluttony kills more than the sword this omnivorantia et homicida gula this all devouring and murdering gut And that of thirteen ninety eight Pliny is truer Simple diet is the best heaping up of several meats is pernicious and sauces worse many dishes bring many diseases thirteen ninety nine Avicen cries out That nothing is worse than to feed on many dishes or to protract the time of meats longer than ordinary from thence proceed our infirmities and tis the fountain of all diseases which arise out of the repugnancy of gross humours Thence saith fourteen hundred Fernelius come crudities wind oppilations cacochymia plethora cachexia bradiopepsia fourteen oh one Hinc subitae mortes atque intestata senectus sudden death c and what not As a lamp is choked with a multitude of oil or a little fire with overmuch wood quite extinguished so is the natural heat with immoderate eating strangled in the body Pernitiosa sentina est abdomen insaturabile one saith An insatiable paunch is a pernicious sink and the fountain of all diseases both of body and mind fourteen oh two Mercurialis will have it a peculiar cause of this private disease Solenander consil five sect three illustrates this of Mercurialis with an example of one so melancholy ab intempestivis commessationibus unseasonable feasting fourteen oh three Crato confirms as much in that often cited counsel twenty one lib two putting superfluous eating for a main cause But what need I seek farther for proofs Hear fourteen oh four Hippocrates himself lib two aphor ten Impure bodies the more they are nourished the more they are hurt for the nourishment is putrefied with vicious humours And yet for all this harm which apparently follows surfeiting and drunkenness see how we luxuriate and rage in this kind read what Johannes Stuckius hath written lately of this subject in his great volume De Antiquorum Conviviis and of our present age Quam fourteen oh five portentosae coenae prodigious suppers fourteen

upon a dinner fourteen oh eight Mully Hamet king of Fez and Morocco spent three pounds on the sauce of a capon it is nothing in our times we scorn all that is cheap We loathe the very fourteen oh nine light some of us as Seneca notes because it comes free and we are offended with the sun s heat and those cool blasts because we buy them not This air we breathe is so common we care not for it nothing pleaseth but what is dear And if we be fourteen ten witty in anything it is ad gulam If we study at all it is erudito luxu to please the palate and to satisfy the gut A cook of old was a base knave as fourteen eleven Livy complains but now a great man in request cookery is become an art a noble science cooks are gentlemen Venter Deus They wear their brains in their bellies and their guts in their heads as fourteen twelve Agrippa taxed some parasites of his time rushing on their own destruction as if a man should run upon the point of a sword usque dum rumpantur comedunt They eat till they

Sea land rivers lakes c may not give content to their raging guts To make up the mess what immoderate drinking in every place Senem potum pota trahebat anus how they flock to the tavern as if they were fruges consumere nati born to no other end but to eat and drink like Offellius Bibulus that famous Roman parasite Qui dum vixit aut bibit aut minxit as so many casks to hold wine yea worse than a cask that mars wine and itself is not marred by it yet these are brave men Silenus Ebrius was no braver Et quae fuerunt vitia mores sunt tis now the fashion of our times an honour Nunc vero res ista

bringing up that will not drink fit for no company he is your only gallant that plays it off finest no disparagement now to stagger in the streets reel rave c but much to his fame and renown as in like case Epidicus told Thesprio his fellow servant in the fourteen seventeen Poet Aedipol facinus improbum one urged the other replied At jam alii fecere idem erit illi illa res honori tis now no fault there be so many brave examples to bear one out tis a credit to have a strong brain and carry his liquor well the sole contention who can drink most and fox his fellow the soonest Tis the summum bonum of our tradesmen their felicity life and soul Tanta dulcedine affectant saith Pliny lib fourteen cap twelve Ut magna pars non aliud vitae praemium intelligat their chief comfort to be merry together in an alehouse or tavern as our modern Muscovites do in their mead inns and Turks in their coffeehouses which much resemble our taverns they will labour hard all day long to be drunk at night and spend totius anni labores as saint Ambrose adds in a tippling feast convert day into night as Seneca taxes some in his times Pervertunt officia anoctis et lucis when we rise they commonly go to bed like our antipodes Nosque ubi primus equis oriens afflavit anhelis Illis sera rubens ascendit lumina vesper So did Petronius in Tacitus Heliogabalus in Lampridius fourteen eighteen Noctes vigilibat ad ipsum Mane diem totum stertebat He drank the night away Till rising dawn then snored out all the day Snymdiris the Sybarite never saw the sun rise or set so much as once in twenty years Verres against whom Tully so much inveighs in winter he never was extra tectum vix extra lectum never almost out of bed fourteen nineteen still wenching and drinking so did he spend his time and so do myriads in our days They have gymnasia bibonum schools and rendezvous these centaurs and Lapithae toss pots and bowls as so many balls invent new tricks as sausages anchovies tobacco caviar pickled oysters herrings fumados c innumerable salt meats to increase their appetite and study how to hurt themselves by taking antidotes fourteen twenty to carry their drink the better fourteen twenty one and when nought else serves they will go forth or be conveyed out to empty their gorge that they may return to drink afresh They make laws insanas leges contra bibendi fallacias and fourteen twenty two brag of it when they have done crowning that man that is soonest gone as their drunken predecessors have done fourteen twenty three quid ego video Ps Cum corona Pseudolum ebrium tuum And when they are dead will have a can of wine with fourteen twenty four Maron s old woman to be engraven on their tombs So they triumph in villainy and justify their wickedness with Rabelais that French Lucian drunkenness is better for the body than physic because there be more old drunkards than old physicians Many such frothy arguments they have fourteen twenty five inviting and encouraging others to do as they do and love them dearly for it no glue like to that of good fellowship So did Alcibiades in Greece Nero Bonosus Heliogabalus in Rome or Alegabalus rather as he was styled of old as fourteen twenty six Ignatius proves out of some old coins So do many great men still as fourteen twenty seven Heresbachius observes When a prince drinks till his eyes stare like Bitias in the Poet fourteen twenty eight ille impiger hausit Spumantem vino pateram a thirsty soul He took challenge and embrac d the bowl With pleasure swill d the gold nor ceased to draw Till he the bottom of the brimmer saw and comes off clearly sound trumpets fife and drums the spectators will applaud him the fourteen twenty nine bishop himself if he belie them not with his chaplain will stand by and do as much O dignum principe haustum twas done like a prince Our Dutchmen invite all comers with a pail and a dish Velut infundibula integras obbas exhauriunt et in monstrosis poculis ipsi monstrosi monstrosius epotant making barrels of their bellies Incredibile dictu as fourteen thirty one of their own countrymen complains fourteen thirty one Quantum liquoris immodestissima gens capiat c How they love a man that will be drunk crown him and honour him for it hate him that will not pledge him stab him kill him a most intolerable offence and not to be forgiven fourteen thirty two He is a mortal enemy that will not drink with him as Munster relates of the Saxons So in Poland he is the best servitor and the honestest fellow saith Alexander Gaguinus fourteen thirty three that drinketh most healths to the honour of his master he shall be rewarded as a good servant and held the bravest fellow that carries his liquor best when a brewer s horse will bear much more than any sturdy drinker yet for his noble exploits in this kind he shall be accounted a most valiant man for fourteen thirty four Tam inter epulas fortis vir esse potest ac in bello as much valour is to be found in feasting as in fighting and some of our city captains and carpet knights will make this good and prove it Thus they many times wilfully pervert the good temperature of their bodies stifle their wits strangle nature and degenerate into beasts Some again are in the other extreme and draw this mischief on their heads by too ceremonious and strict diet being over precise cockney like and curious in their observation of meats times as that Medicina statica prescribes just so many ounces at dinner which Lessius enjoins so much at supper not a little more nor a little less of such meat and at such hours a diet drink in the morning cock broth China broth at dinner plum broth a chicken a rabbit rib of a rack of mutton wing of a capon the merry thought of a hen c to sounder bodies this is too nice and most absurd Others offend in overmuch fasting pining adays saith fourteen thirty five Guianerius and waking anights as many Moors and Turks in these our times do Anchorites monks and the rest of that superstitious rank as the same Guianerius witnesseth that he hath often seen to have happened in his time through immoderate fasting have been frequently mad Of such men belike Hippocrates speaks l Aphor five when as he saith fourteen thirty six they more offend in too sparing diet and are worse damnified than they that feed liberally and are ready to surfeit SUBSECT III Custom of Diet Delight Appetite Necessity how they cause or hinder No rule is so general which admits not some exception to this therefore which hath been hitherto said for I shall otherwise put most men out of commons and those inconveniences which proceed from the substance of meats an intemperate or unseasonable use of them custom somewhat detracts and qualifies according to that of Hippocrates two Aphoris fifty fourteen thirty seven Such things as we have been long accustomed to though they be evil in their own nature yet they are less offensive Otherwise it might well be objected that it were a mere fourteen thirty eight tyranny to live after those strict rules of physic for custom fourteen thirty nine doth alter nature itself and to such as are used to them it makes bad meats wholesome and unseasonable times to cause no disorder Cider and perry are windy drinks so are all fruits windy in themselves cold most part yet in some shires of fourteen forty England Normandy in France Guipuscoa in Spain tis their common drink and they are no whit offended with it In Spain Italy and Africa they live most on roots raw herbs camel s fourteen forty one milk and it agrees well with them which to a stranger will cause much grievance In Wales lacticiniis vescuntur as Humphrey Llwyd confesseth a Cambro Briton himself in his elegant epistle to Abraham Ortelius they live most on white meats in Holland on fish roots fourteen forty two butter and so at this day in Greece as fourteen forty three Bellonius observes they had much rather feed on fish than flesh With us Maxima pars victus in carne consistit we feed on flesh most part saith fourteen forty four Polydore Virgil as all northern countries do and it would be very offensive to us to live after their diet or they to live after ours We drink beer they wine they use oil we butter we in the north are fourteen forty five great eaters they most sparing in those hotter countries and yet they and we following our own customs are well pleased An Ethiopian of old seeing an European eat bread wondered quomodo stercoribus vescentes viverimus how we could eat such kind of meats so much differed his countrymen from ours in diet that as mine fourteen forty six author infers si quis illorum victum apud nos aemulari vellet if any man should so feed with us it would be all one to nourish as Cicuta Aconitum or Hellebore itself At this day in China the common people live in a manner altogether on roots and herbs and to the wealthiest horse ass mule dogs cat flesh is as delightsome as the rest so fourteen forty seven Mat Riccius the Jesuit relates who lived many years amongst them The Tartars eat raw meat and most commonly fourteen forty eight horse flesh drink milk and blood as the nomades of old Et lac concretum cum sanguine potat equino They scoff at our Europeans for eating bread which they call tops of weeds and horse meat not fit for men and yet Scaliger accounts them a sound and witty nation living a hundred years even in the civilest country of them they do thus as Benedict the Jesuit observed in his travels from the great Mogul s Court by land to Pekin which Riccius contends to be the same with Cambulu in Cataia In Scandia their bread is usually dried fish and so likewise in the Shetland Isles and their other fare as in Iceland saith fourteen forty nine Dithmarus Bleskenius butter cheese and fish their drink water their lodging on the ground In America in many places their bread is roots their meat palmettos pinas potatoes c and such fruits There be of them too that familiarly drink fourteen fifty salt seawater all their lives eat fourteen fifty one raw meat grass and that with delight With some fish serpents spiders and in divers places they fourteen fifty two eat man s flesh raw and roasted even the Emperor fourteen fifty three Montezuma himself In some coasts again fourteen fifty four one tree yields them cocoanuts meat and drink fire fuel apparel with his leaves oil vinegar cover for houses c and yet these men going naked feeding coarse live commonly a hundred years are seldom or never sick all which diet our physicians forbid In Westphalia they feed most part on fat meats and worts knuckle deep and call it fourteen fifty five cerebrum Iovis in the Low Countries with roots in Italy frogs and snails are used The Turks saith Busbequius delight most in fried meats In Muscovy garlic and onions are ordinary meat and sauce which would be pernicious to such as are unaccustomed to them delightsome to others and all is fourteen fifty six because they have been brought up unto it Husbandmen and such as labour can eat fat bacon salt gross meat hard cheese c O dura messorum illa coarse bread at all times go to bed and labour upon a full stomach which to some idle persons would be present death and is against the rules of physic so that custom is all in all Our travellers find this by common experience when they come in far countries and use their diet they are suddenly offended fourteen fifty seven as our Hollanders and Englishmen when they touch upon the coasts of Africa those Indian capes and islands are commonly molested with calentures fluxes and much distempered by reason of their fruits fourteen fifty eight Peregrina etsi suavia solent vescentibus perturbationes insignes adferre strange meats though pleasant cause notable alterations and distempers On the other side use or custom mitigates or makes all good again Mithridates by often use which Pliny wonders at was able to drink poison and a maid as Curtius records sent to Alexander from King Porus was brought up with poison from her infancy The Turks saith Bellonius lib three c fifteen eat opium familiarly a dram at once which we dare not take in grains fourteen fifty nine Garcias ab Horto writes of one whom he saw at Goa in the East Indies that took ten drams of opium in three days and yet consulto loquebatur spake understandingly so much can custom do fourteen sixty Theophrastus speaks of a shepherd that could eat hellebore in substance And therefore Cardan concludes out of Galen Consuetudinem utcunque ferendam nisi valde malam Custom is howsoever to be kept except it be extremely bad he adviseth all men to keep their old customs and that by the authority of fourteen sixty one Hippocrates himself Dandum aliquid tempori aetati regioni consuetudini and therefore to fourteen sixty two continue as they began be it diet bath exercise c or whatsoever else Another exception is delight or appetite to such and such meats though they be hard of digestion melancholy yet as Fuchsius excepts cap six lib two Instit sect two fourteen sixty three The stomach doth readily digest and willingly entertain such meats we love most and are pleasing to us abhors on the other side such as we distaste Which Hippocrates confirms Aphoris two thirty eight Some cannot endure cheese out of a secret antipathy or to see a roasted duck which to others is a fourteen sixty four delightsome meat The last exception is necessity poverty want hunger which drives men many times to do that which otherwise they are loath cannot endure and thankfully to accept of it as beverage in ships and in sieges of great cities to feed on dogs cats rats and men themselves Three outlaws in fourteen sixty five Hector Boethius being driven to their shifts did eat raw flesh and flesh of such fowl as they could catch in one of the Hebrides for some few months These things do mitigate or disannul that which hath been said of melancholy meats and make it more tolerable but to such as are wealthy live plenteously at ease may take their choice and refrain if they will these viands are to be forborne if they be inclined to or suspect melancholy as they tender their healths Otherwise if they be intemperate or disordered in their diet at their peril be it Qui monet amat Ave et cave He who advises is your friend Farewell and to your health attend SUBSECT IV Retention and Evacuation a cause and how Of retention and evacuation there be divers kinds which are either concomitant assisting or sole causes many times of melancholy fourteen sixty six Galen reduceth defect and abundance to this head others fourteen sixty seven All that is separated or remains Costiveness In the first rank of these I may well reckon up costiveness and keeping in of our ordinary excrements which as it often causeth other diseases so this of melancholy in particular fourteen sixty eight Celsus lib one cap three saith It produceth inflammation of the head dullness cloudiness headache c Prosper Calenus lib de atra bile will have it distemper not the organ only fourteen sixty nine but the mind itself by troubling of it and sometimes it is a sole cause of madness as you may read in the first book of fourteen seventy Skenkius s Medicinal Observations A young merchant going to Nordeling fair in Germany for ten days space never went to stool at his return he was fourteen seventy one grievously melancholy thinking that he was robbed and would not be persuaded but that all his money was gone his friends thought he had some philtrum given him but Cnelius a physician being sent for found his fourteen seventy two costiveness alone to be the cause and thereupon gave him a clyster by which he was speedily recovered Trincavellius consult thirty five lib one saith as much of a melancholy lawyer to whom he administered physic and Rodericus a Fonseca consult eighty five tom two fourteen seventy three of a patient of his that for eight days was bound and therefore melancholy affected Other retentions and evacuations there are not simply necessary but at some times as Fernelius accounts them Path lib one cap fifteen as suppression of haemorrhoids monthly issues in women bleeding at nose immoderate or no use at all of Venus or any other ordinary issues fourteen seventy four Detention of haemorrhoids or monthly issues Villanovanus Breviar lib one cap eighteen Arculanus cap sixteen in nine Rhasis Vittorius Faventinus pract mag tract two cap fifteen Bruel c put for ordinary causes Fuchsius l two sect five c thirty goes farther and saith fourteen seventy five That many men unseasonably cured of the haemorrhoids have been corrupted with melancholy seeking to avoid Scylla they fall into Charybdis Galen l de hum commen three ad text twenty six illustrates this by an example of Lucius Martius whom he cured of madness contracted by this means And fourteen seventy six Skenkius hath two other instances of two melancholy and mad women so caused from the suppression of their months The same may be said of bleeding at the nose if it be suddenly stopped and have been formerly used as fourteen seventy seven Villanovanus urgeth And fourteen seventy eight Fuchsius lib two sect five cap thirty three stiffly maintains That without great danger such an issue may not be stayed Venus omitted produceth like effects Mathiolus epist five l penult fourteen seventy nine avoucheth of his knowledge that some through bashfulness abstained from venery and thereupon became very heavy and dull and some others that were very timorous melancholy and beyond all measure sad Oribasius med collect l six c thirty seven speaks of some fourteen eighty That if they do not use carnal copulation are continually troubled with heaviness and headache and some in the same case by intermission of it Not use of it hurts many Arculanus c six in nine Rhasis et Magninus part three cap five think because it fourteen eighty one sends up poisoned vapours to the brain and heart And so doth Galen himself hold That if this natural seed be over long kept in some parties it turns to poison Hieronymus Mercurialis in his chapter of melancholy cites it for an especial cause of this malady fourteen eighty two priapismus satyriasis c Haliabbas five Theor c thirty six reckons up this and many other diseases Villanovanus Breviar l one c eighteen saith He knew fourteen eighty three many monks and widows grievously troubled with melancholy and that from this sole cause fourteen eighty four Ludovicus Mercatus l two de mulierum affect cap four and Rodericus a Castro de morbis mulier l two c three treat largely of this subject and will have it produce a peculiar kind of melancholy in stale maids nuns and widows Ob suppressionem mensium et venerem omissam timidae moestae anxiae verecundae suspicioscae languentes consilii inopes cum summa vitae et rerum meliorum desperatione c they are melancholy in the highest degree and all for want of husbands Aelianus Montaltus cap thirty seven de melanchol confirms as much out of Galen so doth Wierus Christophorus a Vega de art med lib three c fourteen relates many such examples of men and women that he had seen so melancholy Felix Plater in the first book of his Observations fourteen eighty five tells a story of an ancient gentleman in Alsatia that married a young wife and was not able to pay his debts in that kind for a long time together by reason of his several infirmities but she because of this inhibition of Venus fell into a horrible fury and desired every one that came to see her by words looks and gestures to have to do with her c fourteen eighty six Bernardus Paternus a physician saith He knew a good honest godly priest that because he would neither willingly marry nor make use of the stews fell into grievous melancholy fits Hildesheim spicel two hath such another example of an Italian melancholy priest in a consultation had Anno fifteen eighty Jason Pratensis gives instance in a married man that from his wife s death abstaining fourteen eighty seven after marriage became exceedingly melancholy Rodericus a Fonseca in a young man so misaffected Tom two consult eighty five To these you may add if you please that conceited tale of a Jew so visited in like sort and so cured out of Poggius Florentinus Intemperate Venus is all but as bad in the other extreme Galen l six de mortis popular sect five text twenty six reckons up melancholy amongst those diseases which are fourteen eighty eight exasperated by venery so doth Avicenna two three c eleven Oribasius loc citat Ficinus lib two de sanitate tuenda Marsilius Cognatus Montaltus cap twenty seven Guianerius Tract three cap two Magninus cap five part three fourteen eighty nine gives the reason because fourteen ninety it infrigidates and dries up the body consumes the spirits and would therefore have all such as are cold and dry to take heed of and to avoid it as a mortal enemy Jacchinus in nine Rhasis cap fifteen ascribes the same cause and instanceth in a patient of his that married a young wife in a hot summer fourteen ninety one and so dried himself with chamber work that he became in short space from melancholy mad he cured him by moistening remedies The like example I find in Laelius a Fonte Eugubinus consult one hundred twenty nine of a gentleman of Venice that upon the same occasion was first melancholy afterwards mad Read in him the story at large Any other evacuation stopped will cause it as well as these above named be it bile fourteen ninety two ulcer issue c Hercules de Saxonia lib one c sixteen and Gordonius verify this out of their experience They saw one wounded in the head who as long as the sore was open Lucida habuit mentis intervalla was well but when it was stopped Rediit melancholia his melancholy fit seized on him again Artificial evacuations are much like in effect as hot houses baths bloodletting purging unseasonably and immoderately used fourteen ninety three Baths dry too much if used in excess be they natural or artificial and offend extreme hot or cold fourteen ninety four one dries the other refrigerates overmuch Montanus consil one hundred thirty seven saith they overheat the liver Joh Struthius Stigmat artis l four c nine contends fourteen ninety five that if one stay longer than ordinary at the bath go in too oft or at unseasonable times he putrefies the humours in his body To this purpose writes Magninus l three c five Guianerius Tract fifteen c twenty one utterly disallows all hot baths in melancholy adust fourteen ninety six I saw saith he a man that laboured of the gout who to be freed of this malady came to the bath and was instantly cured of his disease but got another worse and that was madness But this judgment varies as the humour doth in hot or cold baths may be good for one melancholy man bad for another that which will cure it in this party may cause it in a second Phlebotomy Phlebotomy many times neglected may do much harm to the body when there is a manifest redundance of bad humours and melancholy blood and when these humours heat and boil if this be not used in time the parties affected so inflamed are in great danger to be mad but if it be unadvisedly importunely immoderately used it doth as much harm by refrigerating the body dulling the spirits and consuming them as Joh fourteen ninety seven Curio in his tenth chapter well reprehends such kind of letting blood doth more hurt than good fourteen ninety eight The humours rage much more than they did before and is so far from avoiding melancholy that it increaseth it and weakeneth the sight fourteen ninety nine Prosper Calenus observes as much of all phlebotomy except they keep a very good diet after it yea and as fifteen hundred Leonartis Jacchinus speaks out of his own experience fifteen oh one The blood is much blacker to many men after their letting of blood than it was at first For this cause belike Salust Salvinianus l two c one will admit or hear of no bloodletting at all in this disease except it be manifest it proceed from blood he was it appears by his own words in that place master of an hospital of mad men fifteen oh two and found by long experience that this kind of evacuation either in head arm or any other part did more harm than good To this opinion of his fifteen oh three Felix Plater is quite opposite though some wink at disallow and quite contradict all phlebotomy in melancholy yet by long experience I have found innumerable so saved after they had been twenty nay sixty times let blood and to live happily after it It was an ordinary thing of old in Galen s time to take at once from such men six pounds of blood which now we dare scarce take in ounces sed viderint medici great books are written of this subject Purging upward and downward in abundance of bad humours omitted may be for the worst so likewise as in the precedent if overmuch too frequent or violent it fifteen oh four weakeneth their strength saith Fuchsius l two sect two c seventeen or if they be strong or able to endure physic yet it brings them to an ill habit they make their bodies no better than apothecaries shops this and such like infirmities must needs follow SUBSECT V Bad Air a cause of Melancholy Air is a cause of great moment in producing this or any other disease being that it is still taken into our bodies by respiration and our more inner parts fifteen oh five If it be impure and foggy it dejects the spirits and causeth diseases by infection of the heart as Paulus hath it lib one c forty nine Avicenna lib one Gal de san tuenda Mercurialis Montaltus c fifteen oh six Fernelius saith A thick air thickeneth the blood and humours fifteen oh seven Lemnius reckons up two main things most profitable and most pernicious to our bodies air and diet and this peculiar disease nothing sooner causeth fifteen oh eight Jobertus holds than the air wherein we breathe and live fifteen oh nine Such as is the air such be our spirits and as our spirits such are our humours It offends commonly if it be too fifteen ten hot and dry thick fuliginous cloudy blustering or a tempestuous air Bodine in his fifth Book De repub cap one five of his Method of History proves that hot countries are most troubled with melancholy and that there are therefore in Spain Africa and Asia Minor great numbers of mad men insomuch that they are compelled in all cities of note to build peculiar hospitals for them Leo fifteen eleven Afer lib three de Fessa urbe Ortelius and Zuinger confirm as much they are ordinarily so choleric in their speeches that scarce two words pass without railing or chiding in common talk and often quarrelling in their streets fifteen twelve Gordonius will have every man take notice of it Note this saith he that in hot countries it is far more familiar than in cold Although this we have now said be not continually so for as fifteen thirteen Acosta truly saith under the Equator itself is a most temperate habitation wholesome air a paradise of pleasure the leaves ever green cooling showers But it holds in such as are intemperately hot as fifteen fourteen Johannes a Meggen found in Cyprus others in Malta Aupulia and the fifteen fifteen Holy Land where at some seasons of the year is nothing but dust their rivers dried up the air scorching hot and earth inflamed insomuch that many pilgrims going barefoot for devotion sake from Joppa to Jerusalem upon the hot sands often run mad or else quite overwhelmed with sand profundis arenis as in many parts of Africa Arabia Deserta Bactriana now Charassan when the west wind blows fifteen sixteen Involuti arenis transeuntes necantur fifteen seventeen Hercules de Saxonia a professor in Venice gives this cause why so many Venetian women are melancholy Quod diu sub sole degant they tarry too long in the sun Montanus consil twenty one amongst other causes assigns this Why that Jew his patient was mad Quod tam multum exposuit se calori et frigori he exposed himself so much to heat and cold and for that reason in Venice there is little stirring in those brick paved streets in summer about noon they are most part then asleep as they are likewise in the great Mogol s countries and all over the East Indies At Aden in Arabia as fifteen eighteen Lodovicus Vertomannus relates in his travels they keep their markets in the night to avoid extremity of heat and in Ormus like cattle in a pasture people of all sorts lie up to the chin in water all day long At Braga in Portugal Burgos in Castile Messina in Sicily all over Spain and Italy their streets are most part narrow to avoid the sunbeams The Turks wear great turbans ad fugandos solis radios to refract the sunbeams and much inconvenience that hot air of Bantam in Java yields to our men that sojourn there for traffic where it is so hot fifteen nineteen that they that are sick of the pox lie commonly bleaching in the sun to dry up their sores Such a complaint I read of those isles of Cape Verde fourteen degrees from the Equator they do male audire fifteen twenty One calls them the unhealthiest clime of the world for fluxes fevers frenzies calentures which commonly seize on seafaring men that touch at them and all by reason of a hot distemperature of the air The hardiest men are offended with this heat and stiffest clowns cannot resist it as Constantine affirms Agricult l two c forty five They that are naturally born in such air may not fifteen twenty one endure it as Niger records of some part of Mesopotamia now called Diarbecha Quibusdam in locis saevienti aestui adeo subjecta est ut pleraque animalia fervore solis et coeli extinguantur tis so hot there in some places that men of the country and cattle are killed with it and fifteen twenty two Adricomius of Arabia Felix by reason of myrrh frankincense and hot spices there growing the air is so obnoxious to their brains that the very inhabitants at some times cannot abide it much less weaklings and strangers fifteen twenty three Amatus Lusitanus cent one curat forty five reports of a young maid that was one Vincent a currier s daughter some thirteen years of age that would wash her hair in the heat of the day in July and so let it dry in the sun fifteen twenty four to make it yellow but by that means tarrying too long in the heat she inflamed her head and made herself mad Cold air in the other extreme is almost as bad as hot and so doth Montaltus esteem of it c eleven if it be dry withal In those northern countries the people are therefore generally dull heavy and many witches which as I have before quoted Saxo Grammaticus Olaus Baptista Porta ascribe to melancholy But these cold climes are more subject to natural melancholy not this artificial which is cold and dry for which cause fifteen twenty five Mercurius Britannicus belike puts melancholy men to inhabit just under the Pole The worst of the three is a fifteen twenty six thick cloudy misty foggy air or such as come from fens moorish grounds lakes muck hills draughts sinks where any carcasses or carrion lies or from whence any stinking fulsome smell comes Galen Avicenna Mercurialis new and old physicians hold that such air is unwholesome and engenders melancholy plagues and what not fifteen twenty seven Alexandretta an haven town in the Mediterranean Sea Saint John de Ulloa an haven in Nova Hispania are much condemned for a bad air so are Durazzo in Albania Lithuania Ditmarsh Pomptinae Paludes in Italy the territories about Pisa Ferrara c Romney Marsh with us the Hundreds in Essex the fens in Lincolnshire Cardan de rerum varietate l seventeen c ninety six finds fault with the sight of those rich and most populous cities in the Low Countries as Bruges Ghent Amsterdam Leiden Utrecht c the air is bad and so at Stockholm in Sweden Regium in Italy Salisbury with us Hull and Lynn they may be commodious for navigation this new kind of fortification and many other good necessary uses but are they so wholesome Old Rome hath descended from the hills to the valley tis the site of most of our new cities and held best to build in plains to take the opportunity of rivers Leander Albertus pleads hard for the air and site of Venice though the black moorish lands appear at every low water the sea fire and smoke as he thinks qualify the air and fifteen twenty eight some suppose that a thick foggy air helps the memory as in them of Pisa in Italy and our Camden out of Plato commends the site of Cambridge because it is so near the fens But let the site of such places be as it may how can they be excused that have a delicious seat a pleasant air and all that nature can afford and yet through their own nastiness and sluttishness immund and sordid manner of life suffer their air to putrefy and themselves to be chocked up Many cities in Turkey do male audire in this kind Constantinople itself where commonly carrion lies in the street Some find the same fault in Spain even in Madrid the king s seat a most excellent air a pleasant site but the inhabitants are slovens and the streets uncleanly kept A troublesome tempestuous air is as bad as impure rough and foul weather impetuous winds cloudy dark days as it is commonly with us Coelum visu foedum fifteen twenty nine Polydore calls it a filthy sky et in quo facile generantur nubes as Tully s brother Quintus wrote to him in Rome being then quaestor in Britain In a thick and cloudy air saith Lemnius men are tetric sad and peevish And if the western winds blow and that there be a calm or a fair sunshine day there is a kind of alacrity in men s minds it cheers up men and beasts but if it be a turbulent rough cloudy stormy weather men are sad lumpish and much dejected angry waspish dull and melancholy This was fifteen thirty Virgil s experiment of old Verum ubi tempestas et coeli mobilis humor Mutavere vices et Jupiter humidus Austro Vertuntur species animorum et pectore motus Concipiunt alios But when the face of Heaven changed is To tempests rain from season fair Our minds are altered and in our breasts Forthwith some new conceits appear And who is not weather wise against such and such conjunctions of planets moved in foul weather dull and heavy in such tempestuous seasons fifteen thirty one Gelidum contristat Aquarius annum the time requires and the autumn breeds it winter is like unto it ugly foul squalid the air works on all men more or less but especially on such as are melancholy or inclined to it as Lemnius holds fifteen thirty two They are most moved with it and those which are already mad rave downright either in or against a tempest Besides the devil many times takes his opportunity of such storms and when the humours by the air be stirred he goes in with them exagitates our spirits and vexeth our souls as the sea waves so are the spirits and humours in our bodies tossed with tempestuous winds and storms To such as are melancholy therefore Montanus consil twenty four will have tempestuous and rough air to be avoided and consil twenty seven all night air and would not have them to walk abroad but in a pleasant day Lemnius l three c three discommends the south and eastern winds commends the north Montanus consil thirty one fifteen thirty three Will not any windows to be opened in the night Consil two hundred twenty nine et consil two hundred thirty he discommends especially the south wind and nocturnal air So doth fifteen thirty four Plutarch The night and darkness makes men sad the like do all subterranean vaults dark houses in caves and rocks desert places cause melancholy in an instant especially such as have not been used to it or otherwise accustomed Read more of air in Hippocrates Aetius l three a c one hundred seventy one ad one hundred seventy five Oribasius a c one ad twenty one Avicen l one can Fen two doc two Fen one c one hundred twenty three to the twelve c SUBSECT VI Immoderate Exercise a cause and how Solitariness Idleness Nothing so good but it may be abused nothing better than exercise if opportunely used for the preservation of the body nothing so bad if it be unseasonable violent or overmuch Fernelius out of Galen Path lib one c sixteen saith fifteen thirty five That much exercise and weariness consumes the spirits and substance refrigerates the body and such humours which Nature would have otherwise concocted and expelled it stirs up and makes them rage which being so enraged diversely affect and trouble the body and mind So doth it if it be unseasonably used upon a full stomach or when the body is full of crudities which Fuchsius so much inveighs against lib two instit sec two c four giving that for a cause why schoolboys in Germany are so often scabbed because they use exercise presently after meats fifteen thirty six Bayerus puts in a caveat against such exercise because it fifteen thirty seven corrupts the meat in the stomach and carries the same juice raw and as yet undigested into the veins saith Lemnius which there putrefies and confounds the animal spirits Crato consil twenty one l two fifteen thirty eight protests against all such exercise after meat as being the greatest enemy to concoction that may be and cause of corruption of humours which produce this and many other diseases Not without good reason then doth Salust Salvianus l two c one and Leonartus Jacchinus in nine Rhasis Mercurialis Arcubanus and many other set down fifteen thirty nine immoderate exercise as a most forcible cause of melancholy Opposite to exercise is idleness the badge of gentry or want of exercise the bane of body and mind the nurse of naughtiness stepmother of discipline the chief author of all mischief one of the seven deadly sins and a sole cause of this and many other maladies the devil s cushion as fifteen forty Gualter calls it his pillow and chief reposal For the mind can never rest but still meditates on one thing or other except it be occupied about some honest business of his own accord it rusheth into melancholy fifteen forty one As too much and violent exercise offends on the one side so doth an idle life on the other saith Crato it fills the body full of phlegm gross humours and all manner of obstructions rheums catarrhs c Rhasis cont lib one tract nine accounts of it as the greatest cause of melancholy fifteen forty two I have often seen saith he that idleness begets this humour more than anything else Montaltus c one seconds him out of his experience fifteen forty three They that are idle are far more subject to melancholy than such as are conversant or employed about any office or business fifteen forty four Plutarch reckons up idleness for a sole cause of the sickness of the soul There are they saith he troubled in mind that have no other cause but this Homer Iliad one brings in Achilles eating of his own heart in his idleness because he might not fight Mercurialis consil eighty six for a melancholy young man urgeth fifteen forty five it as a chief cause why was he melancholy because idle Nothing begets it sooner increaseth and continueth it oftener than idleness fifteen forty six A disease familiar to all idle persons an inseparable companion to such as live at ease Pingui otio desidiose agentes a life out of action and have no calling or ordinary employment to busy themselves about that have small occasions and though they have such is their laziness dullness they will not compose themselves to do aught they cannot abide work though it be necessary easy as to dress themselves write a letter or the like yet as he that is benumbed with cold sits still shaking that might relieve himself with a little exercise or stirring do they complain but will not use the facile and ready means to do themselves good and so are still tormented with melancholy Especially if they have been formerly brought up to business or to keep much company and upon a sudden come to lead a sedentary life it crucifies their souls and seizeth on them in an instant for whilst they are any ways employed in action discourse about any business sport or recreation or in company to their liking they are very well but if alone or idle tormented instantly again one day s solitariness one hour s sometimes doth them more harm than a week s physic labour and company can do good Melancholy seizeth on them forthwith being alone and is such a torture that as wise Seneca well saith Malo mihi male quam molliter esse I had rather be sick than idle This idleness is either of body or mind That of body is nothing but a kind of benumbing laziness intermitting exercise which if we may believe fifteen forty seven Fernelius causeth crudities obstructions excremental humours quencheth the natural heat dulls the spirits and makes them unapt to do any thing whatsoever fifteen forty eight Neglectis urenda filix innascitur agris for a neglected field Shall for the fire its thorns and thistles yield As fern grows in untilled grounds and all manner of weeds so do gross humours in an idle body Ignavum corrumpunt otia corpus A horse in a stable that never travels a hawk in a mew that seldom flies are both subject to diseases which left unto themselves are most free from any such encumbrances An idle dog will be mangy and how shall an idle person think to escape Idleness of the mind is much worse than this of the body wit without employment is a disease fifteen forty nine Aerugo animi rubigo ingenii the rust of the soul fifteen fifty a plague a hell itself Maximum animi nocumentum Galen calls it fifteen fifty one As in a standing pool worms and filthy creepers increase et vitium capiunt ni moveantur aquae the water itself putrefies and air likewise if it be not continually stirred by the wind so do evil and corrupt thoughts in an idle person the soul is contaminated In a commonwealth where is no public enemy there is likely civil wars and they rage upon themselves this body of ours when it is idle and knows not how to bestow itself macerates and vexeth itself with cares griefs false fears discontents and suspicions it tortures and preys upon his own bowels and is never at rest Thus much I dare boldly say he or she that is idle be they of what condition they will never so rich so well allied fortunate happy let them have all things in abundance and felicity that heart can wish and desire all contentment so long as he or she or they are idle they shall never be pleased never well in body and mind but weary still sickly still vexed still loathing still weeping sighing grieving suspecting offended with the world with every object wishing themselves gone or dead or else earned away with some foolish phantasy or other And this is the true cause that so many great men ladies and gentlewomen labour of this disease in country and city for idleness is an appendix to nobility they count it a disgrace to work and spend all their days in sports recreations and pastimes and will therefore take no pains be of no vocation they feed liberally fare well want exercise action employment for to work I say they may not abide and Company to their desires and thence their bodies become full of gross humours wind crudities their minds disquieted dull heavy c care jealousy fear of some diseases sullen fits weeping fits seize too fifteen fifty two familiarly on them For what will not fear and phantasy work in an idle body what distempers will they not cause when the children of fifteen fifty three Israel murmured against Pharaoh in Egypt he commanded his officers to double their task and let them get straw themselves and yet make their full number of bricks for the sole cause why they mutiny and are evil at ease is they are idle When you shall hear and see so many discontented persons in all places where you come so many several grievances unnecessary complaints fears suspicions fifteen fifty four the best means to redress it is to set them awork so to busy their minds for the truth is they are idle Well they may build castles in the air for a time and sooth up themselves with fantastical and pleasant humours but in the end they will prove as bitter as gall they shall be still I say discontent suspicious fifteen fifty five fearful jealous sad fretting and vexing of themselves so long as they be idle it is impossible to please them Otio qui nescit uti plus habet negotii quam qui negotium in negotio as that fifteen fifty six Agellius could observe He that knows not how to spend his time hath more business care grief anguish of mind than he that is most busy in the midst of all his business Otiosus animus nescit quid volet An idle person as he follows it knows not when he is well what he would have or whither he would go Quum illuc ventum est illinc lubet he is tired out with everything displeased with all weary of his life Nec bene domi nec militiae neither at home nor abroad errat et praeter vitam vivitur he wanders and lives besides himself In a word What the mischievous effects of laziness and idleness are I do not find any where more accurately expressed than in these verses of Philolaches in the fifteen fifty seven Comical Poet which for their elegancy I will in part insert Novarum aedium esse arbitror similem ego hominem Quando hic natus est Ei rei argumenta dicam Aedes quando sunt ad amussim expolitae Quisque laudat fabrum atque exemplum expetit c At ubi illo migrat nequam homo indiligensque c Tempestas venit confringit tegulas imbricesque Putrifacit aer operam fabri c Dicam ut homines similes esse aedium arbitremini Fabri parentes fundamentum substruunt liberorum Expoliunt docent literas nec parcunt sumptui Ego autem sub fabrorum potestate frugi fui Postquam autem migravi in ingenium meum Perdidi operam fabrorum illico oppido Venit ignavia ea mihi tempestas fuit Adventuque suo grandinem et imbrem attulit Illa mihi virtutem deturbavit c A young man is like a fair new house the carpenter leaves it well built in good repair of solid stuff but a bad tenant lets it rain in and for want of reparation fall to decay c Our parents tutors friends spare no cost to bring us up in our youth in all manner of virtuous education but when we are left to ourselves idleness as a tempest drives all virtuous motions out of our minds et nihili sumus on a sudden by sloth and such bad ways we come to nought Cousin german to idleness and a concomitant cause which goes hand in hand with it is fifteen fifty eight nimia solitudo too much solitariness by the testimony of all physicians cause and symptom both but as it is here put for a cause it is either coact enforced or else voluntary Enforced solitariness is commonly seen in students monks friars anchorites that by their order and course of life must abandon all company society of other men and betake themselves to a private cell Otio superstitioso seclusi as Bale and Hospinian well term it such as are the Carthusians of our time that eat no flesh by their order keep perpetual silence never go abroad Such as live in prison or some desert place and cannot have company as many of our country gentlemen do in solitary houses they must either be alone without companions or live beyond their means and entertain all comers as so many hosts or else converse with their servants and hinds such as are unequal inferior to them and of a contrary disposition or else as some do to avoid solitariness spend their time with lewd fellows in taverns and in alehouses and thence addict themselves to some unlawful disports or dissolute courses Divers again are cast upon this rock of solitariness for want of means or out of a strong apprehension of some infirmity disgrace or through bashfulness rudeness simplicity they cannot apply themselves to others company Nullum solum infelici gratius solitudine ubi nullus sit qui miseriam exprobret this enforced solitariness takes place and produceth his effect soonest in such as have spent their time jovially peradventure in all honest recreations in good company in some great family or populous city and are upon a sudden confined to a desert country cottage far off restrained of their liberty and barred from their ordinary associates solitariness is very irksome to such most tedious and a sudden cause of great inconvenience Voluntary solitariness is that which is familiar with melancholy and gently brings on like a Siren a shoeing horn or some sphinx to this irrevocable gulf fifteen fifty nine a primary cause Piso calls it most pleasant it is at first to such as are melancholy given to lie in bed whole days and keep their chambers to walk alone in some solitary grove betwixt wood and water by a brook side to meditate upon some delightsome and pleasant subject which shall affect them most amabilis insania et mentis gratissimus error a most incomparable delight it is so to melancholise and build castles in the air to go smiling to themselves acting an infinite variety of parts which they suppose and strongly imagine they represent or that they see acted or done Blandae quidem ab initio saith Lemnius to conceive and meditate of such pleasant things sometimes fifteen sixty present past or to come as Rhasis speaks So delightsome these toys are at first they could spend whole days and nights without sleep even whole years alone in such contemplations and fantastical meditations which are like unto dreams and they will hardly be drawn from them or willingly interrupt so pleasant their vain conceits are that they hinder their ordinary tasks and necessary business they cannot address themselves to them or almost to any study or employment these fantastical and bewitching thoughts so covertly so feelingly so urgently so continually set upon creep in insinuate possess overcome distract and detain them they cannot I say go about their more necessary business stave off or extricate themselves but are ever musing melancholising and carried along as he they say that is led round about a heath with a Puck in the night they run earnestly on in this labyrinth of anxious and solicitous melancholy meditations and cannot well or willingly refrain or easily leave off winding and unwinding themselves as so many clocks and still pleasing their humours until at last the scene is turned upon a sudden by some bad object and they being now habituated to such vain meditations and solitary places can endure no company can ruminate of nothing but harsh and distasteful subjects Fear sorrow suspicion subrusticus pudor discontent cares and weariness of life surprise them in a moment and they can think of nothing else continually suspecting no sooner are their eyes open but this infernal plague of melancholy seizeth on them and terrifies their souls representing some dismal object to their minds which now by no means no labour no persuasions they can avoid haeret lateri lethalis arundo the arrow of death still remains in the side they may not be rid of it fifteen sixty one they cannot resist I may not deny but that there is some profitable meditation contemplation and kind of solitariness to be embraced which the fathers so highly commended fifteen sixty two Hierom Chrysostom Cyprian Austin in whole tracts which Petrarch Erasmus Stella and others so much magnify in their books a paradise a heaven on earth if it be used aright good for the body and better for the soul as many of those old monks used it to divine contemplations as Simulus a courtier in Adrian s time Diocletian the emperor retired themselves c in that sense Vatia solus scit vivere Vatia lives alone which the Romans were wont to say when they commended a country life Or to the bettering of their knowledge as Democritus Cleanthes and those excellent philosophers have ever done to sequester themselves from the tumultuous world or as in Pliny s villa Laurentana Tully s Tusculan Jovius study that they might better vacare studiis et Deo serve God and follow their studies Methinks therefore our too zealous innovators were not so well advised in that general subversion of abbeys and religious houses promiscuously to fling down all they might have taken away those gross abuses crept in amongst them rectified such inconveniences and not so far to have raved and raged against those fair buildings and everlasting monuments of our forefathers devotion consecrated to pious uses some monasteries and collegiate cells might have been well spared and their revenues otherwise employed here and there one in good towns or cities at least for men and women of all sorts and conditions to live in to sequester themselves from the cares and tumults of the world that were not desirous or fit to marry or otherwise willing to be troubled with common affairs and know not well where to bestow themselves to live apart in for more conveniency good education better company sake to follow their studies I say to the perfection of arts and sciences common good and as some truly devoted monks of old had done freely and truly to serve God For these men are neither solitary nor idle as the poet made answer to the husbandman in Aesop that objected idleness to him he was never so idle as in his company or that Scipio Africanus in fifteen sixty three Tully Nunquam minus solus quam cum solus nunquam minus otiosus quam quum esset otiosus never less solitary than when he was alone never more busy than when he seemed to be most idle It is reported by Plato in his dialogue de Amore in that prodigious commendation of Socrates how a deep meditation coming into Socrates mind by chance he stood still musing eodem vestigio cogitabundus from morning to noon and when as then he had not yet finished his meditation perstabat cogitans he so continued till the evening the soldiers for he then followed the camp observed him with admiration and on set purpose watched all night but he persevered immovable ad exhortim solis till the sun rose in the morning and then saluting the sun went his ways In what humour constant Socrates did thus I know not or how he might be affected but this would be pernicious to another man what intricate business might so really possess him I cannot easily guess but this is otiosum otium it is far otherwise with these men according to Seneca Omnia nobis mala solitudo persuadet this solitude undoeth us pugnat cum vita sociali tis a destructive solitariness These men are devils alone as the saying is Homo solus aut Deus aut Daemon a man alone is either a saint or a devil mens ejus aut languescit aut tumescit and fifteen sixty four Vae soli in this sense woe be to him that is so alone These wretches do frequently degenerate from men and of sociable creatures become beasts monsters inhumane ugly to behold Misanthropi they do even loathe themselves and hate the company of men as so many Timons Nebuchadnezzars by too much indulging to these pleasing humours and through their own default So that which Mercurialis consil eleven sometimes expostulated with his melancholy patient may be justly applied to every solitary and idle person in particular fifteen sixty five Natura de te videtur conqueri posse c Nature may justly complain of thee that whereas she gave thee a good wholesome temperature a sound body and God hath given thee so divine and excellent a soul so many good parts and profitable gifts thou hast not only contemned and rejected but hast corrupted them polluted them overthrown their temperature and perverted those gifts with riot idleness solitariness and many other ways thou art a traitor to God and nature an enemy to thyself and to the world Perditio tua ex te thou hast lost thyself wilfully cast away thyself thou thyself art the efficient cause of thine own misery by not resisting such vain cogitations but giving way unto them SUBSECT VII Sleeping and Waking Causes What I have formerly said of exercise I may now repeat of sleep Nothing better than moderate sleep nothing worse than it if it be in extremes or unseasonably used It is a received opinion that a melancholy man cannot sleep overmuch Somnus supra modum prodest as an only antidote and nothing offends them more or causeth this malady sooner than waking yet in some cases sleep may do more harm than good in that phlegmatic swinish cold and sluggish melancholy which Melancthon speaks of that thinks of waters sighing most part c fifteen sixty six It dulls the spirits if overmuch and senses fills the head full of gross humours causeth distillations rheums great store of excrements in the brain and all the other parts as fifteen sixty seven Fuchsius speaks of them that sleep like so many dormice Or if it be used in the daytime upon a full stomach the body ill composed to rest or after hard meats it increaseth fearful dreams incubus night walking crying out and much unquietness such sleep prepares the body as fifteen sixty eight one observes to many perilous diseases But as I have said waking overmuch is both a symptom and an ordinary cause It causeth dryness of the brain frenzy dotage and makes the body dry lean hard and ugly to behold as fifteen sixty nine Lemnius hath it The temperature of the brain is corrupted by it the humours adust the eyes made to sink into the head choler increased and the whole body inflamed and as may be added out of Galen three de sanitate tuendo Avicenna three one fifteen seventy It overthrows the natural heat it causeth crudities hurts concoction and what not Not without good cause therefore Crato consil twenty one lib two Hildesheim spicel two de delir et Mania Jacchinus Arculanus on Rhasis Guianerius and Mercurialis reckon up this overmuch waking as a principal cause MEMB III SUBSECT I Passions and Perturbations of the Mind how they cause Melancholy As that gymnosophist in fifteen seventy one Plutarch made answer to Alexander demanding which spake best Every one of his fellows did speak better than the other so may I say of these causes to him that shall require which is the greatest every one is more grievous than other and this of passion the greatest of all A most frequent and ordinary cause of melancholy fifteen seventy two fulmen perturbationum Picolomineus calls it this thunder and lightning of perturbation which causeth such violent and speedy alterations in this our microcosm and many times subverts the good estate and temperature of it For as the body works upon the mind by his bad humours troubling the spirits sending gross fumes into the brain and so per consequens disturbing the soul and all the faculties of it fifteen seventy three Corpus onustum Hesternis vitiis animum quoque praegravat una with fear sorrow c which are ordinary symptoms of this disease so on the other side the mind most effectually works upon the body producing by his passions and perturbations miraculous alterations as melancholy despair cruel diseases and sometimes death itself Insomuch that it is most true which Plato saith in his Charmides omnia corporis mala ab anima procedere all the fifteen seventy four mischiefs of the body proceed from the soul and Democritus in fifteen seventy five Plutarch urgeth Damnatam iri animam a corpore if the body should in this behalf bring an action against the soul surely the soul would be cast and convicted that by her supine negligence had caused such inconveniences having authority over the body and using it for an instrument as a smith doth his hammer saith fifteen seventy six Cyprian imputing all those vices and maladies to the mind Even so doth fifteen seventy seven Philostratus non coinquinatur corpus nisi consensuanimae the body is not corrupted but by the soul Lodovicus Vives will have such turbulent commotions proceed from ignorance and indiscretion fifteen seventy eight All philosophers impute the miseries of the body to the soul that should have governed it better by command of reason and hath not done it The Stoics are altogether of opinion as fifteen seventy nine Lipsius and fifteen eighty Picolomineus record that a wise man should be Greek apathaes without all manner of passions and perturbations whatsoever as fifteen eighty one Seneca reports of Cato the fifteen eighty two Greeks of Socrates and fifteen eighty three Io Aubanus of a nation in Africa so free from passion or rather so stupid that if they be wounded with a sword they will only look back fifteen eighty four Lactantius two instit will exclude fear from a wise man others except all some the greatest passions But let them dispute how they will set down in Thesi give precepts to the contrary we find that of fifteen eighty five Lemnius true by common experience No mortal man is free from these perturbations or if he be so sure he is either a god or a block They are born and bred with us we have them from our parents by inheritance A parentibus habemus malum hunc assem saith fifteen eighty six Pelezius Nascitur una nobiscum aliturque tis propagated from Adam Cain was melancholy fifteen eighty seven as Austin hath it and who is not Good discipline education philosophy divinity I cannot deny may mitigate and restrain these passions in some few men at some times but most part they domineer and are so violent fifteen eighty eight that as a torrent torrens velut aggere rupto bears down all before and overflows his banks sternit agros sternit sata lays waste the fields prostrates the crops they overwhelm reason judgment and pervert the temperature of the body Fertur fifteen eighty nine equis auriga nec audit currus habenas Now such a man saith fifteen ninety Austin that is so led in a wise man s eye is no better than he that stands upon his head It is doubted by some Gravioresne morbi a perturbationibus an ab humoribus whether humours or perturbations cause the more grievous maladies But we find that of our Saviour Mat xxvi forty one most true The spirit is willing the flesh is weak we cannot resist and this of fifteen ninety one Philo Judeus Perturbations often offend the body and are most frequent causes of melancholy turning it out of the hinges of his health Vives compares them to fifteen ninety two Winds upon the sea some only move as those great gales but others turbulent quite overturn the ship Those which are light easy and more seldom to our thinking do us little harm and are therefore contemned of us yet if they be reiterated fifteen ninety three as the rain saith Austin doth a stone so do these perturbations penetrate the mind fifteen ninety four and as one observes produce a habit of melancholy at the last which having gotten the mastery in our souls may well be called diseases How these passions produce this effect fifteen ninety five Agrippa hath handled at large Occult Philos l eleven c sixty three Cardan l fourteen subtil Lemnius l one c twelve de occult nat mir et lib one cap sixteen Suarez Met disput eighteen sect one art twenty five T Bright cap twelve of his Melancholy Treatise Wright the Jesuit in his Book of the Passions of the Mind c Thus in brief to our imagination cometh by the outward sense or memory some object to be known residing in the foremost part of the brain which he misconceiving or amplifying presently communicates to the heart the seat of all affections The pure spirits forthwith flock from the brain to the heart by certain secret channels and signify what good or bad object was presented fifteen ninety six which immediately bends itself to prosecute or avoid it and withal draweth with it other humours to help it so in pleasure concur great store of purer spirits in sadness much melancholy blood in ire choler If the imagination be very apprehensive intent and violent it sends great store of spirits to or from the heart and makes a deeper impression and greater tumult as the humours in the body be likewise prepared and the temperature itself ill or well disposed the passions are longer and stronger so that the first step and fountain of all our grievances in this kind is fifteen ninety seven laesa imaginatio which misinforming the heart causeth all these distemperatures alteration and confusion of spirits and humours By means of which so disturbed concoction is hindered and the principal parts are much debilitated as fifteen ninety eight doctor Navarra well declared being consulted by Montanus about a melancholy Jew The spirits so confounded the nourishment must needs be abated bad humours increased crudities and thick spirits engendered with melancholy blood The other parts cannot perform their functions having the spirits drawn from them by vehement passion but fail in sense and motion so we look upon a thing and see it not hear and observe not which otherwise would much affect us had we been free I may therefore conclude with fifteen ninety nine Arnoldus Maxima vis est phantasiae et huic uni fere non autem corporis intemperiei omnis melancholiae causa est ascribenda Great is the force of imagination and much more ought the cause of melancholy to be ascribed to this alone than to the distemperature of the body Of which imagination because it hath so great a stroke in producing this malady and is so powerful of itself it will not be improper to my discourse to make a brief digression and speak of the force of it and how it causeth this alteration Which manner of digression howsoever some dislike as frivolous and impertinent yet I am of sixteen hundred Beroaldus s opinion Such digressions do mightily delight and refresh a weary reader they are like sauce to a bad stomach and I do therefore most willingly use them SUBSECT II Of the Force of Imagination What imagination is I have sufficiently declared in my digression of the anatomy of the soul I will only now point at the wonderful effects and power of it which as it is eminent in all so most especially it rageth in melancholy persons in keeping the species of objects so long mistaking amplifying them by continual and sixteen oh one strong meditation until at length it produceth in some parties real effects causeth this and many other maladies And although this phantasy of ours be a subordinate faculty to reason and should be ruled by it yet in many men through inward or outward distemperatures defect of organs which are unapt or otherwise contaminated it is likewise unapt or hindered and hurt This we see verified in sleepers which by reason of humours and concourse of vapours troubling the phantasy imagine many times absurd and prodigious things and in such as are troubled with incubus or witch ridden as we call it if they lie on their backs they suppose an old woman rides and sits so hard upon them that they are almost stifled for want of breath when there is nothing offends but a concourse of bad humours which trouble the phantasy This is likewise evident in such as walk in the night in their sleep and do strange feats sixteen oh two these vapours move the phantasy the phantasy the appetite which moving the animal spirits causeth the body to walk up and down as if they were awake Fracast l three de intellect refers all ecstasies to this force of imagination such as lie whole days together in a trance as that priest whom sixteen oh three Celsus speaks of that could separate himself from his senses when he list and lie like a dead man void of life and sense Cardan brags of himself that he could do as much and that when he list Many times such men when they come to themselves tell strange things of heaven and hell what visions they have seen as that saint Owen in Matthew Paris that went into saint Patrick s purgatory and the monk of Evesham in the same author Those common apparitions in Bede and Gregory Saint Bridget s revelations Wier l three de lamiis c eleven Caesar Vanninus in his Dialogues c reduceth as I have formerly said with all those tales of witches progresses dancing riding transformations operations c to the force of sixteen oh four imagination and the sixteen oh five devil s illusions The like effects almost are to be seen in such as are awake how many chimeras antics golden mountains and castles in the air do they build unto themselves I appeal to painters mechanicians mathematicians Some ascribe all vices to a false and corrupt imagination anger revenge lust ambition covetousness which prefers falsehood before that which is right and good deluding the soul with false shows and suppositions sixteen oh six Bernardus Penottus will have heresy and superstition to proceed from this fountain as he falsely imagineth so he believeth and as he conceiveth of it so it must be and it shall be contra gentes he will have it so But most especially in passions and affections it shows strange and evident effects what will not a fearful man conceive in the dark What strange forms of bugbears devils witches goblins Lavater imputes the greatest cause of spectrums and the like apparitions to fear which above all other passions begets the strongest imagination saith sixteen oh seven Wierus and so likewise love sorrow joy c Some die suddenly as she that saw her son come from the battle at Cannae c Jacob the patriarch by force of imagination made speckled lambs laying speckled rods before his sheep Persina that Ethiopian queen in Heliodorus by seeing the picture of Persius and Andromeda instead of a blackamoor was brought to bed of a fair white child In imitation of whom belike a hard favoured fellow in Greece because he and his wife were both deformed to get a good brood of children Elegantissimas imagines in thalamo collocavit c hung the fairest pictures he could buy for money in his chamber That his wife by frequent sight of them might conceive and bear such children And if we may believe Bale one of Pope Nicholas the Third s concubines by seeing of sixteen oh eight a bear was brought to bed of a monster If a woman saith sixteen oh nine Lemnius at the time of her conception think of another man present or absent the child will be like him Great bellied women when they long yield us prodigious examples in this kind as moles warts scars harelips monsters especially caused in their children by force of a depraved phantasy in them Ipsam speciem quam animo effigiat faetui inducit She imprints that stamp upon her child which she sixteen ten conceives unto herself And therefore Lodovicus Vives lib two de Christ faem gives a special caution to great bellied women sixteen eleven that they do not admit such absurd conceits and cogitations but by all means avoid those horrible objects heard or seen or filthy spectacles Some will laugh weep sigh groan blush tremble sweat at such things as are suggested unto them by their imagination Avicenna speaks of one that could cast himself into a palsy when he list and some can imitate the tunes of birds and beasts that they can hardly be discerned Dagebertus and Saint Francis scars and wounds like those of Christ s if at the least any such were sixteen twelve Agrippa supposeth to have happened by force of imagination that some are turned to wolves from men to women and women again to men which is constantly believed to the same imagination or from men to asses dogs or any other shapes sixteen thirteen Wierus ascribes all those famous transformations to imagination that in hydrophobia they seem to see the picture of a dog still in their water sixteen fourteen that melancholy men and sick men conceive so many fantastical visions apparitions to themselves and have such absurd apparitions as that they are kings lords cocks bears apes owls that they are heavy light transparent great and little senseless and dead as shall be showed more at large in our sixteen fifteen sections of symptoms can be imputed to nought else but to a corrupt false and violent imagination It works not in sick and melancholy men only but even most forcibly sometimes in such as are sound it makes them suddenly sick and sixteen sixteen alters their temperature in an instant And sometimes a strong conceit or apprehension as sixteen seventeen Valesius proves will take away diseases in both kinds it will produce real effects Men if they see but another man tremble giddy or sick of some fearful disease their apprehension and fear is so strong in this kind that they will have the same disease Or if by some soothsayer wiseman fortune teller or physician they be told they shall have such a disease they will so seriously apprehend it that they will instantly labour of it A thing familiar in China saith Riccius the Jesuit sixteen eighteen If it be told them they shall be sick on such a day when that day comes they will surely be sick and will be so terribly afflicted that sometimes they die upon it doctor Cotta in his discovery of ignorant practitioners of physic cap eight hath two strange stories to this purpose what fancy is able to do The one of a parson s wife in Northamptonshire An sixteen oh seven that coming to a physician and told by him that she was troubled with the sciatica as he conjectured a disease she was free from the same night after her return upon his words fell into a grievous fit of a sciatica and such another example he hath of another good wife that was so troubled with the cramp after the same manner she came by it because her physician did but name it Sometimes death itself is caused by force of phantasy I have heard of one that coming by chance in company of him that was thought to be sick of the plague which was not so fell down suddenly dead Another was sick of the plague with conceit One seeing his fellow let blood falls down in a swoon Another saith sixteen nineteen Cardan out of Aristotle fell down dead which is familiar to women at any ghastly sight seeing but a man hanged A Jew in France saith sixteen twenty Lodovicus Vives came by chance over a dangerous passage or plank that lay over a brook in the dark without harm the next day perceiving what danger he was in fell down dead Many will not believe such stories to be true but laugh commonly and deride when they hear of them but let these men consider with themselves as sixteen twenty one Peter Byarus illustrates it If they were set to walk upon a plank on high they would be giddy upon which they dare securely walk upon the ground Many saith Agrippa sixteen twenty two strong hearted men otherwise tremble at such sights dazzle and are sick if they look but down from a high place and what moves them but conceit As some are so molested by phantasy so some again by fancy alone and a good conceit are as easily recovered We see commonly the toothache gout falling sickness biting of a mad dog and many such maladies cured by spells words characters and charms and many green wounds by that now so much used Unguentum Armarium magnetically cured which Crollius and Goclenius in a book of late hath defended Libavius in a just tract as stiffly contradicts and most men controvert All the world knows there is no virtue in such charms or cures but a strong conceit and opinion alone as sixteen twenty three Pomponatius holds which forceth a motion of the humours spirits and blood which takes away the cause of the malady from the parts affected The like we may say of our magical effects superstitious cures and such as are done by mountebanks and wizards As by wicked incredulity many men are hurt so saith sixteen twenty four Wierus of charms spells c we find in our experience by the same means many are relieved An empiric oftentimes and a silly chirurgeon doth more strange cures than a rational physician Nymannus gives a reason because the patient puts his confidence in him sixteen twenty five which Avicenna prefers before art precepts and all remedies whatsoever Tis opinion alone saith sixteen twenty six Cardan that makes or mars physicians and he doth the best cures according to Hippocrates in whom most trust So diversely doth this phantasy of ours affect turn and wind so imperiously command our bodies which as another sixteen twenty seven Proteus or a chameleon can take all shapes and is of such force as Ficinus adds that it can work upon others as well as ourselves How can otherwise blear eyes in one man cause the like affection in another Why doth one man s yawning sixteen twenty eight make another yawn One man s pissing provoke a second many times to do the like Why doth scraping of trenchers offend a third or hacking of files Why doth a carcass bleed when the murderer is brought before it some weeks after the murder hath been done Why do witches and old women fascinate and bewitch children but as Wierus Paracelsus Cardan Mizaldus Valleriola Caesar Vanninus Campanella and many philosophers think the forcible imagination of the one party moves and alters the spirits of the other Nay more they can cause and cure not only diseases maladies and several infirmities by this means as Avicenna de anim l four sect four supposeth in parties remote but move bodies from their places cause thunder lightning tempests which opinion Alkindus Paracelsus and some others approve of So that I may certainly conclude this strong conceit or imagination is astrum hominis and the rudder of this our ship which reason should steer but overborne by phantasy cannot manage and so suffers itself and this whole vessel of ours to be overruled and often overturned Read more of this in Wierus l three de Lamiis c eight nine ten Franciscus Valesius med controv l five cont six Marcellus Donatus l two c one de hist med mirabil Levinus Lemnius de occult nat mir l one c twelve Cardan l eighteen de rerum var Corn Agrippa de occult plilos cap sixty four sixty five Camerarius one cent cap fifty four horarum subcis Nymannus morat de Imag Laurentius and him that is instar omnium Fienus a famous physician of Antwerp that wrote three books de viribus imaginationis I have thus far digressed because this imagination is the medium deferens of passions by whose means they work and produce many times prodigious effects and as the phantasy is more or less intended or remitted and their humours disposed so do perturbations move more or less and take deeper impression SUBSECT III Division of Perturbations Perturbations and passions which trouble the phantasy though they dwell between the confines of sense and reason yet they rather follow sense than reason because they are drowned in corporeal organs of sense They are commonly sixteen twenty nine reduced into two inclinations irascible and concupiscible The Thomists subdivide them into eleven six in the coveting and five in the invading Aristotle reduceth all to pleasure and pain Plato to love and hatred sixteen thirty Vives to good and bad If good it is present and then we absolutely joy and love or to come and then we desire and hope for it If evil we absolute hate it if present it is by sorrow if to come fear These four passions sixteen thirty one Bernard compares to the wheels of a chariot by which we are carried in this world All other passions are subordinate unto these four or six as some will love joy desire hatred sorrow fear the rest as anger envy emulation pride jealousy anxiety mercy shame discontent despair ambition avarice c are reducible unto the first and if they be immoderate they sixteen thirty two consume the spirits and melancholy is especially caused by them Some few discreet men there are that can govern themselves and curb in these inordinate affections by religion philosophy and such divine precepts of meekness patience and the like but most part for want of government out of indiscretion ignorance they suffer themselves wholly to be led by sense and are so far from repressing rebellious inclinations that they give all encouragement unto them leaving the reins and using all provocations to further them bad by nature worse by art discipline sixteen thirty three custom education and a perverse will of their own they follow on wheresoever their unbridled affections will transport them and do more out of custom self will than out of reason Contumax voluntas as Melancthon calls it malum facit this stubborn will of ours perverts judgment which sees and knows what should and ought to be done and yet will not do it Mancipia gulae slaves to their several lusts and appetite they precipitate and plunge sixteen thirty four themselves into a labyrinth of cares blinded with lust blinded with ambition sixteen thirty five They seek that at God s hands which they may give unto themselves if they could but refrain from those cares and perturbations wherewith they continually macerate their minds But giving way to these violent passions of fear grief shame revenge hatred malice c they are torn in pieces as Actaeon was with his dogs and sixteen thirty six crucify their own souls SUBSECT IV Sorrow a Cause of Melancholy Sorrow Insanus dolor In this catalogue of passions which so much torment the soul of man and cause this malady for I will briefly speak of them all and in their order the first place in this irascible appetite may justly be challenged by sorrow An inseparable companion sixteen thirty seven The mother and daughter of melancholy her epitome symptom and chief cause as Hippocrates hath it they beget one another and tread in a ring for sorrow is both cause and symptom of this disease How it is a symptom shall be shown in its place That it is a cause all the world acknowledgeth Dolor nonnullis insaniae causa fuit et aliorum morborum insanabilium saith Plutarch to Apollonius a cause of madness a cause of many other diseases a sole cause of this mischief sixteen thirty eight Lemnius calls it So doth Rhasis cont l one tract nine Guianerius Tract fifteen c five And if it take root once it ends in despair as sixteen thirty nine Felix Plater observes and as in sixteen forty Cebes table may well be coupled with it sixteen forty one Chrysostom in his seventeenth epistle to Olympia describes it to be a cruel torture of the soul a most inexplicable grief poisoned worm consuming body and soul and gnawing the very heart a perpetual executioner continual night profound darkness a whirlwind a tempest an ague not appearing heating worse than any fire and a battle that hath no end It crucifies worse than any tyrant no torture no strappado no bodily punishment is like unto it Tis the eagle without question which the poets feigned to gnaw sixteen forty two Prometheus heart and no heaviness is like unto the heaviness of the heart Eccles xxv fifteen sixteen sixteen forty three Every perturbation is a misery but grief a cruel torment a domineering passion as in old Rome when the Dictator was created all inferior magistracies ceased when grief appears all other passions vanish It dries up the bones saith Solomon cap seventeen Prov makes them hollow eyed pale and lean furrow faced to have dead looks wrinkled brows shrivelled cheeks dry bodies and quite perverts their temperature that are misaffected with it As Eleonara that exiled mournful duchess in our sixteen forty four English Ovid laments to her noble husband Humphrey Duke of Gloucester Sawest thou those eyes in whose sweet cheerful look Duke Humphrey once such joy and pleasure took Sorrow hath so despoil d me of all grace Thou couldst not say this was my Elnor s face Like a foul Gorgon c sixteen forty five It hinders concoction refrigerates the heart takes away stomach colour and sleep thickens the blood sixteen forty six Fernelius l one c eighteen de morb causis contaminates the spirits sixteen forty seven Piso Overthrows the natural heat perverts the good estate of body and mind and makes them weary of their lives cry out howl and roar for very anguish of their souls David confessed as much Psalm xxxviii eight I have roared for the very disquietness of my heart And Psalm cxix four part four v My soul melteth away for very heaviness v thirty eight I am like a bottle in the smoke Antiochus complained that he could not sleep and that his heart fainted for grief sixteen forty eight Christ himself vir dolorum out of an apprehension of grief did sweat blood Mark xiv His soul was heavy to the death and no sorrow was like unto his Crato consil twenty four l two gives instance in one that was so melancholy by reason of sixteen forty nine grief and Montanus consil thirty in a noble matron sixteen fifty that had no other cause of this mischief I S D in Hildesheim fully cured a patient of his that was much troubled with melancholy and for many years sixteen fifty one but afterwards by a little occasion of sorrow he fell into his former fits and was tormented as before Examples are common how it causeth melancholy sixteen fifty two desperation and sometimes death itself for Eccles xxxviii fifteen Of heaviness comes death worldly sorrow causeth death two Cor vii ten Psalm xxxi ten My life is wasted with heaviness and my years with mourning Why was Hecuba said to be turned to a dog Niobe into a stone but that for grief she was senseless and stupid Severus the Emperor sixteen fifty three died for grief and how sixteen fifty four many myriads besides Tanta illi est feritas tanta est insania luctus sixteen fifty five Melancthon gives a reason of it sixteen fifty six the gathering of much melancholy blood about the heart which collection extinguisheth the good spirits or at least dulleth them sorrow strikes the heart makes it tremble and pine away with great pain and the black blood drawn from the spleen and diffused under the ribs on the left side makes those perilous hypochondriacal convulsions which happen to them that are troubled with sorrow SUBSECT V Fear a Cause Cousin german to sorrow is fear or rather a sister fidus Achates and continual companion an assistant and a principal agent in procuring of this mischief a cause and symptom as the other In a word as sixteen fifty seven Virgil of the Harpies I may justly say of them both Tristius haud illis monstrum nec saevior ulla Pestis et ira Deum stygiis sese extulit undis A sadder monster or more cruel plague so fell Or vengeance of the gods ne er came from Styx or Hell This foul fiend of fear was worshipped heretofore as a god by the Lacedaemonians and most of those other torturing sixteen fifty eight affections and so was sorrow amongst the rest under the name of Angerona Dea they stood in such awe of them as Austin de Civitat Dei lib four cap eight noteth out of Varro fear was commonly sixteen fifty nine adored and painted in their temples with a lion s head and as Macrobius records l ten Saturnalium sixteen sixty In the calends of January Angerona had her holy day to whom in the temple of Volupia or goddess of pleasure their augurs and bishops did yearly sacrifice that being propitious to them she might expel all cares anguish and vexation of the mind for that year following Many lamentable effects this fear causeth in men as to be red pale tremble sweat sixteen sixty one it makes sudden cold and heat to come over all the body palpitation of the heart syncope c It amazeth many men that are to speak or show themselves in public assemblies or before some great personages as Tully confessed of himself that he trembled still at the beginning of his speech and Demosthenes that great orator of Greece before Philippus It confounds voice and memory as Lucian wittily brings in Jupiter Tragoedus so much afraid of his auditory when he was to make a speech to the rest of the Gods that he could not utter a ready word but was compelled to use Mercury s help in prompting Many men are so amazed and astonished with fear they know not where they are what they say sixteen sixty two what they do and that which is worst it tortures them many days before with continual affrights and suspicion It hinders most honourable attempts and makes their hearts ache sad and heavy They that live in fear are never free sixteen sixty three resolute secure never merry but in continual pain that as Vives truly said Nulla est miseria major quam metus no greater misery no rack nor torture like unto it ever suspicious anxious solicitous they are childishly drooping without reason without judgment sixteen sixty four especially if some terrible object be offered as Plutarch hath it It causeth oftentimes sudden madness and almost all manner of diseases as I have sufficiently illustrated in my sixteen sixty five digression of the force of imagination and shall do more at large in my section of sixteen sixty six terrors Fear makes our imagination conceive what it list invites the devil to come to us as sixteen sixty seven Agrippa and Cardan avouch and tyranniseth over our phantasy more than all other affections especially in the dark We see this verified in most men as sixteen sixty eight Lavater saith Quae metuunt fingunt what they fear they conceive and feign unto themselves they think they see goblins hags devils and many times become melancholy thereby Cardan subtil lib eighteen hath an example of such an one so caused to be melancholy by sight of a bugbear all his life after Augustus Caesar durst not sit in the dark nisi aliquo assidente saith sixteen sixty nine Suetonius Nunquam tenebris exigilavit And tis strange what women and children will conceive unto themselves if they go over a churchyard in the night lie or be alone in a dark room how they sweat and tremble on a sudden Many men are troubled with future events foreknowledge of their fortunes destinies as Severus the Emperor Adrian and Domitian Quod sciret ultimum vitae diem saith Suetonius valde solicitus much tortured in mind because he foreknew his end with many such of which I shall speak more opportunely in another place sixteen seventy Anxiety mercy pity indignation c and such fearful branches derived from these two stems of fear and sorrow I voluntarily omit read more of them in sixteen seventy one Carolus Pascalius sixteen seventy two Dandinus c SUBSECT VI Shame and Disgrace Causes Shame and disgrace cause most violent passions and bitter pangs Ob pudorem et dedecus publicum ob errorum commissum saepe moventur generosi animi Felix Plater lib three de alienat mentis Generous minds are often moved with shame to despair for some public disgrace And he saith Philo lib two de provid dei sixteen seventy three that subjects himself to fear grief ambition shame is not happy but altogether miserable tortured with continual labour care and misery It is as forcible a batterer as any of the rest sixteen seventy four Many men neglect the tumults of the world and care not for glory and yet they are afraid of infamy repulse disgrace Tul offic l one they can severely contemn pleasure bear grief indifferently but they are quite sixteen seventy five battered and broken with reproach and obloquy siquidem vita et fama pari passu ambulant and are so dejected many times for some public injury disgrace as a box on the ear by their inferior to be overcome of their adversary foiled in the field to be out in a speech some foul fact committed or disclosed c that they dare not come abroad all their lives after but melancholise in corners and keep in holes The most generous spirits are most subject to it Spiritus altos frangit et generosos Hieronymus Aristotle because he could not understand the motion of Euripus for grief and shame drowned himself Caelius Rodigimus antiquar lec lib twenty nine cap eight Homerus pudore consumptus was swallowed up with this passion of shame sixteen seventy six because he could not unfold the fisherman s riddle Sophocles killed himself sixteen seventy seven for that a tragedy of his was hissed off the stage Valer max lib nine cap twelve Lucretia stabbed herself and so did sixteen seventy eight Cleopatra when she saw that she was reserved for a triumph to avoid the infamy Antonius the Roman sixteen seventy nine after he was overcome of his enemy for three days space sat solitary in the fore part of the ship abstaining from all company even of Cleopatra herself and afterwards for very shame butchered himself Plutarch vita ejus Apollonius Rhodius sixteen eighty wilfully banished himself forsaking his country and all his dear friends because he was out in reciting his poems Plinius lib seven cap twenty three Ajax ran mad because his arms were adjudged to Ulysses In China tis an ordinary thing for such as are excluded in those famous trials of theirs or should take degrees for shame and grief to lose their wits sixteen eighty one Mat Riccius expedit ad Sinas l three c nine Hostratus the friar took that book which Reuclin had writ against him under the name of Epist obscurorum virorum so to heart that for shame and grief he made away with himself sixteen eighty two Jovius in elogiis A grave and learned minister and an ordinary preacher at Alcmar in Holland was one day as he walked in the fields for his recreation suddenly taken with a lax or looseness and thereupon compelled to retire to the next ditch but being sixteen eighty three surprised at unawares by some gentlewomen of his parish wandering that way was so abashed that he did never after show his head in public or come into the pulpit but pined away with melancholy Pet Forestus med observat lib ten observat twelve So shame amongst other passions can play his prize I know there be many base impudent brazenfaced rogues that will sixteen eighty four Nulla pallescere culpa be moved with nothing take no infamy or disgrace to heart laugh at all let them be proved perjured stigmatised convict rogues thieves traitors lose their ears be whipped branded carted pointed at hissed reviled and derided with sixteen eighty five Ballio the Bawd in Plautus they rejoice at it Cantores probos babe and Bombax what care they We have too many such in our times Exclamat Melicerta perisse Frontem de rebus sixteen eighty six Yet a modest man one that hath grace a generous spirit tender of his reputation will be deeply wounded and so grievously affected with it that he had rather give myriads of crowns lose his life than suffer the least defamation of honour or blot in his good name And if so be that he cannot avoid it as a nightingale Que cantando victa moritur saith sixteen eighty seven Mizaldus dies for shame if another bird sing better he languisheth and pineth away in the anguish of his spirit SUBSECT VII Envy Malice Hatred Causes Envy and malice are two links of this chain and both as Guianerius Tract fifteen cap two proves out of Galen three Aphorism com twenty two sixteen eighty eight cause this malady by themselves especially if their bodies be otherwise disposed to melancholy Tis Valescus de Taranta and Felix Platerus observation sixteen eighty nine Envy so gnaws many men s hearts that they become altogether melancholy And therefore belike Solomon Prov xiv thirteen calls it the rotting of the bones Cyprian vulnus occultum sixteen ninety Siculi non invenere tyranni Majus tormentum The Sicilian tyrants never invented the like torment It crucifies their souls withers their bodies makes them hollow eyed sixteen ninety one pale lean and ghastly to behold Cyprian ser two de zelo et livore sixteen ninety two As a moth gnaws a garment so saith Chrysostom doth envy consume a man to be a living anatomy a skeleton to be a lean and sixteen ninety three pale carcass quickened with a sixteen ninety four fiend Hall in Charact for so often as an envious wretch sees another man prosper to be enriched to thrive and be fortunate in the world to get honours offices or the like he repines and grieves sixteen ninety five intabescitque videndo Successus hominum suppliciumque suum est He tortures himself if his equal friend neighbour be preferred commended do well if he understand of it it galls him afresh and no greater pain can come to him than to hear of another man s well doing tis a dagger at his heart every such object He looks at him as they that fell down in Lucian s rock of honour with an envious eye and will damage himself to do another a mischief Atque cadet subito dum super hoste cadat As he did in Aesop lose one eye willingly that his fellow might lose both or that rich man in sixteen ninety six Quintilian that poisoned the flowers in his garden because his neighbour s bees should get no more honey from them His whole life is sorrow and every word he speaks a satire nothing fats him but other men s ruins For to speak in a word envy is nought else but Tristitia de bonis alienis sorrow for other men s good be it present past or to come et gaudium de adversis and sixteen ninety seven joy at their harms opposite to mercy sixteen ninety eight which grieves at other men s mischances and misaffects the body in another kind so Damascen defines it lib two de orthod fid Thomas two two quaest thirty six art one Aristotle l two Rhet c four et ten Plato Philebo Tully three Tusc Greg Nic l de virt animae c twelve Basil de Invidia Pindarus Od one ser five and we find it true Tis a common disease and almost natural to us as sixteen ninety nine Tacitus holds to envy another man s prosperity And tis in most men an incurable disease seventeen hundred I have read saith Marcus Aurelius Greek Hebrew Chaldee authors I have consulted with many wise men for a remedy for envy I could find none but to renounce all happiness and to be a wretch and miserable for ever Tis the beginning of hell in this life and a passion not to be excused seventeen oh one Every other sin hath some pleasure annexed to it or will admit of an excuse envy alone wants both Other sins last but for awhile the gut may be satisfied anger remits hatred hath an end envy never ceaseth Cardan lib two de sap Divine and humane examples are very familiar you may run and read them as that of Saul and David Cain and Abel angebat illum non proprium peccatum sed fratris prosperitas saith Theodoret it was his brother s good fortune galled him Rachel envied her sister being barren general xxx Joseph s brethren him general xxxvii David had a touch of this vice as he confesseth seventeen oh two Psal thirty seven seventeen oh three Jeremy and seventeen oh four Habakkuk they repined at others good but in the end they corrected themselves Psal seventy five fret not thyself c Domitian spited Agricola for his worth seventeen oh five that a private man should be so much glorified seventeen oh six Cecinna was envied of his fellow citizens because he was more richly adorned But of all others seventeen oh seven women are most weak ob pulchritudinem invidae sunt foeminae Musaeus aut amat aut odit nihil est tertium Granatensis They love or hate no medium amongst them Implacabiles plerumque laesae mulieres Agrippina like seventeen oh eight A woman if she see her neighbour more neat or elegant richer in tires jewels or apparel is enraged and like a lioness sets upon her husband rails at her scoffs at her and cannot abide her so the Roman ladies in Tacitus did at Solonina Cecinna s wife seventeen oh nine because she had a better horse and better furniture as if she had hurt them with it they were much offended In like sort our gentlewomen do at their usual meetings one repines or scoffs at another s bravery and happiness Myrsine an Attic wench was murdered of her fellows seventeen ten because she did excel the rest in beauty Constantine Agricult l eleven c seven Every village will yield such examples SUBSECT VIII Emulation Hatred Faction Desire of Revenge Causes Out of this root of envy seventeen eleven spring those feral branches of faction hatred livor emulation which cause the like grievances and are serrae animae the saws of the soul seventeen twelve consternationis pleni affectus affections full of desperate amazement or as Cyprian describes emulation it is seventeen thirteen a moth of the soul a consumption to make another man s happiness his misery to torture crucify and execute himself to eat his own heart Meat and drink can do such men no good they do always grieve sigh and groan day and night without intermission their breast is torn asunder and a little after seventeen fourteen Whomsoever he is whom thou dost emulate and envy he may avoid thee but thou canst neither avoid him nor thyself wheresoever thou art he is with thee thine enemy is ever in thy breast thy destruction is within thee thou art a captive bound hand and foot as long as thou art malicious and envious and canst not be comforted It was the devil s overthrow and whensoever thou art thoroughly affected with this passion it will be thine Yet no perturbation so frequent no passion so common seventeen fifteen Greek kai kerameus keramei koteei kai tektoni tekton kai ptochos ptochoi phthoneei kai aoidos aoido A potter emulates a potter One smith envies another A beggar emulates a beggar A singing man his brother Every society corporation and private family is full of it it takes hold almost of all sorts of men from the prince to the ploughman even amongst gossips it is to be seen scarce three in a company but there is siding faction emulation between two of them some simultas jar private grudge heart burning in the midst of them Scarce two gentlemen dwell together in the country if they be not near kin or linked in marriage but there is emulation betwixt them and their servants some quarrel or some grudge betwixt their wives or children friends and followers some contention about wealth gentry precedency c by means of which like the frog in seventeen sixteen Aesop that would swell till she was as big as an ox burst herself at last they will stretch beyond their fortunes callings and strive so long that they consume their substance in lawsuits or otherwise in hospitality feasting fine clothes to get a few bombast titles for ambitiosa paupertate laboramus omnes to outbrave one another they will tire their bodies macerate their souls and through contentions or mutual invitations beggar themselves Scarce two great scholars in an age but with bitter invectives they fall foul one on the other and their adherents Scotists Thomists Reals Nominals Plato and Aristotle Galenists and Paracelsians c it holds in all professions Honest seventeen seventeen emulation in studies in all callings is not to be disliked tis ingeniorum cos as one calls it the whetstone of wit the nurse of wit and valour and those noble Romans out of this spirit did brave exploits There is a modest ambition as Themistocles was roused up with the glory of Miltiades Achilles trophies moved Alexander seventeen eighteen Ambire semper stulta confidentia est Ambire nunquam deses arrogantia est Tis a sluggish humour not to emulate or to sue at all to withdraw himself neglect refrain from such places honours offices through sloth niggardliness fear bashfulness or otherwise to which by his birth place fortunes education he is called apt fit and well able to undergo but when it is immoderate it is a plague and a miserable pain What a deal of money did Henry VIII and Francis I king of France spend at that seventeen nineteen famous interview and how many vain courtiers seeking each to outbrave other spent themselves their livelihood and fortunes and died beggars seventeen twenty Adrian the Emperor was so galled with it that he killed all his equals so did Nero This passion made seventeen twenty one Dionysius the tyrant banish Plato and Philoxenus the poet because they did excel and eclipse his glory as he thought the Romans exile Coriolanus confine Camillus murder Scipio the Greeks by ostracism to expel Aristides Nicias Alcibiades imprison Theseus make away Phocion c When Richard I and Philip of France were fellow soldiers together at the siege of Acon in the Holy Land and Richard had approved himself to be the more valiant man insomuch that all men s eyes were upon him it so galled Philip Francum urebat Regis victoria saith mine seventeen twenty two author tam aegre ferebat Richardi gloriam ut carpere dicta calumniari facta that he cavilled at all his proceedings and fell at length to open defiance he could contain no longer but hasting home invaded his territories and professed open war Hatred stirs up contention Prov x twelve and they break out at last into immortal enmity into virulency and more than Vatinian hate and rage seventeen twenty three they persecute each other their friends followers and all their posterity with bitter taunts hostile wars scurrile invectives libels calumnies fire sword and the like and will not be reconciled Witness that Guelph and Ghibelline faction in Italy that of the Adurni and Fregosi in Genoa that of Cneius Papirius and Quintus Fabius in Rome Caesar and Pompey Orleans and Burgundy in France York and Lancaster in England yea this passion so rageth seventeen twenty four many times that it subverts not men only and families but even populous cities seventeen twenty five Carthage and Corinth can witness as much nay flourishing kingdoms are brought into a wilderness by it This hatred malice faction and desire of revenge invented first all those racks and wheels strappadoes brazen bulls feral engines prisons inquisitions severe laws to macerate and torment one another How happy might we be and end our time with blessed days and sweet content if we could contain ourselves and as we ought to do put up injuries learn humility meekness patience forget and forgive as in seventeen twenty six God s word we are enjoined compose such final controversies amongst ourselves moderate our passions in this kind and think better of others as seventeen twenty seven Paul would have us than of ourselves be of like affection one towards another and not avenge ourselves but have peace with all men But being that we are so peevish and perverse insolent and proud so factious and seditious so malicious and envious we do invicem angariare maul and vex one another torture disquiet and precipitate ourselves into that gulf of woes and cares aggravate our misery and melancholy heap upon us hell and eternal damnation SUBSECT IX Anger a Cause Anger a perturbation which carries the spirits outwards preparing the body to melancholy and madness itself Ira furor brevis est anger is temporary madness and as seventeen twenty eight Picolomineus accounts it one of the three most violent passions seventeen twenty nine Areteus sets it down for an especial cause so doth Seneca ep eighteen l one of this malady seventeen thirty Magninus gives the reason Ex frequenti ira supra modum calefiunt it overheats their bodies and if it be too frequent it breaks out into manifest madness saith saint Ambrose Tis a known saying Furor fit Iaesa saepius palienlia the most patient spirit that is if he be often provoked will be incensed to madness it will make a devil of a saint and therefore Basil belike in his Homily de Ira calls it tenebras rationis morbum animae et daemonem pessimum the darkening of our understanding and a bad angel seventeen thirty one Lucian in Abdicato tom one will have this passion to work this effect especially in old men and women Anger and calumny saith he trouble them at first and after a while break out into madness many things cause fury in women especially if they love or hate overmuch or envy be much grieved or angry these things by little and little lead them on to this malady From a disposition they proceed to an habit for there is no difference between a mad man and an angry man in the time of his fit anger as Lactantius describes it L de Ira Dei ad Donatum c five is seventeen thirty two saeva animi tempestas c a cruel tempest of the mind making his eye sparkle fire and stare teeth gnash in his head his tongue stutter his face pale or red and what more filthy imitation can be of a mad man seventeen thirty three Ora tument ira fervescunt sanguine venae Lumina Gorgonio saevius angue micant They are void of reason inexorable blind like beasts and monsters for the time say and do they know not what curse swear rail fight and what not How can a mad man do more as he said in the comedy seventeen thirty four Iracundia non sum apud me I am not mine own man If these fits be immoderate continue long or be frequent without doubt they provoke madness Montanus consil twenty one had a melancholy Jew to his patient he ascribes this for a principal cause Irascebatur levibus de causis he was easily moved to anger Ajax had no other beginning of his madness and Charles the Sixth that lunatic French king fell into this misery out of the extremity of his passion desire of revenge and malice seventeen thirty five incensed against the duke of Britain he could neither eat drink nor sleep for some days together and in the end about the calends of July thirteen ninety two he became mad upon his horseback drawing his sword striking such as came near him promiscuously and so continued all the days of his life Aemil lib ten Gal hist Aegesippus de exid urbis Hieros l one c thirty seven hath such a story of Herod that out of an angry fit became mad seventeen thirty six leaping out of his bed he killed Jossippus and played many such bedlam pranks the whole court could not rule him for a long time after sometimes he was sorry and repented much grieved for that he had done Postquam deferbuit ira by and by outrageous again In hot choleric bodies nothing so soon causeth madness as this passion of anger besides many other diseases as Pelesius observes cap twenty one l one de hum affect causis Sanguinem imminuit fel auget and as seventeen thirty seven Valesius controverts Med controv lib five contro eight many times kills them quite out If this were the worst of this passion it were more tolerable seventeen thirty eight but it ruins and subverts whole towns seventeen thirty nine cities families and kingdoms Nulla pestis humano generi pluris stetit saith Seneca de Ira lib one No plague hath done mankind so much harm Look into our histories and you shall almost meet with no other subject but what a company seventeen forty of harebrains have done in their rage We may do well therefore to put this in our procession amongst the rest From all blindness of heart from pride vainglory and hypocrisy from envy hatred and malice anger and all such pestiferous perturbations good Lord deliver us SUBSECT X Discontents Cares Miseries c Causes Discontents cares crosses miseries or whatsoever it is that shall cause any molestation of spirits grief anguish and perplexity may well be reduced to this head preposterously placed here in some men s judgments they may seem yet in that Aristotle in his seventeen forty one Rhetoric defines these cares as he doth envy emulation c still by grief I think I may well rank them in this irascible row being that they are as the rest both causes and symptoms of this disease producing the like inconveniences and are most part accompanied with anguish and pain The common etymology will evince it Cura quasi cor uro Dementes curae insomnes curae damnosae curae tristes mordaces carnifices c biting eating gnawing cruel bitter sick sad unquiet pale tetric miserable intolerable cares as the poets seventeen forty two call them worldly cares and are as many in number as the sea sands seventeen forty three Galen Fernelius Felix Plater Valescus de Taranta c reckon afflictions miseries even all these contentions and vexations of the mind as principal causes in that they take away sleep hinder concoction dry up the body and consume the substance of it They are not so many in number but their causes be as divers and not one of a thousand free from them or that can vindicate himself whom that Ate dea seventeen forty four Per hominum capita molliter ambulans Plantas pedum teneras habens Over men s heads walking aloft With tender feet treading so soft Homer s Goddess Ate hath not involved into this discontented seventeen forty five rank or plagued with some misery or other Hyginus fab two hundred twenty to this purpose hath a pleasant tale Dame Cura by chance went over a brook and taking up some of the dirty slime made an image of it Jupiter eftsoons coming by put life to it but Cura and Jupiter could not agree what name to give him or who should own him the matter was referred to Saturn as judge he gave this arbitrement his name shall be Homo ab humo Cura eum possideat quamdiu vivat Care shall have him whilst he lives Jupiter his soul and Tellus his body when he dies But to leave tales A general cause a continuate cause an inseparable accident to all men is discontent care misery were there no other particular affliction which who is free from to molest a man in this life the very cogitation of that common misery were enough to macerate and make him weary of his life to think that he can never be secure but still in danger sorrow grief and persecution For to begin at the hour of his birth as seventeen forty six Pliny doth elegantly describe it he is born naked and falls seventeen forty seven a whining at the very first he is swaddled and bound up like a prisoner cannot help himself and so he continues to his life s end Cujusque ferae pabulum saith seventeen forty eight Seneca impatient of heat and cold impatient of labour impatient of idleness exposed to fortune s contumelies To a naked mariner Lucretius compares him cast on shore by shipwreck cold and comfortless in an unknown land seventeen forty nine no estate age sex can secure himself from this common misery A man that is born of a woman is of short continuance and full of trouble Job xiv one twenty two And while his flesh is upon him he shall be sorrowful and while his soul is in him it shall mourn All his days are sorrow and his travels griefs his heart also taketh not rest in the night Eccles ii twenty three and ii eleven All that is in it is sorrow and vexation of spirit seventeen fifty Ingress progress regress egress much alike blindness seizeth on us in the beginning labour in the middle grief in the end error in all What day ariseth to us without some grief care or anguish Or what so secure and pleasing a morning have we seen that hath not been overcast before the evening One is miserable another ridiculous a third odious One complains of this grievance another of that Aliquando nervi aliquando pedes vexant Seneca nunc distillatio nunc epatis morbus nunc deest nunc superest sanguis now the head aches then the feet now the lungs then the liver c Huic sensus exuberat sed est pudori degener sanguis c He is rich but base born he is noble but poor a third hath means but he wants health peradventure or wit to manage his estate children vex one wife a second c Nemo facile cum conditione sua concordat no man is pleased with his fortune a pound of sorrow is familiarly mixed with a dram of content little or no joy little comfort but seventeen fifty one everywhere danger contention anxiety in all places go where thou wilt and thou shalt find discontents cares woes complaints sickness diseases encumbrances exclamations If thou look into the market there saith seventeen fifty two Chrysostom is brawling and contention if to the court there knavery and flattery c if to a private man s house there s cark and care heaviness c As he said of old seventeen fifty three Nil homine in terra spirat miserum magis alma No creature so miserable as man so generally molested seventeen fifty four in miseries of body in miseries of mind miseries of heart in miseries asleep in miseries awake in miseries wheresoever he turns as Bernard found Nunquid tentatio est vita humana super terram A mere temptation is our life Austin confess lib ten cap twenty eight catena perpetuorum malorum et quis potest molestias et difficultates pati Who can endure the miseries of it seventeen fifty five In prosperity we are insolent and intolerable dejected in adversity in all fortunes foolish and miserable seventeen fifty six In adversity I wish for prosperity and in prosperity I am afraid of adversity What mediocrity may be found Where is no temptation What condition of life is free seventeen fifty seven Wisdom hath labour annexed to it glory envy riches and cares children and encumbrances pleasure and diseases rest and beggary go together as if a man were therefore born as the Platonists hold to be punished in this life for some precedent sins Or that as seventeen fifty eight Pliny complains Nature may be rather accounted a stepmother than a mother unto us all things considered no creature s life so brittle so full of fear so mad so furious only man is plagued with envy discontent griefs covetousness ambition superstition Our whole life is an Irish sea wherein there is nought to be expected but tempestuous storms and troublesome waves and those infinite seventeen fifty nine Tantum malorum pelagus aspicio Ut non sit inde enatandi copia no halcyonian times wherein a man can hold himself secure or agree with his present estate but as Boethius infers seventeen sixty there is something in every one of us which before trial we seek and having tried abhor seventeen sixty one we earnestly wish and eagerly covet and are eftsoons weary of it Thus between hope and fear suspicions angers seventeen sixty two Inter spemque metumque timores inter et iras betwixt falling in falling out c we bangle away our best days befool out our times we lead a contentious discontent tumultuous melancholy miserable life insomuch that if we could foretell what was to come and it put to our choice we should rather refuse than accept of this painful life In a word the world itself is a maze a labyrinth of errors a desert a wilderness a den of thieves cheaters c full of filthy puddles horrid rocks precipitiums an ocean of adversity an heavy yoke wherein infirmities and calamities overtake and follow one another as the sea waves and if we scape Scylla we fall foul on Charybdis and so in perpetual fear labour anguish we run from one plague one mischief one burden to another duram servientes servitutem and you may as soon separate weight from lead heat from fire moistness from water brightness from the sun as misery discontent care calamity danger from a man Our towns and cities are but so many dwellings of human misery In which grief and sorrow seventeen sixty three as he right well observes out of Solon innumerable troubles labours of mortal men and all manner of vices are included as in so many pens Our villages are like molehills and men as so many emmets busy busy still going to and fro in and out and crossing one another s projects as the lines of several sea cards cut each other in a globe or map Now light and merry but seventeen sixty four as one follows it by and by sorrowful and heavy now hoping then distrusting now patient tomorrow crying out now pale then red running sitting sweating trembling halting c Some few amongst the rest or perhaps one of a thousand may be Pullus Jovis in the world s esteem Gallinae filius albae an happy and fortunate man ad invidiam felix because rich fair well allied in honour and office yet peradventure ask himself and he will say that of all others seventeen sixty five he is most miserable and unhappy A fair shoe Hic soccus novus elegans as he seventeen sixty six said sed nescis ubi urat but thou knowest not where it pincheth It is not another man s opinion can make me happy but as seventeen sixty seven Seneca well hath it He is a miserable wretch that doth not account himself happy though he be sovereign lord of a world he is not happy if he think himself not to be so for what availeth it what thine estate is or seem to others if thou thyself dislike it A common humour it is of all men to think well of other men s fortunes and dislike their own seventeen sixty eight Cui placet alterius sua nimirum est odio sors but seventeen sixty nine qui fit Mecoenas c how comes it to pass what s the cause of it Many men are of such a perverse nature they are well pleased with nothing saith seventeen seventy Theodoret neither with riches nor poverty they complain when they are well and when they are sick grumble at all fortunes prosperity and adversity they are troubled in a cheap year in a barren plenty or not plenty nothing pleaseth them war nor peace with children nor without This for the most part is the humour of us all to be discontent miserable and most unhappy as we think at least and show me him that is not so or that ever was otherwise Quintus Metellus his felicity is infinitely admired amongst the Romans insomuch that as seventeen seventy one Paterculus mentioneth of him you can scarce find of any nation order age sex one for happiness to be compared unto him he had in a word Bona animi corporis et fortunae goods of mind body and fortune so had P Mutianus seventeen seventy two Crassus Lampsaca that Lacedaemonian lady was such another in seventeen seventy three Pliny s conceit a king s wife a king s mother a king s daughter and all the world esteemed as much of Polycrates of Samos The Greeks brag of their Socrates Phocion Aristides the Psophidians in particular of their Aglaus Omni vita felix ab omni periculo immunis which by the way Pausanias held impossible the Romans of their seventeen seventy four Cato Curius Fabricius for their composed fortunes and retired estates government of passions and contempt of the world yet none of all these were happy or free from discontent neither Metellus Crassus nor Polycrates for he died a violent death and so did Cato and how much evil doth Lactantius and Theodoret speak of Socrates a weak man and so of the rest There is no content in this life but as seventeen seventy five he said All is vanity and vexation of spirit lame and imperfect Hadst thou Sampson s hair Milo s strength Scanderbeg s arm Solomon s wisdom Absalom s beauty Croesus wealth Pasetis obulum Caesar s valour Alexander s spirit Tully s or Demosthenes eloquence Gyges ring Perseus Pegasus and Gorgon s head Nestor s years to come all this would not make thee absolute give thee content and true happiness in this life or so continue it Even in the midst of all our mirth jollity and laughter is sorrow and grief or if there be true happiness amongst us tis but for a time seventeen seventy six Desinat in piscem mulier formosa superne A handsome woman with a fish s tail a fair morning turns to a lowering afternoon Brutus and Cassius once renowned both eminently happy yet you shall scarce find two saith Paterculus quos fortuna maturius destiturit whom fortune sooner forsook Hannibal a conqueror all his life met with his match and was subdued at last Occurrit forti qui mage fortis erit One is brought in triumph as Caesar into Rome Alcibiades into Athens coronis aureis donatus crowned honoured admired by and by his statues demolished he hissed out massacred c seventeen seventy seven Magnus Gonsalva that famous Spaniard was of the prince and people at first honoured approved forthwith confined and banished Admirandas actiones graves plerunque sequuntur invidiae et acres calumniae tis Polybius his observation grievous enmities and bitter calumnies commonly follow renowned actions One is born rich dies a beggar sound today sick tomorrow now in most flourishing estate fortunate and happy by and by deprived of his goods by foreign enemies robbed by thieves spoiled captivated impoverished as they of seventeen seventy eight Rabbah put under iron saws and under iron harrows and under axes of iron and cast into the tile kiln seventeen seventy nine Quid me felicem toties jactastis amici Qui cecidit stabili non erat ille gradu He that erst marched like Xerxes with innumerable armies as rich as Croesus now shifts for himself in a poor cock boat is bound in iron chains with Bajazet the Turk and a footstool with Aurelian for a tyrannising conqueror to trample on So many casualties there are that as Seneca said of a city consumed with fire Una dies interest inter maximum civitatem et nullam one day betwixt a great city and none so many grievances from outward accidents and from ourselves our own indiscretion inordinate appetite one day betwixt a man and no man And which is worse as if discontents and miseries would not come fast enough upon us homo homini daemon we maul persecute and study how to sting gall and vex one another with mutual hatred abuses injuries preying upon and devouring as so many seventeen eighty ravenous birds and as jugglers panders bawds cozening one another or raging as seventeen eighty one wolves tigers and devils we take a delight to torment one another men are evil wicked malicious treacherous and seventeen eighty two naught not loving one another or loving themselves not hospitable charitable nor sociable as they ought to be but counterfeit dissemblers ambidexters all for their own ends hard hearted merciless pitiless and to benefit themselves they care not what mischief they procure to others seventeen eighty three Praxinoe and Gorgo in the poet when they had got in to see those costly sights they then cried bene est and would thrust out all the rest when they are rich themselves in honour preferred full and have even that they would

loathes and scorns his inferior hates or emulates his equal envies his superior insults over all such as are under him as if he were of another species a demigod not subject to any fall or human infirmities Generally they love not are not beloved again they tire out others bodies with continual labour they themselves living at ease caring for none else sibi nati and are so far many times from putting to their helping hand that they seek all means to depress even most worthy and well deserving better than themselves those whom they are by the laws of nature bound to relieve and help as much as in them lies they will let them caterwaul starve beg and hang before they will any ways though it be in their power assist or ease seventeen eighty five so unnatural are they for the most part so unregardful so hard hearted so churlish proud insolent so dogged of so bad a disposition And being so brutish so devilishly bent one towards another how is it possible but that we should be discontent of all sides full of cares woes and miseries If this be not a sufficient proof of their discontent and misery examine every condition and calling apart Kings princes monarchs and magistrates seem to be most happy but look into their estate you shall seventeen eighty six find them to be most encumbered with cares in perpetual fear agony suspicion jealousy that as seventeen eighty seven he said of a crown if they knew but the discontents that accompany it they would not stoop to take it up Quem mihi regent dabis saith Chrysostom non curis plenum What king canst thou show me not full of cares

suddenly depress and leave in a vale of misery The middle sort of men are as so many asses to bear burdens or if they be free and live at ease they spend themselves and consume their bodies and fortunes with luxury and riot contention emulation c The poor I reserve for another seventeen ninety place and their discontents For particular professions I hold as of the rest there s no content or

table and groan for the very anguish of our souls Our hearts fail us as David s did Psal xl twelve for innumerable troubles that compassed him and we are ready to confess with Hezekiah Isaiah lviii seventeen behold for felicity I had bitter grief to weep with Heraclitus to curse the day of our birth with Jeremy xx fourteen and our stars with Job to hold that axiom of Silenus eighteen oh one better never to have been born and the best next of all to die quickly or if we must live to abandon the world as Timon did creep into caves and holes as our anchorites cast all into the sea as Crates Thebanus or as Theombrotus Ambrociato s four hundred auditors precipitate ourselves to be rid of these miseries SUBSECT XI Concupiscible Appetite as Desires Ambition Causes These concupiscible and irascible appetites are as the two twists of a rope mutually mixed one with the other and both twining about the heart both good as Austin holds l fourteen c nine de civ Dei eighteen oh two if they be moderate both pernicious if they be exorbitant This concupiscible appetite howsoever it may seem to carry with it a show of pleasure and delight and our concupiscences most part affect us with content and a pleasing object yet if they be in extremes they rack and wring us on the other side A true saying it is Desire hath no rest is infinite in itself endless and as eighteen oh three one calls it a perpetual rack eighteen oh four or horse mill according to Austin still going round as in a ring They are not so continual as divers felicius atomos denumerare possem saith eighteen oh five Bernard quam motus cordis nunc haec nunc illa cogito you may as well reckon up the motes in the sun as them eighteen oh six It extends itself to everything as Guianerius will have it that is superfluously sought after or to any eighteen oh seven fervent desire as Fernelius interprets it be it in what kind soever it tortures if immoderate and is according to eighteen oh eight Plater and others an especial cause of melancholy Multuosis concupiscentiis dilaniantur cogitationes meae eighteen oh nine Austin confessed that he was torn a pieces with his manifold desires and so doth eighteen ten Bernard complain that he could not rest for them a minute of an hour this I would have and that and then I desire to be such and such Tis a hard matter therefore to confine them being they are so various and many impossible to apprehend all I will only insist upon some few of the chief and most noxious in their kind as that exorbitant appetite and desire of honour which we commonly call ambition love of money which is covetousness and that greedy desire of gain self love pride and inordinate desire of vainglory or applause love of study in excess love of women which will require a just volume of itself of the other I will briefly speak and in their order Ambition a proud covetousness or a dry thirst of honour a great torture of the mind composed of envy pride and covetousness a gallant madness one eighteen eleven defines it a pleasant poison Ambrose a canker of the soul an hidden plague eighteen twelve Bernard a secret poison the father of livor and mother of hypocrisy the moth of holiness and cause of madness crucifying and disquieting all that it takes hold of eighteen thirteen Seneca calls it rem solicitam timidam vanam ventosam a windy thing a vain solicitous and fearful thing For commonly they that like Sisyphus roll this restless stone of ambition are in a perpetual agony still eighteen fourteen perplexed semper taciti tritesque recedunt Lucretius doubtful timorous suspicious loath to offend in word or deed still cogging and colloguing embracing capping cringing applauding flattering fleering visiting waiting at men s doors with all affability counterfeit honesty and humility eighteen fifteen If that will not serve if once this humour as eighteen sixteen Cyprian describes it possess his thirsty soul ambitionis salsugo ubi bibulam animam possidet by hook and by crook he will obtain it and from his hole he will climb to all honours and offices if it be possible for him to get up flattering one bribing another he will leave no means unessay d to win all eighteen seventeen It is a wonder to see how slavishly these kind of men subject themselves when they are about a suit to every inferior person what pains they will take run ride cast plot countermine protest and swear vow promise what labours undergo early up down late how obsequious and affable they are how popular and courteous how they grin and fleer upon every man they meet with what feasting and inviting how they spend themselves and their fortunes in seeking that many times which they had much better be without as eighteen eighteen Cyneas the orator told Pyrrhus with what waking nights painful hours anxious thoughts and bitterness of mind inter spemque metumque distracted and tired they consume the interim of their time There can be no greater plague for the present If they do obtain their suit which with such cost and solicitude they have sought they are not so freed their anxiety is anew to begin for they are never satisfied nihil aliud nisi imperium spirant their thoughts actions endeavours are all for sovereignty and honour like eighteen nineteen Lues Sforza that huffing Duke of Milan a man of singular wisdom but profound ambition born to his own and to the destruction of Italy though it be to their own ruin and friends undoing they will contend they may not cease but as a dog in a wheel a bird in a cage or a squirrel in a chain so eighteen twenty Budaeus compares them eighteen twenty one they climb and climb still with much labour but never make an end never at the top A knight would be a baronet and then a lord and then a viscount and then an earl c a doctor a dean and then a bishop from tribune to praetor from bailiff to major first this office and then that as Pyrrhus in eighteen twenty two Plutarch they will first have Greece then Africa and then Asia and swell with Aesop s frog so long till in the end they burst or come down with Sejanus ad Gemonias scalas and break their own necks or as Evangelus the piper in Lucian that blew his pipe so long till he fell down dead If he chance to miss and have a canvass he is in a hell on the other side so dejected that he is ready to hang himself turn heretic Turk or traitor in an instant Enraged against his enemies he rails swears fights slanders detracts envies murders and for his own part si appetitum explere non potest furore corripitur if he cannot satisfy his desire as eighteen twenty three Bodine writes he runs mad So that both ways hit or miss he is distracted so long as his ambition lasts he can look for no other but anxiety and care discontent and grief in the meantime eighteen twenty four madness itself or violent death in the end The event of this is common to be seen in populous cities or in princes courts for a courtier s life as Budaeus describes it is a eighteen twenty five gallimaufry of ambition lust fraud imposture dissimulation detraction envy pride eighteen twenty six the court a common conventicle of flatterers time servers politicians c or as eighteen twenty seven Anthony Perez will the suburbs of hell itself If you will see such discontented persons there you shall likely find them eighteen twenty eight And which he observed of the markets of old Rome Qui perjurum convenire vult hominem mitto in Comitium Qui mendacem et gloriosum apud Cluasinae sacrum Dites damnosos maritos sub basilica quaerito c Perjured knaves knights of the post liars crackers bad husbands c keep their several stations they do still and always did in every commonwealth SUBSECT XII Greek philarguria Covetousness a Cause Plutarch in his eighteen twenty nine book whether the diseases of the body be more grievous than those of the soul is of opinion if you will examine all the causes of our miseries in this life you shall find them most part to have had their beginning from stubborn anger that furious desire of contention or some unjust or immoderate affection as covetousness c From whence are wars and contentions amongst you eighteen thirty saint James asks I will add usury fraud rapine simony oppression lying swearing bearing false witness c are they not from this fountain of covetousness that greediness in getting tenacity in keeping sordidity in spending that they are so wicked eighteen thirty one unjust against God their neighbour themselves all comes hence The desire of money is the root of all evil and they that lust after it pierce themselves through with many sorrows one Tim vi ten Hippocrates therefore in his Epistle to Crateva an herbalist gives him this good counsel that if it were possible eighteen thirty two amongst other herbs he should cut up that weed of covetousness by the roots that there be no remainder left and then know this for a certainty that together with their bodies thou mayst quickly cure all the diseases of their minds For it is indeed the pattern image epitome of all melancholy the fountain of many miseries much discontented care and woe this inordinate or immoderate desire of gain to get or keep money as eighteen thirty three Bonaventure defines it or as Austin describes it a madness of the soul Gregory a torture Chrysostom an insatiable drunkenness Cyprian blindness speciosum supplicium a plague subverting kingdoms families an eighteen thirty four incurable disease Budaeus an ill habit eighteen thirty five yielding to no remedies neither Aesculapius nor Plutus can cure them a continual plague saith Solomon and vexation of spirit another hell I know there be some of opinion that covetous men are happy and worldly wise that there is more pleasure in getting of wealth than in spending and no delight in the world like unto it Twas eighteen thirty six Bias problem of old With what art thou not weary with getting money What is most delectable to gain What is it trow you that makes a poor man labour all his lifetime carry such great burdens fare so hardly macerate himself and endure so much misery undergo such base offices with so great patience to rise up early and lie down late if there were not an extraordinary delight in getting and keeping of money What makes a merchant that hath no need satis superque domi to range all over the world through all those intemperate eighteen thirty seven Zones of heat and cold voluntarily to venture his life and be content with such miserable famine nasty usage in a stinking ship if there were not a pleasure and hope to get money which doth season the rest and mitigate his indefatigable pains What makes them go into the bowels of the earth an hundred fathom deep endangering their dearest lives enduring damps and filthy smells when they have enough already if they could be content and no such cause to labour but an extraordinary delight they take in riches This may seem plausible at first show a popular and strong argument but let him that so thinks consider better of it and he shall soon perceive that it is far otherwise than he supposeth it may be haply pleasing at the first as most part all melancholy is For such men likely have some lucida intervalla pleasant symptoms intermixed but you must note that of eighteen thirty eight Chrysostom Tis one thing to be rich another to be covetous generally they are all fools dizzards madmen eighteen thirty nine miserable wretches living besides themselves sine arte fruendi in perpetual slavery fear suspicion sorrow and discontent plus aloes quam mellis habent and are indeed rather possessed by their money than possessors as eighteen forty Cyprian hath it mancipati pecuniis bound prentice to their goods as eighteen forty one Pliny or as Chrysostom servi divitiarum slaves and drudges to their substance and we may conclude of them all as eighteen forty two Valerius doth of Ptolomaeus king of Cyprus He was in title a king of that island but in his mind a miserable drudge of money eighteen forty three potiore metallis libertate carens wanting his liberty which is better than gold Damasippus the Stoic in Horace proves that all mortal men dote by fits some one way some another but that covetous men eighteen forty four are madder than the rest and he that shall truly look into their estates and examine their symptoms shall find no better of them but that they are all eighteen forty five fools as Nabal was Re et nomine one Reg fifteen For what greater folly can there be or eighteen forty six madness than to macerate himself when he need not and when as Cyprian notes eighteen forty seven he may be freed from his burden and eased of his pains will go on still his wealth increasing when he hath enough to get more to live besides himself to starve his genius keep back from his wife eighteen forty eight and children neither letting them nor other friends use or enjoy that which is theirs by right and which they much need perhaps like a hog or dog in the manger he doth only keep it because it shall do nobody else good hurting himself and others and for a little momentary pelf damn his own soul They are commonly sad and tetric by nature as Achab s spirit was because he could not get Naboth s vineyard one Reg twenty two and if he lay out his money at any time though it be to necessary uses to his own children s good he brawls and scolds his heart is heavy much disquieted he is and loath to part from it Miser abstinet et timet uti Hor He is of a wearish dry pale constitution and cannot sleep for cares and worldly business his riches saith Solomon will not let him sleep and unnecessary business which he heapeth on himself or if he do sleep tis a very unquiet interrupt unpleasing sleep with his bags in his arms congestis undique sacc indormit inhians And though he be at a banquet or at some merry feast he sighs for grief of heart as eighteen forty nine Cyprian hath it and cannot sleep though it be upon a down bed his wearish body takes no rest eighteen fifty troubled in his abundance and sorrowful in plenty unhappy for the present and more unhappy in the life to come Basil He is a perpetual drudge eighteen fifty one restless in his thoughts and never satisfied a slave a wretch a dust worm semper quod idolo suo immolet sedulus observat Cypr prolog ad sermon still seeking what sacrifice he may offer to his golden god per fas et nefas he cares not how his trouble is endless eighteen fifty two crescunt divitiae tamen curtae nescio quid semper abest rei his wealth increaseth and the more he hath the more eighteen fifty three he wants like Pharaoh s lean kine which devoured the fat and were not satisfied eighteen fifty four Austin therefore defines covetousness quarumlibet rerum inhonestam et insatiabilem cupiditatem a dishonest and insatiable desire of gain and in one of his epistles compares it to hell eighteen fifty five which devours all and yet never hath enough a bottomless pit an endless misery in quem scopulum avaritiae cadaverosi senes utplurimum impingunt and that which is their greatest corrosive they are in continual suspicion fear and distrust He thinks his own wife and children are so many thieves and go about to cozen him his servants are all false Rem suam periisse seque eradicarier Et divum atque hominum clamat continuo fidem De suo tigillo si qua exit foras If his doors creek then out he cries anon His goods are gone and he is quite undone Timidus Plutus an old proverb As fearful as Plutus so doth Aristophanes and Lucian bring him in fearful still pale anxious suspicious and trusting no man eighteen fifty six They are afraid of tempests for their corn they are afraid of their friends lest they should ask something of them beg or borrow they are afraid of their enemies lest they hurt them thieves lest they rob them they are afraid of war and afraid of peace afraid of rich and afraid of poor afraid of all Last of all they are afraid of want that they shall die beggars which makes them lay up still and dare not use that they have what if a dear year come or dearth or some loss and were it not that they are both to eighteen fifty seven lay out money on a rope they would be hanged forthwith and sometimes die to save charges and make away themselves if their corn and cattle miscarry though they have abundance left as eighteen fifty eight Agellius notes eighteen fifty nine Valerius makes mention of one that in a famine sold a mouse for two hundred pence and famished himself such are their cares eighteen sixty griefs and perpetual fears These symptoms are elegantly expressed by Theophrastus in his character of a covetous man eighteen sixty one lying in bed he asked his wife whether she shut the trunks and chests fast the cap case be sealed and whether the hall door be bolted and though she say all is well he riseth out of his bed in his shirt barefoot and barelegged to see whether it be so with a dark lantern searching every corner scarce sleeping a wink all night Lucian in that pleasant and witty dialogue called Gallus brings in Mycillus the cobbler disputing with his cock sometimes Pythagoras where after much speech pro and con to prove the happiness of a mean estate and discontents of a rich man Pythagoras cock in the end to illustrate by examples that which he had said brings him to Gnyphon the usurer s house at midnight and after that to Encrates whom they found both awake casting up their accounts and telling of their money eighteen sixty two lean dry pale and anxious still suspecting lest somebody should make a hole through the wall and so get in or if a rat or mouse did but stir starting upon a sudden and running to the door to see whether all were fast Plautus in his Aulularia makes old Euclio eighteen sixty three commanding Staphyla his wife to shut the doors fast and the fire to be put out lest anybody should make that an errand to come to his house when he washed his hands eighteen sixty four he was loath to fling away the foul water complaining that he was undone because the smoke got out of his roof And as he went from home seeing a crow scratch upon the muck hill returned in all haste taking it for malum omen an ill sign his money was digged up with many such He that will but observe their actions shall find these and many such passages not feigned for sport but really performed verified indeed by such covetous and miserable wretches and that it is eighteen sixty five manifesta phrenesis Ut locuples moriaris egenti vivere fato A mere madness to live like a wretch and die rich SUBSECT XIII Love of Gaming c and pleasures immoderate Causes It is a wonder to see how many poor distressed miserable wretches one shall meet almost in every path and street begging for an alms that have been well descended and sometimes in flourishing estate now ragged tattered and ready to be starved lingering out a painful life in discontent and grief of body and mind and all through immoderate lust gaming pleasure and riot Tis the common end of all sensual epicures and brutish prodigals that are stupefied and carried away headlong with their several pleasures and lusts Cebes in his table saint Ambrose in his second book of Abel and Cain and amongst the rest Lucian in his tract de Mercede conductis hath excellent well deciphered such men s proceedings in his picture of Opulentia whom he feigns to dwell on the top of a high mount much sought after by many suitors at their first coming they are generally entertained by pleasure and dalliance and have all the content that possibly may be given so long as their money lasts but when their means fail they are contemptibly thrust out at a back door headlong and there left to shame reproach despair And he at first that had so many attendants parasites and followers young and lusty richly arrayed and all the dainty fare that might be had with all kind of welcome and good respect is now upon a sudden stripped of all eighteen sixty six pale naked old diseased and forsaken cursing his stars and ready to strangle himself having no other company but repentance sorrow grief derision beggary and contempt which are his daily attendants to his life s end As the eighteen sixty seven prodigal son had exquisite music merry company dainty fare at first but a sorrowful reckoning in the end so have all such vain delights and their followers eighteen sixty eight Tristes voluptatum exitus et quisquis voluptatum suarum reminisci volet intelliget as bitter as gall and wormwood is their last grief of mind madness itself The ordinary rocks upon which such men do impinge and precipitate themselves are cards dice hawks and hounds Insanum venandi studium one calls it insanae substructiones their mad structures disports plays c when they are unseasonably used imprudently handled and beyond their fortunes Some men are consumed by mad fantastical buildings by making galleries cloisters terraces walks orchards gardens pools rillets bowers and such like places of pleasure Inutiles domos eighteen sixty nine Xenophon calls them which howsoever they be delightsome things in themselves and acceptable to all beholders an ornament and benefiting some great men yet unprofitable to others and the sole overthrow of their estates Forestus in his observations hath an example of such a one that became melancholy upon the like occasion having consumed his substance in an unprofitable building which would afterward yield him no advantage Others I say are eighteen seventy overthrown by those mad sports of hawking and hunting honest recreations and fit for some great men but not for every base inferior person whilst they will maintain their falconers dogs and hunting nags their wealth saith eighteen seventy one Salmutze runs away with hounds and their fortunes fly away with hawks They persecute beasts so long till in the end they themselves degenerate into beasts as eighteen seventy two Agrippa taxeth them eighteen seventy three Actaeon like for as he was eaten to death by his own dogs so do they devour themselves and their patrimonies in such idle and unnecessary disports neglecting in the mean time their more necessary business and to follow their vocations Over mad too sometimes are our great men in delighting and doting too much on it eighteen seventy four When they drive poor husbandmen from their tillage as eighteen seventy five Sarisburiensis objects Polycrat l one c four fling down country farms and whole towns to make parks and forests starving men to feed beasts and eighteen seventy six punishing in the mean time such a man that shall molest their game more severely than him that is otherwise a common hacker or a notorious thief But great men are some ways to be excused the meaner sort have no evasion why they should not be counted mad Poggius the Florentine tells a merry story to this purpose condemning the folly and impertinent business of such kind of persons A physician of Milan saith he that cured mad men had a pit of water in his house in which he kept his patients some up to the knees some to the girdle some to the chin pro modo insaniae as they were more or less affected One of them by chance that was well recovered stood in the door and seeing a gallant ride by with a hawk on his fist well mounted with his spaniels after him would needs know to what use all this preparation served he made answer to kill certain fowls the patient demanded again what his fowl might be worth which he killed in a year he replied five or ten crowns and when he urged him farther what his dogs horse and hawks stood him in he told him four hundred crowns with that the patient bad be gone as he loved his life and welfare for if our master come and find thee here he will put thee in the pit amongst mad men up to the chin taxing the madness and folly of such vain men that spend themselves in those idle sports neglecting their business and necessary affairs Leo Decimus that hunting pope is much discommended by eighteen seventy seven Jovius in his life for his immoderate desire of hawking and hunting in so much that as he saith he would sometimes live about Ostia weeks and months together leave suitors eighteen seventy eight unrespected bulls and pardons unsigned to his own prejudice and many private men s loss eighteen seventy nine And if he had been by chance crossed in his sport or his game not so good he was so impatient that he would revile and miscall many times men of great worth with most bitter taunts look so sour be so angry and waspish so grieved and molested that it is incredible to relate it But if he had good sport and been well pleased on the other side incredibili munificentia with unspeakable bounty and munificence he would reward all his fellow hunters and deny nothing to any suitor when he was in that mood To say truth tis the common humour of all gamesters as Galataeus observes if they win no men living are so jovial and merry but eighteen eighty if they lose though it be but a trifle two or three games at tables or a dealing at cards for two pence a game they are so choleric and testy that no man may speak with them and break many times into violent passions oaths imprecations and unbeseeming speeches little differing from mad men for the time Generally of all gamesters and gaming if it be excessive thus much we may conclude that whether they win or lose for the present their winnings are not Munera fortunae sed insidiae as that wise Seneca determines not fortune s gifts but baits the common catastrophe is eighteen eighty one beggary eighteen eighty two Ut pestis vitam sic adimit alea pecuniam as the plague takes away life doth gaming goods for eighteen eighty three omnes nudi inopes et egeni eighteen eighty four Alea Scylla vorax species certissima furti Non contenta bonis animum quoque perfida mergit Foeda furax infamis iners furiosa ruina For a little pleasure they take and some small gains and gettings now and then their wives and children are ringed in the meantime and they themselves with loss of body and soul rue it in the end I will say nothing of those prodigious prodigals perdendae pecuniae genitos as he eighteen eighty five taxed Anthony Qui patrimonium sine ulla fori calumnia amittunt saith eighteen eighty six Cyprian and eighteen eighty seven mad sybaritical spendthrifts Quique una comedunt patrimonia coena that eat up all at a breakfast at a supper or amongst bawds parasites and players consume themselves in an instant as if they had flung it into eighteen eighty eight Tiber with great wages vain and idle expenses c not themselves only but even all their friends as a man desperately swimming drowns him that comes to help him by suretyship and borrowing they will willingly undo all their associates and allies eighteen eighty nine Irati pecuniis as he saith angry with their money eighteen ninety what with a wanton eye a liquorish tongue and a gamesome hand when they have indiscreetly impoverished themselves mortgaged their wits together with their lands and entombed their ancestors fair possessions in their bowels they may lead the rest of their days in prison as many times they do they repent at leisure and when all is gone begin to be thrifty but Sera est in fundo parsimonia tis then too late to look about their eighteen ninety one end is misery sorrow shame and discontent And well they deserve to be infamous and discontent eighteen ninety two Catamidiari in Amphitheatro as by Adrian the emperor s edict they were of old decoctores bonorum suorum so he calls them prodigal fools to be publicly shamed and hissed out of all societies rather than to be pitied or relieved eighteen ninety three The Tuscans and Boetians brought their bankrupts into the marketplace in a bier with an empty purse carried before them all the boys following where they sat all day circumstante plebe to be infamous and ridiculous At eighteen ninety four Padua in Italy they have a stone called the stone of turpitude near the senate house where spendthrifts and such as disclaim non payment of debts do sit with their hinder parts bare that by that note of disgrace others may be terrified from all such vain expense or borrowing more than they can tell how to pay The eighteen ninety five civilians of old set guardians over such brain sick prodigals as they did over madmen to moderate their expenses that they should not so loosely consume their fortunes to the utter undoing of their families I may not here omit those two main plagues and common dotages of human kind wine and women which have infatuated and besotted myriads of people they go commonly together eighteen ninety six Qui vino indulget quemque aloa decoquit ille In venerem putret To whom is sorrow saith Solomon Pro xxiii thirty nine to whom is woe but to such a one as loves drink it causeth torture vino tortus et ira and bitterness

choose but do Quum tale quid nihil intra se repererint when they know they come as far short as a mouse to an elephant of any such virtues yet it doth us good Though we seem many times to be angry

have of our good parts own worth which indeed is no worth our bounty favour grace valour strength wealth patience meekness hospitality beauty temperance gentry knowledge wit science art learning our nineteen fifteen excellent gifts and fortunes for which Narcissus like we admire flatter and applaud ourselves and think all the world esteems so of us and as deformed women easily believe those that

iter intendo sed dat mihi gloria vires I contemplate a monstrous journey but the love of glory strengthens me for it gaining honour a little applause pride self love vainglory This is it which makes them take such pains and break out into those ridiculous strains this high conceit of themselves to nineteen thirty two scorn all others ridiculo fastu et intolerando contemptu as nineteen thirty three Palaemon the grammarian contemned Varro secum et natas et morituras literas jactans and brings them to that height of insolency that they cannot endure to be contradicted nineteen thirty four or hear of anything but their own commendation which Hierom notes of such kind of men And as nineteen thirty five Austin well seconds him tis their sole study day and night to be commended and applauded When as indeed in all wise men s judgments quibus cor sapit they are nineteen thirty six mad empty vessels funges beside themselves derided et ut Camelus in proverbio quaerens cornua etiam quas habebat aures amisit nineteen thirty seven their works are toys as an almanac out of date nineteen thirty eight authoris pereunt garrulitate sui they seek fame and immortality but reap dishonour and infamy they are a common obloquy insensati and come far short of that which they suppose or expect nineteen thirty nine O puer ut sis vitalis metuo How much I dread Thy days are short some lord shall strike thee dead Of so many myriads of poets rhetoricians philosophers sophisters as nineteen forty Eusebius well observes which have written in former ages scarce one of a thousand s works remains nomina et libri simul cum corporibus interierunt their books and bodies are perished together It is not as they vainly think they shall surely be admired and immortal as one told Philip of Macedon insultingly after a victory that his shadow was no longer than before we may say to them Nos demiramur sed non cum deside vulgo Sed velut Harpyas Gorgonas et Furias We marvel too not as the vulgar we But as we Gorgons Harpies or Furies see Or if we do applaud honour and admire quota pars how small a part in respect of the whole world never so much as hears our names how few take notice of us how slender a tract as scant as Alcibiades land in a map And yet every man must and will be immortal as he hopes and extend his fame to our antipodes when as half no not a quarter of his own province or city neither knows nor hears of him but say they did what s a city to a kingdom a kingdom to Europe Europe to the world the world itself that must have an end if compared to the least visible star in the firmament eighteen times bigger than it and then if those stars be infinite and every star there be a sun as some will and as this sun of ours hath his planets about him all inhabited what proportion bear we to them and where s our glory Orbem terrarum victor Romanus habebat as he cracked in Petronius all the world was under Augustus and so in Constantine s time Eusebius brags he governed all the world universum mundum praeclare admodum administravit et omnes orbis gentes Imperatori subjecti so of Alexander it is given out the four monarchies c when as neither Greeks nor Romans ever had the fifteenth part of the now known world nor half of that which was then described What braggadocios are they and we then quam brevis hic de nobis sermo as nineteen forty one he said nineteen forty two pudebit aucti nominis how short a time how little a while doth this fame of ours continue Every private province every small territory and city when we have all done will yield as generous spirits as brave examples in all respects as famous as ourselves Cadwallader in Wales Rollo in Normandy Robin Hood and Little John are as much renowned in Sherwood as Caesar in Rome Alexander in Greece or his Hephestion nineteen forty three Omnis aetas omnisque populus in exemplum et admirationem veniet every town city book is full of brave soldiers senators scholars and though nineteen forty four Bracyclas was a worthy captain a good man and as they thought not to be matched in Lacedaemon yet as his mother truly said plures habet Sparta Bracyda meliores Sparta had many better men than ever he was and howsoever thou admirest thyself thy friend many an obscure fellow the world never took notice of had he been in place or action would have done much better than he or he or thou thyself Another kind of mad men there is opposite to these that are insensibly mad and know not of it such as contemn all praise and glory think themselves most free when as indeed they are most mad calcant sed alio fastu a company of cynics such as are monks hermits anchorites that contemn the world contemn themselves contemn all titles honours offices and yet in that contempt are more proud than any man living whatsoever They are proud in humility proud in that they are not proud saepe homo de vanae gloriae contemptu vanius gloriatur as Austin hath it confess lib ten cap thirty eight like Diogenes intus gloriantur they brag inwardly and feed themselves fat with a self conceit of sanctity which is no better than hypocrisy They go in sheep s russet many great men that might maintain themselves in cloth of gold and seem to be dejected humble by their outward carriage when as inwardly they are swollen full of pride arrogancy and self conceit And therefore Seneca adviseth his friend Lucilius nineteen forty five in his attire and gesture outward actions especially to avoid all such things as are more notable in themselves as a rugged attire hirsute head horrid beard contempt of money coarse lodging and whatsoever leads to fame that opposite way All this madness yet proceeds from ourselves the main engine which batters us is from others we are merely passive in this business from a company of parasites and flatterers that with immoderate praise and bombast epithets glossing titles false eulogiums so bedaub and applaud gild over many a silly and undeserving man that they clap him quite out of his wits Res imprimis violenta est as Hierom notes this common applause is a most violent thing laudum placenta a drum fife and trumpet cannot so animate that fattens men erects and dejects them in an instant nineteen forty six Palma negata macrum donata reducit opimum It makes them fat and lean as frost doth conies nineteen forty seven And who is that mortal man that can so contain himself that if he be immoderately commended and applauded will not be moved Let him be what he will those parasites will overturn him if he be a king he is one of the nine worthies more than a man a god forthwith nineteen forty eight edictum Domini Deique nostri and they will sacrifice unto him nineteen forty nine divinos si tu patiaris honores Ultro ipsi dabimus meritasque sacrabimus aras If he be a soldier then Themistocles Epaminondas Hector Achilles duo fulmina belli triumviri terrarum c and the valour of both Scipios is too little for him he is invictissimus serenissimus multis trophaeus ornatissimus naturae dominus although he be lepus galeatus indeed a very coward a milk sop nineteen fifty and as he said of Xerxes postremus in pugna primus in fuga and such a one as never durst look his enemy in the face If he be a big man then is he a Samson another Hercules if he pronounce a speech another Tully or Demosthenes as of Herod in the Acts the voice of God and not of man if he can make a verse Homer Virgil c And then my silly weak patient takes all these eulogiums to himself if he be a scholar so commended for his much reading excellent style method c he will eviscerate himself like a spider study to death Laudatas ostendit avis Junonia pennas peacock like he will display all his feathers If he be a soldier and so applauded his valour extolled though it be impar congressus as that of Troilus and Achilles Infelix puer he will combat with a giant run first upon a breach as another nineteen fifty one Philippus he will ride into the thickest of his enemies Commend his housekeeping and he will beggar himself commend his temperance he will starve himself laudataque virtus Crescit et immensum gloria calcar habet nineteen fifty two he is mad mad mad no woe with him impatiens consortis erit he will over the nineteen fifty three Alps to be talked of or to maintain his credit Commend an ambitious man some proud prince or potentate si plus aequo laudetur saith nineteen fifty four Erasmus cristas erigit exuit hominem Deum se putat he sets up his crest and will be no longer a man but a God nineteen fifty five nihil est quod credere de se Non audet quum laudatur diis aequa potestas nineteen fifty six How did this work with Alexander that would needs be Jupiter s son and go like Hercules in a lion s skin Domitian a god nineteen fifty seven Dominus Deus noster sic fieri jubet like the nineteen fifty eight Persian kings whose image was adored by all that came into the city of Babylon Commodus the emperor was so gulled by his flattering parasites that he must be called Hercules nineteen fifty nine Antonius the Roman would be crowned with ivy carried in a chariot and adored for Bacchus Cotys king of Thrace was married to nineteen sixty Minerva and sent three several messengers one after another to see if she were come to his bedchamber Such a one was nineteen sixty one Jupiter Menecrates Maximinus Jovianus Dioclesianus Herculeus Sapor the Persian king brother of the sun and moon and our modern Turks that will be gods on earth kings of kings God s shadow commanders of all that may be commanded our kings of China and Tartary in this present age Such a one was Xerxes that would whip the sea fetter Neptune stulta jactantia and send a challenge to Mount Athos and such are many sottish princes brought into a fool s paradise by their parasites tis a common humour incident to all men when they are in great places or come to the solstice of honour have done or deserved well to applaud and flatter themselves Stultitiam suam produnt c saith nineteen sixty two Platerus your very tradesmen if they be excellent will crack and brag and show their folly in excess They have good parts and they know it you need not tell them of it out of a conceit of their worth they go smiling to themselves a perpetual meditation of their trophies and plaudits they run at last quite mad and lose their wits nineteen sixty three Petrarch lib one de contemptu mundi confessed as much of himself and Cardan in his fifth book of wisdom gives an instance in a smith of Milan a fellow citizen of his nineteen sixty four one Galeus de Rubeis that being commended for refining of an instrument of Archimedes for joy ran mad Plutarch in the life of Artaxerxes hath such a like story of one Chamus a soldier that wounded king Cyrus in battle and grew thereupon so nineteen sixty five arrogant that in a short space after he lost his wits So many men if any new honour office preferment booty treasure possession or patrimony ex insperato fall unto them for immoderate joy and continual meditation of it cannot sleep nineteen sixty six or tell what they say or do they are so ravished on a sudden and with vain conceits transported there is no rule with them Epaminondas therefore the next day after his Leuctrian victory nineteen sixty seven came abroad all squalid and submiss and gave no other reason to his friends of so doing than that he perceived himself the day before by reason of his good fortune to be too insolent overmuch joyed That wise and virtuous lady nineteen sixty eight Queen Katherine Dowager of England in private talk upon like occasion said that nineteen sixty nine she would not willingly endure the extremity of either fortune but if it were so that of necessity she must undergo the one she would be in adversity because comfort was never wanting in it but still counsel and government were defective in the other they could not moderate themselves SUBSECT XV Love of Learning or overmuch study With a Digression of the misery of Scholars and why the Muses are Melancholy Leonartus Fuchsius Instit lib iii sect one cap one Felix Plater lib iii de mentis alienat Herc de Saxonia Tract post de melanch cap three speak of a nineteen seventy peculiar fury which comes by overmuch study Fernelius lib one cap eighteen nineteen seventy one puts study contemplation and continual meditation as an especial cause of madness and in his eighty six consul cites the same words Jo Arculanus in lib nine Rhasis ad Alnansorem cap sixteen amongst other causes reckons up studium vehemens so doth Levinus Lemnius lib de occul nat mirac lib one cap sixteen nineteen seventy two Many men saith he come to this malady by continual nineteen seventy three study and night waking and of all other men scholars are most subject to it and such Rhasis adds nineteen seventy four that have commonly the finest wits Cont lib one tract nine Marsilius Ficinus de sanit tuenda lib one cap seven puts melancholy amongst one of those five principal plagues of students tis a common Maul unto them all and almost in some measure an inseparable companion Varro belike for that cause calls Tristes Philosophos et severos severe sad dry tetric are common epithets to scholars and nineteen seventy five Patritius therefore in the institution of princes would not have them to be great students For as Machiavel holds study weakens their bodies dulls the spirits abates their strength and courage and good scholars are never good soldiers which a certain Goth well perceived for when his countrymen came into Greece and would have burned all their books he cried out against it by no means they should do it nineteen seventy six leave them that plague which in time will consume all their vigour and martial spirits The nineteen seventy seven Turks abdicated Cornutus the next heir from the empire because he was so much given to his book and tis the common tenet of the world that learning dulls and diminisheth the spirits and so per consequens produceth melancholy Two main reasons may be given of it why students should be more subject to this malady than others The one is they live a sedentary solitary life sibi et musis free from bodily exercise and those ordinary disports which other men use and many times if discontent and idleness concur with it which is too frequent they are precipitated into this gulf on a sudden but the common cause is overmuch study too much learning as nineteen seventy eight Festus told Paul hath made thee mad tis that other extreme which effects it So did Trincavelius lib one consil twelve and thirteen find by his experience in two of his patients a young baron and another that contracted this malady by too vehement study So Forestus observat l ten observ thirteen in a young divine in Louvain that was mad and said nineteen seventy nine he had a Bible in his head Marsilius Ficinus de sanit tuend lib one cap one three four and lib two cap sixteen gives many reasons nineteen eighty why students dote more often than others The first is their negligence nineteen eighty one other men look to their tools a painter will wash his pencils a smith will look to his hammer anvil forge a husbandman will mend his plough irons and grind his hatchet if it be dull a falconer or huntsman will have an especial care of his hawks hounds horses dogs c a musician will string and unstring his lute c only scholars neglect that instrument their brain and spirits I mean which they daily use and by which they range overall the world which by much study is consumed Vide saith Lucian ne funiculum nimis intendendo aliquando abrumpas See thou twist not the rope so hard till at length it nineteen eighty two break Facinus in his fourth chap gives some other reasons Saturn and Mercury the patrons of learning they are both dry planets and Origanus assigns the same cause why Mercurialists are so poor and most part beggars for that their president Mercury had no better fortune himself The destinies of old put poverty upon him as a punishment since when poetry and beggary are Gemelli twin born brats inseparable companions nineteen eighty three And to this day is every scholar poor Gross gold from them runs headlong to the boor Mercury can help them to knowledge but not to money The second is contemplation nineteen eighty four which dries the brain and extinguisheth natural heat for whilst the spirits are intent to meditation above in the head the stomach and liver are left destitute and thence come black blood and crudities by defect of concoction and for want of exercise the superfluous vapours cannot exhale c The same reasons are repeated by Gomesius lib four cap one de sale nineteen eighty five Nymannus orat de Imag Jo Voschius lib two cap five de peste and something more they add that hard students are commonly troubled with gouts catarrhs rheums cachexia bradiopepsia bad eyes stone and colic nineteen eighty six crudities oppilations vertigo winds consumptions and all such diseases as come by overmuch sitting they are most part lean dry ill coloured spend their fortunes lose their wits and many times their lives and all through immoderate pains and extraordinary studies If you will not believe the truth of this look upon great Tostatus and Thomas Aquinas s works and tell me whether those men took pains peruse Austin Hierom c and many thousands besides Qui cupit optatam cursu contingere metam Multa tulit fecitque puer sudavit et alsit He that desires this wished goal to gain Must sweat and freeze before he can attain and labour hard for it So did Seneca by his own confession ep eight nineteen eighty seven Not a day that I spend idle part of the night I keep mine eyes open tired with waking and now slumbering to their continual task Hear Tully pro Archia Poeta whilst others loitered and took their pleasures he was continually at his book so they do that will be scholars and that to the hazard I say of their healths fortunes wits and lives How much did Aristotle and Ptolemy spend unius regni precium they say more than a king s ransom how many crowns per annum to perfect arts the one about his History of Creatures the other on his Almagest How much time did Thebet Benchorat employ to find out the motion of the eighth sphere forty years and more some write how many poor scholars have lost their wits or become dizzards neglecting all worldly affairs and their own health wealth esse and bene esse to gain knowledge for which after all their pains in this world s esteem they are accounted ridiculous and silly fools idiots asses and as oft they are rejected contemned derided doting and mad Look for examples in Hildesheim spicel two de mania et delirio read Trincavellius l three consil thirty six et c seventeen Montanus consil two hundred thirty three nineteen eighty eight Garceus de Judic genit cap thirty three Mercurialis consil eighty six cap twenty five Prosper nineteen eighty nine Calenius in his Book de atra bile Go to Bedlam and ask Or if they keep their wits yet they are esteemed scrubs and fools by reason of their carriage after seven years study statua taciturnius exit Plerumque et risum populi quatit He becomes more silent than a statue and generally excites people s laughter Because they cannot ride a horse which every clown can do salute and court a gentlewoman carve at table cringe and make conges which every common swasher can do nineteen ninety hos populus ridet c they are laughed to scorn and accounted silly fools by our gallants Yea many times such is their misery they deserve it nineteen ninety one a mere scholar a mere ass nineteen ninety two Obstipo capite et figentes lumine terram Murmura cum secum et rabiosa silentia rodunt Atque experrecto trutinantur verba labello Aegroti veteris meditantes somnia gigni De nihilo nihilum in nihilum nil posse reverti nineteen ninety three who do lean awry Their heads piercing the earth with a fixt eye When by themselves they gnaw their murmuring And furious silence as twere balancing Each word upon their out stretched lip and when They meditate the dreams of old sick men As Out of nothing nothing can be brought And that which is can ne er be turn d to nought Thus they go commonly meditating unto themselves thus they sit such is their action and gesture Fulgosus l eight c seven makes mention how Th Aquinas supping with king Lewis of France upon a sudden knocked his fist upon the table and cried conclusum est contra Manichaeos his wits were a wool gathering as they say and his head busied about other matters when he perceived his error he was much nineteen ninety four abashed Such a story there is of Archimedes in Vitruvius that having found out the means to know how much gold was mingled with the silver in king Hieron s crown ran naked forth of the bath and cried Greek heuraeka I have found nineteen ninety five and was commonly so intent to his studies that he never perceived what was done about him when the city was taken and the soldiers now ready to rifle his house he took no notice of it saint Bernard rode all day long by the Lemnian lake and asked at last where he was Marullus lib two cap four It was Democritus s carriage alone that made the Abderites suppose him to have been mad and send for Hippocrates to cure him if he had been in any solemn company he would upon all occasions fall a laughing Theophrastus saith as much of Heraclitus for that he continually wept and Laertius of Menedemus Lampsacus because he ran like a madman nineteen ninety six saying he came from hell as a spy to tell the devils what mortal men did Your greatest students are commonly no better silly soft fellows in their outward behaviour absurd ridiculous to others and no whit experienced in worldly business they can measure the heavens range over the world teach others wisdom and yet in bargains and contracts they are circumvented by every base tradesman Are not these men fools and how should they be otherwise but as so many sots in schools when as nineteen ninety seven he well observed they neither hear nor see such things as are commonly practised abroad how should they get experience by what means nineteen ninety eight I knew in my time many scholars saith Aeneas Sylvius in an epistle of his to Gasper Scitick chancellor to the emperor excellent well learned but so rude so silly that they had no common civility nor knew how to manage their domestic or public affairs Paglarensis was amazed and said his farmer had surely cozened him when he heard him tell that his sow had eleven pigs and his ass had but one foal To say the best of this profession I can give no other testimony of them in general than that of Pliny of Isaeus nineteen ninety nine He is yet a scholar than which kind of men there is nothing so simple so sincere none better they are most part harmless honest upright innocent plain dealing men Now because they are commonly subject to such hazards and inconveniences as dotage madness simplicity c Jo Voschius would have good scholars to be highly rewarded and had in some extraordinary respect above other men to have greater two thousand privileges than the rest that adventure themselves and abbreviate their lives for the public good But our patrons of learning are so far nowadays from respecting the muses and giving that honour to scholars or reward which they deserve and are allowed by those indulgent privileges of many noble princes that after all their pains taken in the universities cost and charge expenses irksome hours laborious tasks wearisome days dangers hazards barred interim from all pleasures which other men have mewed up like hawks all their lives if they chance to wade through them they shall in the end be rejected contemned and which is their greatest misery driven to their shifts exposed to want poverty and beggary Their familiar attendants are two thousand one Pallentes morbi luctus curaeque laborque Et metus et malesuada fames et turpis egestas Terribiles visu formae Grief labour care pale sickness miseries Fear filthy poverty hunger that cries Terrible monsters to be seen with eyes If there were nothing else to trouble them the conceit of this alone were enough to make them all melancholy Most other trades and professions after some seven years apprenticeship are enabled by their craft to live of themselves A merchant adventures his goods at sea and though his hazard be great yet if one ship return of four he likely makes a saving voyage An husbandman s gains are almost certain quibus ipse Jupiter nocere non potest whom Jove himself can t harm tis two thousand two Cato s hyperbole a great husband himself only scholars methinks are most uncertain unrespected subject to all casualties and hazards For first not one of a many proves to be a scholar all are not capable and docile two thousand three ex omniligno non fit Mercurius we can make majors and officers every year but not scholars kings can invest knights and barons as Sigismund the emperor confessed universities can give degrees and Tu quod es e populo quilibet esse potest but he nor they nor all the world can give learning make philosophers artists orators poets we can soon say as Seneca well notes O virum bonum o divitem point at a rich man a good a happy man a prosperous man sumptuose vestitum Calamistratum bene olentem magno temporis impendio constat haec laudatio o virum literarum but tis not so easily performed to find out a learned man Learning is not so quickly got though they may be willing to take pains to that end sufficiently informed and liberally maintained by their patrons and parents yet few can compass it Or if they be docile yet all men s wills are not answerable to their wits they can apprehend but will not take pains they are either seduced by bad companions vel in puellam impingunt vel in poculum they fall in with women or wine and so spend their time to their friends grief and their own undoings Or put case they be studious industrious of ripe wits and perhaps good capacities then how many diseases of body and mind must they encounter No labour in the world like unto study It may be their temperature will not endure it but striving to be excellent to know all they lose health wealth wit life and all Let him yet happily escape all these hazards aereis intestinis with a body of brass and is now consummate and ripe he hath profited in his studies and proceeded with all applause after many expenses he is fit for preferment where shall he have it he is as far to seek it as he was after twenty years standing at the first day of his coming to the University For what course shall he take being now capable and ready The most parable and easy and about which many are employed is to teach a school turn lecturer or curate and for that he shall have falconer s wages ten pound per annum and his diet or some small stipend so long as he can please his patron or the parish if they approve him not for usually they do but a year or two as inconstant as two thousand four they that cried Hosanna one day and Crucify him the other serving man like he must go look a new master if they do what is his reward two thousand five Hoc quoque te manet ut pueros elementa docentem Occupet extremis in vicis alba senectus At last thy snow white age in suburb schools Shall toil in teaching boys their grammar rules Like an ass he wears out his time for provender and can show a stump rod togam tritam et laceram saith two thousand six Haedus an old torn gown an ensign of his infelicity he hath his labour for his pain a modicum to keep him till he be decrepit and that is all Grammaticus non est felix c If he be a trencher chaplain in a gentleman s house as it befell two thousand seven Euphormio after some seven years service he may perchance have a living to the halves or some small rectory with the mother of the maids at length a poor kinswoman or a cracked chambermaid to have and to hold during the time of his life But if he offend his good patron or displease his lady mistress in the mean time two thousand eight Ducetur Planta velut ictus ab Hercule Cacus Poneturque foras si quid tentaverit unquam Hiscere as Hercules did by Cacus he shall be dragged forth of doors by the heels away with him If he bend his forces to some other studies with an intent to be a secretis to some nobleman or in such a place with an ambassador he shall find that these persons rise like apprentices one under another and in so many tradesmen s shops when the master is dead the foreman of the shop commonly steps in his place Now for poets rhetoricians historians philosophers two thousand nine mathematicians sophisters c they are like grasshoppers sing they must in summer and pine in the winter for there is no preferment for them Even so they were at first if you will believe that pleasant tale of Socrates which he told fair Phaedrus under a plane tree at the banks of the river Iseus about noon when it was hot and the grasshoppers made a noise he took that sweet occasion to tell him a tale how grasshoppers were once scholars musicians poets c before the Muses were born and lived without meat and drink and for that cause were turned by Jupiter into grasshoppers And may be turned again In Tythoni Cicadas aut Lyciorum ranas for any reward I see they are like to have or else in the mean time I would they could live as they did without any viaticum like so many twenty ten manucodiatae those Indian birds of paradise as we commonly call them those I mean that live with the air and dew of heaven and need no other food for being as they are their twenty eleven rhetoric only serves them to curse their bad fortunes and many of them for want of means are driven to hard shifts from grasshoppers they turn humble bees and wasps plain parasites and make the muses mules to satisfy their hunger starved paunches and get a meal s meat To say truth tis the common fortune of most scholars to be servile and poor to complain pitifully and lay open their wants to their respectless patrons as twenty twelve Cardan doth as twenty thirteen Xilander and many others and which is too common in those dedicatory epistles for hope of gain to lie flatter and with hyperbolical eulogiums and commendations to magnify and extol an illiterate unworthy idiot for his excellent virtues whom they should rather as twenty fourteen Machiavel observes vilify and rail at downright for his most notorious villainies and vices So they prostitute themselves as fiddlers or mercenary tradesmen to serve great men s turns for a small reward They are like twenty fifteen Indians they have store of gold but know not the worth of it for I am of Synesius s opinion twenty sixteen King Hieron got more by Simonides acquaintance than Simonides did by his they have their best education good institution sole qualification from us and when they have done well their honour and immortality from us we are the living tombs registers and as so many trumpeters of their fames what was Achilles without Homer Alexander without Arian and Curtius who had known the Caesars but for Suetonius and Dion twenty seventeen Vixerunt fortes ante Agamemnona Multi sed omnes illachrymabiles Urgentur ignotique longa Nocte carent quia vate sacro Before great Agamemnon reign d Reign d kings as great as he and brave Whose huge ambition s now contain d In the small compass of a grave In endless night they sleep unwept unknown No bard they had to make all time their own they are more beholden to scholars than scholars to them but they undervalue themselves and so by those great men are kept down Let them have that encyclopaedian all the learning in the world they must keep it to themselves twenty eighteen live in base esteem and starve except they will submit as Budaeus well hath it so many good parts so many ensigns of arts virtues be slavishly obnoxious to some illiterate potentate and live under his insolent worship or honour like parasites Qui tanquam mures alienum panem comedunt For to say truth artes hae non sunt Lucrativae as Guido Bonat that great astrologer could foresee they be not gainful arts these sed esurientes et famelicae but poor and hungry twenty nineteen Dat Galenus opes dat Justinianus honores Sed genus et species cogitur ire pedes The rich physician honour d lawyers ride Whilst the poor scholar foots it by their side Poverty is the muses patrimony and as that poetical divinity teacheth us when Jupiter s daughters were each of them married to the gods the muses alone were left solitary Helicon forsaken of all suitors and I believe it was because they had no portion Calliope longum caelebs cur vixit in aevum Nempe nihil dotis quod numeraret erat Why did Calliope live so long a maid Because she had no dowry to be paid Ever since all their followers are poor forsaken and left unto themselves Insomuch that as twenty twenty Petronius argues you shall likely know them by their clothes There came saith he by chance into my company a fellow not very spruce to look on that I could perceive by that note alone he was a scholar whom commonly rich men hate I asked him what he was he answered a poet I demanded again why he was so ragged he told me this kind of learning never made any man rich twenty twenty one Qui Pelago credit magno se faenore tollit Qui pugnas et rostra petit praecingitur auro Vilis adulator picto jacet ebrius ostro Sola pruinosis horret facundia pannis A merchant s gain is great that goes to sea A soldier embossed all in gold A flatterer lies fox d in brave array A scholar only ragged to behold All which our ordinary students right well perceiving in the universities how unprofitable these poetical mathematical and philosophical studies are how little respected how few patrons apply themselves in all haste to those three commodious professions of law physic and divinity sharing themselves between them twenty twenty two rejecting these arts in the mean time history philosophy philology or lightly passing them over as pleasant toys fitting only table talk and to furnish them with discourse They are not so behoveful he that can tell his money hath arithmetic enough he is a true geometrician can measure out a good fortune to himself a perfect astrologer that can cast the rise and fall of others and mark their errant motions to his own use The best optics are to reflect the beams of some great man s favour and grace to shine upon him He is a good engineer that alone can make an instrument to get preferment This was the common tenet and practice of Poland as Cromerus observed not long since in the first book of his history their universities were generally base not a philosopher a mathematician an antiquary c to be found of any note amongst them because they had no set reward or stipend but every man betook himself to divinity hoc solum in votis habens opimum sacerdotium a good parsonage was their aim This was the practice of some of our near neighbours as twenty twenty three Lipsius inveighs they thrust their children to the study of law and divinity before they be informed aright or capable of such studies Scilicet omnibus artibus antistat spes lucri et formosior est cumulus auri quam quicquid Graeci Latinique delirantes scripserunt Ex hoc numero deinde veniunt ad gubernacula reipub intersunt et praesunt consiliis regum o pater o patria so he complained and so may others For even so we find to serve a great man to get an office in some bishop s court to practise in some good town or compass a benefice is the mark we shoot at as being so advantageous the highway to preferment Although many times for aught I can see these men fail as often as the rest in their projects and are as usually frustrate of their hopes For let him be a doctor of the law an excellent civilian of good worth where shall he practise and expatiate Their fields are so scant the civil law with us so contracted with prohibitions so few causes by reason of those all devouring municipal laws quibus nihil illiteratius saith twenty twenty four Erasmus an illiterate and a barbarous study for though they be never so well learned in it I can hardly vouchsafe them the name of scholars except they be otherwise qualified and so few courts are left to that profession such slender offices and those commonly to be compassed at such dear rates that I know not how an ingenious man should thrive amongst them Now for physicians there are in every village so many mountebanks empirics quacksalvers Paracelsians as they call themselves Caucifici et sanicidae so twenty twenty five Clenard terms them wizards alchemists poor vicars cast apothecaries physicians men barbers and good wives professing great skill that I make great doubt how they shall be maintained or who shall be their patients Besides there are so many of both sorts and some of them such harpies so covetous so clamorous so impudent and as twenty twenty six he said litigious idiots Quibus loquacis affatim arrogantiae est Pentiae parum aut nihil Nec ulla mica literarii salis Crumenimulga natio Loquuteleia turba litium strophae Maligna litigantium cohors togati vultures Lavernae alumni Agyrtae c Which have no skill but prating arrogance No learning such a purse milking nation Gown d vultures thieves and a litigious rout Of cozeners that haunt this occupation that they cannot well tell how to live one by another but as he jested in the Comedy of Clocks they were so many twenty twenty seven major pars populi arida reptant fame they are almost starved a great part of them and ready to devour their fellows twenty twenty eight Et noxia callidilate se corripere such a multitude of pettifoggers and empirics such impostors that an honest man knows not in what sort to compose and behave himself in their society to carry himself with credit in so vile a rout scientiae nomen tot sumptibus partum et vigiliis profiteri dispudeat postquam c Last of all to come to our divines the most noble profession and worthy of double honour but of all others the most distressed and miserable If you will not believe me hear a brief of it as it was not many years since publicly preached at Paul s cross twenty twenty nine by a grave minister then and now a reverend bishop of this land We that are bred up in learning and destinated by our parents to this end we suffer our childhood in the grammar school which Austin calls magnam tyrannidem et grave malum and compares it to the torments of martyrdom when we come to the university if we live of the college allowance as Phalaris objected to the Leontines Greek pan ton endeis plaen limou kai phobou needy of all things but hunger and fear or if we be maintained but partly by our parents cost do expend in unnecessary maintenance books and degrees before we come to any perfection five hundred pounds or a thousand marks If by this price of the expense of time our bodies and spirits our substance and patrimonies we cannot purchase those small rewards which are ours by law and the right of inheritance a poor parsonage or a vicarage of fifty l per annum but we must pay to the patron for the lease of a life a spent and out worn life either in annual pension or above the rate of a copyhold and that with the hazard and loss of our souls by simony and perjury and the forfeiture of all our spiritual preferments in esse and posse both present and to come What father after a while will be so improvident to bring up his son to his great charge to this necessary beggary What Christian will be so irreligious to bring up his son in that course of life which by all probability and necessity cogit ad turpia enforcing to sin will entangle him in simony and perjury when as the poet said Invitatus ad haec aliquis de ponte negabit a beggar s brat taken from the bridge where he sits a begging if he knew the inconvenience had cause to refuse it This being thus have not we fished fair all this while that are initiate divines to find no better fruits of our labours twenty thirty hoc est cur palles cur quis non prandeat hoc est do we macerate ourselves for this Is it for this we rise so early all the year long twenty thirty one Leaping as he saith out of our beds when we hear the bell ring as if we had heard a thunderclap If this be all the respect reward and honour we shall have twenty thirty two frange leves calamos et scinde Thalia libellos let us give over our books and betake ourselves to some other course of life to what end should we study twenty thirty three Quid me litterulas stulti docuere parentes what did our parents mean to make us scholars to be as far to seek of preferment after twenty years study as we were at first why do we take such pains Quid tantum insanis juvat impallescere chartis If there be no more hope of reward no better encouragement I say again Frange leves calamos et scinde Thalia libellos let s turn soldiers sell our books and buy swords guns and pikes or stop bottles with them turn our philosopher s gowns as Cleanthes once did into millers coats leave all and rather betake ourselves to any other course of life than to continue longer in this misery twenty thirty four Praestat dentiscalpia radere quam literariis monumentis magnatum favorem emendicare Yea but methinks I hear some man except at these words that though this be true which I have said of the estate of scholars and especially of divines that it is miserable and distressed at this time that the church suffers shipwreck of her goods and that they have just cause to complain there is a fault but whence proceeds it If the cause were justly examined it would be retorted upon ourselves if we were cited at that tribunal of truth we should be found guilty and not able to excuse it That there is a fault among us I confess and were there not a buyer there would not be a seller but to him that will consider better of it it will more than manifestly appear that the fountain of these miseries proceeds from these griping patrons In accusing them I do not altogether excuse us both are faulty they and we yet in my judgment theirs is the greater fault more apparent causes and much to be condemned For my part if it be not with me as I would or as it should I do ascribe the cause as twenty thirty five Cardan did in the like case meo infortunio potius quam illorum sceleri to twenty thirty six mine own infelicity rather than their naughtiness although I have been baffled in my time by some of them and have as just cause to complain as another or rather indeed to mine own negligence for I was ever like that Alexander in twenty thirty seven Plutarch Crassus his tutor in philosophy who though he lived many years familiarly with rich Crassus was even as poor when from which many wondered at as when he came first to him he never asked the other never gave him anything when he travelled with Crassus he borrowed a hat of him at his return restored it again I have had some such noble friends acquaintance and scholars but most part common courtesies and ordinary respects excepted they and I parted as we met they gave me as much as I requested and that was And as Alexander ab Alexandro Genial dier l six c sixteen made answer to Hieronymus Massainus that wondered quum plures ignavos et ignobiles ad dignitates et sacerdotia promotos quotidie videret when other men rose still he was in the same state eodem tenore et fortuna cui mercedem laborum studiorumque deberi putaret whom he thought to deserve as well as the rest He made answer that he was content with his present estate was not ambitious and although objurgabundus suam segnitiem accusaret cum obscurae sortis homines ad sacerdotia et pontificatus evectos c he chid him for his backwardness yet he was still the same and for my part though I be not worthy perhaps to carry Alexander s books yet by some overweening and well wishing friends the like speeches have been used to me but I replied still with Alexander that I had enough and more peradventure than I deserved and with Libanius Sophista that rather chose when honours and offices by the emperor were offered unto him to be talis Sophista quam tails Magistratus I had as lief be still Democritus junior and privus privatus si mihi jam daretur optio quam talis fortasse Doctor talis Dominus Sed quorsum haec For the rest tis on both sides facinus detestandum to buy and sell livings to detain from the church that which God s and men s laws have bestowed on it but in them most and that from the covetousness and ignorance of such as are interested in this business I name covetousness in the first place as the root of all these mischiefs which Achan like compels them to commit sacrilege and to make simoniacal compacts and what not to their own ends twenty thirty eight that kindles God s wrath brings a plague vengeance and a heavy visitation upon themselves and others Some out of that insatiable desire of filthy lucre to be enriched care not how they come by it per fas et nefas hook or crook so they have it And others when they have with riot and prodigality embezzled their estates to recover themselves make a prey of the church robbing it as twenty thirty nine Julian the apostate did spoil parsons of their revenues in keeping half back twenty forty as a great man amongst us observes and that maintenance on which they should live by means whereof barbarism is increased and a great decay of Christian professors for who will apply himself to these divine studies his son or friend when after great pains taken they shall have nothing whereupon to live But with what event do they these things twenty forty one Opesque totis viribus venamini At inde messis accidit miserrima They toil and moil but what reap they They are commonly unfortunate families that use it accursed in their progeny and as common experience evinceth accursed themselves in all their proceedings With what face as twenty forty two he quotes out of Aust can they expect a blessing or inheritance from Christ in heaven that defraud Christ of his inheritance here on earth I would all our simoniacal patrons and such as detain tithes would read those judicious tracts of Sir Henry Spelman and Sir James Sempill knights those late elaborate and learned treatises of doctor Tilslye and mister Montague which they have written of that subject But though they should read it would be to small purpose clames licet et mare coelo Confundas thunder lighten preach hell and damnation tell them tis a sin they will not believe it denounce and terrify they have twenty forty three cauterised consciences they do not attend as the enchanted adder they stop their ears Call them base irreligious profane barbarous pagans atheists epicures as some of them surely are with the bawd in Plautus Euge optime they cry and applaud themselves with that miser twenty forty four simul ac nummos contemplor in arca say what you will quocunque modo rem as a dog barks at the moon to no purpose are your sayings Take your heaven let them have money A base profane epicurean hypocritical rout for my part let them pretend what zeal they will counterfeit religion blear the world s eyes bombast themselves and stuff out their greatness with church spoils shine like so many peacocks so cold is my charity so defective in this behalf that I shall never think better of them than that they are rotten at core their bones are full of epicurean hypocrisy and atheistical marrow they are worse than heathens For as Dionysius Halicarnassaeus observes Antiq Rom lib seven twenty forty five Primum locum c Greeks and Barbarians observe all religious rites and dare not break them for fear of offending their gods but our simoniacal contractors our senseless Achans our stupefied patrons fear neither God nor devil they have evasions for it it is no sin or not due jure divino or if a sin no great sin c And though they be daily punished for it and they do manifestly perceive that as he said frost and fraud come to foul ends yet as twenty forty six Chrysostom follows it Nulla ex poena sit correctio et quasi adversis malitia hominum provocetur crescit quotidie quod puniatur they are rather worse than better iram atque animos a crimine sumunt and the more they are corrected the more they offend but let them take their course twenty forty seven Rode caper vites go on still as they begin tis no sin let them rejoice secure God s vengeance will overtake them in the end and these ill gotten goods as an eagle s feathers twenty forty eight will consume the rest of their substance it is twenty forty nine aurum Tholosanum and will produce no better effects twenty fifty Let them lay it up safe and make their conveyances never so close lock and shut door saith Chrysostom yet fraud and covetousness two most violent thieves are still included and a little gain evil gotten will subvert the rest of their goods The eagle in Aesop seeing a piece of flesh now ready to be sacrificed swept it away with her claws and carried it to her nest but there was a burning coal stuck to it by chance which unawares consumed her young ones nest and all together Let our simoniacal church chopping patrons and sacrilegious harpies look for no better success A second cause is ignorance and from thence contempt successit odium in literas ab ignorantia vulgi which twenty fifty one Junius well perceived this hatred and contempt of learning proceeds out of twenty fifty two ignorance as they are themselves barbarous idiots dull illiterate and proud so they esteem of others Sint Mecaenates non deerunt Flacce Marones Let there be bountiful patrons and there will be painful scholars in all sciences But when they contemn learning and think themselves sufficiently qualified if they can write and read scramble at a piece of evidence or have so much Latin as that emperor had twenty fifty three qui nescit dissimulare nescit vivere they are unfit to do their country service to perform or undertake any action or employment which may tend to the good of a commonwealth except it be to fight or to do country justice with common sense which every yeoman can likewise do And so they bring up their children rude as they are themselves unqualified untaught uncivil most part twenty fifty four Quis e nostra juventute legitime instituitur literis Quis oratores aut Philosophos tangit quis historiam legit illam rerum agendarum quasi animam praecipitant parentes vota sua c twas Lipsius complaint to his illiterate countrymen it may be ours Now shall these men judge of a scholar s worth that have no worth that know not what belongs to a student s labours that cannot distinguish between a true scholar and a drone or him that by reason of a voluble tongue a strong voice a pleasing tone and some trivially polyanthean helps steals and gleans a few notes from other men s harvests and so makes a fairer show than he that is truly learned indeed that thinks it no more to preach than to speak twenty fifty five or to run away with an empty cart as a grave man said and thereupon vilify us and our pains scorn us and all learning twenty fifty six Because they are rich and have other means to live they think it concerns them not to know or to trouble themselves with it a fitter task for younger brothers or poor men s sons to be pen and inkhorn men pedantical slaves and no whit beseeming the calling of a gentleman as Frenchmen and Germans commonly do neglect therefore all human learning what have they to do with it Let mariners learn astronomy merchants factors study arithmetic surveyors get them geometry spectacle makers optics land leapers geography town clerks rhetoric what should he do with a spade that hath no ground to dig or they with learning that have no use of it thus they reason and are not ashamed to let mariners apprentices and the basest servants be better qualified than themselves In former times kings princes and emperors were the only scholars excellent in all faculties Julius Caesar mended the year and writ his own Commentaries twenty fifty seven media inter prealia semper Stellarum coelique plagis superisque vacavit twenty fifty eight Antonius Adrian Nero Seve Jul c twenty fifty nine Michael the emperor and Isacius were so much given to their studies that no base fellow would take so much pains Orion Perseus Alphonsus Ptolomeus famous astronomers Sabor Mithridates Lysimachus admired physicians Plato s kings all Evax that Arabian prince a most expert jeweller and an exquisite philosopher the kings of Egypt were priests of old chosen and from thence Idem rex hominum Phoebique sacerdos but those heroical times are past the Muses are now banished in this bastard age ad sordida tuguriola to meaner persons and confined alone almost to universities In those days scholars were highly beloved twenty sixty honoured esteemed as old Ennius by Scipio Africanus Virgil by Augustus Horace by Meceanas princes companions dear to them as Anacreon to Polycrates Philoxenus to Dionysius and highly rewarded Alexander sent Xenocrates the philosopher fifty talents because he was poor visu rerum aut eruditione praestantes viri mensis olim regum adhibiti as Philostratus relates of Adrian and Lampridius of Alexander Severus famous clerks came to these princes courts velut in Lycaeum as to a university and were admitted to their tables quasi divum epulis accumbentes Archilaus that Macedonian king would not willingly sup without Euripides amongst the rest he drank to him at supper one night and gave him a cup of gold for his pains delectatus poetae suavi sermone and it was fit it should be so because as twenty sixty one Plato in his Protagoras well saith a good philosopher as much excels other men as a great king doth the commons of his country and again twenty sixty two quoniam illis nihil deest et minime egere solent et disciplinas quas profitentur soli a contemptu vindicare possunt they needed not to beg so basely as they compel twenty sixty three scholars in our times to complain of poverty or crouch to a rich chuff for a meal s meat but could vindicate themselves and those arts which they professed Now they would and cannot for it is held by some of them as an axiom that to keep them poor will make them study they must be dieted as horses to a race not pampered twenty sixty four Alendos volunt non saginandos ne melioris mentis flammula extinguatur a fat bird will not sing a fat dog cannot hunt and so by this depression of theirs twenty sixty five some want means others will all want twenty sixty six encouragement as being forsaken almost and generally contemned Tis an old saying Sint Mecaenates non deerunt Flacce Marones and tis a true saying still Yet oftentimes I may not deny it the main fault is in ourselves Our academics too frequently offend in neglecting patrons as twenty sixty seven Erasmus well taxeth or making ill choice of them negligimus oblatos aut amplectimur parum aptos or if we get a good one non studemus mutuis officiis favorem ejus alere we do not ply and follow him as we should Idem mihi accidit Adolescenti saith Erasmus acknowledging his fault et gravissime peccavi and so may twenty sixty eight I say myself I have offended in this and so peradventure have many others We did not spondere magnatum favoribus qui caeperunt nos amplecti apply ourselves with that readiness we should idleness love of liberty immodicus amor libertatis effecit ut diu cum perfidis amicis as he confesseth et pertinaci pauperate colluctarer bashfulness melancholy timorousness cause many of us to be too backward and remiss So some offend in one extreme but too many on the other we are most part too forward too solicitous too ambitious too impudent we commonly complain deesse Maecenates of want of encouragement want of means when as the true defect is in our own want of worth our insufficiency did Maecenas take notice of Horace or Virgil till they had shown themselves first or had Bavius and Mevius any patrons Egregium specimen dent saith Erasmus let them approve themselves worthy first sufficiently qualified for learning and manners before they presume or impudently intrude and put themselves on great men as too many do with such base flattery parasitical colloguing such hyperbolical elogies they do usually insinuate that it is a shame to hear and see Immodicae laudes conciliant invidiam potius quam laudem and vain commendations derogate from truth and we think in conclusion non melius de laudato pejus de laudante ill of both the commender and commended So we offend but the main fault is in their harshness defect of patrons How beloved of old and how much respected was Plato to Dionysius How dear to Alexander was Aristotle Demeratus to Philip Solon to Croesus Auexarcus and Trebatius to Augustus Cassius to Vespasian Plutarch to Trajan Seneca to Nero Simonides to Hieron how honoured twenty sixty nine Sed haec prius fuere nunc recondita Senent quiete those days are gone Et spes et ratio studiorum in Caesare tantum twenty seventy as he said of old we may truly say now he is our amulet our twenty seventy one sun our sole comfort and refuge our Ptolemy our common Maecenas Jacobus munificus Jacobus pacificus mysta Musarum Rex Platonicus Grande decus columenque nostrum a famous scholar himself and the sole patron pillar and sustainer of learning but his worth in this kind is so well known that as Paterculus of Cato Jam ipsum laudare nefas sit and which twenty seventy two Pliny to Trajan Seria te carmina honorque aeternus annalium non haec brevis et pudenda praedicatio colet But he is now gone the sun of ours set and yet no night follows Sol occubuit nox nulla sequuta est We have such another in his room twenty seventy three aureus alter Avulsus simili frondescit virga metallo and long may he reign and flourish amongst us Let me not be malicious and lie against my genius I may not deny but that we have a sprinkling of our gentry here and there one excellently well learned like those Fuggeri in Germany Dubartus Du Plessis Sadael in France Picus Mirandula Schottus Barotius in Italy Apparent rari nantes in gurgite vasto But they are but few in respect of the multitude the major part and some again excepted that are indifferent are wholly bent for hawks and hounds and carried away many times with intemperate lust gaming and drinking If they read a book at any time si quod est interim otii a venatu poculis alea scortis tis an English Chronicle saint Huon of Bordeaux Amadis de Gaul c a play book or some pamphlet of news and that at such seasons only when they cannot stir abroad to drive away time twenty seventy four their sole discourse is dogs hawks horses and what news If some one have been a traveller in Italy or as far as the emperor s court wintered in Orleans and can court his mistress in broken French wear his clothes neatly in the newest fashion sing some choice outlandish tunes discourse of lords ladies towns palaces and cities he is complete and to be admired twenty seventy five otherwise he and they are much at one no difference between the master and the man but worshipful titles wink and choose betwixt him that sits down clothes excepted and him that holds the trencher behind him yet these men must be our patrons our governors too sometimes statesmen magistrates noble great and wise by inheritance Mistake me not I say again Vos o Patritius sanguis you that are worthy senators gentlemen I honour your names and persons and with all submissiveness prostrate myself to your censure and service There are amongst you I do ingenuously confess many well deserving patrons and true patriots of my knowledge besides many hundreds which I never saw no doubt or heard of pillars of our commonwealth twenty seventy six whose worth bounty learning forwardness true zeal in religion and good esteem of all scholars ought to be consecrated to all posterity but of your rank there are a debauched corrupt covetous illiterate crew again no better than stocks merum pecus testor Deum non mihi videri dignos ingenui hominis appellatione barbarous Thracians et quis ille thrax qui hoc neget a sordid profane pernicious company irreligious impudent and stupid I know not what epithets to give them enemies to learning confounders of the church and the ruin of a commonwealth patrons they are by right of inheritance and put in trust freely to dispose of such livings to the church s good but hard taskmasters they prove they take away their straw and compel them to make their number of brick they commonly respect their own ends commodity is the steer of all their actions and him they present in conclusion as a man of greatest gifts that will give most no penny twenty seventy seven no paternoster as the saying is Nisi preces auro fulcias amplius irritas ut Cerberus offa their attendants and officers must be bribed feed and made as Cerberus is with a sop by him that goes to hell It was an old saying Omnia Romae venalia all things are venal at Rome tis a rag of Popery which will never be rooted out there is no hope no good to be done without money A clerk may offer himself approve his twenty seventy eight worth learning honesty religion zeal they will commend him for it but twenty seventy nine probitas laudatur et alget If he be a man of extraordinary parts they will flock afar off to hear him as they did in Apuleius to see Psyche multi mortales confluebant ad videndum saeculi decus speculum gloriosum laudatur ab omnibus spectatur ob omnibus nec quisquam non rex non regius cupidus ejus nuptiarium petitor accedit mirantur quidem divinam formam omnes sed ut simulacrum fabre politum mirantur many mortal men came to see fair Psyche the glory of her age they did admire her commend desire her for her divine beauty and gaze upon her but as on a picture none would marry her quod indotato fair Psyche had no money twenty eighty So they do by learning twenty eighty one didicit jam dives avarus Tantum admirari tantum laudare disertos Ut pueri Junonis avem Your rich men have now learn d of latter days T admire commend and come together To hear and see a worthy scholar speak As children do a peacock s feather He shall have all the good words that may be given twenty eighty two a proper man and tis pity he hath no preferment all good wishes but inexorable indurate as he is he will not prefer him though it be in his power because he is indotatus he hath no money Or if he do give him entertainment let him be never so well qualified plead affinity consanguinity sufficiency he shall serve seven years as Jacob did for Rachel before he shall have it twenty eighty three If he will enter at first he must get in at that Simoniacal gate come off soundly and put in good security to perform all covenants else he will not deal with or admit him But if some poor scholar some parson chaff will offer himself some trencher chaplain that will take it to the halves thirds or accepts of what he will give he is welcome be conformable preach as he will have him he likes him before a million of others for the host is always best cheap and then as Hierom said to Cromatius patella dignum operculum such a patron such a clerk the cure is well supplied and all parties pleased So that is still verified in our age which twenty eighty four Chrysostom complained of in his time Qui opulentiores sunt in ordinem parasitorum cogunt eos et ipsos tanquam canes ad mensas suas enutriunt eorumque impudentes Venires iniquarum coenarum reliquiis differtiunt iisdem pro arbitro abulentes Rich men keep these lecturers and fawning parasites like so many dogs at their tables and filling their hungry guts with the offals of their meat they abuse them at their pleasure and make them say what they propose twenty eighty five As children do by a bird or a butterfly in a string pull in and let him out as they list do they by their trencher chaplains prescribe command their wits let in and out as to them it seems best If the patron be precise so must his chaplain be if he be papistical his clerk must be so too or else be turned out These are those clerks which serve the turn whom they commonly entertain and present to church livings whilst in the meantime we that are University men like so many hidebound calves in a pasture tarry out our time wither away as a flower ungathered in a garden and are never used or as so many candles illuminate ourselves alone obscuring one another s light and are not discerned here at all the least of which translated to a dark room or to some country benefice where it might shine apart would give a fair light and be seen over all Whilst we lie waiting here as those sick men did at the Pool of twenty eighty six Bethesda till the Angel stirred the water expecting a good hour they step between and beguile us of our preferment I have not yet said if after long expectation much expense travel earnest suit of ourselves and friends we obtain a small benefice at last our misery begins afresh we are suddenly encountered with the flesh world and devil with a new onset we change a quiet life for an ocean of troubles we come to a ruinous house which before it be habitable must be necessarily to our great damage repaired we are compelled to sue for dilapidations or else sued ourselves and scarce yet settled we are called upon for our predecessor s arrearages first fruits tenths subsidies are instantly to be paid benevolence procurations c and which is most to be feared we light upon a cracked title as it befell Clenard of Brabant for his rectory and charge of his Beginae he was no sooner inducted but instantly sued cepimusque twenty eighty seven saith he strenue litigare et implacabili bello confligere at length after ten years suit as long as Troy s siege when he had tired himself and spent his money he was fain to leave all for quietness sake and give it up to his adversary Or else we are insulted over and trampled on by domineering officers fleeced by those greedy harpies to get more fees we stand in fear of some precedent lapse we fall amongst refractory seditious sectaries peevish puritans perverse papists a lascivious rout of atheistical Epicures that will not be reformed or some litigious people those wild beasts of Ephesus must be fought with that will not pay their dues without much repining or compelled by long suit Laici clericis oppido infesti an old axiom all they think well gotten that is had from the church and by such uncivil harsh dealings they make their poor minister weary of his place if not his life and put case they be quiet honest men make the best of it as often it falls out from a polite and terse academic he must turn rustic rude melancholise alone learn to forget or else as many do become maltsters graziers

remote outward adventitious or accidental causes as first from the Nurse Of those remote outward ambient necessary causes I have sufficiently discoursed in the precedent member the non necessary follow of which saith twenty one oh four Fuchsius no art can be made by reason of their uncertainty casualty and multitude so called not necessary because according to twenty one oh five Fernelius they may be avoided and used without necessity Many of these accidental causes which I shall entreat of here might have well been reduced to the former because they cannot be avoided but fatally happen to us though accidentally and unawares at some time or other the rest are contingent and inevitable and more properly inserted in this rank of causes To reckon up all is a thing impossible of some therefore most remarkable of these contingent causes which produce melancholy I will briefly speak and in their order From a child s nativity the first ill accident that can likely befall him in this kind is a bad nurse by whose means alone he may be tainted with this twenty one oh six malady from his cradle Aulus Gellius l twelve c one brings in Phavorinus that eloquent philosopher proving this at large twenty one oh seven that there is the same virtue and property in the milk as in the seed and not in men alone but in all other creatures he gives instance in a kid and lamb if either of them suck of the other s milk the lamb of the goat s or the kid of the ewe s the wool of the one will be hard and the hair of the other soft Giraldus Cambrensis Itinerar Cambriae l one c two confirms this by a notable example which happened in his time A sow pig by chance sucked a brach and when she was grown twenty one oh eight would miraculously hunt all manner of deer and that as well or rather better than any ordinary hound His conclusion is twenty one oh nine that men and beasts participate of her nature and conditions by whose milk they are fed Phavorinus urges it farther and demonstrates it more evidently that if a nurse be twenty one ten misshapen unchaste dishonest impudent twenty one eleven cruel or the like the child that sucks upon her breast will be so too all other affections of the mind and diseases are almost engrafted as it were and imprinted into the temperature of the infant by the nurse s milk as pox leprosy melancholy c Cato for some such reason would make his servants children suck upon his wife s breast because by that means they would love him and his the better and in all likelihood agree with them A more evident example that the minds are altered by milk cannot be given than that of twenty one twelve Dion which he relates of Caligula s cruelty it could neither be imputed to father nor mother but to his cruel nurse alone that anointed her paps with blood still when he sucked which made him such a murderer and to express her cruelty to a hair and that of Tiberius who was a common drunkard because his nurse was such a one Et si delira fuerit twenty one thirteen one observes infantulum delirum faciet if she be a fool or dolt the child she nurseth will take after her or otherwise be misaffected which Franciscus Barbarus l two c ult de re uxoria proves at full and Ant Guivarra lib two de Marco Aurelio the child will surely participate For bodily sickness there is no doubt to be made Titus Vespasian s son was therefore sickly because the nurse was so Lampridius And if we may believe physicians many times children catch the pox from a bad nurse Botaldus cap sixty one de lue vener Besides evil attendance negligence and many gross inconveniences which are incident to nurses much danger may so come to the child twenty one fourteen For these causes Aristotle Polit lib seven c seventeen Phavorinus and Marcus Aurelius would not have a child put to nurse at all but every mother to bring up her own of what condition soever she be for a sound and able mother to put out her child to nurse is naturae intemperies so twenty one fifteen Guatso calls it tis fit therefore she should be nurse herself the mother will be more careful loving and attendant than any servile woman or such hired creatures this all the world acknowledgeth convenientissimum est as Rod a Castro de nat mulierum lib four c twelve in many words confesseth matrem ipsam lactare infantem It is most fit that the mother should suckle her own infant who denies that it should be so and which some women most curiously observe amongst the rest twenty one sixteen that queen of France a Spaniard by birth that was so precise and zealous in this behalf that when in her absence a strange nurse had suckled her child she was never quiet till she had made the infant vomit it up again But she was too jealous If it be so as many times it is they must be put forth the mother be not fit or well able to be a nurse I would then advise such mothers as twenty one seventeen Plutarch doth in his book de liberis educandis and twenty one eighteen S Hierom li two epist twenty seven Laetae de institut fil Magninus part two Reg sanit cap seven and the said Rodericus that they make choice of a sound woman of a good complexion honest free from bodily diseases if it be possible all passions and perturbations of the mind as sorrow fear grief twenty one nineteen folly melancholy For such passions corrupt the milk and alter the temperature of the child which now being twenty one twenty Udum et molle lutum a moist and soft clay is easily seasoned and perverted And if such a nurse may be found out that will be diligent and careful withal let Phavorinus and M Aurelius plead how they can against it I had rather accept of her in some cases than the mother herself and which Bonacialus the physician Nic Biesius the politician lib four de repub cap eight approves twenty one twenty one Some nurses are much to be preferred to some mothers For why may not the mother be naught a peevish drunken flirt a waspish choleric slut a crazed piece a fool as many mothers are unsound as soon as the nurse There is more choice of nurses than mothers and therefore except the mother be most virtuous staid a woman of excellent good parts and of a sound complexion I would have all children in such cases committed to discreet strangers And tis the only way as by marriage they are engrafted to other families to alter the breed or if anything be amiss in the mother as Ludovicus Mercatus contends Tom two lib de morb haered to prevent diseases and future maladies to correct and qualify the child s ill disposed temperature which he had from his parents This is an excellent remedy if good choice be made of such a nurse SUBSECT II Education a Cause of Melancholy Education of these accidental causes of melancholy may justly challenge the next place for if a man escape a bad nurse he may be undone by evil bringing up twenty one twenty two Jason Pratensis puts this of education for a principal cause bad parents stepmothers tutors masters teachers too rigorous too severe too remiss or indulgent on the other side are often fountains and furtherers of this disease Parents and such as have the tuition and oversight of children offend many times in that they are too stern always threatening chiding brawling whipping or striking by means of which their poor children are so disheartened and cowed that they never after have any courage a merry hour in their lives or take pleasure in anything There is a great moderation to be had in such things as matters of so great moment to the making or marring of a child Some fright their children with beggars bugbears and hobgoblins if they cry or be otherwise unruly but they are much to blame in it many times saith Lavater de spectris part one cap five ex metu in morbos graves incidunt et noctu dormientes clamant for fear they fall into many diseases and cry out in their sleep and are much the worse for it all their lives these things ought not at all or to be sparingly done and upon just occasion Tyrannical impatient hair brain schoolmasters aridi magistri so twenty one twenty three Fabius terms them Ajaces flagelliferi are in this kind as bad as hangmen and executioners they make many children endure a martyrdom all the while they are at school with bad diet if they board in their houses too much severity and ill usage they quite pervert their temperature of body and mind still chiding railing frowning lashing tasking keeping that they are fracti animis moped many times weary of their lives twenty one twenty four nimia severitate deficiunt et desperant and think no slavery in the world as once I did myself like to that of a grammar scholar Praeceptorum ineptiis discruciantur ingenia puerorum twenty one twenty five saith Erasmus they tremble at his voice looks coming in saint Austin in the first book of his confess et four ca calls this schooling meliculosam necessitatem and elsewhere a martyrdom and confesseth of himself how cruelly he was tortured in mind for learning Greek nulla verba noveram et saevis terroribus et poenis ut nossem instabatur mihi vehementer I know nothing and with cruel terrors and punishment I was daily compelled twenty one twenty six Beza complains in like case of a rigorous schoolmaster in Paris that made him by his continual thunder and threats once in a mind to drown himself had he not met by the way with an uncle of his that vindicated him from that misery for the time by taking him to his house Trincavellius lib one consil sixteen had a patient nineteen years of age extremely melancholy ob nimium studium Tarvitii et praeceptoris minas by reason of overmuch study and his twenty one twenty seven tutor s threats Many masters are hard hearted and bitter to their servants and by that means do so deject with terrible speeches and hard usage so crucify them that they become desperate and can never be recalled Others again in that opposite extreme do as great harm by their too much remissness they give them no bringing up no calling to busy themselves about or to live in teach them no trade or set them in any good course by means of which their servants children scholars are carried away with that stream of drunkenness idleness gaming and many such irregular courses that in the end they rue it curse their parents and mischief themselves Too much indulgence causeth the like twenty one twenty eight inepta patris lenitas et facilitas prava when as Mitio like with too much liberty and too great allowance they feed their children s humours let them revel wench riot swagger and do what they will themselves and then punish them with a noise of musicians twenty one twenty nine Obsonet potet oleat unguenta de meo Amat dabitur a me argentum ubi erit commodum Fores effregit restituentur descidit Vestem resarcietur Faciat quod lubet Sumat consumat perdat decretum est pati But as Demeo told him tu illum corrumpi sinis your lenity will be his undoing praevidere videor jam diem illum quum hic egens profugiet aliquo militatum I foresee his ruin So parents often err many fond mothers especially dote so much upon their children like twenty one thirty Aesop s ape till in the end they crush them to death Corporum nutrices animarum novercae pampering up their bodies to the undoing of their souls they will not let them be twenty one thirty one corrected or controlled but still soothed up in everything they do that in conclusion they bring sorrow shame heaviness to their parents Ecclus cap xxx eight nine become wanton stubborn wilful and disobedient rude untaught headstrong incorrigible and graceless they love them so foolishly saith twenty one thirty two Cardan that they rather seem to hate them bringing them not up to virtue but injury not to learning but to riot not to sober life and conversation but to all pleasure and licentious behaviour Who is he of so little experience that knows not this of Fabius to be true twenty one thirty three Education is another nature altering the mind and will and I would to God saith he we ourselves did not spoil our children s manners by our overmuch cockering and nice education and weaken the strength of their bodies and minds that causeth custom custom nature c For these causes Plutarch in his book de lib educ and Hierom epist lib one epist seventeen to Laeta de institut filiae gives a most especial charge to all parents and many good cautions about bringing up of children that they be not committed to indiscreet passionate bedlam tutors light giddy headed or covetous persons and spare for no cost that they may be well nurtured and taught it being a matter of so great consequence For such parents as do otherwise Plutarch esteems of them twenty one thirty four that are more careful of their shoes than of their feet that rate their wealth above their children And he saith twenty one thirty five Cardan that leaves his son to a covetous schoolmaster to be informed or to a close Abbey to fast and learn wisdom together doth no other than that he be a learned fool or a sickly wise man SUBSECT III Terrors and Affrights Causes of Melancholy Tully in the fourth of his Tusculans distinguishes these terrors which arise from the apprehension of some terrible object heard or seen from other fears and so doth Patritius lib five Tit four de regis institut Of all fears they are most pernicious and violent and so suddenly alter the whole temperature of the body move the soul and spirits strike such a deep impression that the parties can never be recovered causing more grievous and fiercer melancholy as Felix Plater c three de mentis alienat twenty one thirty six speaks out of his experience than any inward cause whatsoever and imprints itself so forcibly in the spirits brain humours that if all the mass of blood were let out of the body it could hardly be extracted This horrible kind of melancholy for so he terms it had been often brought before him and troubles and affrights commonly men and women young and old of all sorts twenty one thirty seven Hercules de Saxonia calls this kind of melancholy ab agitatione spirituum by a peculiar name it comes from the agitation motion contraction dilatation of spirits not from any distemperature of humours and produceth strong effects This terror is most usually caused as twenty one thirty eight Plutarch will have from some imminent danger when a terrible object is at hand heard seen or conceived twenty one thirty nine truly appearing or in a twenty one forty dream and many times the more sudden the accident it is the more violent twenty one forty one Stat terror animis et cor attonitum salit Pavidumque trepidis palpitat venis jecur Their soul s affright their heart amazed quakes The trembling liver pants i th veins and aches Arthemedorus the grammarian lost his wits by the unexpected sight of a crocodile Laurentius seven de melan twenty one forty two The massacre at Lyons fifteen seventy two in the reign of Charles IX was so terrible and fearful that many ran mad some died great bellied women were brought to bed before their time generally all affrighted aghast Many lose their wits twenty one forty three by the sudden sight of some spectrum or devil a thing very common in all ages saith Lavater part one cap nine as Orestes did at the sight of the Furies which appeared to him in black as twenty one forty four Pausanias records The Greeks call them Greek mormolucheia which so terrify their souls or if they be but affrighted by some counterfeit devils in jest twenty one forty five ut pueri trepidant atque omnia caecis In tenebris metuunt as children in the dark conceive hobgoblins and are so afraid they are the worse for it all their lives Some by sudden fires earthquakes inundations or any such dismal objects Themiscon the physician fell into a hydrophobia by seeing one sick of that disease Dioscorides l six c thirty three or by the sight of a monster a carcase they are disquieted many months following and cannot endure the room where a corpse hath been for a world would not be alone with a dead man or lie in that bed many years after in which a man hath died At twenty one forty six Basil many little children in the springtime went to gather flowers in a meadow at the town s end where a malefactor hung in gibbets all gazing at it one by chance flung a stone and made it stir by which accident the children affrighted ran away one slower than the rest looking back and seeing the stirred carcase wag towards her cried out it came after and was so terribly affrighted that for many days she could not rest eat or sleep she could not be pacified but melancholy died twenty one forty seven In the same town another child beyond the Rhine saw a grave opened and upon the sight of a carcase was so troubled in mind that she could not be comforted but a little after departed and was buried by it Platerus observat l one a gentlewoman of the same city saw a fat hog cut up when the entrails were opened and a noisome savour offended her nose she much misliked and would not longer abide a physician in presence told her as that hog so was she full of filthy excrements and aggravated the matter by some other loathsome instances insomuch this nice gentlewoman apprehended it so deeply that she fell forthwith a vomiting was so mightily distempered in mind and body that with all his art and persuasions for some months after he could not restore her to herself again she could not forget it or remove the object out of her sight Idem Many cannot endure to see a wound opened but they are offended a man executed or labour of any fearful disease as possession apoplexies one bewitched twenty one forty eight or if they read by chance of some terrible thing the symptoms alone of such a disease or that which they dislike they are instantly troubled in mind aghast ready to apply it to themselves they are as much disquieted as if they had seen it or were so affected themselves Hecatas sibi videntur somniare they dream and continually think of it As lamentable effects are caused by such terrible objects heard read or seen auditus maximos motus in corpore facit as twenty one forty nine Plutarch holds no sense makes greater alteration of body and mind sudden speech sometimes unexpected news be they good or bad praevisa minus oratio will move as much animum obruere et de sede sua dejicere as a twenty one fifty philosopher observes will take away our sleep and appetite disturb and quite overturn us Let them bear witness that have heard those tragical alarms outcries hideous noises which are many times suddenly heard in the dead of the night by irruption of enemies and accidental fires c those twenty one fifty one panic fears which often drive men out of their wits bereave them of sense understanding and all some for a time some for their whole lives they never recover it The twenty one fifty two Midianites were so affrighted by Gideon s soldiers they breaking but every one a pitcher and twenty one fifty three Hannibal s army by such a panic fear was discomfited at the walls of Rome Augusta Livia hearing a few tragical verses recited out of Virgil Tu Marcellus eris c fell down dead in a swoon Edinus king of Denmark by a sudden sound which he heard twenty one fifty four was turned into fury with all his men Cranzius l five Dan hist and Alexander ab Alexandro l three c five Amatus Lusitanus had a patient that by reason of bad tidings became epilepticus cen two cura ninety Cardan subtil l eighteen saw one that lost his wits by mistaking of an echo If one sense alone can cause such violent commotions of the mind what may we think when hearing sight and those other senses are all troubled at once as by some earthquakes thunder lightning tempests c At Bologna in Italy anno fifteen oh four there was such a fearful earthquake about eleven o clock in the night as twenty one fifty five Beroaldus in his book de terrae motu hath commended to posterity that all the city trembled the people thought the world was at an end actum de mortalibus such a fearful noise it made such a detestable smell the inhabitants were infinitely affrighted and some ran mad Audi rem atrocem et annalibus memorandam mine author adds hear a strange story and worthy to be chronicled I had a servant at the same time called Fulco Argelanus a bold and proper man so grievously terrified with it that he twenty one fifty six was first melancholy after doted at last mad and made away himself At twenty one fifty seven Fuscinum in Japona there was such an earthquake and darkness on a sudden that many men were offended with headache many overwhelmed with sorrow and melancholy At Meacum whole streets and goodly palaces were overturned at the same time and there was such a hideous noise withal like thunder and filthy smell that their hair stared for fear and their hearts quaked men and beasts were incredibly terrified In Sacai another city the same earthquake was so terrible unto them that many were bereft of their senses and others by that horrible spectacle so much amazed that they knew not what they did Blasius a Christian the reporter of the news was so affrighted for his part that though it were two months after he was scarce his own man neither could he drive the remembrance of it out of his mind Many times some years following they will tremble afresh at the twenty one fifty eight remembrance or conceit of such a terrible object even all their lives long if mention be made of it Cornelius Agrippa relates out of Gulielmus Parisiensis a story of one that after a distasteful purge which a physician had prescribed unto him was so much moved twenty one fifty nine that at the very sight of physic he would be distempered though he never so much as smelled to it the box of physic long after would give him a purge nay the very remembrance of it did effect it twenty one sixty like travellers and seamen saith Plutarch that when they have been sanded or dashed on a rock for ever after fear not that mischance only but all such dangers whatsoever SUBSECT IV Scoffs Calumnies bitter Jests how they cause Melancholy It is an old saying twenty one sixty one A blow with a word strikes deeper than a blow with a sword and many men are as much galled with a calumny a scurrilous and bitter jest a libel a pasquil satire apologue epigram stage play or the like as with any misfortune whatsoever Princes and potentates that are otherwise happy and have all at command secure and free quibus potentia sceleris impunitatem fecit are grievously vexed with these pasquilling libels and satires they fear a railing twenty one sixty two Aretine more than an enemy in the field which made most princes of his time as some relate allow him a liberal pension that he should not tax them in his satires twenty one sixty three The Gods had their Momus Homer his Zoilus Achilles his Thersites Philip his Demades the Caesars themselves in Rome were commonly taunted There was never wanting a Petronius a Lucian in those times nor will be a Rabelais an Euphormio a Boccalinus in ours Adrian the sixth pope twenty one sixty four was so highly offended and grievously vexed with pasquillers at Rome he gave command that his statue should be demolished and burned the ashes flung into the river Tiber and had done it forthwith had not Ludovicus Suessanus a facete companion dissuaded him to the contrary by telling him that pasquil s ashes would turn to frogs in the bottom of the river and croak worse and louder than before genus irritabile vatum and therefore twenty one sixty five Socrates in Plato adviseth all his friends that respect their credits to stand in awe of poets for they are terrible fellows can praise and dispraise as they see cause Hinc quam sit calamus saevior ense patet The prophet David complains Psalm cxxiii four that his soul was full of the mocking of the wealthy and of the despitefulness of the proud and Psalm lv four for the voice of the wicked c and their hate his heart trembled within him and the terrors of death came upon him fear and horrible fear c and Psal lxix twenty Rebuke hath broken my heart and I am full of heaviness Who hath not like cause to complain and is not so troubled that shall fall into the mouths of such men for many are of so twenty one sixty six petulant a spleen and have that figure Sarcasmus so often in their mouths so bitter so foolish as twenty one sixty seven Balthazar Castilio notes of them that they cannot speak but they must bite they had rather lose a friend than a jest and what company soever they come in they will be scoffing insulting over their inferiors especially over such as any way depend upon them humouring misusing or putting gulleries on some or other till they have made by their humouring or gulling twenty one sixty eight ex stulto insanum a mope or a noddy and all to make themselves merry twenty one sixty nine dummodo risum Excutiat sibi non hic cuiquam parcit amico Friends neuters enemies all are as one to make a fool a madman is their sport and they have no greater felicity than to scoff and deride others they must sacrifice to the god of laughter with them in twenty one seventy Apuleius once a day or else they shall be melancholy themselves they care not how they grind and misuse others so they may exhilarate their own persons Their wits indeed serve them to that sole purpose to make sport to break a scurrile jest which is levissimus ingenii fructus the froth of wit as twenty one seventy one Tully holds and for this they are often applauded in all other discourse dry barren stramineous dull and heavy here lies their genius in this they alone excel please themselves and others Leo Decimus that scoffing pope as Jovius hath registered in the Fourth book of his life took an extraordinary delight in humouring of silly fellows and to put gulleries upon them twenty one seventy two by commending some persuading others to this or that he made ex stolidis stultissimos et maxime ridiculos ex stultis insanos soft fellows stark noddies and such as were foolish quite mad before he left them One memorable example he recites there of Tarascomus of Parma a musician that was so humoured by Leo Decimus and Bibiena his second in this business that he thought himself to be a man of most excellent skill who was indeed a ninny they twenty one seventy three made him set foolish songs and invent new ridiculous precepts which they did highly commend as to tie his arm that played on the lute to make him strike a sweeter stroke twenty one seventy four and to pull down the arras hangings because the voice would be clearer by reason of the reverberation of the wall In the like manner they persuaded one Baraballius of Caieta that he was as good a poet as Petrarch would have him to be made a laureate poet and invite all his friends to his instalment and had so possessed the poor man with a conceit of his excellent poetry that when some of his more discreet friends told him of his folly he was very angry with them and said twenty one seventy five they envied his honour and prosperity it was strange saith Jovius to see an old man of sixty years a venerable and grave old man so gulled But what cannot such scoffers do especially if they find a soft creature on whom they may work nay to say truth who is so wise or so discreet that may not be humoured in this kind especially if some excellent wits shall set upon him he that mads others if he were so humoured would be as mad himself as much grieved and tormented he might cry with him in the comedy Proh Jupiter tu homo me adigas ad insaniam For all is in these things as they are taken if he be a silly soul and do not perceive it tis well he may haply make others sport and be no whit troubled himself but if he be apprehensive of his folly and take it to heart then it torments him worse than any lash a bitter jest a slander a calumny pierceth deeper than any loss danger bodily pain or injury whatsoever leviter enim volat it flies swiftly as Bernard of an arrow sed graviter vulnerat but wounds deeply especially if it shall proceed from a virulent tongue it cuts saith David like a two edged sword They shoot bitter words as arrows Psal lxiv five And they smote with their tongues Jer xviii eighteen and that so hard that they leave an incurable wound behind them Many men are undone by this means moped and so dejected that they are never to be recovered and of all other men living those which are actually melancholy or inclined to it are most sensible as being suspicious choleric apt to mistake and impatient of an injury in that kind they aggravate and so meditate continually of it that it is a perpetual corrosive not to be removed till time wear it out Although they peradventure that so scoff do it alone in mirth and merriment and hold it optimum aliena frui insania an excellent thing to enjoy another man s madness yet they must know that it is a mortal sin as twenty one seventy six Thomas holds and as the prophet twenty one seventy seven David denounceth they that use it shall never dwell in God s tabernacle Such scurrilous jests flouts and sarcasms therefore ought not at all to be used especially to our betters to those that are in misery or any way distressed for to such aerumnarum incrementa sunt they multiply grief and as twenty one seventy eight he perceived In multis pudor in multis iracundia c many are ashamed many vexed angered and there is no greater cause or furtherer of melancholy Martin Cromerus in the Sixth book of his history hath a pretty story to this purpose of Vladislaus the second king of Poland and Peter Dunnius earl of Shrine they had been hunting late and were enforced to lodge in a poor cottage When they went to bed Vladislaus told the earl in jest that his wife lay softer with the abbot of Shrine he not able to contain replied Et tua cum Dabesso and yours with Dabessus a gallant young gentleman in the court whom Christina the queen loved Tetigit id dictum Principis animum these words of his so galled the prince that he was long after tristis et cogitabundus very sad and melancholy for many months but they were the earl s utter undoing for when Christina heard of it she persecuted him to death Sophia the empress Justinian s wife broke a bitter jest upon Narsetes the eunuch a famous captain then disquieted for an overthrow which he lately had that he was fitter for a distaff and to keep women company than to wield a sword or to be general of an army but it cost her dear for he so far distasted it that he went forthwith to the adverse part much troubled in his thoughts caused the Lombards to rebel and thence procured many miseries to the commonwealth Tiberius the emperor withheld a legacy from the people of Rome which his predecessor Augustus had lately given and perceiving a fellow round a dead corse in the ear would needs know wherefore he did so the fellow replied that he wished the departed soul to signify to Augustus the commons of Rome were yet unpaid for this bitter jest the emperor caused him forthwith to be slain and carry the news himself For this reason all those that otherwise approve of jests in some cases and facete companions as who doth not let them laugh and be merry rumpantur et illa Codro tis laudable and fit those yet will by no means admit them in their companies that are any way inclined to this malady non jocandum cum iis qui miseri sunt et aerumnosi no jesting with a discontented person Tis Castilio s caveat twenty one seventy nine Jo Pontanus and twenty one eighty Galateus and every good man s Play with me but hurt me not Jest with me but shame me not Comitas is a virtue between rusticity and scurrility two extremes as affability is between flattery and contention it must not exceed but be still accompanied with that twenty one eighty one Greek ablabeia or innocency quae nemini nocet omnem injuriae oblationem abhorrens hurts no man abhors all offer of injury Though a man be liable to such a jest or obloquy have been overseen or committed a foul fact yet it is no good manners or humanity to upbraid to hit him in the teeth with his offence or to scoff at such a one tis an old axiom turpis in reum omnis exprobratio twenty one eighty two I speak not of such as generally tax vice Barclay Gentilis Erasmus Agrippa Fishcartus c the Varronists and Lucians of our time satirists epigrammists comedians apologists c but such as personate rail scoff calumniate perstringe by name or in presence offend twenty one eighty three Ludit qui stolida procacitate Non est Sestius ille sed caballus Tis horse play this and those jests as he twenty one eighty four saith are no better than injuries biting jests mordentes et aculeati they are poisoned jests leave a sting behind them and ought not to be used twenty one eighty five Set not thy foot to make the blind to fall Nor wilfully offend thy weaker brother Nor wound the dead with thy tongue s bitter gall Neither rejoice thou in the fall of other If these rules could be kept we should have much more ease and quietness than we have less melancholy whereas on the contrary we study to misuse each other how to sting and gall like two fighting boors bending all our force and wit friends fortune to crucify twenty one eighty six one another s souls by means of which there is little content and charity much virulency hatred malice and disquietness among us SUBSECT V Loss of Liberty Servitude Imprisonment how they cause Melancholy To this catalogue of causes I may well annex loss of liberty servitude or imprisonment which to some persons is as great a torture as any of the rest Though they have all things convenient sumptuous houses to their use fair walks and gardens delicious bowers galleries good fare and diet and all things correspondent yet they are not content because they are confined may not come and go at their pleasure have and do what they will but live twenty one eighty seven aliena quadra at another man s table and command As it is twenty one eighty eight in meats so it is in all other things places societies sports let them be never so pleasant commodious wholesome so good yet omnium rerum est satietas there is a loathing satiety of all things The children of Israel were tired with manna it is irksome to them so to live as to a bird in his cage or a dog in his kennel they are weary of it They are happy it is true and have all things to another man s judgment that heart can wish or that they themselves can desire bona si sua norint yet they loathe it and are tired with the present Est natura hominum novitatis avida men s nature is still desirous of news variety delights and our wandering affections are so irregular in this kind that they must change though it must be to the worst Bachelors must be married and married men would be bachelors they do not love their own wives though otherwise fair wise virtuous and well qualified because they are theirs our present estate is still the worst we cannot endure one course of life long et quod modo voverat odit one calling long esse in honore juvat mox displicet one place long twenty one eighty nine Romae Tibur amo ventosus Tybure Romam that which we earnestly sought we now contemn Hoc quosdam agit ad mortem saith twenty one ninety Seneca quod proposita saepe mutando in eadem revolvuntur et non relinquunt novitati locum Fastidio caepit esse vita et ipsus mundus et subit illud rapidissimarum deliciarum Quousque eadem this alone kills many a man that they are tied to the same still as a horse in a mill a dog in a wheel they run round without alteration or news their life groweth odious the world loathsome and that which crosseth their furious delights what still the same Marcus Aurelius and Solomon that had experience of all worldly delights and pleasure confessed as much of themselves what they most desired was tedious at last and that their lust could never be satisfied all was vanity and affliction of mind Now if it be death itself another hell to be glutted with one kind of sport dieted with one dish tied to one place though

villains hunger starved beggars wandering rogues those ordinary slaves and day labouring drudges yet they are commonly so preyed upon by twenty two sixty two polling officers for breaking the laws by their tyrannising landlords so flayed and fleeced by perpetual twenty two sixty three exactions that though they do drudge fare hard and starve their genius they cannot live in twenty two sixty four some countries but what they have is instantly taken from them the very care they take to live to be drudges to maintain their poor families their trouble and anxiety takes away their sleep Sirac xxxi

and merciless uncharitable as they are they leave them so distressed to beg steal murmur and twenty two sixty five rebel or else starve The feeling and fear of this misery compelled those old Romans whom Menenius Agrippa pacified to resist their governors outlaws and rebels in most places to take up seditious arms and in all ages hath caused uproars murmurings seditions rebellions thefts murders mutinies jars and contentions in every commonwealth grudging repining complaining discontent in each private family because they want means to live according to their callings bring up their children it breaks their hearts they cannot do as they would No greater misery than for a lord to have a knight s living a gentleman a yeoman s not to be able to live as his birth and place require Poverty and want are generally corrosives to all kinds of men especially to such as have been in good and flourishing estate are suddenly distressed twenty two sixty six nobly born liberally brought up and by

cases If we may give credit to twenty two ninety Munster amongst us Christians in Lithuania they voluntarily mancipate and sell themselves their wives and children to rich men to avoid hunger and beggary twenty two ninety one many make away themselves in this extremity Apicius the Roman when he cast up his accounts and found but one hundred thousand crowns left murdered himself for fear he

humour massacred themselves Another of a merchant learned wise otherwise and discreet but out of a deep apprehension he had of a loss at seas would not be persuaded but as twenty two ninety two

new causes as so many by paths offer themselves to be discussed to search out all were an Herculean work and fitter for Theseus I will follow mine intended thread and point only at some few of the chiefest Death of Friends Amongst which loss and death of friends may challenge a first place multi tristantur as twenty three thirteen Vives well observes post delicias convivia dies festos many are melancholy after a feast holiday merry meeting or some pleasing sport if they be solitary by chance left alone to themselves without employment sport or want their ordinary companions some at the departure of friends only whom they shall shortly see again weep and howl and look after them as a cow lows after her calf or a child takes on that goes to school after holidays Ut me levarat tuus adventus sic discessus afflixit which twenty three fourteen Tully writ to Atticus thy coming was not so welcome to me as thy departure was harsh Montanus consil one hundred thirty two makes mention of a country woman that parting with her friends and native place became grievously melancholy for many years and Trallianus of another so caused for the absence of her husband which is an ordinary passion amongst our good wives if their husband tarry out a day longer than his appointed time or break his hour they take on presently with sighs and tears he is either robbed or dead some mischance or other is surely befallen him they cannot eat drink sleep or be quiet in mind till they see him again If parting of friends absence alone can work such violent effects what shall death do when they must eternally be separated never in this world to meet again This is so grievous a torment for the time that it takes away their appetite desire of life extinguisheth all delights it causeth deep

cicuta mandrakes c twenty three ninety two A company of young men at Agrigentum in Sicily came into a tavern where after they had freely taken their liquor whether it were the wine itself or something mixed with it tis not yet known twenty three ninety three but upon a sudden they began to be so troubled in their brains and their phantasy so crazed that they thought they were in a ship at sea and now ready to be cast away by reason of a tempest Wherefore to avoid shipwreck and present drowning they flung all the goods in the house out at the windows into the street or into the sea as they supposed thus they continued mad a pretty season and being brought before the magistrate to give an account of this their fact they told him not yet recovered of their madness that what was done they did for fear of death and to avoid imminent danger the spectators were all amazed at this their stupidity and gazed on them still whilst one of the ancientest of the company in a grave tone excused himself to the magistrate upon his knees O viri Tritones ego in imo jacui I beseech your deities c for I was in the bottom of the ship all the while another besought them as so many sea gods to be

grains and small sands sink a ship many small drops make a flood c often reiterated many dispositions produce an habit MEMB V SUBSECT I Continent inward antecedent next causes and how the body works on the mind As a purlieu hunter I have hitherto beaten about the circuit of the forest of this microcosm and followed only those outward adventitious causes I will now break into the inner rooms and rip up the antecedent immediate causes which are there to be found For as the distraction of the mind amongst other outward causes and perturbations alters the temperature of the body so the distraction and distemper of the body will cause a distemperature of the soul and tis hard to decide which of these two do more harm to the other Plato Cyprian and some others as I have formerly said lay the greatest fault upon the soul excusing the body others again accusing the body excuse the soul as a principal agent Their reasons are because twenty four oh one the manners do follow the temperature of the body as Galen proves in his book of that subject Prosper Calenius de Atra bile Jason Pratensis c de Mania Lemnius l four c sixteen and many others And that which Gualter hath commented hom ten in epist Johannis is most true concupiscence and originals in inclinations and bad humours are twenty four oh two radical in every one of us causing these perturbations affections and several distempers offering many times violence unto the soul Every man is tempted by his own concupiscence James i fourteen the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak and rebelleth against the spirit as our twenty four oh three apostle teacheth us that methinks the soul hath the better plea against the body which so forcibly inclines us that we cannot resist Nec nos obniti contra nec tendere tantum sufficimus How the body being material worketh upon the immaterial soul by mediation of humours and spirits which participate of both and ill disposed organs Cornelius Agrippa hath discoursed lib one de occult Philos cap sixty three sixty four sixty five Levinus Lemnius lib one de occult nat mir cap twelve et sixteen et twenty one institut ad opt vit Perkins lib one Cases of

oh five Lemnius corpori quoque infesta sunt et illi teterrimos morbos inferunt cause grievous diseases in the body so bodily diseases affect the soul by consent Now the chiefest causes proceed from the twenty four oh six heart humours spirits as they are purer or impurer so is the mind and equally suffers as a lute out of tune if one string or one organ be distempered all the rest miscarry twenty four oh seven corpus onustum hesternis vitiis animum quoque praegravat una The body is domicilium animae her house abode and stay and as a torch gives a better light a sweeter smell according to the matter it is made of so doth our soul perform all her actions better or worse as her organs are disposed or as wine savours of the cask wherein it is kept the soul receives a tincture from the body through which it works We see this in old men children Europeans Asians hot and cold climes sanguine are merry melancholy sad phlegmatic dull by reason of abundance of those humours and they cannot resist such passions which are inflicted by them For in this infirmity of human nature as Melancthon declares the understanding is so tied to and captivated by his inferior senses that without their help he cannot exercise his functions and the will being weakened hath but a small power to restrain those outward parts but suffers herself to be overruled by them that I must needs conclude with Lemnius spiritus et humores maximum nocumentum obtinent spirits and humours do most harm in twenty four oh eight troubling the soul How should a man choose but be choleric and angry that hath his body so clogged with abundance of gross humours or melancholy that is so inwardly disposed That thence comes then this malady madness apoplexies lethargies c it may not be denied Now this body of ours is most part distempered by some precedent diseases which molest his inward organs and instruments and so per consequens cause melancholy according to the consent of the most approved physicians twenty four oh nine This humour as Avicenna l three Fen one Tract four c eighteen Arnoldus breviar l one c eighteen Jacchinus comment in nine Rhasis c fifteen Montaltus c ten Nicholas Piso c de Melan c suppose is begotten by the distemperature of some inward part innate or left after some inflammation or else included in the blood after an twenty four ten ague or some other malignant disease This opinion of theirs concurs with that of Galen l three c six de locis affect Guianerius gives an instance in one so caused by a quartan ague and Montanus consil thirty two in a young man of twenty eight years of age so distempered after a quartan which had molested him five years together Hildesheim spicel two de Mania relates of a Dutch baron grievously tormented with melancholy after a long twenty four eleven ague Galen l de atra bile c four puts the plague a cause Botaldus in his book de lue vener c two the French pox for a cause others frenzy epilepsy apoplexy because those diseases do often degenerate into this Of suppression of haemorrhoids haemorrhagia or bleeding at the nose menstruous retentions although they deserve a larger explication as being the sole cause of a proper kind of melancholy in more ancient maids nuns and widows handled apart by Rodericus a Castro and Mercatus as I have elsewhere signified or any other evacuation stopped I have already spoken Only this I will add that this melancholy which shall be caused by such infirmities deserves to be pitied of all men and to be respected with a more tender compassion according to Laurentius as coming from a more inevitable cause SUBSECT II Distemperature of particular Parts causes There is almost no part of the body which being distempered doth not cause this malady as the brain and his parts heart liver spleen stomach matrix or womb pylorus mirach mesentery hypochondries mesaraic veins and in a word saith twenty four twelve Arculanus there is no part which causeth not melancholy either because it is adust or doth not expel the superfluity of the nutriment Savanarola Pract major rubric eleven Tract six cap one is of the same opinion that melancholy is engendered in each particular part and twenty four thirteen Crato in consil seventeen lib two Gordonius who is instar omnium lib med partic two cap nineteen confirms as much putting the twenty four fourteen matter of melancholy sometimes in the stomach liver heart brain spleen mirach hypochondries when as the melancholy humour resides there or the liver is not well cleansed from melancholy blood The brain is a familiar and frequent cause too hot or too cold twenty four fifteen through adust blood so caused as Mercurialis will have it within or without the head the brain itself being distempered Those are most apt to this disease twenty four sixteen that have a hot heart and moist brain which Montaltus cap eleven de Melanch approves out of Halyabbas Rhasis and Avicenna Mercurialis consil eleven assigns the coldness of the brain a cause and Salustius Salvianus med lect l two c one twenty four seventeen will have it arise from a cold and dry distemperature of the brain Piso Benedictus Victorius Faventinus will have it proceed from a twenty four eighteen hot distemperature of the brain and twenty four nineteen Montaltus cap ten from the brain s heat scorching the blood The brain is still distempered by himself or by consent by himself or his proper affection as Faventinus calls it twenty four twenty or by vapours which arise from the other parts and fume up into the head altering the animal facilities Hildesheim spicel two de Mania thinks it may be caused from a twenty four twenty one distemperature of the heart sometimes hot sometimes cold A hot liver and a cold stomach are put for usual causes of melancholy Mercurialis consil eleven et consil six consil eighty six assigns a hot liver and cold stomach for ordinary causes twenty four twenty two Monavius in an epistle of his to Crato in Scoltzius is of opinion that hypochondriacal melancholy may proceed from a cold liver the question is there discussed Most agree that a hot liver is in fault twenty four twenty three the liver is the shop of humours and especially causeth melancholy by his hot and dry distemperature twenty four twenty four The stomach and mesaraic veins do often concur by reason of their obstructions and thence their heat cannot be avoided and many times the matter is so adust and inflamed in those parts that it degenerates into hypochondriacal melancholy Guianerius c two Tract fifteen holds the mesaraic veins to be a sufficient twenty four twenty five cause alone The spleen concurs to this malady by all their consents and suppression of haemorrhoids dum non expurget alter a causa lien saith Montaltus if it be twenty four twenty six too cold and dry and do not purge the other parts as it ought consil twenty three Montanus puts the twenty four twenty seven spleen stopped for a great cause twenty four twenty eight Christophorus a Vega reports of his knowledge that he hath known melancholy caused from putrefied blood in those seed veins and womb twenty four twenty nine Arculanus from that menstruous blood turned into melancholy and seed too long detained as I have already declared by putrefaction or adustion The mesenterium or midriff diaphragma is a cause which the twenty four thirty Greeks called Greek phrenas because by his inflammation the mind is much troubled with convulsions and dotage All these most part offend by inflammation corrupting humours and spirits in this non natural melancholy for from these are engendered fuliginous and black spirits And for that reason twenty four thirty one Montaltus cap ten de causis melan will have the efficient cause of melancholy to be hot and dry not a cold and dry distemperature as some hold from the heat of the brain roasting the blood immoderate heat of the liver and bowels and inflammation of the pylorus And so much the rather because that as Galen holds all spices inflame the blood solitariness waking agues study meditation all which heat and therefore he concludes that this distemperature causing adventitious melancholy is not cold and dry but hot and dry But of this I have sufficiently treated in the matter of melancholy and hold that this may be true in non natural melancholy which produceth madness but not in that natural which is more cold and being immoderate produceth a gentle dotage twenty four thirty two Which opinion Geraldus de Solo maintains in his comment upon Rhasis SUBSECT III Causes of Head Melancholy After a tedious discourse of the general causes of melancholy I am now returned at last to treat in brief of the three particular species and such causes as properly appertain unto them Although these causes promiscuously concur to each and every particular kind and commonly produce their effects in that part which is most ill disposed and least able to resist and so cause all three species yet many of them are proper to some one kind and seldom found in the rest As for example head melancholy is commonly caused by a cold or hot distemperature of the brain according to Laurentius cap five de melan but as twenty four thirty three Hercules de Saxonia contends from that agitation or distemperature of the animal spirits alone Salust Salvianus before mentioned lib two cap three de re med will have it proceed from cold but that I take of natural melancholy such as are fools and dote for as Galen writes lib four de puls eight and Avicenna twenty four thirty four a cold and moist brain is an inseparable companion of folly But this adventitious melancholy which is here meant is caused of a hot and dry distemperature as twenty four thirty five Damascen the Arabian lib three cap twenty two thinks and most writers Altomarus and Piso call it twenty four thirty six an innate burning intemperateness turning blood and choler into melancholy Both these opinions may stand good as Bruel maintains and Capivaccius si cerebrum sit calidius twenty four thirty seven if the brain be hot the animal spirits will be hot and thence comes madness if cold folly David Crusius Theat morb Hermet lib two cap six de atra bile grants melancholy to be a disease of an inflamed brain but cold notwithstanding of itself calida per accidens frigida per se hot by accident only I am of Capivaccius mind for my part Now this humour according to Salvianus is sometimes in the substance of the brain sometimes contained in the membranes and tunicles that cover the brain sometimes in the passages of the ventricles of the brain or veins of those ventricles It follows many times twenty four thirty eight frenzy long diseases agues long abode in hot places or under the sun a blow on the head as Rhasis informeth us Piso adds solitariness waking inflammations of the head proceeding most part twenty four thirty nine from much use of spices hot wines hot meats all which Montanus reckons up consil twenty two for a melancholy Jew and Heurnius repeats cap twelve de Mania hot baths garlic onions saith Guianerius bad air corrupt much twenty four forty waking c retention of seed or abundance stopping of haemorrhagia the midriff misaffected and according to Trallianus l one sixteen immoderate cares troubles griefs discontent study meditation and in a word the abuse of all those six non natural things Hercules de Saxonia cap sixteen lib one will have it caused from a twenty four forty one cautery or boil dried up or an issue Amatus Lusitanus cent two cura sixty seven gives instance in a fellow that had a hole in his arm twenty four forty two after that was healed ran mad and when the wound was open he was cured again Trincavellius consil thirteen lib one hath an example of a melancholy man so caused by overmuch continuance in the sun frequent use of venery and immoderate exercise and in his cons forty nine lib three from a twenty four forty three headpiece overheated which caused head melancholy Prosper Calenus brings in Cardinal Caesius for a pattern of such as are so melancholy by long study but examples are infinite SUBSECT IV Causes of Hypochondriacal or Windy Melancholy In repeating of these causes I must crambem bis coctam apponere say that again which I have formerly said in applying them to their proper species Hypochondriacal or flatuous melancholy is that which the Arabians call mirachial and is in my judgment the most grievous and frequent though Bruel and Laurentius make it least dangerous and not so hard to be known or cured His causes are inward or outward Inward from divers parts or organs as midriff spleen stomach liver pylorus womb diaphragma mesaraic veins stopping of issues c Montaltus cap fifteen out of Galen recites twenty four forty four heat and obstruction of those mesaraic veins as an immediate cause by which means the passage of the chilus to the liver is detained stopped or corrupted and turned into rumbling and wind Montanus consil two hundred thirty three hath an evident demonstration Trincavelius another lib one cap one and Plater a third observat lib one for a doctor of the law visited with this infirmity from the said obstruction and heat of these mesaraic veins and bowels quoniam inter ventriculum et jecur venae effervescunt the veins are inflamed about the liver and stomach Sometimes those other parts are together misaffected and concur to the production of this malady a hot liver and cold stomach or cold belly look for instances in Hollerius Victor Trincavelius consil thirty five l three Hildesheim Spicel two fol one hundred thirty two Solenander consil nine pro cive Lugdunensi Montanus consil two hundred twenty nine for the Earl of Montfort in Germany fifteen forty nine and Frisimelica in the two hundred thirty three consultation of the said Montanus I Caesar Claudinus gives instance of a cold stomach and over hot liver almost in every consultation con eighty nine for a certain count and con one hundred six for a Polonian baron by reason of heat the blood is inflamed and gross vapours sent to the heart and brain Mercurialis subscribes to them cons eighty nine twenty four forty five the stomach being misaffected which he calls the king of the belly because if he be distempered all the rest suffer with him as being deprived of their nutriment or fed with bad nourishment by means of which come crudities obstructions wind rumbling griping c Hercules de Saxonia besides heat will have the weakness of the liver and his obstruction a cause facultatem debilem jecinoris which he calls the mineral of melancholy Laurentius assigns this reason because the liver over hot draws the meat undigested out of the stomach and burneth the humours Montanus cons two hundred forty four proves that sometimes a cold liver may be a cause Laurentius c twelve Trincavelius lib twelve consil and Gualter Bruel seems to lay the greatest fault upon the spleen that doth not his duty in purging the liver as he ought being too great or too little in drawing too much blood sometimes to it and not expelling it as P Cnemiandrus in a twenty four forty six consultation of his noted tumorem lienis he names it and the fountain of melancholy Diocles supposed the ground of this kind of melancholy to proceed from the inflammation of the pylorus which is the nether mouth of the ventricle Others assign the mesenterium or midriff distempered by heat the womb misaffected stopping of haemorrhoids with many such All which Laurentius cap twelve reduceth to three mesentery liver and spleen from whence he denominates hepatic splenetic and mesaraic melancholy Outward causes are bad diet care griefs discontents and in a word all those six non natural things as Montanus found by his experience consil two hundred forty four Solenander consil nine for a citizen of Lyons in France gives his reader to understand that he knew this mischief procured by a medicine of cantharides which an unskilful physician ministered his patient to drink ad venerem excitandam But most commonly fear grief and some sudden commotion or perturbation of the mind begin it in such bodies especially as are ill disposed Melancthon tract fourteen cap two de anima will have it as common to men as the mother to women upon some grievous trouble dislike passion or discontent For as Camerarius records in his life Melancthon himself was much troubled with it and therefore could speak out of experience Montanus consil twenty two pro delirante Judaeo confirms it twenty four forty seven grievous symptoms of the mind brought him to it Randolotius relates of himself that being one day very intent to write out a physician s notes molested by an occasion he fell into a hypochondriacal fit to avoid which he drank the decoction of wormwood and was freed twenty four forty eight Melancthon being the disease is so troublesome and frequent holds it a most necessary and profitable study for every man to know the accidents of it and a dangerous thing to be ignorant and would therefore have all men in some sort to understand the causes symptoms and cures of it SUBSECT V Causes of Melancholy from the whole Body As before the cause of this kind of melancholy is inward or outward Inward twenty four forty nine when the liver is apt to engender such a humour or the spleen weak by nature and not able to discharge his office A melancholy temperature retention of haemorrhoids monthly issues bleeding at nose long diseases agues and all those six non natural things increase it But especially twenty four fifty bad diet as Piso thinks pulse salt meat shellfish cheese black wine c Mercurialis out of Averroes and Avicenna condemns all herbs Galen lib three de loc affect cap seven especially cabbage So likewise fear sorrow discontents c but of these before And thus in brief you have had the general and particular causes of melancholy Now go and brag of thy present happiness whosoever thou art brag of thy temperature of thy good parts insult triumph and boast thou seest in what a brittle state thou art how soon thou mayst be dejected how many several ways by bad diet bad air a small loss a little sorrow or discontent an ague c how many sudden accidents may procure thy ruin what a small tenure of happiness thou hast in this life how weak and silly a creature thou art Humble thyself therefore under the mighty hand of God one Peter v six know thyself acknowledge thy present misery and make right use of it Qui stat videat ne cadat Thou dost now flourish and hast bona animi corporis et fortunae goods of body mind and fortune nescis quid serus secum vesper ferat thou knowest not what storms and tempests the late evening may bring with it Be not secure then be sober and watch twenty four fifty one fortunam reverenter habe if fortunate and rich if sick and poor moderate thyself I have said SECT III MEMB I SUBSECT I Symptoms or Signs of Melancholy in the Body Parrhasius a painter of Athens amongst those Olynthian captives Philip of Macedon brought home to sell twenty four fifty two bought one very old man and when he had him at Athens put him to extreme torture and torment the better by his example to express the pains and passions of his Prometheus whom he was then about to paint I need not be so barbarous inhuman curious or cruel for this purpose to torture any poor melancholy man their symptoms are plain obvious and familiar there needs no such accurate observation or far fetched object they delineate themselves they voluntarily betray themselves they are too frequent in all places I meet them still as I go they cannot conceal it their grievances are too well known I need not seek far to describe them Symptoms therefore are either twenty four fifty three universal or particular saith Gordonius lib med cap nineteen part two to persons to species some signs are secret some manifest some in the body some in the mind and diversely vary according to the inward or outward causes Capivaccius or from stars according to Jovianus Pontanus de reb caelest lib ten cap thirteen and celestial influences or from the humours diversely mixed Ficinus lib one cap four de sanit tuenda as they are hot cold natural unnatural intended or remitted so will Aetius have melancholica deliria multiformia diversity of melancholy signs Laurentius ascribes them to their several temperatures delights natures inclinations continuance of time as they are simple or mixed with other diseases as the causes are divers so must the signs be almost infinite Altomarus cap seven art med And as wine produceth divers effects or that herb Tortocolla in twenty four fifty four Laurentius which makes some laugh some weep some sleep some dance some sing some howl some drink c so doth this our melancholy humour work several signs in several parties But to confine them these general symptoms may be reduced to those of the body or the mind Those usual signs appearing in the bodies of such as are melancholy be these cold and dry or they are hot and dry as the humour is more or less adust From twenty four fifty five these first qualities arise many other second as that of twenty four fifty six colour black swarthy pale ruddy c some are impense rubri as Montaltus cap sixteen observes out of Galen lib three de locis affectis very red and high coloured Hippocrates in his book twenty four fifty seven de insania et melan reckons up these signs that they are twenty four fifty eight lean withered hollow eyed look old wrinkled harsh much troubled with wind and a griping in their bellies or bellyache belch often dry bellies and hard dejected looks flaggy beards singing of the ears vertigo light headed little or no sleep and that interrupt terrible and fearful dreams twenty four fifty nine Anna soror quae me suspensam insomnia terrent The same symptoms are repeated by Melanelius in his book of melancholy collected out of Galen Ruffus Aetius by Rhasis Gordonius and all the juniors twenty four sixty continual sharp and stinking belchings as if their meat in their stomachs were putrefied or that they had eaten fish dry bellies absurd and interrupt dreams and many fantastical visions about their eyes vertiginous apt to tremble and prone to venery twenty four sixty one Some add palpitation of the heart cold sweat as usual symptoms and a leaping in many parts of the body saltum in multis corporis partibus a kind of itching saith Laurentius on the superficies of the skin like a flea biting sometimes twenty four sixty two Montaltus cap twenty one puts fixed eyes and much twinkling of their eyes for a sign and so doth Avicenna oculos habentes palpitantes trauli vehementer rubicundi c lib three Fen one Tract four cap eighteen They stut most part which he took out of Hippocrates aphorisms twenty four sixty three Rhasis makes headache and a binding heaviness for a principal token much leaping of wind about the skin as well as stutting or tripping in speech c hollow eyes gross veins and broad lips To some too if they be far gone mimical gestures are too familiar laughing grinning fleering murmuring talking to themselves with strange mouths and faces inarticulate voices exclamations c And although they be commonly lean hirsute uncheerful in countenance withered and not so pleasant to behold by reason of those continual fears griefs and vexations dull heavy lazy restless unapt to go about any business yet their memories are most part good they have happy wits and excellent apprehensions Their hot and dry brains make them they cannot sleep Ingentes habent et crebras vigilias Arteus mighty and often watchings sometimes waking for a month a year together twenty four sixty four Hercules de Saxonia faithfully averreth that he hath heard his mother swear she slept not for seven months together Trincavelius Tom two cons sixteen speaks of one that waked fifty days and Skenkius hath examples of two years and all without offence In natural actions their appetite is greater than their concoction multa appetunt pauca digerunt as Rhasis hath it they covet to eat but cannot digest And although they twenty four sixty five do eat much yet they are lean ill liking saith Areteus withered and hard much troubled with costiveness crudities oppilations spitting belching c Their pulse is rare and slow except it be of the twenty four sixty six Carotides which is very strong but that varies according to their intended passions or perturbations as Struthius hath proved at large Spigmaticae artis l four c thirteen To say truth in such chronic diseases the pulse is not much to be respected there being so much superstition in it as twenty four sixty seven Crato notes and so many differences in Galen that he dares say they may not be observed or understood of any man Their urine is most part pale and low coloured urina pauca acris biliosa Areteus not much in quantity but this in my judgment is all out as uncertain as the other varying so often according to several persons habits and other occasions not to be respected in chronic diseases twenty four sixty eight Their melancholy excrements in some very much in others little as the spleen plays his part and thence proceeds wind palpitation of the heart short breath plenty of humidity in the stomach heaviness of heart and heartache and intolerable stupidity and dullness of spirits Their excrements or stool hard black to some and little If the heart brain liver spleen be misaffected as usually they are many inconveniences proceed from them many diseases accompany as incubus twenty four sixty nine apoplexy epilepsy vertigo those frequent wakings and terrible dreams twenty four seventy intempestive laughing weeping sighing sobbing bashfulness blushing trembling sweating swooning c twenty four seventy one All their senses are troubled they think they see hear smell and touch that which they do not as shall be proved in the following discourse SUBSECT II Symptoms or Signs in the Mind Fear Arculanus in nine Rhasis ad Almansor cap sixteen will have these symptoms to be infinite as indeed they are varying according to the parties for scarce is there one of a thousand that dotes alike twenty four seventy two Laurentius c sixteen Some few of greater note I will point at and amongst the rest fear and sorrow which as they are frequent causes so if they persevere long according to Hippocrates twenty four seventy three and Galen s aphorisms they are most assured signs inseparable companions and characters of melancholy of present melancholy and habituated saith Montaltus cap eleven and common to them all as the said Hippocrates Galen Avicenna and all Neoterics hold But as hounds many times run away with a false cry never perceiving themselves to be at a fault so do they For Diocles of old whom Galen confutes and amongst the juniors twenty four seventy four Hercules de Saxonia with Lod Mercatus cap seventeen l one de melan takes just exceptions at this aphorism of Hippocrates tis not always true or so generally to be understood fear and sorrow are no common symptoms to all melancholy upon more serious consideration I find some saith he that are not so at all Some indeed are sad and not fearful some fearful and not sad some neither fearful nor sad some both Four kinds he excepts fanatical persons such as were Cassandra Nanto Nicostrata Mopsus Proteus the sibyls whom twenty four seventy five Aristotle confesseth to have been deeply melancholy Baptista Porta seconds him Physiog lib one cap eight they were atra bile perciti demoniacal persons and such as speak strange languages are of this rank some poets such as laugh always and think themselves kings cardinals c sanguine they are pleasantly disposed most part and so continue twenty four seventy six Baptista Portia confines fear and sorrow to them that are cold but lovers Sibyls enthusiasts he wholly excludes So that I think I may truly conclude they are not always sad and fearful but usually so and that twenty four seventy seven without a cause timent de non timendis Gordonius quaeque momenti non sunt although not all alike saith Altomarus twenty four seventy eight yet all likely fear twenty four seventy nine some with an extraordinary and a mighty fear Areteus twenty four eighty Many fear death and yet in a contrary humour make away themselves Galen lib three de loc affec cap seven Some are afraid that heaven will fall on their heads some they are damned or shall be twenty four eighty one They are troubled with scruples of consciences distrusting God s mercies think they shall go certainly to hell the devil will have them and make great lamentation Jason Pratensis Fear of devils death that they shall be so sick of some such or such disease ready to tremble at every object they shall die themselves forthwith or that some of their dear friends or near allies are certainly dead imminent danger loss disgrace still torment others c that they are all glass and therefore will suffer no man to come near them that they are all cork as light as feathers others as heavy as lead some are afraid their heads will fall off their shoulders that they have frogs in their bellies c twenty four eighty two Montanus consil twenty three speaks of one that durst not walk alone from home for fear he should swoon or die A second twenty four eighty three fears every man he meets will rob him quarrel with him or kill him A third dares not venture to walk alone for fear he should meet the devil a thief be sick fears all old women as witches and every black dog or cat he sees he suspecteth to be a devil every person comes near him is maleficiated every creature all intend to hurt him seek his ruin another dares not go over a bridge come near a pool rock steep hill lie in a chamber where cross beams are for fear he be tempted to hang drown or precipitate himself If he be in a silent auditory as at a sermon he is afraid he shall speak aloud at unawares something indecent unfit to be said If he be locked in a close room he is afraid of being stifled for want of air and still carries biscuit aquavitae or some strong waters about him for fear of deliquiums or being sick or if he be in a throng middle of a church multitude where he may not well get out though he sit at ease he is so misaffected He will freely promise undertake any business beforehand but when it comes to be performed he dare not adventure but fears an infinite number of dangers disasters c Some are twenty four eighty four afraid to be burned or that the twenty four eighty five ground will sink under them or twenty four eighty six swallow them quick or that the king will call them in question for some fact they never did Rhasis cont and that they shall surely be executed The terror of such a death troubles them and they fear as much and are equally tormented in mind twenty four eighty seven as they that have committed a murder and are pensive without a cause as if they were now presently to be put to death Plater cap three de mentis alienat They are afraid of some loss danger that they shall surely lose their lives goods and all they have but why they know not Trincavelius consil thirteen lib one had a patient that would needs make away himself for fear of being hanged and could not be persuaded for three years together but that he had killed a man Plater observat lib one hath two other examples of such as feared to be executed without a cause If they come in a place where a robbery theft or any such offence hath been done they presently fear they are suspected and many times betray themselves without a cause Lewis XI the French king suspected every man a traitor that came about him durst trust no officer Alii formidolosi omnium alii quorundam Fracatorius lib two de Intellect twenty four eighty eight some fear all alike some certain men and cannot endure their companies are sick in them or if they be from home Some suspect twenty four eighty nine treason still others are afraid of their twenty four ninety dearest and nearest friends Melanelius e Galeno Ruffo Aetio and dare not be alone in the dark for fear of hobgoblins and devils he suspects everything he hears or sees to be a devil or enchanted and imagineth a thousand chimeras and visions which to his thinking he certainly sees bugbears talks with black men ghosts goblins c twenty four ninety one Omnes se terrent aurae sonus excitat omnis Another through bashfulness suspicion and timorousness will not be seen abroad twenty four ninety two loves darkness as life and cannot endure the light or to sit in lightsome places his hat still in his eyes he will neither see nor be seen by his goodwill Hippocrates lib de Insania et Melancholia He dare not come in company for fear he should be misused disgraced overshoot himself in gesture or speeches or be sick he thinks every man observes him aims at him derides him owes him malice Most part twenty four ninety three they are afraid they are bewitched possessed or poisoned by their enemies and sometimes they suspect their nearest friends he thinks something speaks or talks within him and he belcheth of the poison Christophorus a Vega lib two cap one had a patient so troubled that by no persuasion or physic he could be reclaimed Some are afraid that they shall have every fearful disease they see others have hear of or read and dare not therefore hear or read of any such subject no not of melancholy itself lest by applying to themselves that which they hear or read they should aggravate and increase it If they see one possessed bewitched an epileptic paroxysm a man shaking with the palsy or giddy headed reeling or standing in a dangerous place c for many days after it runs in their minds they are afraid they shall be so too they are in like danger as Perkins c twelve sc twelve well observes in his Cases of Conscience and many times by violence of imagination they produce it They cannot endure to see any terrible object as a monster a man executed a carcase hear the devil named or any tragical relation seen but they quake for fear Hecatas somniare sibi videntur Lucian they dream of hobgoblins and may not get it out of their minds a long time after they apply as I have said all they hear see read to themselves as twenty four ninety four Felix Plater notes of some young physicians that study to cure diseases catch them themselves will be sick and appropriate all symptoms they find related of others to their own persons And therefore quod iterum moneo licet nauseam paret lectori malo decem potius verba decies repetita licet abundare quam unum desiderari I would advise him that is actually melancholy not to read this tract of Symptoms lest he disquiet or make himself for a time worse and more melancholy than he was before Generally of them all take this de inanibus semper conqueruntur et timent saith Aretius they complain of toys and fear twenty four ninety five without a cause and still think their melancholy to be most grievous none so bad as they are though it be nothing in respect yet never any man sure was so troubled or in this sort As really tormented and perplexed in as great an agony for toys and trifles such things as they will after laugh at themselves as if they were most material and essential matters indeed worthy to be feared and will not be satisfied Pacify them for one they are instantly troubled with some other fear always afraid of something which they foolishly imagine or conceive to themselves which never peradventure was never can be never likely will be troubled in mind upon every small occasion unquiet still complaining grieving vexing suspecting grudging discontent and cannot be freed so long as melancholy continues Or if their minds be more quiet for the present and they free from foreign fears outward accidents yet their bodies are out of tune they suspect some part or other to be amiss now their head aches heart stomach spleen c is misaffected they shall surely have this or that disease still troubled in body mind or both and through wind corrupt fantasy some accidental distemper continually molested Yet for all this as twenty four ninety six Jacchinus notes in all other things they are wise staid discreet and do nothing unbeseeming their dignity person or place this foolish ridiculous and childish fear excepted which so much so continually tortures and crucifies their souls like a barking dog that always bawls but seldom bites this fear ever molesteth and so long as melancholy lasteth cannot be avoided Sorrow is that other character and inseparable companion as individual as Saint Cosmus and Damian

discontent they be molested again and then they are weary of their lives weary of all they will die and show rather a necessity to live than a desire Claudius the emperor as twenty five oh six Sueton describes him had a spice of this disease for when he was tormented with the pain of his stomach he had a conceit to make away himself Julius Caesar Claudinus consil eighty four had a Polonian to his

duke of Muscovy that was instantly sick if he came but in sight of them and that twenty five eighteen Anchorite that fell into a cold palsy when a woman was brought before him Humorous Humorous they are beyond all measure sometimes profusely laughing extraordinarily merry and then again weeping without a cause which is familiar with many gentlewomen groaning sighing pensive sad almost distracted multa absurda fingunt et a ratione aliena saith twenty five nineteen Frambesarius they feign many absurdities vain void of reason one supposeth himself to be a dog cock bear horse glass butter c He is

still talk with and follow them In fine cogitationes somniantibus similes id vigilant quod alii somniant cogitabundi still saith Avicenna they wake as others dream and such for the most part are their imaginations and conceits twenty five twenty one absurd vain foolish toys yet they are twenty five twenty two most curious and solicitous continual et supra modum Rhasis cont lib one cap nine praemeditantur de aliqua re As serious in a toy as if it were a most necessary business of great moment importance and still still still thinking of it saeviunt in se macerating themselves Though they do talk with you and seem to be otherwise employed and to your thinking very intent and busy still that toy runs in their mind that fear that suspicion that abuse that jealousy that agony that vexation that cross that castle in the air that crotchet that whimsy that fiction that pleasant waking dream whatsoever it is Nec interrogant saith twenty five twenty three Fracastorius nec interrogatis recte respondent They do not much heed what you say their mind is on another matter ask what you will they do not attend or much intend that business they are about but forget themselves what they are saying doing or should otherwise say or do whither they are going distracted with their own melancholy thoughts One laughs upon a sudden another smiles to himself a third frowns calls his lips go still he acts with his hand as he walks c Tis proper to all melancholy men saith twenty five twenty four Mercurialis con eleven What conceit they have once entertained to be most intent violent and continually about it Invitas occurrit do what they may they cannot be rid of it against their wills they must think of it a thousand times over Perpetuo molestantur nec oblivisci possunt they are continually troubled with it in company out of company at meat at exercise at all times and places twenty five twenty five non desinunt ea quae minime volunt cogitare if it be offensive especially they cannot forget it they may not rest or sleep for it but still tormenting themselves Sysiphi saxum volvunt sibi ipsis as twenty five twenty six Brunner observes Perpetua calamitas et miserabile flagellum Bashfulness twenty five twenty seven Crato twenty five twenty eight Laurentius and Fernelius put bashfulness for an ordinary symptom sabrusticus pudor or vitiosus pudor is a thing which much haunts and torments them If they have been misused derided disgraced chidden c or by any perturbation of mind misaffected it so far troubles them that they become quite moped many times and so disheartened dejected they dare not come abroad into strange companies especially or manage their ordinary affairs so childish timorous and bashful they can look no man in the face some are more disquieted in this kind some less longer some others shorter by fits c though some on the other side according to twenty five twenty nine Fracastorius be inverecundi et pertinaces impudent and peevish But most part they are very shamefaced and that makes them with Pet Blesensis Christopher Urswick and many such to refuse honours offices and preferments which sometimes fall into their mouths they cannot speak or put forth themselves as others can timor hos pudor impedit illos timorousness and bashfulness hinder their proceedings they are contented with their present estate unwilling to undertake any office and therefore never likely to rise For that cause they seldom visit their friends except some familiars pauciloqui of few words and oftentimes wholly silent twenty five thirty Frambeserius a Frenchman had two such patients omnino taciturnos their friends could not get them to speak Rodericus a Fonseca consult tom two eighty five consil gives instance in a young man of twenty seven years of age that was frequently silent bashful moped solitary that would not eat his meat or sleep and yet again by fits apt to be angry c Solitariness Most part they are as Plater notes desides taciturni aegre impulsi nec nisi coacti procedunt c they will scarce be compelled to do that which concerns them though it be for their good so diffident so dull of small or no compliment unsociable hard to be acquainted with especially of strangers they had rather write their minds than speak and above all things love solitariness Ob voluptatem an ob timorem soli sunt Are they so solitary for pleasure one asks or pain for both yet I rather think for fear and sorrow c twenty five thirty one Hinc metuunt cupiuntque dolent fugiuntque nec auras Respiciunt clausi tenebris et carcere caeco Hence tis they grieve and fear avoiding light And shut themselves in prison dark from sight As Bellerophon in twenty five thirty two Homer Qui miser in sylvis moerens errabat opacis Ipse suum cor edens hominum vestigia vitans That wandered in the woods sad all alone Forsaking men s society making great moan They delight in floods and waters desert places to walk alone in orchards gardens private walks back lanes averse from company as Diogenes in his tub or Timon Misanthropus twenty five thirty three they abhor all companions at last even their nearest acquaintances and most familiar friends for they have a conceit I say every man observes them will deride laugh to scorn or misuse them confining themselves therefore wholly to their private houses or chambers fugiunt homines sine causa saith Rhasis et odio habent cont l one c nine they will diet themselves feed and live alone It was one of the chiefest reasons why the citizens of Abdera suspected Democritus to be melancholy and mad because that as Hippocrates related in his Epistle to Philopaemenes twenty five thirty four he forsook the city lived in groves and hollow trees upon a green bank by a brook side or confluence of waters all day long and all night Quae quidem saith he plurimum atra bile vexatis et melancholicis eveniunt deserta frequentant hominumque congressum aversantur twenty five thirty five which is an ordinary thing with melancholy men The Egyptians therefore in their hieroglyphics expressed a melancholy man by a hare sitting in her form as being a most timorous and solitary creature Pierius Hieroglyph l twelve But this and all precedent symptoms are more or less apparent as the humour is intended or remitted hardly perceived in some or not all most manifest in others Childish in some terrible in others to be derided in one pitied or admired in another to him by fits to a second continuate and howsoever these symptoms be common and incident to all persons yet they are the more remarkable frequent furious and violent in melancholy men To speak in a word there is nothing so vain absurd ridiculous extravagant impossible incredible so monstrous a chimera so prodigious and strange twenty five thirty six such as painters and poets durst not attempt which they will not really fear feign suspect and imagine unto themselves and that which twenty five thirty seven Lod Vives said in a jest of a silly country fellow that killed his ass for drinking up the moon ut lunam mundo redderet you may truly say of them in earnest they will act conceive all extremes contrarieties and contradictions and that in infinite varieties Melancholici plane incredibilia sibi persuadent ut vix omnibus saeculis duo reperti sint qui idem imaginati sint Erastus de Lamiis scarce two of two thousand that concur in the same symptoms The tower of Babel never yielded such confusion of tongues as the chaos of melancholy doth variety of symptoms There is in all melancholy similitudo dissimilis like men s faces a disagreeing likeness still and as in a river we swim in the same place though not in the same numerical water as the same instrument affords several lessons so the same disease yields diversity of symptoms Which howsoever they be diverse intricate and hard to be confined I will adventure yet in such a vast confusion and generality to bring them into some order and so descend to particulars SUBSECT III Particular Symptoms from the influence of Stars parts of the Body and Humours Some men have peculiar symptoms according to their temperament and crisis which they had from the stars and those celestial influences variety of wits and dispositions as Anthony Zara contends Anat ingen sect one memb eleven twelve thirteen fourteen plurimum irritant influentiae caelestes unde cientur animi aegritudines et morbi corporum twenty five thirty eight One saith diverse diseases of the body and mind proceed from their influences twenty five thirty nine as I have already proved out of Ptolemy Pontanus Lemnius Cardan and others as they are principal significators of manners diseases mutually irradiated or lords of the geniture c Ptolomeus in his centiloquy Hermes or whosoever else the author of that tract attributes all these symptoms which are in melancholy men to celestial influences which opinion Mercurialis de affect lib cap ten rejects but as I say twenty five forty Jovianus Pontanus and others stiffly defend That some are solitary dull heavy churlish some again blithe buxom light and merry they ascribe wholly to the stars As if Saturn be predominant in his nativity and cause melancholy in his temperature then twenty five forty one he shall be very austere sullen churlish black of colour profound in his cogitations full of cares miseries and discontents sad and fearful always silent solitary still delighting in husbandry in woods orchards gardens rivers ponds pools dark walks and close Cogitationes sunt velle aedificare velle arbores plantare agros colere c To catch birds fishes c still contriving and musing of such matters If Jupiter domineers they are more ambitious still meditating of kingdoms magistracies offices honours or that they are princes potentates and how they would carry themselves c If Mars they are all for wars brave combats monomachies testy choleric harebrain rash furious and violent in their actions They will feign themselves victors commanders are passionate and satirical in their speeches great braggers ruddy of colour And though they be poor in show vile and base yet like Telephus and Peleus in the twenty five forty two poet Ampullas jactant et sesquipedalia verba forget their swelling and gigantic words their mouths are full of myriads and tetrarchs at their tongues end If the sun they will be lords emperors in conceit at least and monarchs give offices honours c If Venus they are still courting of their mistresses and most apt to love amorously given they seem to hear music plays see fine pictures dancers merriments and the like Ever in love and dote on all they see Mercurialists are solitary much in contemplation subtle poets philosophers and musing most part about such matters If the moon have a hand they are all for peregrinations sea voyages much affected with travels to discourse read meditate of such things wandering in their thoughts diverse much delighting in waters to fish fowl c But the most immediate symptoms proceed from the temperature itself and the organical parts as head liver spleen mesaraic veins heart womb stomach c and most especially from distemperature of spirits which as twenty five forty three Hercules de Saxonia contends are wholly immaterial or from the four humours in those seats whether they be hot or cold natural unnatural innate or adventitious intended or remitted simple or mixed their diverse mixtures and several adustions combinations which may be as diversely varied as those twenty five forty four four first qualities in twenty five forty five Clavius and produce as many several symptoms and monstrous fictions as wine doth effect which as Andreas Bachius observes lib three de vino cap twenty are infinite Of greater note be these If it be natural melancholy as Lod Mercatus lib one cap seventeen de melan T Bright c sixteen hath largely described either of the spleen or of the veins faulty by excess of quantity or thickness of substance it is a cold and dry humour as Montanus affirms consil twenty six the parties are sad timorous and fearful Prosper Calenus in his book de atra bile will have them to be more stupid than ordinary cold heavy solitary sluggish Si multam atram bilem et frigidam habent Hercules de Saxonia c nineteen l seven twenty five forty six holds these that are naturally melancholy to be of a leaden colour or black and so doth Guianerius c three tract fifteen and such as think themselves dead many times or that they see talk with black men dead men spirits and goblins frequently if it be in excess These symptoms vary according to the mixture of those four humours adust which is unnatural melancholy For as Trallianus hath written cap sixteen l seven twenty five forty seven There is not one cause of this melancholy nor one humour which begets but divers diversely intermixed from whence proceeds this variety of symptoms and those varying again as they are hot or cold twenty five forty eight Cold melancholy saith Benedic Vittorius Faventinus pract mag is a cause of dotage and more mild symptoms if hot or more adust of more violent passions and furies Fracastorius l two de intellect will have us to consider well of it twenty five forty nine with what kind of melancholy every one is troubled for it much avails to know it one is enraged by fervent heat another is possessed by sad and cold one is fearful shamefaced the other impudent and bold as Ajax Arma rapit superosque furens inpraelia poscit quite mad or tending to madness Nunc hos nunc impetit illos Bellerophon on the other side solis errat male sanus in agris wanders alone in the woods one despairs weeps and is weary of his life another laughs c All which variety is produced from the several degrees of heat and cold which twenty five fifty Hercules de Saxonia will have wholly proceed from the distemperature of spirits alone animal especially and those immaterial the next and immediate causes of melancholy as they are hot cold dry moist and from their agitation proceeds that diversity of symptoms which he reckons up in the twenty five fifty one thirteenth chap of his Tract of Melancholy and that largely through every part Others will have them come from the diverse adustion of the four humours which in this unnatural melancholy by corruption of blood adust choler or melancholy natural twenty five fifty two by excessive distemper of heat turned in comparison of the natural into a sharp lye by force of adustion cause according to the diversity of their matter diverse and strange symptoms which T Bright reckons up in his following chapter So doth twenty five fifty three Arculanus according to the four principal humours adust and many others For example if it proceed from phlegm which is seldom and not so frequently as the rest twenty five fifty four it stirs up dull symptoms and a kind of stupidity or impassionate hurt they are sleepy saith twenty five fifty five Savanarola dull slow cold blockish ass like Asininam melancholiam twenty five fifty six Melancthon calls it they are much given to weeping and delight in waters ponds pools rivers fishing fowling c Arnoldus breviar one cap eighteen They are twenty five fifty seven pale of colour slothful apt to sleep heavy twenty five fifty eight much troubled with headache continual meditation and muttering to themselves they dream of waters twenty five fifty nine that they are in danger of drowning and fear such things Rhasis They are fatter than others that are melancholy of a muddy complexion apter to spit twenty five sixty sleep more troubled with rheum than the rest and have their eyes still fixed on the ground Such a patient had Hercules de Saxonia a widow in Venice that was fat and very sleepy still Christophorus a Vega another affected in the same sort If it be inveterate or violent the symptoms are more evident they plainly denote and are ridiculous to others in all their gestures actions speeches imagining impossibilities as he in Christophorus a Vega that thought he was a tun of wine twenty five sixty one and that Siennois that resolved within himself not to piss for fear he should drown all the town If it proceed from blood adust or that there be a mixture of blood in it twenty five sixty two such are commonly ruddy of complexion and high coloured according to Salust Salvianus and Hercules de Saxonia And as Savanarola Vittorius Faventinus Emper farther adds twenty five sixty three the veins of their eyes be red as well as their faces They are much inclined to laughter witty and merry conceited in discourse pleasant if they be not far gone much given to music dancing and to be in women s company They meditate wholly on such things and think twenty five sixty four they see or hear plays dancing and suchlike sports free from all fear and sorrow as twenty five sixty five Hercules de Saxonia supposeth If they be more strongly possessed with this kind of melancholy Arnoldus adds Breviar lib one cap eighteen Like him of Argos in the Poet that sate laughing twenty five sixty six all day long as if he had been at a theatre Such another is mentioned by twenty five sixty seven Aristotle living at Abydos a town of Asia Minor that would sit after the same fashion as if he had been upon a stage and sometimes act himself now clap his hands and laugh as if he had been well pleased with the sight Wolfius relates of a country fellow called Brunsellius subject to this humour twenty five sixty eight that being by chance at a sermon saw a woman fall off from a form half asleep at which object most of the company laughed but he for his part was so much moved that for three whole days after he did nothing but laugh by which means he was much weakened and worse a long time following Such a one was old Sophocles and Democritus himself had hilare delirium much in this vein Laurentius cap three de melan thinks this kind of melancholy which is a little adust with some mixture of blood to be that which Aristotle meant when he said melancholy men of all others are most witty which causeth many times a divine ravishment and a kind of enthusiasmus which stirreth them up to be excellent philosophers poets prophets c Mercurialis consil one hundred ten gives instance in a young man his patient sanguine melancholy twenty five sixty nine of a great wit and excellently learned If it arise from choler adust they are bold and impudent and of a more harebrain disposition apt to quarrel and think of such things battles combats and their manhood furious impatient in discourse stiff irrefragable and prodigious in their tenets and if they be moved most violent outrageous twenty five seventy ready to disgrace provoke any to kill themselves and others Arnoldus adds stark mad by fits twenty five seventy one they sleep little their urine is subtle and fiery Guianerius In their fits you shall hear them speak all manner of languages Hebrew Greek and Latin that never were taught or knew them before Apponensis in com in Pro sec thirty speaks of a mad woman that spake excellent good Latin and Rhasis knew another that could prophecy in her fit and foretell things truly to come twenty five seventy two Guianerius had a patient could make Latin verses when the moon was combust otherwise illiterate Avicenna and some of his adherents will have these symptoms when they happen to proceed from the devil and that they are rather demoniaci possessed than mad or melancholy or both together as Jason Pratensis thinks Immiscent se mali genii c but most ascribe it to the humour which opinion Montaltus cap twenty one stiffly maintains confuting Avicenna and the rest referring it wholly to the quality and disposition of the humour and subject Cardan de rerum var lib eight cap ten holds these men of all others fit to be assassins bold hardy fierce and adventurous to undertake anything by reason of their choler adust twenty five seventy three This humour saith he prepares them to endure death itself and all manner of torments with invincible courage and tis a wonder to see with what alacrity they will undergo such tortures ut supra naturam res videatur he ascribes this generosity fury or rather stupidity to this adustion of choler and melancholy but I take these rather to be mad or desperate than properly melancholy for commonly this humour so adust and hot degenerates into madness If it come from melancholy itself adust those men saith Avicenna twenty five seventy four are usually sad and solitary and that continually and in excess more than ordinarily suspicious more fearful and have long sore and most corrupt imaginations cold and black bashful and so solitary that as twenty five seventy five Arnoldus writes they will endure no company they dream of graves still and dead men and think themselves bewitched or dead if it be extreme they think they hear hideous noises see and talk twenty five seventy six with black men and converse familiarly with devils and such strange chimeras and visions Gordonius or that they are possessed by them that somebody talks to them or within them Tales melancholici plerumque daemoniaci Montaltus consil twenty six ex Avicenna Valescus de Taranta had such a woman in cure twenty five seventy seven that thought she had to do with the devil and Gentilis Fulgosus quaest fifty five writes that he had a melancholy friend that twenty five seventy eight had a black man in the likeness of a soldier still following him wheresoever he was Laurentius cap seven hath many stories of such as have thought themselves bewitched by their enemies and some that would eat no meat as being dead twenty five seventy nine Anno fifteen fifty an advocate of Paris fell into such a melancholy fit that he believed verily he was dead he could not be persuaded otherwise or to eat or drink till a kinsman of his a scholar of Bourges did eat before him dressed like a corse The story saith Serres was acted in a comedy before Charles the Ninth Some think they are beasts wolves hogs and cry like dogs foxes bray like asses and low like kine as King Praetus daughters twenty five eighty Hildesheim spicel two de mania hath an example of a Dutch baron so affected and Trincavelius lib one consil eleven another of a nobleman in his country twenty five eighty one that thought he was certainly a beast and would imitate most of their voices with many such symptoms which may properly be reduced to this kind If it proceed from the several combinations of these four humours or spirits Herc de Saxon adds hot cold dry moist dark confused settled constringed as it participates of matter or is without matter the symptoms are likewise mixed One thinks himself a giant another a dwarf One is heavy as lead another is as light as a feather Marcellus Donatus l two cap forty one makes mention out of Seneca of one Seneccio a rich man twenty five eighty two that thought himself and everything else he had great great wife great horses could not abide little things but would have great pots to drink in great hose and great shoes bigger than his feet Like her in twenty five eighty three Trallianus that supposed she could shake all the world with her finger and was afraid to clinch her hand together lest she should crush the world like an apple in pieces or him in Galen that thought he was twenty five eighty four Atlas and sustained heaven with his shoulders Another thinks himself so little that he can creep into a mouse hole one fears heaven will fall on his head a second is a cock and such a one twenty five eighty five Guianerius saith he saw at Padua that would clap his hands together and crow twenty five eighty six Another thinks he is a nightingale and therefore sings all the night long another he is all glass a pitcher and will therefore let nobody come near him and such a one twenty five eighty seven Laurentius gives out upon his credit that he knew in France Christophorus a Vega cap three lib fourteen Skenkius and Marcellus Donatus l two cap one have many such examples and one amongst the rest of a baker in Ferrara that thought he was composed of butter and durst not sit in the sun or come near the fire for fear of being melted of another that thought he was a case of leather stuffed with wind Some laugh weep some are mad some dejected moped in much agony some by fits others continuate c Some have a corrupt ear they think they hear music or some hideous noise as their phantasy conceives corrupt eyes some smelling some one sense some another twenty five eighty eight Lewis the Eleventh had a conceit everything did stink about him all the odoriferous perfumes they could get would not ease him but still he smelled a filthy stink A melancholy French poet in twenty five eighty nine Laurentius being sick of a fever and troubled with waking by his physicians was appointed to use unguentum populeum to anoint his temples but he so distasted the smell of it that for many years after all that came near him he imagined to scent of it and would let no man talk with him but aloof off or wear any new clothes because he thought still they smelled of it in all other things wise and discreet he would talk sensibly save only in this A gentleman in Limousin saith Anthony Verdeur was persuaded he had but one leg affrighted by a wild boar that by chance struck him on the leg he could not be satisfied his leg was sound in all other things well until two Franciscans by chance coming that way fully removed him from the conceit Sed abunde fabularum audivimus enough of story telling SUBSECT IV Symptoms from Education Custom continuance of Time our Condition mixed with other Diseases by Fits Inclination c Another great occasion of the variety of these symptoms proceeds from custom discipline education and several inclinations twenty five ninety this humour will imprint in melancholy men the objects most answerable to their condition of life and ordinary actions and dispose men according to their several studies and callings If an ambitious man become melancholy he forthwith thinks he is a king an emperor a monarch and walks alone pleasing himself with a vain hope of some future preferment or present as he supposeth and withal acts a lord s part takes upon him to be some statesman or magnifico makes conges gives entertainment looks big c Francisco Sansovino records of a melancholy man in Cremona that would not be induced to believe but that he was pope gave pardons made cardinals c twenty five ninety one Christophorus a Vega makes mention of another of his acquaintance that thought he was a king driven from his kingdom and was very anxious to recover his estate A covetous person is still conversant about purchasing of lands and tenements plotting in his mind how to compass such and such manors as if he were already lord of and able to go through with it all he sees is his re or spe he hath devoured it in hope or else in conceit esteems it his own like him in twenty five ninety two Athenaeus that thought all the ships in the haven to be his own A lascivious inamorato plots all the day long to please his mistress acts and struts and carries himself as if she were in presence still dreaming of her as Pamphilus of his Glycerium or as some do in their morning sleep twenty five ninety three Marcellus Donatus knew such a gentlewoman in Mantua called Elionora Meliorina that constantly believed she was married to a king and twenty five ninety four would kneel down and talk with him as if he had been there present with his associates and if she had found by chance a piece of glass in a muck hill or in the street she would say that it was a jewel sent from her lord and husband If devout and religious he is all for fasting prayer ceremonies alms interpretations visions prophecies revelations twenty five ninety five he is inspired by the Holy Ghost full of the spirit one while he is saved another while damned or still troubled in mind for his sins the devil will surely have him c more of these in the third partition of love melancholy twenty five ninety six A scholar s mind is busied about his studies he applauds himself for that he hath done or hopes to do one while fearing to be out in his next exercise another while contemning all censures envies one emulates another or else with indefatigable pains and meditation consumes himself So of the rest all which vary according to the more remiss and violent impression of the object or as the humour itself is intended or remitted For some are so gently melancholy that in all their carriage and to the outward apprehension of others it can hardly be discerned yet to them an intolerable burden and not to be endured twenty five ninety seven Quaedam occulta quaedam manifesta some signs are manifest and obvious to all at all times some to few or seldom or hardly perceived let them keep their own council none will take notice or suspect them They do not express in outward show their depraved imaginations as twenty five ninety eight Hercules de Saxonia observes but conceal them wholly to themselves and are very wise men as I have often seen some fear some do not fear at all as such as think themselves kings or dead some have more signs some fewer some great some less some vex fret still fear grieve lament suspect laugh sing weep chafe c by fits as I have said or more during and permanent Some dote in one thing are most childish and ridiculous and to be wondered at in that and yet for all other matters most discreet and wise To some it is in disposition to another in habit and as they write of heat and cold we may say of this humour one is melancholicus ad octo a second two degrees less a third halfway Tis superparticular sesquialtera sesquitertia and superbipartiens tertias quintas Melancholiae c all those geometrical proportions are too little to express it twenty five ninety nine It comes to many by fits and goes to others it is continuate many saith twenty six hundred Faventinus in spring and fall only are molested some once a year as that Roman twenty six oh one Galen speaks of twenty six oh two one at the conjunction of the moon alone or some unfortunate aspects at such and such set hours and times like the sea tides to some women when they be with child as twenty six oh three Plater notes never otherwise to others tis settled and fixed to one led about and variable still by that ignis fatuus of phantasy like an arthritis or running gout tis here and there and in every joint always molesting some part or other or if the body be free in a myriad of forms exercising the mind A second once peradventure in his life hath a most grievous fit once in seven years once in five years even to the extremity of madness death or dotage and that upon some feral accident or perturbation terrible object and for a time never perhaps so before never after A third is moved upon all such troublesome objects cross fortune disaster and violent passions otherwise free once troubled in three or four years A fourth if things be to his mind or he in action well pleased in good company is most jocund and of a good complexion if idle or alone a la mort or carried away wholly with pleasant dreams and phantasies but if once crossed and displeased Pectore concipiet nil nisi triste suo He will imagine naught save sadness in his heart his countenance is altered on a sudden his heart heavy irksome thoughts crucify his soul and in an instant he is moped or weary of his life he will kill himself A fifth complains in his youth a sixth in his middle age the last in his old age Generally thus much we may conclude of melancholy that it is twenty six oh four most pleasant at first I say mentis gratissimus error twenty six oh five a most delightsome humour to be alone dwell alone walk alone meditate lie in bed whole days dreaming awake as it were and frame a thousand fantastical imaginations unto themselves They are never better pleased than when they are so doing they are in paradise for the time and cannot well endure to be interrupt with him in the poet twenty six oh six pol me occidistis amici non servastis ait you have undone him he complains if you trouble him tell him what inconvenience will follow what will be the event all is one canis ad vomitum twenty six oh seven tis so pleasant he cannot refrain He may thus continue peradventure many years by reason of a strong temperature or some mixture of business which may divert his cogitations but at the last laesa imaginatio his phantasy is crazed and now habituated to such toys cannot but work still like a fate the scene alters upon a sudden fear and sorrow supplant those pleasing thoughts suspicion discontent and perpetual anxiety succeed in their places so by little and little by that shoeing horn of idleness and voluntary solitariness melancholy this feral fiend is drawn on twenty six oh eight et quantum vertice ad auras Aethereas tantum radice in Tartara tendit extending up by its branches so far towards Heaven as by its roots it does down towards Tartarus it was not so delicious at first as now it is bitter and harsh a cankered soul macerated with cares and discontents taedium vitae impatience agony inconstancy irresolution precipitate them unto unspeakable miseries They cannot endure company light or life itself some unfit for action and the like twenty six oh nine Their bodies are lean and dried up withered ugly their looks harsh very dull and their souls tormented as they are more or less entangled as the humour hath been intended or according to the continuance of time they have been troubled To discern all which symptoms the better twenty six ten Rhasis the Arabian makes three degrees of them The first is falsa cogitatio false conceits and idle thoughts to misconstrue and amplify aggravating everything they conceive or fear the second is falso cogitata loqui to talk to themselves or to use inarticulate incondite voices speeches obsolete gestures and plainly to utter their minds and conceits of their hearts by their words and actions as to laugh weep to be silent not to sleep eat their meat c the third is to put in practice twenty six eleven that which they think or speak Savanarola Rub eleven tract eight cap one de aegritudine confirms as much twenty six twelve when he begins to express that in words which he conceives in his heart or talks idly or goes from one thing to another which twenty six thirteen Gordonius calls nec caput habentia nec caudam having neither head nor tail he is in the middle way twenty six fourteen but when he begins to act it likewise and to put his fopperies in execution he is then in the extent of melancholy or madness itself This progress of melancholy you shall easily observe in them that have been so affected they go smiling to themselves at first at length they laugh out at first solitary at last they can endure no company or if they do they are now dizzards past sense and shame quite moped they care not what they say or do all their actions words gestures are furious or ridiculous At first his mind is troubled he doth not attend what is said if you tell him a tale he cries at last what said you but in the end he mutters to himself as old women do many times or old men when they sit alone upon a sudden they laugh whoop halloo or run away and swear they see or hear players twenty six fifteen devils hobgoblins ghosts strike or strut c grow humorous in the end like him in the poet saepe ducentos saepe decem servos at one time followed by two hundred servants at another only by ten he will dress himself and undress careless at last grows insensible stupid or mad twenty six sixteen He howls like a wolf barks like a dog and raves like Ajax and Orestes hears music and outcries which no man else hears As twenty six seventeen he did whom Amatus Lusitanus mentioneth cent three cura fifty five or that woman in twenty six eighteen Springer that spake many languages and said she was possessed that farmer in twenty six nineteen Prosper Calenius that disputed and discoursed learnedly in philosophy and astronomy with Alexander Achilles his master at Bologna in Italy But of these I have already spoken Who can sufficiently speak of these symptoms or prescribe rules to comprehend them as Echo to the painter in Ausonius vane quid affectas c foolish fellow what wilt if you must needs paint me paint a voice et similem si vis pingere pinge sonum if you will describe melancholy describe a fantastical conceit a corrupt imagination vain thoughts and different which who can do The four and twenty letters make no more variety of words in diverse languages than melancholy conceits produce diversity of symptoms in several persons They are irregular obscure various so infinite Proteus himself is not so diverse you may as well make the moon a new coat as a true character of a melancholy man as soon find the motion of a bird in the air as the heart of man a melancholy man They are so confused I say diverse intermixed with other diseases As the species be confounded which twenty six twenty I have showed so are the symptoms sometimes with headache cachexia dropsy stone as you may perceive by those several examples and illustrations collected by twenty six twenty one Hildesheim spicel two Mercurialis consil one hundred eighteen cap six and eleven with headache epilepsy priapismus Trincavelius consil twelve lib one consil forty nine with gout caninus appetitus Montanus consil twenty six c twenty three two hundred thirty four two hundred forty nine with falling sickness headache vertigo lycanthropia c J Caesar Claudinus consult four consult eighty nine and one hundred sixteen with gout agues haemorrhoids stone c who can distinguish these melancholy symptoms so intermixed with others or apply them to their several kinds confine them into method Tis hard I confess yet I have disposed of them as I could and will descend to particularise them according to their species For hitherto I have expatiated in more general lists or terms speaking promiscuously of such ordinary signs which occur amongst writers Not that they are all to be found in one man for that were to paint a monster or chimera not a man but some in one some in another and that successively or at several times Which I have been the more curious to express and report not to upbraid any miserable man or by way of derision I rather pity them but the better to discern to apply remedies unto them and to show that the best and soundest of us all is in great danger how much we ought to fear our own fickle estates remember our miseries and vanities examine and humiliate ourselves seek to God and call to Him for mercy that needs not look for any rods to scourge ourselves since we carry them in our bowels and that our souls are in a miserable captivity if the light of grace and heavenly truth doth not shine continually upon us and by our discretion to moderate ourselves to be more circumspect and wary in the midst of these dangers MEMB II SUBSECT I Symptoms of Head Melancholy If twenty six twenty two no symptoms appear about the stomach nor the blood be misaffected and fear and sorrow continue it is to be thought the brain itself is troubled by reason of a melancholy juice bred in it or otherwise conveyed into it and that evil juice is from the distemperature of the part or left after some inflammation thus far Piso But this is not always true for blood and hypochondries both are often affected even in head melancholy twenty six twenty three Hercules de Saxonia differs here from the common current of writers putting peculiar signs of head melancholy from the sole distemperature of spirits in the brain as they are hot cold dry moist all without matter from the motion alone and tenebrosity of spirits of melancholy which proceeds from humours by adustion he treats apart with their several symptoms and cures The common signs if it be by essence in the head are ruddiness of face high sanguine complexion most part rubore saturato twenty six twenty four one calls it a bluish and sometimes full of pimples with red eyes Avicenna l three Fen two Tract four c eighteen Duretus and others out of Galen de affect l three c six twenty six twenty five Hercules de Saxonia to this of redness of face adds heaviness of the head fixed and hollow eyes twenty six twenty six If it proceed from dryness of the brain then their heads will be light vertiginous and they most apt to wake and to continue whole months together without sleep Few excrements in their eyes and nostrils and often bald by reason of excess of dryness Montaltus adds c seventeen If it proceed from moisture dullness drowsiness headache follows and as Salust Salvianus c one l two out of his own experience found epileptical with a multitude of humours in the head They are very bashful if ruddy apt to blush and to be red upon all occasions praesertim si metus accesserit But the chiefest symptom to discern this species as I have said is this that there be no notable signs in the stomach hypochondries or elsewhere digna as twenty six twenty seven Montaltus terms them or of greater note because oftentimes the passions of the stomach concur with them Wind is common to all three species and is not excluded only that of the hypochondries is twenty six twenty eight more windy than the rest saith Hollerius Aetius tetrab l two sc two c nine and ten maintains the same twenty six twenty nine if there be more signs and more evident in the head than elsewhere the brain is primarily affected and prescribes head melancholy to be cured by meats amongst the rest void of wind and good juice not excluding wind or corrupt blood even in head melancholy itself but these species are often confounded and so are their symptoms as I have already proved The symptoms of the mind are superfluous and continual cogitations twenty six thirty for when the head is heated it scorcheth the blood and from thence proceed melancholy fumes which trouble the mind Avicenna They are very choleric and soon hot solitary sad often silent watchful discontent Montaltus cap twenty four If anything trouble them they cannot sleep but fret themselves still till another object mitigate or time wear it out They have grievous passions and immoderate perturbations of the mind fear sorrow c yet not so continuate but that they are sometimes merry apt to profuse laughter which is more to be wondered at and that by the authority of twenty six thirty one Galen himself by reason of mixture of blood praerubri jocosis delectantur et irrisores plerumque sunt if they be ruddy they are delighted in jests and oftentimes scoffers themselves conceited and as Rodericus a Vega comments on that place of Galen merry witty of a pleasant disposition and yet grievously melancholy anon after omnia discunt sine doctore saith Aretus they learn without a teacher and as twenty six thirty two Laurentius supposeth those feral passions and symptoms of such as think themselves glass pitchers feathers c speak strange languages a colore cerebri if it be in excess from the brain s distempered heat SUBSECT II Symptoms of windy Hypochondriacal Melancholy In this hypochondriacal or flatuous melancholy the symptoms are so ambiguous saith twenty six thirty three Crato in a counsel of his for a noblewoman that the most exquisite physicians cannot determine of the part affected Matthew Flaccius consulted about a noble matron confessed as much that in this malady he with Hollerius Fracastorius Falopius and others being to give their sentence of a party labouring of hypochondriacal melancholy could not find out by the symptoms which part was most especially affected some said the womb some heart some stomach c and therefore Crato consil twenty four lib one boldly avers that in this diversity of symptoms which commonly accompany this disease twenty six thirty four no physician can truly say what part is affected Galen lib three de loc affect reckons up these ordinary symptoms which all the Neoterics repeat of Diocles only this fault he finds with him that he puts not fear and sorrow amongst the other signs Trincavelius excuseth Diocles lib three consil thirty five because that oftentimes in a strong head and constitution a generous spirit and a valiant these symptoms appear not by reason of his valour and courage twenty six thirty five Hercules de Saxonia to whom I subscribe is of the same mind which I have before touched that fear and sorrow are not general symptoms some fear and are not sad some be sad and fear not some neither fear nor grieve The rest are these beside fear and sorrow twenty six thirty six sharp belchings fulsome crudities heat in the bowels wind and rumbling in the guts vehement gripings pain in the belly and stomach sometimes after meat that is hard of concoction much watering of the stomach and moist spittle cold sweat importunus sudor unseasonable sweat all over the body as Octavius Horatianus lib two cap five calls it cold joints indigestion twenty six thirty seven they cannot endure their own fulsome belchings continual wind about their hypochondries heat and griping in their bowels praecordia sursum convelluntur midriff and bowels are pulled up the veins about their eyes look red and swell from vapours and wind Their ears sing now and then vertigo and giddiness come by fits turbulent dreams dryness leanness apt they are to sweat upon all occasions of all colours and complexions Many of them are high coloured especially after meals which symptom Cardinal Caecius was much troubled with and of which he complained to Prosper Calenus his physician he could not eat or drink a cup of wine but he was as red in the face as if he had been at a mayor s feast That symptom alone vexeth many twenty six thirty eight Some again are black pale ruddy sometimes their shoulders and shoulder blades ache there is a leaping all over their bodies sudden trembling a palpitation of the heart and that cardiaca passio grief in the mouth of the stomach which maketh the patient think his heart itself acheth and sometimes suffocation difficultas anhelitus short breath hard wind strong pulse swooning Montanus consil fifty five Trincavelius lib three consil thirty six et thirty seven Fernelius cons forty three Frambesarius consult lib one consil seventeen Hildesheim Claudinus c give instance of every particular The peculiar symptoms which properly belong to each part be these If it proceed from the stomach saith twenty six thirty nine Savanarola tis full of pain wind Guianerius adds vertigo nausea much spitting c If from the mirach a swelling and wind in the hypochondries a loathing and appetite to vomit pulling upward If from the heart aching and trembling of it much heaviness If from the liver there is usually a pain in the right hypochondry If from the spleen hardness and grief in the left hypochondry a rumbling much appetite and small digestion Avicenna If from the mesaraic veins and liver on the other side little or no appetite Herc de Saxonia If from the hypochondries a rumbling inflation concoction is hindered often belching c And from these crudities windy vapours ascend up to the brain which trouble the imagination and cause fear sorrow dullness heaviness many terrible conceits and chimeras as Lemnius well observes l one c sixteen as twenty six forty a black and thick cloud covers the sun and intercepts his beams and light so doth this melancholy vapour obnubilate the mind enforce it to many absurd thoughts and imaginations and compel good wise honest discreet men arising to the brain from the twenty six forty one lower parts as smoke out of a chimney to dote speak and do that which becomes them not their persons callings wisdoms One by reason of those ascending vapours and gripings rumbling beneath will not be persuaded but that he hath a serpent in his guts a viper another frogs Trallianus relates a story of a woman that imagined she had swallowed an eel or a serpent and Felix Platerus observat lib one hath a most memorable example of a countryman of his that by chance falling into a pit where frogs and frogs spawn was and a little of that water swallowed began to suspect that he had likewise swallowed frogs spawn and with that conceit and fear his phantasy wrought so far that he verily thought he had young live frogs in his belly qui vivebant ex alimento suo that lived by his nourishment and was so certainly persuaded of it that for many years afterwards he could not be rectified in his conceit He studied physic seven years together to cure himself travelled into Italy France and Germany to confer with the best physicians about it and A D sixteen oh nine asked his counsel amongst the rest he told him it was wind his conceit c but mordicus contradicere et ore et scriptis probare nitebatur no saying would serve it was no wind but real frogs and do you not hear them croak Platerus would have deceived him by putting live frog s into his excrements but he being a physician himself would not be deceived vir prudens alias et doctus a wise and learned man otherwise a doctor of physic and after seven years dotage in this kind a phantasia liberatus est he was cured Laurentius and Goulart have many such examples if you be desirous to read them One commodity above the rest which are melancholy these windy flatuous have lucidia intervalla their symptoms and pains are not usually so continuate as the rest but come by fits fear and sorrow and the rest yet in another they exceed all others and that is twenty six forty two they are luxurious incontinent and prone to venery by reason of wind et facile amant et quamlibet fere amant Jason Pratensis twenty six forty three Rhasis is of opinion that Venus doth many of them much good the other symptoms of the mind be common with the rest SUBSECT III Symptoms of Melancholy abounding in the whole body Their bodies that are affected with this universal melancholy are most part black twenty six forty four the melancholy juice is redundant all over hirsute they are and lean they have broad veins their blood is gross and thick twenty six forty five Their spleen is weak and a liver apt to engender the humour they have kept bad diet or have had some evacuation stopped as haemorrhoids or months in women which twenty six forty six Trallianus in the cure would have carefully to be inquired and withal to observe of what complexion the party is of black or red For as Forrestus and Hollerius contend if twenty six forty seven they be black it proceeds from abundance of natural melancholy if it proceed from cares agony discontents diet exercise c they may be as well of any other colour red yellow pale as black and yet their whole blood corrupt praerubri colore saepe sunt tales saepe flavi saith twenty six forty eight Montaltus cap twenty two The best way to discern this species is to let them bleed if the blood be corrupt thick and black and they withal free from those hypochondriacal symptoms and not so grievously troubled with them or those of the head it argues they are melancholy a toto corpore The fumes which arise from this corrupt blood disturb the mind and make them fearful and sorrowful heavy hearted as the rest dejected discontented solitary silent weary of their lives dull and heavy or merry c and if far gone that which Apuleius wished to his enemy by way of imprecation is true in them twenty six forty nine Dead men s bones hobgoblins ghosts are ever in their minds and meet them still in every turn all the bugbears of the night and terrors fairy babes of tombs and graves are before their eyes and in their thoughts as to women and children if they be in the dark alone If they hear or read or see any tragical object it sticks by them they are afraid of death and yet weary of their lives in their discontented humours they quarrel with all the world bitterly inveigh tax satirically and because they cannot otherwise vent their passions or redress what is amiss as they mean they will by violent death at last be revenged on themselves SUBSECT IV Symptoms of Maids Nuns and Widows Melancholy Because Lodovicus Mercatus in his second book de mulier affect cap four and Rodericus a Castro de morb mulier cap three lib two two famous physicians in Spain Daniel Sennertus of Wittenberg lib one part two cap thirteen with others have vouchsafed in their works not long since published to write two just treatises de Melancholia virginum Monialium et Viduarum as a particular species of melancholy which I have already specified distinct from the rest twenty six fifty for it much differs from that which commonly befalls men and other women as having one only cause proper to women alone I may not omit in this general survey of melancholy symptoms to set down the particular signs of such parties so misaffected The causes are assigned out of Hippocrates Cleopatra Moschion and those old Gynaeciorum Scriptores of this feral malady in more ancient maids widows and barren women ob septum transversum violatum saith Mercatus by reason of the midriff or Diaphragma heart and brain offended with those vicious vapours which come from menstruous blood inflammationem arteriae circa dorsum Rodericus adds an inflammation of the back which with the rest is offended by twenty six fifty one that fuliginous exhalation of corrupt seed troubling the brain heart and mind the brain I say not in essence but by consent Universa enim hujus affectus causa ab utero pendet et a sanguinis menstrui malitia for in a word the whole malady proceeds from that inflammation putridity black smoky vapours c from thence comes care sorrow and anxiety obfuscation of spirits agony desperation and the like which are intended or remitted si amatorius accesserit ardor or any other violent object or perturbation of mind This melancholy may happen to widows with much care and sorrow as frequently it doth by reason of a sudden alteration of their accustomed course of life c To such as lie in childbed ob suppressam purgationem but to nuns and more ancient maids and some barren women for the causes abovesaid tis more familiar crebrius his quam reliquis accidit inquit Rodericus the rest are not altogether excluded Out of these causes Rodericus defines it with Areteus to be angorem animi a vexation of the mind a sudden sorrow from a small light or no occasion twenty six fifty two with a kind of still dotage and grief of some part or other head heart breasts sides back belly c with much solitariness weeping distraction c from which they are sometimes suddenly delivered because it comes and goes by fits and is not so permanent as other melancholy But to leave this brief description the most ordinary symptoms be these pulsatio juxta dorsum a beating about the back which is almost perpetual the skin is many times rough squalid especially as Areteus observes about the arms knees and knuckles The midriff and heart strings do burn and beat very fearfully and when this vapour or fume is stirred flieth upward the heart itself beats is sore grieved and faints fauces siccitate praecluduntur ut difficulter possit ab uteri strangulatione decerni like fits of the mother Alvus plerisque nil reddit aliis exiguum acre biliosum lotium flavum They complain many times saith Mercatus of a great pain in their heads about their hearts and hypochondries and so likewise in their breasts which are often sore sometimes ready to swoon their faces are inflamed and red they are dry thirsty suddenly hot much troubled with wind cannot sleep c And from hence proceed ferina deliramenta a brutish kind of dotage troublesome sleep terrible dreams in the night subrusticus pudor et verecundia ignava a foolish kind of bashfulness to some perverse conceits and opinions twenty six fifty three dejection of mind much discontent preposterous judgment They are apt to loath dislike disdain to be weary of every object c each thing almost is tedious to them they pine away void of counsel apt to weep and tremble timorous fearful sad and out of all hope of better fortunes They take delight in nothing for the time but love to be alone and solitary though that do them more harm and thus they are affected so long as this vapour lasteth but by and by as pleasant and merry as ever they were in their lives they sing discourse and laugh in any good company upon all occasions and so by fits it takes them now and then except the malady be inveterate and then tis more frequent vehement and continuate Many of them cannot tell how to express themselves in words or how it holds them what ails them you cannot understand them or well tell what to make of their sayings so far gone sometimes so stupefied and distracted they think themselves bewitched they are in despair aptae ad fletum desperationem dolores mammis et hypocondriis Mercatus therefore adds now their breasts now their hypochondries belly and sides then their heart and head aches now heat then wind now this now that offends they are weary of all twenty six fifty four and yet will not cannot again tell how where or what offends them though they be in great pain agony and frequently complain grieving sighing weeping and discontented still sine causa manifesta most part yet I say they will complain grudge lament and not be persuaded but that they are troubled with an evil spirit which is frequent in Germany saith Rodericus amongst the common sort and to such as are most grievously affected for he makes three degrees of this disease in women they are in despair surely forespoken or bewitched and in extremity of their dotage weary of their lives some of them will attempt to make away themselves Some think they see visions confer with spirits and devils they shall surely be damned are afraid of some treachery imminent danger and the like they will not speak make answer to any question but are almost distracted mad or stupid for the time and by fits and thus it holds them as they are more or less affected and as the inner humour is intended or remitted or by outward objects and perturbations aggravated solitariness idleness c Many other maladies there are incident to young women out of that one and only cause above specified many feral diseases I will not so much as mention their names melancholy alone is the subject of my present discourse from which I will not swerve The several cures of this infirmity concerning diet which must be very sparing phlebotomy physic internal external remedies are at large in great variety in twenty six fifty five Rodericus a Castro Sennertus and Mercatus which whoso will as occasion serves may make use of But the best and surest remedy of all is to see them well placed and married to good husbands in due time hinc illae lachrymae that is the primary cause and this the ready cure to give them content to their desires I write not this to patronise any wanton idle flirt lascivious or light housewives which are too forward many times unruly and apt to cast away themselves on him that comes next without all care counsel circumspection and judgment If religion good discipline honest education wholesome exhortation fair promises fame and loss of good name cannot inhibit and deter such which to chaste and sober maids cannot choose but avail much labour and exercise strict diet rigour and threats may more opportunely be used and are able of themselves to qualify and divert an ill disposed temperament For seldom should you see an hired servant a poor handmaid though ancient that is kept hard to her work and bodily labour a coarse country wench troubled in this kind but noble virgins nice gentlewomen such as are solitary and idle live at ease lead a life out of action and employment that fare well in great houses and jovial companies ill disposed peradventure of themselves and not willing to make any resistance discontented otherwise of weak judgment able bodies and subject to passions grandiores virgines saith Mercatus steriles et viduae plerumque melancholicae such for the most part are misaffected and prone to this disease I do not so much pity them that may otherwise be eased but those alone that out of a strong temperament innate constitution are violently carried away with this torrent of inward humours and though very modest of themselves sober religious virtuous and well given as many so distressed maids are yet cannot make resistance these grievances will appear this malady will take place and now manifestly show itself and may not otherwise be helped But where am I Into what subject have I rushed What have I to do with nuns maids virgins widows I am a bachelor myself and lead a monastic life in a college nae ego sane ineptus qui haec dixerim I confess tis an indecorum and as Pallas a virgin blushed when Jupiter by chance spake of love matters in her presence and turned away her face me reprimam though my subject necessarily require it I will say no more And yet I must and will say something more add a word or two in gratiam virginum et viduarum in favour of all such distressed parties in commiseration of their present estate And as I cannot choose but condole their mishap that labour of this infirmity and are destitute of help in this case so must I needs inveigh against them that are in fault more than manifest causes and as bitterly tax those tyrannising pseudopoliticians superstitious orders rash vows hard hearted parents guardians unnatural friends allies call them how you will those careless and stupid overseers that out of worldly respects covetousness supine negligence their own private ends cum sibi sit interim bene can so severely reject stubbornly neglect and impiously contemn without all remorse and pity the tears sighs groans and grievous miseries of such poor souls committed to their charge How odious and abominable are those superstitious and rash vows of Popish monasteries so to bind and enforce men and women to vow virginity to lead a single life against the laws of nature opposite to religion policy and humanity so to starve to offer violence to suppress the vigour of youth by rigorous statutes severe laws vain persuasions to debar them of that to which by their innate temperature they are so furiously inclined urgently carried and sometimes precipitated even irresistibly led to the prejudice of their soul s health and good estate of body and mind and all for base and private respects to maintain their gross superstition to enrich themselves and their territories as they falsely suppose by hindering some marriages that the world be not full of beggars and their parishes pestered with orphans stupid politicians haeccine fieri flagilia ought these things so to be carried better marry than burn saith the Apostle but they are otherwise persuaded They will by all means quench their neighbour s house if it be on fire but that fire of lust which breaks out into such lamentable flames they will not take notice of their own bowels oftentimes flesh and blood shall so rage and burn and they will not see it miserum est saith Austin seipsum non miserescere and they are miserable in the meantime that cannot pity themselves the common good of all and per consequens their own estates For let them but consider what fearful maladies feral diseases gross inconveniences come to both sexes by this enforced temperance it troubles me to think of much more to relate those frequent abortions and murdering of infants in their nunneries read twenty six fifty six Kemnisius and others and notorious fornications those Spintrias Tribadas Ambubeias c those rapes incests adulteries mastuprations sodomies buggeries of monks and friars See Bale s visitation of abbeys twenty six fifty seven Mercurialis Rodericus a Castro Peter Forestus and divers physicians I know their ordinary apologies and excuses for these things sed viderint Politici Medici Theologi I shall more opportunely meet with them twenty six fifty eight elsewhere twenty six fifty nine Illius viduae aut patronum Virginis hujus Ne me forte putes verbum non amplius addam MEMB III Immediate cause of these precedent Symptoms To give some satisfaction to melancholy men that are troubled with these symptoms a better means in my judgment cannot be taken than to show them the causes whence they proceed not from devils as they suppose or that they are bewitched or forsaken of God hear or see c as many of them think but from natural and inward causes that so knowing them they may better avoid the effects or at least endure them with more patience The most grievous and common symptoms are fear and sorrow and that without a cause to the wisest and discreetest men in this malady not to be avoided The reason why they are so Aetius discusseth at large Tetrabib two two in his first problem out of Galen lib two de causis sympt one For Galen imputeth all to the cold that is black and thinks that the spirits being darkened and the substance of the brain cloudy and dark all the objects thereof appear terrible and the twenty six sixty mind itself by those dark obscure gross fumes ascending from black humours is in continual darkness fear and sorrow divers terrible monstrous fictions in a thousand shapes and apparitions occur with violent passions by which the brain and fantasy are troubled and eclipsed twenty six sixty one Fracastorius lib two de intellect will have cold to be the cause of fear and sorrow for such as are cold are ill disposed to mirth dull and heavy by nature solitary silent and not for any inward darkness as physicians think for many melancholy men dare boldly be continue and walk in the dark and delight in it solum frigidi timidi if they be hot they are merry and the more hot the more furious and void of fear as we see in madmen but this reason holds not for then no melancholy proceeding from choler adust should fear twenty six sixty two Averroes scoffs at Galen for his reasons and brings five arguments to repel them so doth Herc de Saxonia Tract de Melanch cap three assigning other causes which are copiously censured and confuted by Aelianus Montaltus cap five and six Lod Mercatus de Inter morb cur lib one cap seventeen Altomarus cap seven de mel Guianerius tract fifteen c one Bright cap thirty seven Laurentius cap five Valesius med cont lib five con one twenty six sixty three Distemperature they conclude makes black juice blackness obscures the spirits the spirits obscured cause fear and sorrow Laurentius cap thirteen supposeth these black fumes offend specially the diaphragma or midriff and so per consequens the mind which is obscured as twenty six sixty four the sun by a cloud To this opinion of Galen almost all the Greeks and Arabians subscribe the Latins new and old internae tenebrae offuscant animum ut externae nocent pueris as children are affrighted in the dark so are melancholy men at all times twenty six sixty five as having the inward cause with them and still carrying it about Which black vapours whether they proceed from the black blood about the heart as T W Jes thinks in his treatise of the passions of the mind or stomach spleen midriff or all the misaffected parts together it boots not they keep the mind in a perpetual dungeon and oppress it with continual fears anxieties sorrows c It is an ordinary thing for such as are sound to laugh at this dejected pusillanimity and those other symptoms of melancholy to make themselves merry with them and to wonder at such as toys and trifles which may be resisted and withstood if they will themselves but let him that so wonders consider with himself that if a man should tell him on a sudden some of his especial friends were dead could he choose but grieve Or set him upon a steep rock where he should be in danger to be precipitated could he be secure His heart would tremble for fear and his head be giddy P Byaras Tract de pest gives instance as I have said twenty six sixty six and put case saith he in one that walks upon a plank if it lie on the ground he can safely do it but if the same plank be laid over some deep water instead of a bridge he is vehemently moved and tis nothing but his imagination forma cadendi impressa to which his other members and faculties obey Yea but you infer that such men have a just cause to fear a true object of fear so have melancholy men an inward cause a perpetual fume and darkness causing fear grief suspicion which they carry with them an object which cannot be removed but sticks as close and is as inseparable as a shadow to a body and who can expel or overrun his shadow Remove heat of the liver a cold stomach weak spleen remove those adust humours and vapours arising from them black blood from the heart all outward perturbations take away the cause and then bid them not grieve nor fear or be heavy dull lumpish otherwise counsel can do little good you may as well bid him that is sick of an ague not to be a dry or him that is wounded not to feel pain Suspicion follows fear and sorrow at heels arising out of the same fountain so thinks twenty six sixty seven Fracastorius that fear is the cause of suspicion and still they suspect some treachery or some secret machination to be framed against them still they distrust Restlessness proceeds from the same spring variety of fumes make them like and dislike Solitariness avoiding of light that they are weary of their lives hate the world arise from the same causes for their spirits and humours are opposite to light fear makes them avoid company and absent themselves lest they should be misused hissed at or overshoot themselves which still they suspect They are prone to venery by reason of wind Angry waspish and fretting still out of abundance of choler which causeth fearful dreams and violent perturbations to them both sleeping and waking That they suppose they have no heads fly sink they are pots glasses c is wind in their heads twenty six sixty eight Herc de Saxonia doth ascribe this to the several motions in the animal spirits their dilation contraction confusion alteration tenebrosity hot or cold distemperature excluding all material humours twenty six sixty nine Fracastorius accounts it a thing worthy of inquisition why they should entertain such false conceits as that they have horns great noses that they are birds beasts c why they should think themselves kings lords cardinals For the first twenty six seventy Fracastorius gives two reasons One is the disposition of the body the other the occasion of the fantasy as if their eyes be purblind their ears sing by reason of some cold and rheum c To the second Laurentius answers the imagination inwardly or outwardly moved represents to the understanding not enticements only to favour the passion or dislike but a very intensive pleasure follows the passion or displeasure and the will and reason are captivated by delighting in it Why students and lovers are so often melancholy and mad the philosopher of twenty six seventy one Conimbra assigns this reason because by a vehement and continual meditation of that wherewith they are affected they fetch up the spirits into the brain and with the heat brought with them they incend it beyond measure and the cells of the inner senses dissolve their temperature which being dissolved they cannot perform their offices as they ought Why melancholy men are witty which Aristotle hath long since maintained in his problems and that twenty six seventy two all learned men famous philosophers and lawgivers ad unum fere omnes melancholici have still been melancholy is a problem much controverted Jason Pratensis will have it understood of natural melancholy which opinion Melancthon inclines to in his book de Anima and Marcilius Ficinus de san tuend lib one cap five but not simple for that makes men stupid heavy dull being cold and dry fearful fools and solitary but mixed with the other humours phlegm only excepted and they not adust twenty six seventy three but so mixed as that blood he half with little or no adustion that they be neither too hot nor too cold Aponensis cited by Melancthon thinks it proceeds from melancholy adust excluding all natural melancholy as too cold Laurentius condemns his tenet because adustion of humours makes men mad as lime burns when water is cast on it It must be mixed with blood and somewhat adust and so that old aphorism of Aristotle may be verified Nullum magnum ingenium sine mixtura dementiae no excellent wit without a mixture of madness Fracastorius shall decide the controversy twenty six seventy four phlegmatic are dull sanguine lively pleasant acceptable and merry but not witty choleric are too swift in motion and furious impatient of contemplation deceitful wits melancholy men have the most excellent wits but not all this humour may be hot or cold thick or thin if too hot they are furious and mad if too cold dull stupid timorous and sad if temperate excellent rather inclining to that extreme of heat than cold This sentence of his will agree with that of Heraclitus a dry light makes a wise mind temperate heat and dryness are the chief causes of a good wit therefore saith Aelian an elephant is the wisest of all brute beasts because

may dissuade her from such affections twenty six eighty three Bashfulness and blushing is a passion proper to men alone and is not only caused for twenty six eighty four some shame and ignominy or that they are guilty unto themselves of some foul fact committed but as twenty six eighty five Fracastorius well determines ob defectum proprium et timorem from fear and a conceit of our defects the face labours and is troubled at his presence that sees our defects and nature willing to help sends thither heat heat draws the subtlest blood and so we blush They that are bold arrogant and careless seldom or never blush but such as are fearful Anthonius Lodovicus in his book de pudore will have this subtle blood to arise in the face not so much for the reverence of our betters in presence twenty six eighty six but for joy and pleasure or if anything at unawares shall pass from us a sudden accident occurse or meeting which Disarius in twenty six eighty seven Macrobius confirms any object heard or seen for blind men never blush as Dandinus observes the night and darkness make men impudent Or that we be staid before our betters or in company we like not or if anything molest and offend us erubescentia turns to rubor blushing to a continuate redness twenty six eighty eight Sometimes the extremity of the ears tingle and are red sometimes the whole face Etsi nihil vitiosum commiseris as Lodovicus holds though Aristotle is of opinion omnis pudor ex vitio commisso all shame for some offence But we find otherwise it may as well proceed twenty six eighty nine from fear from force and inexperience so twenty six ninety Dandinus holds as vice a hot liver saith Duretus notis in Hollerium from a hot brain from wind the lungs heated or after drinking of wine strong drink perturbations c Laughter what it is saith twenty six ninety one Tully how caused where and so suddenly breaks out that desirous to stay it we cannot how it comes to possess and stir our face veins eyes countenance mouth sides let Democritus determine The cause that it often affects melancholy men so much is given by Gomesius lib three de sale genial cap eighteen abundance of pleasant vapours which in sanguine melancholy especially break from the heart twenty six ninety two and tickle the midriff because it is transverse and full of nerves by which titillation the sense being moved and arteries distended or pulled the spirits from thence move and possess the sides veins countenance eyes See more in Jossius de risu et fletu Vives three de Anima Tears as Scaliger defines proceed from grief and pity twenty six ninety three or from the heating of a moist brain for a dry cannot weep That they see and hear so many phantasms chimeras noises visions c as Fienus hath discoursed at large in his book of imagination and twenty six ninety four Lavater de spectris part one cap two three four their corrupt phantasy makes them see and hear that which indeed is neither heard nor seen Qui multum jejunant aut noctes ducunt insomnes they that much fast or want sleep as melancholy or sick men commonly do see visions or such as are weak sighted very timorous by nature mad distracted or earnestly seek Sabini quod volunt somniant as the saying is they dream of that they desire Like Sarmiento the Spaniard who when he was sent to discover the straits of Magellan and confine places by the Prorex of Peru standing on the top of a hill Amaenissimam planitiem despicere sibi visus fuit aedificia magnifica quamplurimos Pagos alias Turres splendida Templa and brave cities built like ours in Europe not saith mine twenty six ninety five author that there was any such thing but that he was vanissimus et nimis credulus and would fain have had it so Or as twenty six ninety six Lod Mercatus proves by reason of inward vapours and humours from blood choler c diversely mixed they apprehend and see outwardly as they suppose divers images which indeed are not As they that drink wine think all runs round when it is in their own brain so is it with these men the fault and cause is inward as Galen affirms twenty six ninety seven mad men and such as are near death quas extra se videre putant Imagines intra oculos habent tis in their brain which seems to be before them the brain as a concave glass reflects solid bodies Senes etiam decrepiti cerebrum habent concavum et aridum ut imaginentur

to be red corrupt vapours mounting from the body to the head and distilling again from thence to the eyes when they have mingled themselves with the watery crystal which receiveth the shadows of things to be seen make all things appear of the same colour which remains in the humour that overspreads our sight as to melancholy men all is black to phlegmatic all white c Or else as before the organs corrupt by a corrupt phantasy as Lemnius lib one cap sixteen well quotes twenty six ninety nine cause a great agitation of spirits and humours which wander to and fro in all the creeks of the brain and cause such apparitions before their eyes One thinks he reads something written in the moon as Pythagoras is said to have done of old another smells brimstone hears Cerberus bark Orestes now

Albategnius that noble Arabian on his death bed saw a ship ascending and descending which Fracastorius records of his friend Baptista Tirrianus Weak sight and a vain persuasion withal may effect as much and second causes concurring as an oar in water makes a refraction and seems bigger bended double c The thickness of the air may cause such effects or any object not well discerned in the dark fear and phantasy will suspect to be a ghost a devil c twenty seven oh two Quod nimis miseri timent hoc facile credunt we are apt to believe and mistake in such cases Marcellus Donatus lib two cap one

acquaintance of his that after the want of three or four nights sleep as he was riding by a river side saw another riding with him and using all such gestures as he did but when more light appeared it vanished Eremites and anchorites have frequently such absurd visions revelations by reason of much fasting and bad diet many are deceived by legerdemain as Scot hath well showed in his book of the discovery of witchcraft and Cardan subtil eighteen suffites perfumes suffumigations mixed candles perspective glasses and such natural causes make men look as if they were dead or with horse heads bull s horns and such like brutish shapes the room full of snakes adders dark light green red of all colours as you may perceive in Baptista Porta Alexis Albertus and others glow worms fire drakes meteors Ignis fatuus which Plinius lib two cap thirty seven calls Castor and Pollux with many such that appear in moorish grounds about churchyards moist valleys or where battles have been fought the causes of which read in Goclenius Velouris Fickius c such fears are often done to frighten children with squibs rotten wood c to make folks look as if they were dead twenty seven oh three solito majores bigger lesser fairer fouler ut astantes sine capitibus videantur aut toti igniti aut forma daemonum accipe pilos canis nigri c saith Albertus and so tis ordinary to see strange uncouth sights by catoptrics who knows not that if in a dark room the light be admitted at one only little hole and a paper or glass put upon it the sun shining will represent on the opposite wall all such objects as are illuminated by his rays with concave and cylinder glasses we may reflect any shape of men devils antics as magicians most part do to gull a silly spectator in a dark room we will ourselves and that hanging in the air when tis nothing but such an horrible image as twenty seven oh four Agrippa demonstrates placed in another room Roger Bacon of old is said to have represented his own image walking in the air by this art though no such thing appear in his perspectives But most part it is in the brain that deceives them although I may not deny but that oftentimes the devil deludes them takes his opportunity to suggest and represent vain objects to melancholy men and such as are ill affected To these you may add the knavish impostures of jugglers exorcists mass priests and mountebanks of whom Roger Bacon speaks c de miraculis naturae et artis cap one twenty seven oh five they can counterfeit the voices of all birds and brute beasts almost all tones and tunes of men and speak within their throats as if they spoke afar off that they make their auditors believe they hear spirits and are thence much astonished and affrighted with it Besides those artificial devices to overhear their confessions like that whispering place of Gloucester twenty seven oh six with us or like the duke s place at Mantua in Italy where the sound is reverberated by a concave wall a reason of which Blancanus in his Echometria gives and mathematically demonstrates So that the hearing is as frequently deluded as the sight from the same causes almost as he that hears bells will make them sound what he list As the fool thinketh so the bell clinketh Theophilus in Galen thought he heard music from vapours which made his ears sound c Some are deceived by echoes some by roaring of waters or concaves and reverberation of air in the ground hollow places and walls twenty seven oh seven At Cadurcum in Aquitaine words and sentences are repeated by a strange echo to the full or whatsoever you shall play upon a musical instrument more distinctly and louder than they are spoken at first Some echoes repeat a thing spoken seven times as at Olympus in Macedonia as Pliny relates lib thirty six cap fifteen Some twelve times as at Charenton a village near Paris in France At Delphos in Greece heretofore was a miraculous echo and so in many other places Cardan subtil l eighteen hath wonderful stories of such as have been deluded by these echoes Blancanus the Jesuit in his Echometria hath variety of examples and gives his reader full satisfaction of all such sounds by way of demonstration twenty seven oh eight At Barrey an isle in the Severn mouth they seem to hear a smith s forge so at Lipari and those sulphureous isles and many such like which Olaus speaks of in the continent of Scandia and those northern countries Cardan de rerum var l fifteen c eighty four mentioneth a woman that still supposed she heard the devil call her and speaking to her she was a painter s wife in Milan and many such illusions and voices which proceed most part from a corrupt imagination Whence it comes to pass that they prophesy speak several languages talk of astronomy and other unknown sciences to them of which they have been ever ignorant twenty seven oh nine I have in brief touched only this I will here add that Arculanus Bodin lib three cap six daemon and some others twenty seven ten hold as a manifest token that such persons are possessed with the devil so doth twenty seven eleven Hercules de Saxonia and Apponensis and fit only to be cured by a priest But twenty seven twelve Guianerius twenty seven thirteen Montaltus Pomporiatius of Padua and Lemnius lib two cap two refer it wholly to the ill disposition of the twenty seven fourteen humour and that out of the authority of Aristotle prob thirty one because such symptoms are cured by purging and as by the striking of a flint fire is enforced so by the vehement motion of spirits they do elicere voces inauditas compel strange speeches to be spoken another argument he hath from Plato s reminiscentia which all out as likely as that which twenty seven fifteen Marsilius Ficinus speaks of his friend Pierleonus by a divine kind of infusion he understood the secrets of nature and tenets of Grecian and barbarian philosophers before ever he heard of saw or read their works but in this I should rather hold with Avicenna and his associates that such symptoms proceed from evil spirits which take all opportunities of humours decayed or otherwise to pervert the soul of man and besides the humour itself is balneum diaboli the devil s bath and as Agrippa proves doth entice him to seize upon them SECT IV MEMB I Prognostics of Melancholy Prognostics or signs of things to come are either good or bad If this malady be not hereditary and taken at the beginning there is good hope of cure recens curationem non habet difficilem saith Avicenna l three Fen one Tract four c eighteen That which is with laughter of all others is most secure gentle and remiss Hercules de Saxonia twenty seven sixteen If that evacuation of haemorrhoids or varices which they call the water between the skin shall happen to a melancholy man his misery is ended Hippocrates Aphor six eleven Galen l six de morbis vulgar com eight confirms the same and to this aphorism of Hippocrates all the Arabians new and old Latins subscribe Montaltus c twenty five Hercules de Saxonia Mercurialis Vittorius Faventinus c Skenkius l one observat med c de Mania illustrates this aphorism with an example of one Daniel Federer a coppersmith that was long melancholy and in the end mad about the twenty seventh year of his age these varices or water began to arise in his thighs and he was freed from his madness Marius the Roman was so cured some say though with great pain Skenkius hath some other instances of women that have been helped by flowing of their mouths which before were stopped That the opening of the haemorrhoids will do as much for men all physicians jointly signify so they be voluntary some say and not by compulsion All melancholy are better after a quartan twenty seven seventeen Jobertus saith scarce any man hath that ague twice but whether it free him from this malady tis a question for many physicians ascribe all long agues for especial causes and a quartan ague amongst the rest twenty seven eighteen Rhasis cont lib one tract nine When melancholy gets out at the superficies of the skin or settles breaking out in scabs leprosy morphew or is purged by stools or by the urine or that the spleen is enlarged and those varices appear the disease is dissolved Guianerius cap five tract fifteen adds dropsy jaundice dysentery leprosy as good signs to these scabs morphews and breaking out and proves it out of the sixth of Hippocrates Aphorisms Evil prognostics on the other part Inveterata melancholia incurabilis if it be inveterate it is twenty seven nineteen incurable a common axiom aut difficulter curabilis as they say that make the best hardly cured This Galen witnesseth l three de loc affect cap six twenty seven twenty be it in whom it will or from what cause soever it is ever long wayward tedious and hard to be cured if once it be habituated As Lucian said of the gout she was twenty seven twenty one the queen of diseases and inexorable may we say of melancholy Yet Paracelsus will have all diseases whatsoever curable and laughs at them which think otherwise as T Erastus par three objects to him although in another place hereditary diseases he accounts incurable and by no art to be removed twenty seven twenty two Hildesheim spicel two de mel holds it less dangerous if only twenty seven twenty three imagination be hurt and not reason twenty seven twenty four the gentlest is from blood Worse from choler adust but the worst of all from melancholy putrefied twenty seven twenty five Bruel esteems hypochondriacal least dangerous and the other two species opposite to Galen hardest to be cured twenty seven twenty six The cure is hard in man but much more difficult in women And both men and women must take notice of that saying of Montanus consil two hundred thirty pro Abate Italo twenty seven twenty seven This malady doth commonly accompany them to their grave physicians may ease and it may lie hid for a time but they cannot quite cure it but it will return again more violent and sharp than at first and that upon every small occasion or error as in Mercury s weather beaten statue that was once all over gilt the open parts were clean yet there was in fimbriis aurum in the chinks a remnant of gold there will be some relics of melancholy left in the purest bodies if once tainted not so easily to be rooted out twenty seven twenty eight Oftentimes it degenerates into epilepsy apoplexy convulsions and blindness by the authority of Hippocrates and Galen twenty seven twenty nine all aver if once it possess the ventricles of the brain Frambesarius and Salust Salvianus adds if it get into the optic nerves blindness Mercurialis consil twenty had a woman to his patient that from melancholy became epileptic and blind twenty seven

heat and increase that is the common event twenty seven thirty three per circuitus aut semper insanit he is mad by fits or altogether For as twenty seven thirty four Sennertus contends out of Crato there is seminarius ignis in this humour the very seeds of fire If it come from melancholy natural adust and in excess they are often demoniacal Montanus twenty seven thirty five Seldom this malady procures death except which is the greatest most grievous calamity and the misery of all miseries they make away themselves which is a frequent thing and familiar amongst them Tis twenty seven thirty

Rabbi Moses Aphorism the prognosticon of Avicenna Rhasis Aetius Gordonius Valescus Altomarus Salust Salvianus Capivaccius Mercatus Hercules de Saxonia Piso Bruel Fuchsius all c twenty seven thirty

and hates the light To make an end of fear and grief of heart He voluntary dies to ease his smart In such sort doth the torture and extremity of his misery torment him that he can take no pleasure in his life but is in a manner enforced to offer violence unto himself to be freed from his present insufferable pains So some saith twenty seven thirty nine Fracastorius in fury but most in despair sorrow fear and out of the anguish and vexation of their souls offer violence to themselves for their life is unhappy and miserable They can take no rest in the night nor sleep or if they do slumber fearful dreams astonish them In the daytime they are affrighted still by some terrible object and torn in pieces with suspicion fear sorrow discontents cares shame anguish c as so many wild horses that they cannot be quiet an hour a minute of time but even against their wills they are intent and still thinking of it they cannot forget it it grinds their souls day and night they are perpetually tormented a burden to themselves as Job was they can neither eat drink or sleep Psal cvii eighteen Their soul abhorreth all meat and they are brought to death s door twenty seven forty being bound in misery and iron they twenty seven forty one curse their stars with Job twenty seven forty two and day of their birth and wish for death for as Pineda and most interpreters hold Job was even melancholy to despair and almost twenty seven forty three madness itself they murmur many times against the world friends allies all mankind even against God himself in the bitterness of their passion twenty seven forty four vivere nolunt mori nesciunt live they will not die they cannot And in the midst of these squalid ugly and such irksome days they seek at last finding no comfort twenty seven forty

putant saith twenty seven forty six Hippocrates vel quia putant inde se majoribus malis liberari to be freed as they wish Though many times as Aesop s fishes they leap from the frying pan into the fire itself yet they hope to be eased by this means and therefore saith Felix twenty seven forty seven Platerus after many tedious days at last either by drowning hanging or some such fearful end they precipitate or make away themselves many lamentable examples are daily seen amongst us alius ante fores se laqueo suspendit as Seneca notes alius se praecipitavit a tecto ne dominum stomachantem audiret alius ne reduceretur a fuga ferrum redegit in viscera one hangs himself before his own door another throws himself from the house top to avoid his master s anger a third to escape expulsion

they are condemned to a violent death by a jury of physicians furiously disposed carried headlong by their tyrannising wills enforced by miseries and there remains no more to such persons if that heavenly Physician by his assisting grace and mercy alone do not prevent for no human persuasion or art can help but to be their own butchers and execute themselves Socrates his cicuta Lucretia s dagger Timon s halter are yet to be had Cato s knife and Nero s sword are left behind them as so many fatal engines bequeathed to posterity and will be used to the world s end by such distressed souls so intolerable insufferable grievous and violent is their pain twenty seven forty nine so unspeakable and continuate One day of grief is an hundred years as Cardan observes Tis carnificina hominum angor animi as well saith Areteus a plague of the soul the cramp and convulsion of the soul an epitome of hell and if there be a hell upon earth it is to be found in a melancholy man s heart For that deep torture may be call d an hell When more is felt than one hath power to tell Yea that which scoffing Lucian said of the gout in jest I may truly affirm of melancholy in earnest twenty seven fifty

in other diseases there is some hope likely but these unhappy men are born to misery past all hope of recovery incurably sick the longer they live the worse they are and death alone must ease them Another doubt is made by some philosophers whether it be lawful for a man in such extremity of pain and grief to make away himself and how these men that so do are to be censured The Platonists approve of it that it is lawful in such cases and upon a necessity Plotinus l de beatitud c seven and Socrates himself defends it in Plato s Phaedon if any man labour of an incurable disease he may

may seem to be a continuate inexorable disease hard to be cured accompanying them to their graves most part as twenty seven eighty nine Montanus observes yet many times it may be helped even that which is most violent or at least according to the same twenty seven ninety author it may be mitigated and much eased Nil desperandum It may be hard to cure but not impossible for him that is most grievously affected if he but willing to be helped Upon this good hope I will proceed using the same method in the cure which I have formerly used in the rehearsing of the causes first general then particular and those according to their several species Of these cures some be lawful some again unlawful which though frequent familiar and often used yet justly censured and to be controverted As first whether by these diabolical means which are commonly practised by the devil and his ministers sorcerers witches magicians c by spells cabilistical words charms characters images amulets ligatures philters incantations c this disease and the like may be cured and if they may whether it be lawful to make use of them those magnetical cures or for our good to seek after such means in any case The first whether they can do any such cures is questioned amongst many writers some affirming some denying Valesius cont med lib five cap six Malleus Maleficar Heurnius lib three pract med cap twenty eight Caelius lib sixteen c sixteen Delrio Tom three Wierus lib two de praestig daem Libanius Lavater de spect part two cap seven Holbrenner the Lutheran in Pistorium Polydore Virg l one de prodig Tandlerus Lemnius Hippocrates and Avicenna amongst the rest deny that spirits or devils have any power over us and refer all with Pomponatius of Padua to natural causes and humours Of the other opinion are Bodinus Daemonamantiae lib three cap two Arnoldus Marcellus Empyricus I Pistorius Paracelsus Apodix Magic Agrippa lib two de occult Philos cap thirty six sixty nine seventy one seventy two

works old Hermes Artefius Costaben Luca Picatrix c that such cures may be done They can make fire it shall not burn fetch back thieves or stolen goods show their absent faces in a glass make serpents lie still stanch blood salve gouts epilepsies biting of mad dogs toothache melancholy et omnia mundi mala make men immortal young again as the twenty seven ninety one Spanish marquis is said to have done by one of his slaves and some which jugglers in twenty seven ninety two China maintain still as Tragaltius writes that they can do by their extraordinary skill in physic and some of our modern chemists by their strange limbecks by their spells philosopher s stones and charms twenty seven ninety three Many doubt saith Nicholas Taurellus whether the devil can cure such diseases he hath not made and some flatly deny it howsoever common experience confirms to our astonishment that magicians can work such feats and that the devil without impediment can penetrate through all the parts of our bodies and cure such maladies by means to us unknown Daneus in his tract de Sortiariis subscribes to this of Taurellus Erastus de lamiis maintaineth as much and so do most divines out of their excellent knowledge and long experience they can commit twenty seven ninety four agentes cum patientibus colligere semina rerum eaque materiae applicare as Austin infers de Civ Dei et de Trinit lib three cap seven et eight they can work stupendous and admirable conclusions we see the effects only but not the causes of them Nothing so familiar as to hear of such cures Sorcerers are too common cunning men wizards and white witches as they call them in every village which if they be sought unto will help almost all infirmities of body and mind Servatores in Latin and they have commonly saint Catherine s wheel printed in the roof of their mouth or in some other part about them resistunt incantatorum praestigiis twenty seven ninety five Boissardus writes morbos a sagis motos propulsant c that to doubt of it any longer twenty seven ninety six or not to believe were to run into that other sceptical extreme of incredulity saith Taurellus Leo Suavius in his comment upon Paracelsus seems to make it an art which ought to be approved Pistorius and others stiffly maintain the use of charms words characters c Ars vera est sed pauci artifices reperiuntur the art is true but there be but a few that have skill in it Marcellius Donatus lib two de hist mir cap one proves out of Josephus eight books of antiquities that twenty seven ninety seven Solomon so cured all the diseases of the mind by spells charms and drove away devils and that Eleazer did as much before Vespasian Langius in his med epist holds Jupiter Menecrates that did so many stupendous cures in his time to have used this art and that he was no other than a magician Many famous cures are daily done in this kind the devil is an expert physician as Godelman calls him lib one cap eighteen and God permits oftentimes these witches and magicians to produce such effects as Lavater cap three lib eight part three cap one Polid Virg lib one de prodigiis Delrio and others admit Such cures may be done and as Paracels Tom four de morb ament stiffly maintains twenty seven ninety eight they cannot otherwise be cured but by spells seals and spiritual physic twenty seven ninety nine Arnoldus lib de sigillis sets down the making of them so doth Rulandus and many others Hoc posito they can effect such cures the main question is whether it be lawful in a desperate case to crave their help or ask a wizard s advice Tis a common practice of some men to go first to a witch and then to a physician if one cannot the other shall Flectere si nequeant superos Acheronta movebunt twenty eight hundred It matters not saith Paracelsus whether it be God or the devil angels or unclean spirits cure him so that he be eased If a man fall into a ditch as he prosecutes it what matter is it whether a friend or an enemy help him out and if I be troubled with such a malady what care I whether the devil himself or any of his ministers by God s permission redeem me He calls a twenty eight oh one magician God s minister and his vicar applying that of vos estis dii profanely to them for which he is lashed by T Erastus part one fol forty five And elsewhere he encourageth his patients to have a good faith twenty eight oh two a strong imagination and they shall find the effects let divines say to the contrary what they will He proves and contends that many diseases cannot otherwise be cured Incantatione orti incantatione curari debent if they be caused by incantation twenty eight oh three they must be cured by incantation Constantinus lib four approves of such remedies Bartolus the lawyer Peter Aerodius rerum Judic lib three tit seven Salicetus Godefridus with others of that sect allow of them modo sint ad sanitatem quae a magis fiunt secus non so they be for the parties good or not at all But these men are confuted by Remigius Bodinus daem lib three cap two Godelmanus lib one cap eight Wierus Delrio lib six quaest two tom three mag inquis Erastus de Lamiis all our twenty eight oh four divines schoolmen and such as write cases of conscience are against it the scripture itself absolutely forbids it as a mortal sin Levit cap xviii xix xx Deut xviii c Rom viii nineteen Evil is not to be done that good may come of it Much better it were for such patients that are so troubled to endure a little misery in this life than to hazard their souls health for ever and as Delrio counselleth twenty eight oh five much better die than be so cured Some take upon them to expel devils by natural remedies and magical exorcisms which they seem to approve out of the practice of the primitive church as that above cited of Josephus Eleazer Irenaeus Tertullian Austin Eusebius makes mention of such and magic itself hath been publicly professed in some universities as of old in Salamanca in Spain and Krakow in Poland but condemned anno thirteen eighteen by the chancellor and university of twenty eight oh six Paris Our pontifical writers retain many of these adjurations and forms of exorcisms still in the church besides those in baptism used they exorcise meats and such as are possessed as they hold in Christ s name Read Hieron Mengus cap three Pet Tyreus part three cap eight What exorcisms they prescribe besides those ordinary means of twenty eight oh seven fire suffumigations lights cutting the air with swords cap fifty seven herbs odours of which Tostatus treats two Reg cap sixteen quaest forty three you shall find many vain and frivolous superstitious forms of exorcisms among them not to be tolerated or endured MEMB II Lawful Cures first from God Being so clearly evinced as it is all unlawful cures are to be refused it remains to treat of such as are to be admitted and those are commonly such which God hath appointed twenty eight oh eight by virtue of stones herbs plants meats and the like which are prepared and applied to our use by art and industry of physicians who are the dispensers of such treasures for our good and to be twenty eight oh nine honoured for necessities sake God s intermediate ministers to whom in our infirmities we are to seek for help Yet not so that we rely too much or wholly upon them a Jove principium we must first begin with twenty eight ten prayer and then use physic not one without the other but both together To pray alone and reject ordinary means is to do like him in Aesop that when his cart was stalled lay flat on his back and cried aloud help Hercules but that was to little purpose except as his friend advised him rotis tute ipse annitaris he whipped his horses withal and put his shoulder to the wheel God works by means as Christ cured the blind man with clay and spittle Orandum est ut sit mens sana in corpore sano As we must pray for health of body and mind so we must use our utmost endeavours to preserve and continue it Some kind of devils are not cast out but by fasting and prayer and both necessarily required not one without the other For all the physic we can use art excellent industry is to no purpose without calling upon God nil juvat immensos Cratero promittere montes it is in vain to seek for help run ride except God bless us twenty eight eleven non Siculi dapes Dulcem elaborabunt saporem Non animum cytheraeve cantus twenty eight twelve Non domus et fundus non aeris acervus et auri Aegroto possunt domino deducere febres twenty eight thirteen With house with land with money and with gold The master s fever will not be controll d We must use our prayer and physic both together and so no doubt but our prayers will be available and our physic take effect Tis that Hezekiah practised two King xx Luke the Evangelist and which we are enjoined Coloss iv not the patient only but the physician himself Hippocrates a heathen required this in a good practitioner and so did Galen lib de Plat et Hipp dog lib nine cap fifteen and in that tract of his an mores sequantur temp cor ca eleven tis a rule which he doth inculcate twenty eight fourteen and many others Hyperius in his first book de sacr script lect speaking of that happiness and good success which all physicians desire and hope for in their cures twenty eight fifteen tells them that it is not to be expected except with a true faith they call upon God and teach their patients to do the like The council of Lateran Canon twenty two decreed they should do so the fathers of the church have still advised as much whatsoever thou takest in hand saith twenty eight sixteen Gregory let God be of thy counsel consult with him that healeth those that are broken in heart Psal cxlvii three and bindeth up their sores Otherwise as the prophet Jeremiah cap xlvi eleven denounced to Egypt In vain shalt thou use many medicines for thou shalt have no health It is the same counsel which twenty eight seventeen Comineus that politic historiographer gives to all Christian princes upon occasion of that unhappy overthrow of Charles Duke of Burgundy by means of which he was extremely melancholy and sick to death insomuch that neither physic nor persuasion could do him any good perceiving his preposterous error belike adviseth all great men in such cases twenty eight eighteen to pray first to God with all submission and penitency to confess their sins and then to use physic The very same fault it was which the prophet reprehends in Asa king of Judah that he relied more on physic than on God and by all means would have him to amend it And tis a fit caution to be observed of all other sorts of men The prophet David was so observant of this precept that in his greatest misery and vexation of mind he put this rule first in practice Psal lxxvii three When I am in heaviness I will think on God Psal lxxxvi four Comfort the soul of thy servant for unto thee I lift up my soul and verse seven In the day of trouble will I call upon thee for thou hearest me Psal liv one Save me O God by thy name c Psal lxxxii Psal xx And tis the common practice of all good men Psal cvii thirteen when their heart was humbled with heaviness they cried to the Lord in their troubles and he delivered them from their distress And they have found good success in so doing as David confesseth Psal xxx twelve Thou hast turned my mourning into joy thou hast loosed my sackcloth and girded me with gladness Therefore he adviseth all others to do the like Psal xxxi twenty four All ye that trust in the Lord be strong and he shall establish your heart It is reported by twenty eight nineteen Suidas speaking of Hezekiah that there was a great book of old of King Solomon s writing which contained medicines for all manner of diseases and lay open still as they came into the temple but Hezekiah king of Jerusalem caused it to be taken away because it made the people secure to neglect their duty in calling and relying upon God out of a confidence on those remedies twenty eight twenty Minutius that worthy consul of Rome in an oration he made to his soldiers was much offended with them and taxed their ignorance that in their misery called more on him than upon God A general fault it is all over the world and Minutius s speech concerns us all we rely more on physic and seek oftener to physicians than to God himself As much faulty are they that prescribe as they that ask respecting wholly their gain and trusting more to their ordinary receipts and medicines many times than to him that made them I would wish all patients in this behalf in the midst of their melancholy to remember that of Siracides Ecc i eleven and twelve The fear of the Lord is glory and gladness and rejoicing The fear of the Lord maketh a merry heart and giveth gladness and joy and long life and all such as prescribe physic to begin in nomine Dei as twenty eight twenty one Mesue did to imitate Laelius a Fonte Eugubinus that in all his consultations still concludes with a prayer for the good success of his business and to remember that of Creto one of their predecessors fuge avaritiam et sine oratione et invocations Dei nihil facias avoid covetousness and do nothing without invocation upon God MEMB III Whether it be lawful to seek to Saints for Aid in this Disease That we must pray to God no man doubts but whether we should pray to saints in such cases or whether they can do us any good it may be lawfully controverted Whether their images shrines relics consecrated things holy water medals benedictions those divine amulets holy exorcisms and the sign of the cross be available in this disease The papists on the one side stiffly maintain how many melancholy mad demoniacal persons are daily cured at saint Anthony s Church in Padua at saint Vitus in Germany by our Lady of Loretto in Italy our Lady of Sichem in the Low Countries twenty eight twenty two Quae et caecis lumen aegris salutem mortuis vitam claudis gressum reddit omnes morbos corporis animi curat et in ipsos daemones imperium exercet she cures halt lame blind all diseases of body and mind and commands the devil himself saith Lipsius twenty five thousand in a day come thither twenty eight twenty three quis nisi numen in illum locum sic induxit who brought them in auribus in oculis omnium gesta novae novitia new news lately done our eyes and ears are full of her cures and who can relate them all They have a proper saint almost for every peculiar infirmity for poison gouts agues Petronella saint Romanus for such as are possessed Valentine for the falling sickness saint Vitus for madmen c and as of old twenty eight twenty four Pliny reckons up Gods for all diseases Febri fanum dicalum est Lilius Giraldus repeats many of her ceremonies all affections of the mind were heretofore accounted gods twenty eight twenty five love and sorrow virtue honour liberty contumely impudency had their temples tempests seasons Crepitus Ventris dea Vacuna dea Cloacina there was a goddess of idleness a goddess of the draught or jakes Prema Premunda Priapus bawdy gods and gods for all twenty eight twenty six offices Varro reckons up thirty thousand gods Lucian makes Podagra the gout a goddess and assigns her priests and ministers and melancholy comes not behind for as Austin mentioneth lib four de Civit Dei cap nine there was of old Angerona dea and she had her chapel and feasts to whom saith twenty eight twenty seven Macrobius they did offer sacrifice yearly that she might be pacified as well as the rest Tis no new thing you see this of papists and in my judgment that old doting Lipsius might have fitter dedicated his twenty eight twenty eight pen after all his labours to this our goddess of melancholy than to his Virgo Halensis and been her chaplain it would have become him better but he poor man thought no harm in that which he did and will not be persuaded but that he doth well he hath so many patrons and honourable precedents in the like kind that justify as much as eagerly and more than he there saith of his lady and mistress read but superstitious Coster and Gretser s Tract de Cruce Laur Arcturus Fanteus de Invoc Sanct Bellarmine Delrio dis mag tom three l six quaest two sect three Greg Tolosanus tom two lib eight cap twenty four Syntax Strozius Cicogna lib four cap nine Tyreus Hieronymus Mengus and you shall find infinite examples of cures done in this kind by holy waters relics crosses exorcisms amulets images consecrated beads c Barradius the Jesuit boldly gives it out that Christ s countenance and the Virgin Mary s would cure melancholy if one had looked steadfastly on them P Morales the Spaniard in his book de pulch Jes et Mar confirms the same out of Carthusianus and I know not whom that it was a common proverb in those days for such as were troubled in mind to say eamus ad videndum filium Mariae let us see the son of Mary as they now do post to saint Anthony s in Padua or to saint Hilary s at Poitiers in France twenty eight twenty nine In a closet of that church there is at this day saint Hilary s bed to be seen to which they bring all the madmen in the country and after some prayers and other ceremonies they lay them down there to sleep and so they recover It is an ordinary thing in those parts to send all their madmen to saint Hilary s cradle They say the like of saint Tubery in twenty eight thirty another place Giraldus Cambrensis Itin Camb c one tells strange stories of saint Ciricius staff that would cure this and all other diseases Others say as much as twenty eight thirty one Hospinian observes of the three kings of Cologne their names written in parchment and hung about a patient s neck with the sign of the cross will produce like effects Read Lippomanus or that golden legend of Jacobus de Voragine you shall have infinite stories or those new relations of our twenty eight thirty two Jesuits in Japan and China of Mat Riccius Acosta Loyola Xaverius s life c Jasper Belga a Jesuit cured a mad woman by hanging saint John s gospel about her neck and many such Holy water did as much in Japan c Nothing so familiar in their works as such examples But we on the other side seek to God alone We say with David Psal xlvi one God is our hope and strength and help in trouble ready to be found For their catalogue of examples we make no other answer but that they are false fictions or diabolical illusions counterfeit miracles We cannot deny but that it is an ordinary thing on saint Anthony s day in Padua to bring diverse madmen and demoniacal persons to be cured yet we make a doubt whether such parties be so affected indeed but prepared by their priests by certain ointments and drams to cozen the commonalty as twenty eight thirty three Hildesheim well saith the like is commonly practised in Bohemia as Mathiolus gives us to understand in his preface to his comment upon Dioscorides But we need not run so far for examples in this kind we have a just volume published at home to this purpose twenty eight thirty four A declaration of egregious popish impostures to withdraw the hearts of religious men under the pretence of casting out of devils practised by Father Edmunds alias Weston a Jesuit and divers Romish priests his wicked associates with the several parties names confessions examinations c which were pretended to be possessed But these are ordinary tricks only to get opinion and money mere impostures Aesculapius of old that counterfeit God did as many famous cures his temple as twenty eight thirty five Strabo relates was daily full of patients and as many several tables inscriptions pendants donories c to be seen in his church as at this day our Lady of Loretto s in Italy It was a custom long since suspendisse potenti Vestimenta maris deo twenty eight thirty six Hor Od one lib five Od To do the like in former times they were seduced and deluded as they are now Tis the same devil still called heretofore Apollo Mars Neptune Venus Aesculapius c as twenty

George are come in their places Our lady succeeds Venus as they use her in many offices the rest are otherwise supplied as twenty eight thirty eight Lavater writes and so they are deluded twenty eight thirty nine And God often winks at these impostures because they forsake his word and betake themselves to the devil as they do that seek after holy water crosses c Wierus lib four cap three What can these men plead for themselves more than those heathen gods the same cures done by both the same spirit that seduceth but read more of the Pagan god s effects in Austin de Civitate Dei l ten cap six and of Aesculapius especially in Cicogna l three cap eight or put case they could help why should we rather seek to them than to Christ himself since that he so kindly invites us unto him Come unto me all ye that are heavy laden and I will ease you Mat xi and we know that there is one God one Mediator between God and man Jesus Christ one Tim ii five who gave himself a ransom for all men We know that we have an twenty eight forty advocate with the Father Jesus Christ one Joh ii one that there is no other name under heaven by which we can be saved but by his who is always ready to hear us and sits at the right hand of God and from twenty eight forty one whom we can have no repulse solus vult solus potest curat universos tanquam singulos et twenty eight forty two unumquemque nostrum et

saith God hath bestowed on man this of physic is not the least but most necessary and especially conducing to the good of mankind Next therefore to God in all our extremities for of the most high cometh healing Ecclus xxxviii two we must seek to and rely upon the Physician twenty eight forty three who is Manus Dei saith Hierophilus and to whom he hath given knowledge that he might be glorified in his wondrous works With such doth he heal men and take away their pains Ecclus xxxviii six seven when thou hast need of him let him not go from thee The hour may come that their enterprises may have good success ver thirteen It is not therefore to be doubted that if we seek a physician as we ought we may be eased of our infirmities such a one I mean as is sufficient and worthily so called for there be many mountebanks quacksalvers empirics in every street almost and in every village that take upon them this name make this noble and profitable art to be evil spoken of and contemned by reason of these base and illiterate artificers but such a physician I speak of as is approved learned skilful honest c of whose duty Wecker Antid cap two and Syntax med Crato Julius Alexandrinus medic Heurnius prax med lib three cap one c treat at large For this particular disease him that shall take upon him to cure it twenty eight forty four Paracelsus will have to be a magician a chemist a philosopher an astrologer Thurnesserus Severinus the Dane and some other of his followers require as much many of them cannot be cured but by magic twenty eight forty five Paracelsus is so stiff for those chemical medicines that in his cures he will admit almost of no other physic deriding in the mean time Hippocrates Galen and all their followers but magic and all such remedies I have already censured and shall speak of chemistry twenty eight forty six elsewhere Astrology is required by many famous physicians by Ficinus Crato Fernelius twenty eight forty seven doubted of and exploded by others I will not take upon me to decide the controversy myself Johannes Hossurtus Thomas Boderius and Maginus in the preface to his mathematical physic shall determine for me Many physicians explode astrology in physic saith he there is no use of it unam artem ac quasi temerarium insectantur ac gloriam sibi ab ejus imperitia aucupari but I will reprove physicians by physicians that defend and profess it Hippocrates Galen Avicen c that count them butchers without it homicidas medicos Astrologiae ignaros c Paracelsus goes farther and will have his physician twenty eight forty eight predestinated to this man s cure this malady and time of cure the scheme of each geniture inspected gathering of herbs of administering astrologically observed in which Thurnesserus and some iatromathematical professors are too superstitious in my judgment twenty eight forty nine Hellebore will help but not alway not given by every physician c but these men are too peremptory and self conceited as I think But what do I do interposing in that which is beyond my reach A blind man cannot judge of colours nor I peradventure of these things Only thus much I would require honesty in every physician that he be not over careless or covetous harpy like to make a prey of his patient Carnificis namque est as twenty eight fifty Wecker notes inter ipsos cruciatus ingens precium exposcere as a hungry chirurgeon often produces and wire draws his cure so long as there is any hope of pay Non missura cutem nisi plena cruoris hirudo twenty eight fifty one Many of them to get a fee will give physic to every one that comes when there is no cause and they do so irritare silentem morbum as twenty eight fifty two Heurnius complains stir up a silent disease as it often falleth out which by good counsel good advice alone might have been happily composed or by rectification of those six non natural things otherwise cured This is Naturae bellum inferre to oppugn nature and to make a strong body weak Arnoldus in his eight and eleven Aphorisms gives cautions against and expressly forbiddeth it twenty eight fifty three A wise physician will not give physic but upon necessity and first try medicinal diet before he proceed to medicinal cure twenty eight fifty four In another place he laughs those men to scorn that think longis syrupis expugnare daemones et animi phantasmata they can purge fantastical imaginations and the devil by physic Another caution is that they proceed upon good grounds if so be there be need of physic and not mistake the disease they are often deceived by the twenty eight fifty five similitude of symptoms saith Heurnius and I could give instance in many consultations wherein they have prescribed opposite physic Sometimes they go too perfunctorily to work in not prescribing a just twenty eight fifty six course of physic To stir up the humour and not to purge it doth often more harm than good Montanus consil thirty inveighs against such perturbations that purge to the halves tire nature and molest the body to no purpose Tis a crabbed humour to purge and as Laurentius calls this disease the reproach of physicians Bessardus flagellum medicorum their lash and for that cause more carefully to be respected Though the patient be averse saith Laurentius desire help and refuse it again though he neglect his own health it behoves a good physician not to leave him helpless But most part they offend in that other extreme they prescribe too much physic and tire out their bodies with continual potions to no purpose Aetius tetrabib two two ser cap ninety will have them by all means therefore twenty eight fifty seven to give some respite to nature to leave off now and then and Laelius a Fonte Eugubinus in his consultations found it as he there witnesseth often verified by experience twenty eight fifty eight that after a deal of physic to no purpose left to themselves they have recovered Tis that which Nic Piso Donatus Altomarus still inculcate dare requiem naturae to give nature rest SUBSECT II Concerning the Patient When these precedent cautions are accurately kept and that we have now got a skilful an honest physician to our mind if his patient will not be conformable and content to be ruled by him all his endeavours will come to no good end Many things are necessarily to be observed and continued on the patient s behalf First that he be not too niggardly miserable of his purse or think it too much he bestows upon himself and to save charges endanger his health The Abderites when they sent for twenty eight fifty nine Hippocrates promised him what reward he would twenty eight sixty all the gold they had if all the city were gold he should have it Naaman the Syrian when he went into Israel to Elisha to be cured of his leprosy took with him ten talents of silver six thousand pieces of gold and ten changes of raiment two Kings v five Another thing is that out of bashfulness he do not conceal his grief if aught trouble his mind let him freely disclose it Stultorum incurata pudor malus ulcera celat by that means he procures to himself much mischief and runs into a greater inconvenience he must be willing to be cured and earnestly desire it Pars sanitatis velle sanare fuit Seneca Tis a part of his cure to wish his own health and not to defer it too long twenty eight sixty one Qui blandiendo dulce nutrivit malum Soro recusat ferre quod subiit jugum He that by cherishing a mischief doth provoke Too late at last refuseth to cast off his yoke twenty eight sixty two Helleborum frustra cum jam cutis aegra tumebit Poscentes videas venienti occurrite morbo When the skin swells to seek it to appease With hellebore is vain meet your disease By this means many times or through their ignorance in not taking notice of their grievance and danger of it contempt supine negligence extenuation wretchedness and peevishness they undo themselves The citizens I know not of what city now when rumour was brought their enemies were coming could not abide to hear it and when the plague begins in many places and they certainly know it they command silence and hush it up but after they see their foes now marching to their gates and ready to surprise them they begin to fortify and resist when tis too late when the sickness breaks out and can be no longer concealed then they lament their supine negligence tis no otherwise with these men And often out of prejudice a loathing and distaste of physic they had rather die or do worse than take any of it Barbarous immanity twenty eight sixty three Melancthon terms it and folly to be deplored so to contemn the precepts of health good remedies and voluntarily to pull death and many maladies upon their own heads Though many again are in that other extreme too profuse suspicious and jealous of their health too apt to take physic on every small occasion to aggravate every slender passion imperfection impediment if their finger do but ache run ride send for a physician as many gentlewomen do that are sick without a cause even when they will themselves upon every toy or small discontent and when he comes they make it worse than it is by amplifying that which is not twenty eight sixty four Hier Capivaccius sets it down as a common fault of all melancholy persons to say their symptoms are greater than they are to help themselves And which twenty eight sixty five Mercurialis notes consil fifty three to be more troublesome to their physicians than other ordinary patients that they may have change of physic A third thing to be required in a patient is confidence to be of good cheer and have sure hope that his physician can help him twenty eight sixty six Damascen the Arabian requires likewise in the physician himself that he be confident he can cure him otherwise his physic will not be effectual and promise withal that he will certainly help him make him believe so at least twenty eight sixty seven Galeottus gives this reason because the form of health is contained in the physician s mind and as Galen holds twenty eight sixty eight confidence and hope to be more good than physic he cures most in whom most are confident Axiocus sick almost to death at the very sight of Socrates recovered his former health Paracelsus assigns it for an only cause why Hippocrates was so fortunate in his cures not for any extraordinary skill he had twenty eight sixty nine but because the common people had a most strong conceit of his worth To this of confidence we may add perseverance obedience and constancy not to change his physician or dislike him upon every toy for he that so doth saith twenty eight seventy Janus Damascen or consults with many falls into many errors or that useth many medicines It was a chief caveat of twenty eight seventy one Seneca to his friend Lucilius that he should not alter his physician or prescribed physic Nothing hinders health more a wound can never be cured that hath several plasters Crato consil one hundred eighty six taxeth all melancholy persons of this fault twenty eight seventy two Tis proper to them if things fall not out to their mind and that they have not present ease to seek another and another as they do commonly that have sore eyes twenty one after another and they still promise all to cure them try a thousand remedies and by this means they increase their malady make it most dangerous and difficult to be cured They try many saith twenty eight seventy three Montanus and profit by none and for this cause consil twenty four he enjoins his patient before he take him in hand twenty eight seventy four perseverance and sufferance for in such a small time no great matter can be effected and upon that condition he will administer physic otherwise all his endeavour and counsel would be to small purpose And in his thirty one counsel for a notable matron he tells her twenty eight seventy five if she will be cured she must be of a most abiding patience faithful obedience and singular perseverance if she remit or despair she can expect or hope for no good success Consil two hundred thirty for an Italian Abbot he makes it one of the greatest reasons why this disease is so incurable twenty eight seventy six because the parties are so restless and impatient and will therefore have him that intends to be eased twenty eight seventy seven to take physic not for a month a year but to apply himself to their prescriptions all the days of his life Last of all it is required that the patient be not too bold to practise upon himself without an approved physician s consent or to try conclusions if he read a receipt in a book for so many grossly mistake and do themselves more harm than good That which is conducing to one man in one case the same time is opposite to another twenty eight seventy eight An ass and a mule went laden over a brook the one with salt the other with wool the mule s pack was wet by chance the salt melted his burden the lighter and he thereby much eased he told the ass who thinking to speed as well wet his pack likewise at the next water but it was much the heavier he quite tired So one thing may be good and bad to several parties upon diverse occasions Many things saith twenty eight seventy nine Penottus are written in our books which seem to the reader to be excellent remedies but they that make use of them are often deceived and take for physic poison I remember in Valleriola s observations a story of one John Baptist a Neapolitan that finding by chance a pamphlet in Italian written in praise of hellebore would needs adventure on himself and took one dram for one scruple and had not he been sent for the poor fellow had poisoned himself From whence he concludes out of Damascenus two et three Aphoris twenty eight eighty that without exquisite knowledge to work out of books is most dangerous how unsavoury a thing it is to believe writers and take upon trust as this patient perceived by his own peril I could recite such another example of mine own knowledge of a friend of mine that finding a receipt in Brassivola would needs take hellebore in substance and try it on his own person but had not some of his familiars come to visit him by chance he had by his indiscretion hazarded himself many such I have observed These are those ordinary cautions which I should think fit to be noted and he that shall keep them as twenty eight eighty one Montanus saith shall surely be much eased if not thoroughly cured SUBSECT III Concerning Physic Physic itself in the last place is to be considered for the Lord hath created medicines of the earth and he that is wise will not abhor them Ecclus xxxviii four ver seven zero of such doth the apothecary make a confection c Of these medicines there be diverse and infinite kinds plants metals animals c and those of several natures some good for one hurtful to another some noxious in themselves corrected by art very wholesome and good simples mixed c and therefore left to be managed by discreet and skilful physicians and thence applied to man s use To this purpose they have invented method and several rules of art to put these remedies in order for their particular ends Physic as Hippocrates defines it is nought else but twenty eight eighty two addition and subtraction and as it is required in all other diseases so in this of melancholy it ought to be most accurate it being as twenty eight eighty three Mercurialis acknowledgeth so common an affection in these our times and therefore fit to be understood Several prescripts and methods I find in several men some take upon them to cure all maladies with one medicine severally applied as that panacea aurum potabile so much controverted in these days herba solis c Paracelsus reduceth all diseases to four principal heads to whom Severinus Ravelascus Leo Suavius and others adhere and imitate those are leprosy gout dropsy falling sickness To which they reduce the rest as to leprosy ulcers itches furfurs scabs c To gout stone colic toothache headache c To dropsy agues jaundice cachexia c To the falling sickness belong palsy vertigo cramps convulsions incubus apoplexy c twenty eight eighty four If any of these four principal be cured saith Ravelascus all the inferior are cured and the same remedies commonly serve but this is too general and by some contradicted for this peculiar disease of melancholy of which I am now to speak I find several cures several methods and prescripts They that intend the practic cure of melancholy saith Duretus in his notes to Hollerius set down nine peculiar scopes or ends Savanarola prescribes seven especial canons Aelianus Montaltus cap twenty six Faventinus in his empirics Hercules de Saxonia c have their several injunctions and rules all tending to one end The ordinary is threefold which I mean to follow Greek Diaitaetikae Pharmaceutica and Chirurgica diet or living apothecary chirurgery which Wecker Crato Guianerius c and most prescribe of which I will insist and speak in their order SECT II MEMB I SUBSECT I Diet rectified in substance Diet Greek Diaitaetikae victus or living according to twenty eight eighty five Fuchsius and others comprehends those six non natural things which I have before specified are especial causes and being rectified a sole or chief part of the cure twenty eight eighty six Johannes Arculanus cap sixteen in nine Rhasis accounts the rectifying of these six a sufficient cure Guianerius tract fifteen cap nine calls them propriam et primam curam the principal cure so doth Montanus Crato Mercurialis Altomarus c first to be tried Lemnius instit cap twenty two names them the hinges of our health twenty eight eighty seven no hope of recovery without them Reinerus Solenander in his seventh consultation for a Spanish young gentlewoman that was so melancholy she abhorred all company and would not sit at table with her familiar friends prescribes this physic above the rest twenty eight eighty eight no good to be done without it twenty eight eighty nine Aretus lib one cap seven an old physician is of opinion that this is enough of itself if the party be not too far gone in sickness twenty eight ninety Crato in a consultation of his for a noble patient tells him plainly that if his highness will keep but a good diet he will warrant him his former health twenty eight ninety one Montanus consil twenty seven for a nobleman of France admonisheth his lordship to be most circumspect in his diet or else all his other physic will twenty eight ninety two be to small purpose The same injunction I find verbatim in J Caesar Claudinus Respon thirty four Scoltzii consil one hundred eighty three Trallianus cap sixteen lib one Laelius a Fonte Aeugubinus often brags that he hath done more cures in this kind by rectification of diet than all other physic besides So that in a word I may say to most melancholy men as the fox said to the weasel that could not get out of the garner Macra cavum repetes quem macra subisti twenty eight ninety three the six non natural things caused it and they must cure it Which howsoever I treat of as proper to the meridian of melancholy yet nevertheless that which is here said with him in twenty eight ninety four Tully though writ especially for the good of his friends at Tarentum and Sicily yet it will generally serve twenty eight ninety five most other diseases and help them likewise if it be observed Of these six non natural things the first is diet properly so called which consists in meat and drink in which we must consider substance quantity quality and that opposite to the precedent In substance such meats are generally commended which are twenty eight ninety six moist easy of digestion and not apt to engender wind not fried nor roasted but sod saith Valescus Altomarus Piso c hot and moist and of good nourishment Crato consil twenty one lib two admits roast meat twenty eight ninety seven if the burned and scorched superficies the brown we call it be pared off Salvianus lib two cap one cries out on cold and dry meats twenty eight ninety eight young flesh and tender is approved as of kid rabbits chickens veal mutton capons hens partridge pheasant quails and all mountain birds which are so familiar in some parts of Africa and in Italy and as twenty eight ninety nine Dublinius reports the common food of boors and clowns in Palestine Galen takes exception at mutton but without question he means that rammy mutton which is in Turkey and Asia Minor which have those great fleshy tails of forty eight pounds weight as Vertomannus witnesseth navig lib two cap five The lean of fat meat is best and all manner of broths and pottage with borage lettuce and such wholesome herbs are excellent good especially of a cock boiled all spoon meat Arabians commend brains but twenty nine hundred Laurentius c eight excepts against them and so do many others twenty nine oh one eggs are justified as a nutritive wholesome meat butter and oil may pass but with some limitation so twenty nine oh two Crato confines it and to some men sparingly at set times or in sauce and so sugar and honey are approved twenty nine oh three All sharp and sour sauces must be avoided and spices or at least seldom used and so saffron sometimes in broth may be tolerated but these things may be more freely used as the temperature of the party is hot or cold or as he shall find inconvenience by them The thinnest whitest smallest wine is best not thick nor strong and so of beer the middling is fittest Bread of good wheat pure well purged from the bran is preferred Laurentius cap eight would have it kneaded with rain water if it may be gotten Water Pure thin light water by all means use of good smell and taste like to the air in sight such as is soon hot soon cold and which Hippocrates so much approves if at least it may be had Rain water is purest so that it fall not down in great drops and be used forthwith for it quickly putrefies Next to it fountain water that riseth in the east and runneth eastward from a quick running spring from flinty chalky gravelly grounds and the longer a river runneth it is commonly the purest though many springs do yield the best water at their fountains The waters in hotter countries as in Turkey Persia India within the tropics are frequently purer than ours in the north more subtile thin and lighter as our merchants observe by four ounces in a pound pleasanter to drink as good as our beer and some of them as Choaspis in Persia preferred by the Persian kings before wine itself twenty nine oh four Clitorio quicunque sitim de fonte levarit Vina fugit gaudetque meris abstemius undis Many rivers I deny not are muddy still white thick like those in China Nile in Egypt Tiber at Rome but after they be settled two or three days defecate and clear very commodious useful and good Many make use of deep wells as of old in the Holy Land lakes cisterns when they cannot be better provided to fetch it in carts or gondolas as in Venice or camels backs as at Cairo in Egypt twenty nine oh five Radzivilius observed eight thousand camels daily there employed about that business some keep it in trunks as in the East Indies made four square with descending steps and tis not amiss for I would not have any one so nice as that Grecian Calis sister to Nicephorus emperor of Constantinople and twenty nine oh six married to Dominitus Silvius duke of Venice that out of incredible wantonness communi aqua uti nolebat would use no vulgar water but she died tanta saith mine author foetidissimi puris copia of so fulsome a disease that no water could wash her clean twenty nine oh seven Plato would not have a traveller lodge in a city that is not governed by laws or hath not a quick stream running by it illud enim animum hoc corrumpit valetudinem one corrupts the body the other the mind But this is more than needs too much curiosity is naught in time of necessity any water is allowed Howsoever pure water is best and which as Pindarus holds is better than gold an especial ornament it is and very commodious to a city according to twenty nine oh eight Vegetius when fresh springs are included within the walls as at Corinth in the midst of the town almost there was arx altissima scatens fontibus a goodly mount full of fresh water springs if nature afford them not they must be had by art It is a wonder to read of those twenty nine oh nine stupend aqueducts and infinite cost hath been bestowed in Rome of old Constantinople Carthage Alexandria and such populous cities to convey good and wholesome waters read twenty nine ten Frontinus Lipsius de admir twenty nine eleven Plinius lib three cap eleven Strabo in his Geogr That aqueduct of Claudius was most eminent fetched upon arches fifteen miles every arch one hundred nine feet high they had fourteen such other aqueducts besides lakes and cisterns seven hundred as I take it twenty nine twelve every house had private pipes and channels to serve them for their use Peter Gillius in his accurate description of Constantinople speaks of an old cistern which he went down to see three hundred thirty six feet long one hundred eighty feet broad built of marble covered over with arch work and sustained by three hundred thirty six pillars twelve feet asunder and in eleven rows to contain sweet water Infinite cost in channels and cisterns from Nilus to Alexandria hath been formerly bestowed to the admiration of these times twenty nine thirteen their cisterns so curiously cemented and composed that a beholder would take them to be all of one stone when the foundation is laid and cistern made their house is half built That Segovian aqueduct in Spain is much wondered at in these days twenty nine fourteen upon three rows of pillars one above another conveying sweet water to every house but each city almost is full of such aqueducts Amongst the rest twenty nine fifteen he is eternally to be commended that brought that new stream to the north side of London at his own charge and mister Otho Nicholson founder of our waterworks and elegant conduit in Oxford So much have all times attributed to this element to be conveniently provided of it although Galen hath taken exceptions at such waters which run through leaden pipes ob cerussam quae in iis generatur for that unctuous ceruse which causeth dysenteries and fluxes twenty nine sixteen yet as Alsarius Crucius of Genna well answers it is opposite to common experience If that were true most of our Italian cities Montpelier in France with infinite others would find this inconvenience but there is no such matter For private families in what sort they should furnish themselves let them consult with P Crescentius de Agric l one c four Pamphilius Hirelacus and the rest Amongst fishes those are most allowed of that live in gravelly or sandy waters pikes perch trout gudgeon smelts flounders c Hippolitus Salvianus takes exception at carp but I dare boldly say with twenty nine seventeen Dubravius it is an excellent meat if it come not from twenty nine eighteen muddy pools that it retain not an unsavoury taste Erinacius Marinus is much commended by Oribatius Aetius and most of our late writers twenty nine nineteen Crato consil twenty one lib two censures all manner of fruits as subject to putrefaction yet tolerable at sometimes after meals at second course they keep down vapours and have their use Sweet fruits are best as sweet cherries plums sweet apples pearmains and pippins which Laurentius extols as having a peculiar property against this disease and Plater magnifies omnibus modis appropriata conveniunt but they must be corrected for their windiness ripe grapes are good and raisins of the sun musk melons well corrected and sparingly used Figs are allowed and almonds blanched Trallianus discommends figs twenty nine twenty Salvianus olives and capers which twenty nine twenty one others especially like of and so of pistick nuts Montanus and Mercurialis out of Avenzoar admit peaches twenty nine twenty two pears and apples baked after meals only corrected with sugar and aniseed or fennel seed and so they may be profitably taken because they strengthen the stomach and keep down vapours The like may be said of preserved cherries plums marmalade of plums quinces c but not to drink after them twenty nine twenty three Pomegranates lemons oranges are tolerated if they be not too sharp twenty nine twenty four Crato will admit of no herbs but borage bugloss endive fennel aniseed baum Callenius and Arnoldus tolerate lettuce spinach beets c The same Crato will allow no roots at all to be eaten Some approve of potatoes parsnips but all corrected for wind No raw salads but as Laurentius prescribes in broths and so Crato commends many of them or to use borage hops baum steeped in their ordinary drink twenty nine twenty five Avenzoar magnifies the juice of a pomegranate if it be sweet and especially rose water which he would have to be used in every dish which they put in practice in those hot countries about Damascus where if we may believe the relations of Vertomannus many hogsheads of rose water are to be sold in the market at once it is in so great request with them SUBSECT II Diet rectified in quantity Man alone saith twenty nine twenty six Cardan eats and drinks without appetite and useth all his pleasure without necessity animae vitio and thence come many inconveniences unto him For there is no meat whatsoever though otherwise wholesome and good but if unseasonably taken or immoderately used more than the stomach can well bear it will engender crudity and do much harm Therefore twenty nine twenty seven Crato adviseth his patient to eat but twice a day and that at his set meals by no means to eat without an appetite or upon a full stomach and to put seven hours difference between dinner and supper Which rule if we did observe in our colleges it would be much better for our healths but custom that tyrant so prevails that contrary to all good order and rules of physic we scarce admit of five If after seven hours tarrying he shall have no stomach let him defer his meal or eat very little at his ordinary time of repast This very counsel was given by Prosper Calenus to Cardinal Caesius labouring of this disease and twenty nine twenty eight Platerus prescribes it to a patient of his to be most severely kept Guianerius admits of three meals a day but Montanus consil twenty three pro Ab Italo ties him precisely to two And as he must not eat overmuch so he may not absolutely fast for as Celsus contends lib one Jacchinus fifteen in nine Rhasis twenty nine twenty nine repletion and inanition may both do harm in two contrary extremes Moreover that which he doth eat must be well twenty nine thirty chewed and not hastily gobbled for that causeth crudity and wind and by all means to eat no more than he can well digest Some think saith twenty nine thirty one Trincavelius lib eleven cap twenty nine de curand part hum the more they eat the more they nourish themselves eat and live as the proverb is not knowing that only repairs man which is well concocted not that which is devoured Melancholy men most part have good twenty nine thirty two appetites but ill digestion and for that cause they must be sure to rise with an appetite and that which Socrates and Disarius the physicians in twenty nine thirty three Macrobius so much require saint Hierom enjoins Rusticus to eat and drink no more than will twenty nine thirty four satisfy hunger and thirst twenty nine thirty five Lessius the Jesuit holds twelve thirteen or fourteen ounces or in our northern countries sixteen at most for all students weaklings and such as lead an idle sedentary life of meat bread c a fit proportion for a whole day and as much or little more of drink Nothing pesters the body and mind sooner than to be still fed to eat and ingurgitate beyond all measure as many do twenty nine thirty six By overmuch eating and continual feasts they stifle nature and choke up themselves which had they lived coarsely or like galley slaves been tied to an oar might have happily prolonged many fair years A great inconvenience comes by variety of dishes which causeth the precedent distemperature twenty nine thirty seven than which saith Avicenna nothing is worse to feed on diversity of meats or overmuch Sertorius like in lucem caenare and as commonly they do in Muscovy and Iceland to prolong their meals all day long or all night Our northern countries offend especially in this and we in this island ampliter viventes in prandiis et caenis as twenty nine thirty eight Polydore notes are most liberal feeders but to our own hurt twenty nine thirty nine Persicos odi puer apparatus Excess of meat breedeth sickness and gluttony causeth choleric diseases by surfeiting many perish but he that dieteth himself prolongeth his life Ecclus xxxvii twenty nine thirty We account it a great glory for a man to have his table daily furnished with variety of meats but hear the physician he pulls thee by the ear as thou sittest and telleth thee twenty nine forty that nothing can be more noxious to thy health than such variety and plenty Temperance is a bridle of gold and he that can use it aright twenty nine forty one ego non summis viris comparo sed simillimum Deo judico is liker a God than a man for as it will transform a beast to a man again so will it make a man a God To preserve thine honour health and to avoid therefore all those inflations torments obstructions crudities and diseases that come by a full diet the best way is to twenty nine forty two feed sparingly of one or two dishes at most to have ventrem bene moratum as Seneca calls it twenty nine forty three to choose one of many and to feed on that alone as Crato adviseth his patient The same counsel twenty nine forty four Prosper Calenus gives to Cardinal Caesius to use a moderate and simple diet and though his table be jovially furnished by reason of his state and guests yet for his own part to single out some one savoury dish and feed on it The same is inculcated by twenty nine forty five Crato consil nine l two to a noble personage affected with this grievance he would have his highness to dine or sup alone without all his honourable attendance and courtly company with a private friend or so twenty nine forty six a dish or two a cup of Rhenish wine c Montanus consil twenty four for a noble matron enjoins her one dish and by no means to drink between meals The like consil two hundred twenty nine or not to eat till he be an hungry which rule Berengarius did most strictly observe as Hilbertus Cenomecensis Episc writes in his life cui non fuit unquam Ante sitim potus nec cibus ante famem and which all temperate men do constantly keep It is a frequent solemnity still used with us when friends meet to go to the alehouse or tavern they are not sociable otherwise and if they visit one another s houses they must both eat and drink I reprehend it not moderately used but to some men nothing can be more offensive they had better I speak it with Saint twenty nine forty seven Ambrose pour so much water in their shoes It much avails likewise to keep good order in our diet twenty nine forty eight to eat liquid things first broths fish and such meats as are sooner corrupted in the stomach harder meats of digestion must come last Crato would have the supper less than the dinner which Cardan Contradict lib one tract five contradict eighteen disallows and that by the authority of Galen seven art curat cap six and for four reasons he will have the supper biggest I have read many treatises to this purpose I know not how it may concern some few sick men but for my part generally for all I should subscribe to that custom of the Romans to make a sparing dinner and a liberal supper all their preparation and invitation was still at supper no mention of dinner Many reasons I could give but when all is said pro and con twenty nine forty nine Cardan s rule is best to keep that we are accustomed unto though it be naught and to follow our disposition and appetite in some things is not amiss to eat sometimes of a dish which is hurtful if we have an extraordinary liking to it Alexander Severus loved hares and apples above all other meats as twenty nine fifty Lampridius relates in his life one pope pork another peacock c what harm came of it I conclude our own experience is the best physician that diet which is most propitious to one is often pernicious to another such is the variety of palates humours and temperatures let every man observe and be a law unto himself Tiberius in twenty nine fifty one Tacitus did laugh at all such that thirty years of age would ask counsel of others concerning matters of diet I say the same These few rules of diet he that keeps shall surely find great ease and speedy remedy by it It is a wonder to relate that prodigious temperance of some hermits anchorites and fathers of the church he that shall but read their lives written by Hierom Athanasius c how abstemious heathens have been in this kind those Curii and Fabritii those old philosophers as Pliny records lib eleven Xenophon lib one de vit Socrat Emperors and kings as Nicephorus relates Eccles hist lib eighteen cap eight of Mauritius Ludovicus Pius c and that admirable twenty nine fifty two example of Ludovicus Cornarus a patrician of Venice cannot but admire them This have they done voluntarily and in health what shall these private men do that are visited with sickness and necessarily twenty nine fifty three enjoined to recover and continue their health It is a hard thing to observe a strict diet et qui medice vivit misere vivit twenty nine fifty four as the saying is quale hoc ipsum erit vivere his si privatus fueris as good be buried as so much debarred of his appetite excessit medicina malum the physic is more troublesome than the disease so he complained in the poet so thou thinkest yet he that loves himself will easily endure this little misery to avoid a greater inconvenience e malis minimum better do this than do worse And as twenty nine fifty five Tully holds better be a temperate old man than a lascivious youth Tis the only sweet thing which he adviseth so to moderate ourselves that we may have senectutem in juventute et in juventute senectutem be youthful in our old age staid in our youth discreet and temperate in both MEMB II Retention and Evacuation

Romans had their public baths very sumptuous and stupend as those of Antoninus and Diocletian Plin thirty six saith there were an infinite number of them in Rome and mightily frequented some bathed seven times a day as Commodus the emperor is reported to have done usually twice a day and they were after anointed with most costly ointments rich women bathed themselves in milk some in the milk of

hundred thirty seven et two hundred thirty nine he exhorteth to the same but with this caution twenty nine seventy eight that the liver be outwardly anointed with some coolers that it be not overheated But these baths must be warily frequented by melancholy persons or if used to such as are very cold of themselves for as Gabelius concludes of all Dutch baths and especially of those of Baden they are good for all cold diseases twenty nine seventy nine naught for choleric hot and dry and all infirmities proceeding of choler inflammations of the spleen and liver Our English baths as they are hot must needs incur the same censure but D Turner of old and D Jones have written at large of them Of cold baths I find little or no mention in any physician some speak against them twenty nine eighty Cardan alone out of Agathinus commends bathing in fresh rivers and cold waters and adviseth all such as mean to live long to use it for it agrees with all ages and complexions and is most profitable for hot temperatures As for sweating urine bloodletting by haemrods or otherwise I shall elsewhere more opportunely speak of them Immoderate Venus in excess as it is a cause or in defect so

signs and preservers of health temperance in this kind twenty nine eighty nine to rise with an appetite to be ready to work and abstain from venery tria saluberrima are three most healthful things We

many a circuit in the air still soaring higher and higher till he be come to his full pitch and in the end when the game is sprung comes down amain and stoops upon a sudden so will I having now come at last into these ample fields of air wherein I may freely expatiate and exercise myself for my recreation awhile rove wander round about the world mount aloft to those ethereal orbs and celestial spheres and so descend to my former elements again In which progress I will first see whether that relation of the friar of twenty nine ninety seven Oxford be true concerning those northern parts under the pole if I meet obiter with the wandering Jew Elias Artifex or Lucian s Icaromenippus they shall be my guides whether there be such four Euripes and a great rock of loadstones which may cause the needle in the compass still to bend that way and what should be the true cause of the variation of the compass twenty nine ninety eight is it a magnetical rock or the pole star as Cardan will or some other star in the bear as Marsilius Ficinus or a magnetical meridian as Maurolieus Vel situs in vena terrae as Agricola or the nearness of the next continent as Cabeus will or some other cause as Scaliger Cortesius Conimbricenses Peregrinus contend why at the Azores it looks directly north otherwise not In the Mediterranean or Levant as some observe it varies seven grad by and by twelve and then twenty two In the Baltic Seas near Rasceburg in Finland the needle runs round if any ships come that way though twenty nine ninety nine Martin Ridley write otherwise that the needle near the Pole will hardly be forced from his direction Tis fit to be inquired whether certain rules may be made of it as eleven grad Lond variat alibi thirty six c and that which is more prodigious the variation varies in the same place now taken accurately tis so much after a few years quite altered from that it was till we have better intelligence let our doctor Gilbert and Nicholas three thousand Cabeus the Jesuit that have both written great volumes of this subject satisfy these inquisitors Whether the sea be open and navigable by the Pole arctic and which is the likeliest way that of Bartison the Hollander under the Pole itself which for some reasons I hold best or by Fretum Davis or Nova Zembla Whether three thousand one Hudson s discovery be true of a new found ocean any likelihood of Button s Bay in fifty degrees Hubberd s Hope in sixty that of ut ultra near Sir Thomas Roe s welcome in Northwest Fox being that the sea ebbs and flows constantly there fifteen foot in twelve hours as our three thousand two new cards inform us that California is not a cape but an island and the west winds make the neap tides equal to the spring or that there be any probability to pass by the straits of Anian to China by the promontory of Tabin If there be I shall soon perceive whether three thousand three Marcus Polus the Venetian s narration be true or false of that great city of Quinsay and Cambalu whether there be any such places or that as three thousand four Matth Riccius the Jesuit hath written China and Cataia be all one the great Cham of Tartary and the king of China be the same Xuntain and Quinsay and the city of Cambalu be that new Peking or such a wall four hundred leagues long to part China from Tartary whether three thousand five Presbyter John be in Asia or Africa M Polus Venetus puts him in Asia three thousand six the most received opinion is that he is emperor of the Abyssines which of old was Ethiopia now Nubia under the equator in Africa Whether three thousand seven Guinea be an island or part of the continent or that hungry three thousand eight Spaniard s discovery of Terra Australis Incognita or Magellanica be as true as that of Mercurius Britannius or his of Utopia or his of Lucinia And yet in likelihood it may be so for without all question it being extended from the tropic of Capricorn to the circle Antarctic and lying as it doth in the temperate zone cannot choose but yield in time some flourishing kingdoms to succeeding ages as America did unto the Spaniards Shouten and Le Meir have done well in the discovery of the Straits of Magellan in finding a more convenient passage to Mare pacificum methinks some of our modern argonauts should prosecute the rest As I go by Madagascar I would see that great bird three thousand nine ruck that can carry a man and horse or an elephant with that Arabian phoenix described by three thousand ten Adricomius see the pelicans of Egypt those Scythian gryphes in Asia and afterwards in Africa examine the fountains of Nilus whether Herodotus three thousand eleven Seneca Plin lib five cap nine Strabo lib five give a true cause of his annual flowing three thousand twelve Pagaphetta discourse rightly of it or of Niger and Senegal examine Cardan three thousand thirteen Scaliger s reasons and the rest Is it from those Etesian winds or melting of snow in the mountains under the equator for Jordan yearly overflows when the snow melts in Mount Libanus or from those great dropping perpetual showers which are so frequent to the inhabitants within the tropics when the sun is vertical and cause such vast inundations in Senegal Maragnan Oronoco and the rest of those great rivers in Zona Torrida which have all commonly the same passions at set times and by good husbandry and policy hereafter no doubt may come to be as populous as well tilled as fruitful as Egypt itself or Cauchinthina I would observe all those motions of the sea and from what cause they proceed from the moon as the vulgar hold or earth s motion which Galileus in the fourth dialogue of his system of the world so eagerly proves and firmly demonstrates or winds as three thousand fourteen some will Why in that quiet ocean of Zur in mari pacifico it is scarce perceived in our British seas most violent in the Mediterranean and Red Sea so vehement irregular and diverse Why the current in that Atlantic Ocean should still be in some places from in some again towards the north and why they come sooner than go and so from Moabar to Madagascar in that Indian Ocean the merchants come in three weeks as three thousand fifteen Scaliger discusseth they return scarce in three months with the same or like winds the continual current is from east to west Whether Mount Athos Pelion Olympus Ossa Caucasus Atlas be so high as Pliny Solinus Mela relate above clouds meteors ubi nec aurae nec venti spirant insomuch that they that ascend die suddenly very often the air is so subtile twelve fifty paces high according to that measure of Dicearchus or seventy eight miles perpendicularly high as Jacobus Mazonius sec three et four expounding that place of Aristotle about Caucasus and as three thousand sixteen Blancanus the Jesuit contends out of Clavius and Nonius demonstrations de Crepusculis or rather thirty two stadiums as the most received opinion is or four miles which the height of no mountain doth perpendicularly exceed and is equal to the greatest depths of the sea which is as Scaliger holds fifteen eighty paces Exer thirty eight others one hundred paces I would see those inner parts of America whether there be any such great city of Manoa or Eldorado in that golden empire where the highways are as much beaten one reports as between Madrid and Valadolid in Spain or any such Amazons as he relates or gigantic Patagones in Chica with that miraculous mountain three thousand seventeen Ybouyapab in the Northern Brazil cujus jugum sternitur in amoenissimam planitiem c or that of Pariacacca so high elevated in Peru three thousand eighteen The peak of Tenerife how high it is seventy miles or fifty as Patricius holds or nine as Snellius demonstrates in his Eratosthenes see that strange three thousand nineteen Cirknickzerksey lake in Carniola whose waters gush so fast out of the ground that they will overtake a swift horseman and by and by with as incredible celerity are supped up which Lazius and Wernerus make an argument of the Argonauts sailing under ground And that vast den or hole called three thousand twenty Esmellen in Muscovia quae visitur horriendo hiatu c which if anything casually fall in makes such a roaring noise that no thunder or ordnance or warlike engine can make the like such another is Gilber s Cave in Lapland with many the like I would examine the Caspian Sea and see where and how it exonerates itself after it hath taken in Volga Jaxares Oxus and those great rivers at the mouth of Oby or where What vent the Mexican lake hath the Titicacan in Peru or that circular pool in the vale of Terapeia of which Acosta l three c sixteen hot in a cold country the spring of which boils up in the middle twenty foot square and hath no vent but exhalation and that of Mare mortuum in Palestine of Thrasymene at Peruzium in Italy the Mediterranean itself For from the ocean at the Straits of Gibraltar there is a perpetual current into the Levant and so likewise by the Thracian Bosphorus out of the Euxine or Black Sea besides all those great rivers of Nile Po Rhone c how is this water consumed by the sun or otherwise I would find out with Trajan the fountains of Danube of Ganges Oxus see those Egyptian pyramids Trajan s bridge Grotto de Sybilla Lucullus s fishponds the temple of Nidrose c And if I could observe what becomes of swallows storks cranes cuckoos nightingales redstarts and many other kind of singing birds water fowls hawks c some of them are only seen in summer some in winter some are observed in the three thousand twenty one snow and at no other times each have their seasons In winter not a bird is in Muscovy to be found but at the spring in an instant the woods and hedges are full of them saith three thousand twenty two Herbastein how comes it to pass Do they sleep in winter like Gesner s Alpine mice or do they lie hid as three thousand twenty three Olaus affirms in the bottom of lakes and rivers spiritum continentes often so found by fishermen in Poland and Scandia two together mouth to mouth wing to wing and when the spring comes they revive again or if they be brought into a stove or to the fireside Or do they follow the sun as Peter Martyr legat Babylonica l two manifestly convicts out of his own knowledge for when he was ambassador in Egypt he saw swallows Spanish kites three thousand twenty four and many such other European birds in December and January very familiarly flying and in great abundance about Alexandria ubi floridae tunc arbores ac viridaria Or lie they hid in caves rocks and hollow trees as most think in deep tin mines or sea cliffs as three thousand twenty five mister Carew gives out I conclude of them all for my part as three thousand twenty six Munster doth of cranes and storks whence they come whither they go incompertum adhuc as yet we know not We see them here some in summer some in winter their coming and going is sure in the night in the plains of Asia saith he the storks meet on such a set day he that comes last is torn in pieces and so they get them gone Many strange places Isthmi Euripi Chersonesi creeks havens promontories straits Lakes baths rocks mountains places and fields where cities have been ruined or swallowed battles fought creatures sea monsters remora c minerals vegetals Zoophytes were fit to be considered in such an expedition and amongst the rest that of three thousand twenty seven Harbastein his Tartar lamb three thousand twenty eight Hector Boethius goosebearing tree in the orchards to which Cardan lib seven cap thirty six de rerum varietat subscribes three thousand twenty nine Vertomannus wonderful palm that three thousand thirty fly in Hispaniola that shines like a torch in the night that one may well see to write those spherical stones in Cuba which nature hath so made and those like birds beasts fishes crowns swords saws pots c usually found in the metal mines in Saxony about Mansfield and in Poland near Nokow and Pallukie as three thousand thirty one Munster and others relate Many rare creatures and novelties each part of the world affords amongst the rest I would know for a certain whether there be any such men as Leo Suavius in his comment on Paracelsus de sanit tuend and three thousand thirty two Gaguinus records in his description of Muscovy that in Lucomoria a province in Russia lie fast asleep as dead all winter from the twenty seven of November like frogs and swallows benumbed with cold but about the twenty four of April in the spring they revive again and go about their business I would examine that demonstration of Alexander Picolomineus whether the earth s superficies be bigger than the seas or that of Archimedes be true the superficies of all water is even Search the depth and see that variety of sea monsters and fishes mermaids seamen horses c which it affords Or whether that be true which Jordanus Brunus scoffs at that if God did not detain it the sea would overflow the earth by reason of his higher site and which Josephus Blancanus the Jesuit in his interpretation on those mathematical places of Aristotle foolishly fears and in a just tract proves by many circumstances that in time the sea will waste away the land and all the globe of the earth shall be covered with waters risum teneatis amici what the sea takes away in one place it adds in another Methinks he might rather suspect the sea should in time be filled by land trees grow up carcasses c that all devouring fire omnia devorans et consumens will sooner cover and dry up the vast ocean with sand and ashes I would examine the true seat of that terrestrial three thousand thirty three paradise and where Ophir was whence Solomon did fetch his gold from Peruana which some suppose or that Aurea Chersonesus as Dominicus Niger Arias Montanus Goropius and others will I would censure all Pliny s Solinus Strabo s Sir John Mandeville s Olaus Magnus Marcus Polus lies correct those errors in navigation reform cosmographical charts and rectify longitudes if it were possible not by the compass as some dream with Mark Ridley in his treatise of magnetical bodies cap forty three for as Cabeus magnet philos lib three cap four fully resolves there is no hope thence yet I would observe some better means to find them out I would have a convenient place to go down with Orpheus Ulysses Hercules three thousand thirty four Lucian s Menippus at saint Patrick s purgatory at Trophonius den Hecla in Iceland Aetna in Sicily to descend and see what is done in the bowels of the earth do stones and metals grow there still how come fir trees to be three thousand thirty five digged out from tops of hills as in our mosses and marshes all over Europe How come they to dig up fish bones shells beams ironworks many fathoms under ground and anchors in mountains far remote from all seas three thousand thirty six Anno fourteen sixty at Bern in Switzerland fifty fathom deep a ship was digged out of a mountain where they got metal ore in which were forty eight carcasses of men with other merchandise That such things are ordinarily found in tops of hills Aristotle insinuates in his meteors three thousand thirty seven Pomponius Mela in his first book c de Numidia and familiarly in the Alps saith three thousand thirty eight Blancanus the Jesuit the like is to be seen came this from earthquakes or from Noah s flood as Christians suppose or is there a vicissitude of sea and land as Anaximenes held of old the mountains of Thessaly would become seas and seas again mountains The whole world belike should be new moulded when it seemed good to those all commanding powers and turned inside out as we do haycocks in harvest top to bottom or bottom to top or as we turn apples to the fire move the world upon his centre that which is under the poles now should be translated to the equinoctial and that which is under the torrid zone to the circle arctic and antarctic another while and so be reciprocally warmed by the sun or if the worlds be infinite and every fixed star a sun with his compassing planets as Brunus and Campanella conclude cast three or four worlds into one or else of one world make three or four new as it shall seem to them best To proceed if the earth be twenty one thousand five hundred miles in three thousand thirty nine compass its diameter is seven thousand from us to our antipodes and what shall be comprehended in all that space What is the centre of the earth is it pure element only as Aristotle decrees inhabited as three thousand forty Paracelsus thinks with creatures whose chaos is the earth or with fairies as the woods and waters according to him are with nymphs or as the air with spirits Dionisiodorus a mathematician in three thousand forty one Pliny that sent a letter ad superos after he was dead from the centre of the earth to signify what distance the same centre was from the superficies of the same viz forty two thousand stadiums might have done well to have satisfied all these doubts Or is it the place of hell as Virgil in his Aenides Plato Lucian Dante and others poetically describe it and as many of our divines think In good earnest Anthony Rusca one of the society of that Ambrosian College in Milan in his great volume de Inferno lib one cap forty seven is stiff in this tenet tis a corporeal fire tow cap five I two as he there disputes Whatsoever philosophers write saith three thousand forty two Surius there be certain mouths of hell and places appointed for the punishment of men s souls as at Hecla in Iceland where the ghosts of dead men are familiarly seen and sometimes talk with the living God would have such visible places that mortal men might be certainly informed that there be such punishments after death and learn hence to fear God Kranzius Dan hist lib two cap twenty four subscribes to this opinion of Surius so doth Colerus cap twelve lib de immortal animae out of the authority belike of saint Gregory Durand and the rest of the schoolmen who derive as much from Aetna in Sicily Lipari Hiera and those sulphureous vulcanian islands making Terra del Fuego and those frequent volcanoes in America of which Acosta lib three cap twenty four that fearful mount Hecklebirg in Norway an especial argument to prove it three thousand forty three where lamentable screeches and howlings are continually heard which strike a terror to the auditors fiery chariots are commonly seen to bring in the souls of men in the likeness of crows and devils ordinarily go in and out Such another proof is that place near the Pyramids in Egypt by Cairo as well to confirm this as the resurrection mentioned by three thousand forty four Kornmannus mirac mort lib one cap thirty Camerarius oper suc cap thirty seven Bredenbachius pereg ter sanct and some others where once a year dead bodies arise about March and walk after awhile hide themselves again thousands of people come yearly to see them But these and such like testimonies others reject as fables illusions of spirits and they will have no such local known place more than Styx or Phlegethon Pluto s court or that poetical Infernus where Homer s soul was seen hanging on a tree c to which they ferried over in Charon s boat or went down at Hermione in Greece compendiaria ad Infernos via which is the shortest cut quia nullum a mortuis naulum eo loci exposcunt saith three thousand forty five Gerbelius and besides there were no fees to be paid Well then is it hell or purgatory as Bellarmine or Limbus patrum as Gallucius will and as Rusca will for they have made maps of it three thousand forty six or Ignatius parler Virgil sometimes bishop of Saltburg as Aventinus anno seven hundred forty five relates by Bonifacius bishop of Mentz was therefore called in question because he held antipodes which they made a doubt whether Christ died for and so by that means took away the seat of hell or so contracted it that it could bear no proportion to heaven and contradicted that opinion of Austin Basil Lactantius that held the earth round as a trencher whom Acosta and common experience more largely confute but not as a ball and Jerusalem where Christ died the middle of it or Delos as the fabulous Greeks feigned because when Jupiter let two eagles loose to fly from the world s ends east and west they met at Delos But that scruple of Bonifacius is now quite taken away by our latter divines Franciscus Ribera in cap fourteen Apocalyps will have hell a material and local fire in the centre of the earth two hundred Italian miles in diameter as he defines it out of those words Exivit sanguis de terra per stadia mille sexcenta c But Lessius lib thirteen de moribus divinis cap twenty four will have this local hell far less one Dutch mile in diameter all filled with fire and brimstone because as he there demonstrates that space cubically multiplied will make a sphere able to hold eight hundred thousand millions of damned bodies allowing each body six foot square which will abundantly suffice Cum cerium sit inquit facta subductione non futuros centies mille milliones damnandorum But if it be no material fire as Sco Thomas Bonaventure Soncinas Voscius and others argue it may be there or elsewhere as Keckerman disputes System Theol for sure somewhere it is certum est alicubi etsi definitus circulus non assignetur I will end the controversy in three thousand forty seven Austin s words Better doubt of things concealed than to contend about uncertainties where Abraham s bosom is and hell fire three thousand forty eight Vix a mansuetis a contentiosis nunquam invenitur scarce the meek the contentious shall never find If it be solid earth tis the fountain of metals waters which by his innate temper turns air into water which springs up in several chinks to moisten the earth s superficies and that in a tenfold proportion as Aristotle holds or else these fountains come directly from the sea by three thousand forty nine secret passages and so made fresh again by running through the bowels of the earth and are either thick thin hot cold as the matter or minerals are by which they pass or as Peter Martyr Ocean Decad lib nine and some others hold from three thousand fifty abundance of rain that falls or from that ambient heat and cold which alters that inward heat and so per consequens the generation of waters Or else it may be full of wind or a sulphureous innate fire as our meteorologists inform us which sometimes breaking out causeth those horrible earthquakes which are so frequent in these days in Japan China and oftentimes swallow up whole cities Let Lucian s Menippus consult with or ask of Tiresias if you will not believe philosophers he shall clear all your doubts when he makes a second voyage In the mean time let us consider of that which is sub dio and find out a true cause if it be possible of such accidents meteors alterations as happen above ground Whence proceed that variety of manners and a distinct character as it were to several nations Some are wise subtile witty others dull sad and heavy some big some little as Tully de Fato Plato in Timaeo Vegetius and Bodine prove at large method cap five some soft and some hardy barbarous civil black dun white is it from the air from the soil influence of stars or some other secret cause Why doth Africa breed so many venomous beasts Ireland none Athens owls Crete none three thousand fifty one Why hath Daulis and Thebes no swallows so Pausanius informeth us as well as the rest of Greece three thousand fifty two Ithaca no hares Pontus asses Scythia swine whence comes this variety of complexions colours plants birds beasts three thousand fifty three metals peculiar almost to every place Why so many thousand strange birds and beasts proper to America alone as Acosta demands lib four cap thirty six were they created in the six days or ever in Noah s ark if there why are they not dispersed and found in other countries It is a thing saith he hath long held me in suspense no Greek Latin Hebrew ever heard of them before and yet as differing from our European animals as an egg and a chestnut and which is more kine horses sheep c till the Spaniards brought them were never heard of in those parts How comes it to pass that in the same site in one latitude to such as are Perioeci there should be such difference of soil complexion colour metal air c The Spaniards are white and so are Italians when as the inhabitants about three thousand fifty four Caput bonae spei are blackamoors and yet both alike distant from the equator nay they that dwell in the same parallel line with these Negroes as about the Straits of Magellan are white coloured and yet some in Presbyter John s country in Ethiopia are dun they in Zeilan and Malabar parallel with them again black Manamotapa in Africa and saint Thomas Isle are extreme hot both under the line coal black their inhabitants whereas in Peru they are quite opposite in colour very temperate or rather cold and yet both alike elevated Moscow in fifty three degrees of latitude extreme cold as those northern countries usually are having one perpetual hard frost all winter long and in fifty two deg lat sometimes hard frost and snow all summer as Button s Bay c or by fits and yet three thousand fifty five England near the same latitude and Ireland very moist warm and more temperate in winter than Spain Italy or France Is it the sea that causeth this difference and the air that comes from it Why then is three thousand fifty six Ister so cold near the Euxine Pontus Bithynia and all Thrace frigidas regiones Maginus calls them and yet their latitude is but forty two which should be hot three thousand fifty seven Quevira or Nova Albion in America bordering on the sea was so cold in July that our three thousand fifty eight Englishmen could hardly endure it At Noremberga in forty five lat all the sea is frozen ice and yet in a more southern latitude than ours New England and the island of Cambrial Colchos which that noble gentleman mister Vaughan or Orpheus junior describes in his Golden Fleece is in the same latitude with little Britain in France and yet their winter begins not till January their spring till May which search he accounts worthy of an astrologer is this from the easterly winds or melting of ice and snow dissolved within the circle arctic or that the air being thick is longer before it be warm by the sunbeams and once heated like an oven will keep itself from cold Our climes breed lice three thousand fifty nine Hungary and Ireland male audiunt in this kind come to the Azores by a secret virtue of that air they are instantly consumed and all our European vermin almost saith Ortelius Egypt is watered with Nilus not far from the sea and yet there it seldom or never rains Rhodes an island of the same nature yields not a cloud and yet our islands ever dropping and inclining to rain The Atlantic Ocean is still subject to storms but in Del Zur or Mare pacifico seldom or never any Is it from tropic stars apertio portarum in the dodecotemories or constellations the moon s mansions such aspects of planets such winds or dissolving air or thick air which causeth this and the like differences of heat and cold Bodin relates of a Portugal ambassador that coming from three thousand sixty Lisbon to three thousand sixty one Danzig in Spruce found greater heat there than at any time at home Don Garcia de Sylva legate to Philip III king of Spain residing at Ispahan in Persia sixteen nineteen in his letter to the Marquess of Bedmar makes mention of greater cold in Ispahan whose lat is thirty one gr than ever he felt in Spain or any part of Europe The torrid zone was by our predecessors held to be uninhabitable but by our modern travellers found to be most temperate bedewed with frequent rains and moistening showers the breeze and cooling blasts in some parts as three thousand sixty two Acosta describes most pleasant and fertile Arica in Chile is by report one of the sweetest places that ever the sun shined on Olympus terrae a heaven on earth how incomparably do some extol Mexico in Nova Hispania Peru Brazil c in some again hard dry sandy barren a very desert and still in the same latitude Many times we find great diversity of air in the same three thousand sixty three country by reason of the site to seas hills or dales want of water nature of soil and the like as in Spain Arragon is aspera et sicca harsh and evil inhabited Estremadura is dry sandy barren most part extreme hot by reason of his plains Andalusia another paradise Valencia a most pleasant air and continually green so is it about three thousand sixty four Granada on the one side fertile plains on the other continual snow to be seen all summer long on the hill tops That their houses in the Alps are three quarters of the year covered with snow who knows not That Tenerife is so cold at the top extreme hot at the bottom Mons Atlas in Africa Libanus in Palestine with many such tantos inter ardores fidos nivibus three thousand sixty five Tacitus calls them and Radzivilus epist two fol twenty seven yields it to be far hotter there than in any part of Italy tis true but they are highly elevated near the middle region and therefore cold ob paucam solarium radiorum refractionem as Serrarius answers com in three cap Josua quaest five Abulensis quaest thirty seven In the heat of summer in the king s palace in Escurial the air is most temperate by reason of a cold blast which comes from the snowy mountains of Sierra de Cadarama hard by when as in Toledo it is very hot so in all other countries The causes of these alterations are commonly by reason of their nearness I say to the middle region but this diversity of air in places equally situated elevated and distant from the pole can hardly be satisfied with that diversity of plants birds beasts which is so familiar with us with Indians everywhere the sun is equally distant the same vertical stars the same irradiations of planets aspects like the same nearness of seas the same superficies the same soil or not much different Under the equator itself amongst the Sierras Andes Lanos as Herrera Laet and three thousand sixty six Acosta contend there is tam mirabilis et inopinata varietas such variety of weather ut merito exerceat ingenia that no philosophy can yet find out the true cause of it When I consider how temperate it is in one place saith three thousand sixty seven Acosta within the tropic of Capricorn as about Laplata and yet hard by at Potosi in that same altitude mountainous alike extreme cold extreme hot in Brazil c Hic ego saith Acosta philosophiam Aristotelis meteorologicam vehementer irrisi cum c when the sun comes nearest to them they have great tempests storms thunder and lightning great store of rain snow and the foulest weather when the sun is vertical their rivers overflow the morning fair and hot noonday cold and moist all which is opposite to us How comes it to pass Scaliger poetices l three c sixteen discourseth thus of this subject How comes or wherefore is this temeraria siderum dispositio this rash placing of stars or as Epicurus will fortuita or accidental Why are some big some little why are they so confusedly unequally situated in the heavens and set so much out of order In all other things nature is equal proportionable and constant there be justae dimensiones et prudens partium dispositio as in the fabric of man his eyes ears nose face members are correspondent cur non idem coelo opere omnium pulcherrimo Why are the heavens so irregular neque paribus molibus neque paribus intervallis whence is this difference Diversos he concludes efficere locorum Genios to make diversity of countries soils manners customs characters and constitutions among us ut quantum vicinia ad charitatem addat sidera distrahant ad perniciem and so by this means fluvio vel monte distincti sunt dissimiles the same places almost shall be distinguished in manners But this reason is weak and most insufficient The fixed stars are removed since Ptolemy s time twenty six gr from the first of Aries and if the earth be immovable as their site varies so should countries vary and diverse alterations would follow But this we perceive not as in Tully s time with us in Britain coelum visu foedum et in quo facile generantur nubes c tis so still Wherefore Bodine Theat nat lib two and some others will have all these alterations and effects immediately to proceed from those genii spirits angels which rule and domineer in several places they cause storms thunder lightning earthquakes ruins tempests great winds floods c the philosophers of Conimbra will refer this diversity to the influence of that empyrean heaven for some say the eccentricity of the sun is come nearer to the earth than in Ptolemy s time the virtue therefore of all the vegetals is decayed three thousand sixty eight men grow less c There are that observe new motions of the heavens new stars palantia sidera comets clouds call them what you will like those Medicean Burbonian Austrian planets lately detected which do not decay but come and go rise higher and lower hide and show themselves amongst the fixed stars amongst the planets above and beneath the moon at set times now nearer now farther off together asunder as he that plays upon a sackbut by pulling it up and down alters his tones and tunes do they their stations and places though to us undiscerned and from those motions proceed as they conceive diverse alterations Clavius conjectures otherwise but they be but conjectures About Damascus in Coeli Syria is a three thousand sixty nine Paradise by reason of the plenty of waters in promptu causa est and the deserts of Arabia barren because of rocks rolling seas of sands and dry mountains quod inaquosa saith Adricomius montes habens asperos saxosos praecipites horroris et mortis speciem prae se ferentes uninhabitable therefore of men birds beasts void of all green trees plants and fruits a vast rocky horrid wilderness which by no art can be manured tis evident Bohemia is cold for that it lies all along to the north But why should it be so hot in Egypt or there never rain Why should those three thousand seventy etesian and northeastern winds blow continually and constantly so long together in some places at set times one way still in the dog days only here perpetual drought there dropping showers here foggy mists there a pleasant air here three thousand seventy one terrible thunder and lightning at such set seasons here frozen seas all the year there open in the same latitude to the rest no such thing nay quite opposite is to be found Sometimes as in three thousand seventy two Peru on the one side of the mountains it is hot on the other cold here snow there wind with infinite such Fromundus in his Meteors will excuse or solve all this by the sun s motion but when there is such diversity to such as Perioeci or very near site how can that position hold Who can give a reason of this diversity of meteors that it should rain three thousand seventy three stones frogs mice c Rats which they call lemmer in Norway and are manifestly observed as three thousand seventy four Munster writes by the inhabitants to descend and fall with some feculent showers and like so many locusts consume all that is green Leo Afer speaks as much of locusts about Fez in Barbary there be infinite swarms in their fields upon a sudden so at Aries in France fifteen fifty three the like happened by the same mischief all their grass and fruits were devoured magna incolarum admiratione et consternatione as Valleriola obser med lib one obser one relates coelum subito obumbrabant c he concludes three thousand seventy five it could not be from natural causes they cannot imagine whence they come but from heaven Are these and such creatures corn wood stones worms wool blood c lifted up into the middle region by the sunbeams as three thousand seventy six Baracellus the physician disputes and thence let fall with showers or there engendered three thousand seventy seven Cornelius Gemma is of that opinion they are there conceived by celestial influences others suppose they are immediately from God or prodigies raised by art and illusions of spirits which are princes of the air to whom Bodin lib two Theat Nat subscribes In fine of meteors in general Aristotle s reasons are exploded by Bernardinus Telesius by Paracelsus his principles confuted and other causes assigned sal sulphur mercury in which his disciples are so expert that they can alter elements and separate at their pleasure make perpetual motions not as Cardan Tasneir Peregrinus by some magnetical virtue but by mixture of elements imitate thunder like Salmoneus snow hail the sea s ebbing and flowing give life to creatures as they say without generation and what not P Nonius Saluciensis and Kepler take upon them to demonstrate that no meteors clouds fogs three thousand seventy eight vapours arise higher than fifty or eighty miles and all the rest to be purer air or element of fire which three thousand seventy nine Cardan three thousand eighty Tycho and three thousand eighty one John Pena manifestly confute by refractions and many other arguments there is no such element of fire at all If as Tycho proves the moon be distant from us fifty and sixty semi diameters of the earth and as Peter Nonius will have it the air be so angust what proportion is there betwixt the other three elements and it To what use serves it Is it full of spirits which inhabit it as the Paracelsians and Platonists hold the higher the more noble three thousand eighty two full of birds or a mere vacuum to no purpose It is much controverted between Tycho Brahe and Christopher Rotman the landgrave of Hesse s mathematician in their astronomical epistles whether it be the same Diaphanum clearness matter of air and heavens or two distinct essences Christopher Rotman John Pena Jordanus Brunus with many other late mathematicians contend it is the same and one matter throughout saving that the higher still the purer it is and more subtile as they find by experience in the top of some hills in three thousand eighty three America if a man ascend he faints instantly for want of thicker air to refrigerate the heart Acosta l three c nine calls this mountain Periacaca in Peru it makes men cast and vomit he saith that climb it as some other of those Andes do in the deserts of Chile for five hundred miles together and for extremity of cold to lose their fingers and toes Tycho will have two distinct matters of heaven and air but to say truth with some small qualification they have one and the self same opinion about the essence and matter of heavens that it is not hard and impenetrable as peripatetics hold transparent of a quinta essentia three thousand eighty four but that it is penetrable and soft as the air itself is and that the planets move in it as birds in the air fishes in the sea This they prove by motion of comets and otherwise though Claremontius in his Antitycho stiffly opposes which are not generated as Aristotle teacheth in the aerial region of a hot and dry exhalation and so consumed but as Anaxagoras and Democritus held of old of a celestial matter and as three thousand eighty five Tycho three thousand eighty six Eliseus Roeslin Thaddeus Haggesius Pena Rotman Fracastorius demonstrate by their progress parallaxes refractions motions of the planets which interfere and cut one another s orbs now higher and then lower as Symbol Mars amongst the rest which sometimes as three thousand eighty seven Kepler confirms by his own and Tycho s accurate observations comes nearer the earth than the Symbol Sun and is again eftsoons aloft in Jupiter s orb and three thousand eighty eight other sufficient reasons far above the moon exploding in the meantime that element of fire those fictitious first watery movers those heavens I mean above the firmament which Delrio Lodovicus Imola Patricius and many of the fathers affirm those monstrous orbs of eccentrics and Eccentre Epicycles deserentes Which howsoever Ptolemy Alhasen Vitellio Purbachius Maginus Clavius and many of their associates stiffly maintain to be real orbs eccentric concentric circles aequant c are absurd and ridiculous For who is so mad to think that there should be so many circles like subordinate wheels in a clock all impenetrable and hard as they feign add and subtract at their pleasure three thousand eighty nine Maginus makes eleven heavens subdivided into their orbs and circles and all too little to serve those particular appearances Fracastorius seventy two homocentrics Tycho Brahe Nicholas Ramerus Heliseus Roeslin have peculiar hypotheses of their own inventions and they be but inventions as most of them acknowledge as we admit of equators tropics colures circles arctic and antarctic for doctrine s sake though Ramus thinks them all unnecessary they will have them supposed only for method and order Tycho hath feigned I know not how many subdivisions of epicycles in epicycles c to calculate and express the moon s motion but when all is done as a supposition and no otherwise not as he holds hard impenetrable subtile transparent c or making music as Pythagoras maintained of old and Robert Constantine of late but still quiet liquid open c If the heavens then be penetrable as these men deliver and no lets it were not amiss in this aerial progress to make wings and fly up which that Turk in Busbequius made his fellow citizens in Constantinople believe he would perform and some new fangled wits methinks should some time or other find out or if that may not be yet with a Galileo s glass or Icaromenippus wings in Lucian command the spheres and heavens and see what is done amongst them Whether there be generation and corruption as some think by reason of ethereal comets that in Cassiopea fifteen seventy two that in Cygno sixteen hundred that in Sagittarius sixteen oh four and many like which by no means Jul Caesar la Galla that Italian philosopher in his physical disputation with Galileis de phenomenis in orbe lunae cap nine will admit or that they were created ab initio and show themselves at set times and as three thousand ninety Helisaeus Roeslin contends have poles axle trees circles of their own and regular motions For non pereunt sed minuuntur et disparent three thousand ninety one Blancanus holds they come and go by fits casting their tails still from the sun some of them as a burning glass projects the sunbeams from it though not always neither for sometimes a comet casts his tail from Venus as Tycho observes And as three thousand ninety two Helisaeus Roeslin of some others from the moon with little stars about them ad stuporem astronomorum cum multis aliis in coelo miraculis all which argue with those Medicean Austrian and Burbonian stars that the heaven of the planets is indistinct pure and open in which the planets move certis legibus ac metis Examine likewise An coelum sit coloratum Whether the stars be of that bigness distance as astronomers relate so many in three thousand ninety three number ten twenty six or seventeen twenty five as J Bayerus or as some Rabbins twenty nine thousand myriads or as Galileo discovers by his glasses infinite and that via lactea a confused light of small stars like so many nails in a door or all in a row like those twelve thousand isles of the Maldives in the Indian ocean Whether the least visible star in the eighth sphere be eighteen times bigger than the earth and as Tycho calculates fourteen thousand semi diameters distant from it Whether they be thicker parts of the orbs as Aristotle delivers or so many habitable worlds as Democritus Whether they have light of their own or from the sun or give light round as Patritius discourseth An aeque distent a centra mundi Whether light be of their essence and that light be a substance or an accident Whether they be hot by themselves or by accident cause heat Whether there be such a precession of the equinoxes as Copernicus holds or that the eighth sphere move An bene philosophentur R Bacon and J Dee Aphorism de multiplicatione specierum Whether there be any such images ascending with each degree of the zodiac in the east as Aliacensis feigns An aqua super coelum as Patritius and the schoolmen will a crystalline three thousand ninety four watery heaven which is three thousand ninety five certainly to be understood of that in the middle region for otherwise if at Noah s flood the water came from thence it must be above a hundred years falling down to us as three thousand ninety six some calculate Besides An terra sit animata which some so confidently believe with Orpheus Hermes Averroes from which all other souls of men beasts devils plants fishes c are derived and into which again after some revolutions as Plato in his Timaeus Plotinus in his Enneades more largely discuss they return see Chalcidius and Bennius Plato s commentators as all philosophical matter in materiam primam Keplerus Patritius and some other Neoterics have in part revived this opinion And that every star in heaven hath a soul angel or intelligence to animate or move it c Or to omit all smaller controversies as matters of less moment and examine that main paradox of the earth s motion now so much in question Aristarchus Samius Pythagoras maintained it of old Democritus and many of their scholars Didacus Astunica Anthony Fascarinus a Carmelite and some other commentators will have Job to insinuate as much cap nine ver four Qui commovet terram de loco suo c and that this one place of scripture makes more for the earth s motion than all the other prove against it whom Pineda confutes most contradict Howsoever it is revived since by Copernicus not as a truth but a supposition as he himself confesseth in the preface to pope Nicholas but now maintained in good earnest by three thousand ninety seven Calcagninus Telesius Kepler Rotman Gilbert Digges Galileo Campanella and especially by three thousand ninety eight Lansbergius naturae rationi et veritati consentaneum by Origanus and some three thousand ninety nine others of his followers For if the earth be the centre of the world stand still and the heavens move as the most received three thousand one hundred opinion is which they call inordinatam coeli dispositionem though stiffly maintained by Tycho Ptolemeus and their adherents quis ille furor c what fury is that saith three thousand one hundred one doctor Gilbert satis animose as Cabeus notes that shall drive the heavens about with such incomprehensible celerity in twenty four hours when as every point of the firmament and in the equator must needs move so three thousand one hundred two Clavius calculates one hundred seventy six thousand six hundred sixty in one two hundred and forty sixth part of an hour and an arrow out of a bow must go seven times about the earth whilst a man can say an Ave Maria if it keep the same space or compass the earth eighteen eighty four times in an hour which is supra humanam cogitationem beyond human conceit ocyor et jaculo et ventos aequante sagitta A man could not ride so much ground going forty miles a day in twenty nine oh four years as the firmament goes in twenty three hours or so much in two hundred three years as the firmament in one minute quod incredibile videtur and the three thousand one hundred three pole star which to our thinking scarce moveth out of his place goeth a bigger circuit than the sun whose diameter is much larger than the diameter of the heaven of the sun and twenty thousand semi diameters of the earth from us with the rest of the fixed stars as Tycho proves To avoid therefore these impossibilities they ascribe a triple motion to the earth the sun immovable in the centre of the whole world the earth centre of the moon alone above Symbol Mars and Symbol Mercury beneath Symbol Saturn Symbol Jupiter Symbol Mars or as three thousand one hundred four Origanus and others will one single motion to the earth still placed in the centre of the world which is more probable a single motion to the firmament which moves in thirty or twenty six thousand years and so the planets Saturn in thirty years absolves his sole and proper motion Jupiter in twelve Mars in three c and so solve all appearances better than any way whatsoever calculate all motions be they in longum or latum direct stationary retrograde ascent or descent without epicycles intricate eccentrics c rectius commodiusque per unicum motum terrae saith Lansbergius much more certain than by those Alphonsine or any such tables which are grounded from those other suppositions And tis true they say according to optic principles the visible appearances of the planets do so indeed answer to their magnitudes and orbs and come nearest to mathematical observations and precedent calculations there is no repugnancy to physical axioms because no penetration of orbs but then between the sphere of Saturn and the firmament there is such an incredible and vast three thousand one hundred five space or distance seven million semi diameters of the earth as Tycho calculates void of stars and besides they do so enhance the bigness of the stars enlarge their circuit to solve those ordinary objections of parallaxes and retrogradations of the fixed stars that alteration of the poles elevation in several places or latitude of cities here on earth for say they if a man s eye were in the firmament he should not at all discern that great annual motion of the earth but it would still appear punctum indivisibile and seem to be fixed in one place of the same bigness that it is quite opposite to reason to natural philosophy and all out as absurd as disproportional so some will as prodigious as that of the sun s swift motion of heavens But hoc posito to grant this their tenet of the earth s motion if the earth move it is a planet and shines to them in the moon and to the other planetary inhabitants as the moon and they do to us upon the earth but shine she doth as Galileo three thousand one hundred six Kepler and others prove and then per consequens the rest of the planets are inhabited as well as the moon which he grants in his dissertation with Galileo s Nuncius Sidereus three thousand one hundred seven that there be Jovial and Saturn inhabitants c and those several planets have their several moons about them as the earth hath hers as Galileo hath already evinced by his glasses three thousand one hundred eight four about Jupiter two about Saturn though Sitius the Florentine Fortunius Licetus and Jul Caesar le Galla cavil at it yet Kepler the emperor s mathematician confirms out of his experience that he saw as much by the same help and more about Mars Venus and the rest they hope to find out peradventure even amongst the fixed stars which Brunus and Brutius have already averred Then I say the earth and they be planets alike moved about the sun the common centre of the world alike and it may be those two green children which three thousand one hundred nine Nubrigensis speaks of in his time that fell from heaven came from thence and that famous stone that fell from heaven in Aristotle s time olymp eighty four anno tertio ad Capuas Fluenta recorded by Laertius and others or Ancile or buckler in Numa s time recorded by Festus We may likewise insert with Campanella and Brunus that which Pythagoras Aristarchus Samius Heraclitus Epicurus Melissus Democritus Leucippus maintained in their ages there be three thousand one hundred ten infinite worlds and infinite earths or systems in infinito aethere which three thousand one hundred eleven Eusebius collects out of their tenets because infinite stars and planets like unto this of ours which some stick not still to maintain and publicly defend sperabundus expecto innumerabilium mundorum in aeternitate per ambulationem c Nic Hill Londinensis philos Epicur For if the firmament be of such an incomparable bigness as these Copernical giants will have it infinitum aut infinito proximum so vast and full of innumerable stars as being infinite in extent one above another some higher some lower some nearer some farther off and so far asunder and those so huge and great insomuch that if the whole sphere of Saturn and all that is included in it totum aggregatum as Fromundus of Louvain in his tract de immobilitate terrae argues evehatur inter stellas videri a nobis non poterat tam immanis est distantia inter tellurem et fixas sed instar puncti c If our world be small in respect why may we not suppose a plurality of worlds those infinite stars visible in the firmament to be so many suns with particular fixed centres to have likewise their subordinate planets as the sun hath his dancing still round him which Cardinal Cusanus Walkarinus Brunus and some others have held and some still maintain Animae Aristotelismo innutritae et minutis speculationibus assuetae secus forsan c Though they seem close to us they are infinitely distant and so per consequens there are infinite habitable worlds what hinders Why should not an infinite cause as God is produce infinite effects as Nic Hill Democrit philos disputes Kepler I confess will by no means admit of Brunus s infinite worlds or that the fixed stars should be so many suns with their compassing planets yet the said three thousand one hundred twelve Kepler between jest and earnest in his perspectives lunar geography three thousand one hundred thirteen somnio suo dissertat cum nunc sider seems in part to agree with this and partly to contradict for the planets he yields them to be inhabited he doubts of the stars and so doth Tycho in his astronomical epistles out of a consideration of their vastity and greatness break out into some such like speeches that he will never believe those great and huge bodies were made to no other use than this that we perceive to illuminate the earth a point insensible in respect of the whole But who shall dwell in these vast bodies earths worlds three thousand one hundred fourteen if they be inhabited rational creatures as Kepler demands or have they souls to be saved or do they inhabit a better part of the world than we do Are we or they lords of the world And how are all things made for man Difficile est nodum hunc expedire eo quod nondum omnia quae huc pertinent explorata habemus tis hard to determine this only he proves that we are in praecipuo mundi sinu in the best place best world nearest the heart of the sun three thousand one hundred fifteen Thomas Campanella a Calabrian monk in his second book de sensu rerum cap four subscribes to this of Kepler that they are inhabited he certainly supposeth but with what kind of creatures he cannot say he labours to prove it by all means and that there are infinite worlds having made an apology for Galileo and dedicates this tenet of his to Cardinal Cajetanus Others freely speak mutter and would persuade the world as three thousand one hundred sixteen Marinus Marcenus complains that our modern divines are too severe and rigid against mathematicians ignorant and peevish in not admitting their true demonstrations and certain observations that they tyrannise over art science and all philosophy in suppressing their labours saith Pomponatius forbidding them to write to speak a truth all to maintain their superstition and for their profit s sake As for those places of Scripture which oppugn it they will have spoken ad captum vulgi and if rightly understood and favourably interpreted not at all against it and as Otho Gasman Astrol cap one part one notes many great divines besides Porphyrius Proclus Simplicius and those heathen philosophers doctrina et aetate venerandi Mosis Genesin mundanam popularis nescio cujus ruditatis quae longa absit a vera Philosophorum eruditione insimulant for Moses makes mention but of two planets Symbol Sun and Symbol Moon three four no four elements c Read more on him in three thousand one hundred seventeen Grossius and Junius But to proceed these and such like insolent and bold attempts prodigious paradoxes inferences must needs follow if it once be granted which Rotman Kepler Gilbert Diggeus Origanus Galileo and others maintain of the earth s motion that tis a planet and shines as the moon doth which contains in it three thousand one hundred eighteen both land and sea as the moon doth for so they find by their glasses that Maculae in facie Lunae the brighter parts are earth the dusky sea which Thales Plutarch and Pythagoras formerly taught and manifestly discern hills and dales and such like concavities if we may subscribe to and believe Galileo s observations But to avoid these paradoxes of the earth s motion which the Church of Rome hath lately three thousand one hundred nineteen condemned as heretical as appears by Blancanus and Fromundus s writings our latter mathematicians have rolled all the stones that may be stirred and to solve all appearances and objections have invented new hypotheses and fabricated new systems of the world out of their own Dedalaean heads Fracastorius will have the earth stand still as before and to avoid that supposition of eccentrics and epicycles he hath coined seventy two homocentrics to solve all appearances Nicholas Ramerus will have the earth the centre of the world but movable and the eighth sphere immovable the five upper planets to move about the sun the sun and moon about the earth Of which orbs Tycho Brahe puts the earth the centre immovable the stars immovable the rest with Ramerus the planets without orbs to wander in the air keep time and distance true motion according to that virtue which God hath given them three thousand one hundred twenty Helisaeus Roeslin censureth both with Copernicus whose hypothesis de terrae motu Philippus Lansbergius hath lately vindicated and demonstrated with solid arguments in a just volume Jansonius Caesins three thousand one hundred twenty one hath illustrated in a sphere The said Johannes Lansbergius sixteen thirty three hath since defended his assertion against all the cavils and calumnies of Fromundus his Anti Aristarchus Baptista Morinus and Petrus Bartholinus Fromundus sixteen thirty four hath written against him again J Rosseus of Aberdeen c sound drums and trumpets whilst Roeslin I say censures all and Ptolemeus himself as insufficient one offends against natural philosophy another against optic principles a third against mathematical as not answering to astronomical observations one puts a great space between Saturn s orb and the eighth sphere another too narrow In his own hypothesis he makes the earth as before the universal centre the sun to the five upper planets to the eighth sphere he ascribes diurnal motion eccentrics and epicycles to the seven planets which hath been formerly exploded and so Dum vitant stulti vitia in contraria currunt three thousand one hundred twenty two as a tinker stops one hole and makes two he corrects them and doth worse himself reforms some and mars all In the mean time the world is tossed in a blanket amongst them they hoist the earth up and down like a ball make it stand and go at their pleasures one saith the sun stands another he moves a third comes in taking them all at rebound and lest there should any paradox be wanting he three thousand one hundred twenty three finds certain spots and clouds in the sun by the help of glasses which multiply saith Keplerus a thing seen a thousand times bigger in plano and makes it come thirty two times nearer to the eye of the beholder but see the demonstration of this glass in three thousand one hundred twenty four Tarde by means of which the sun must turn round upon his own centre or they about the sun Fabricius puts only three and those in the sun Apelles fifteen and those without the sun floating like the Cyanean Isles in the Euxine sea three thousand one hundred twenty five Tarde the Frenchman hath observed thirty three and those neither spots nor clouds as Galileo Epist ad Valserum supposeth but planets concentric with the sun and not far from him with regular motions three thousand one hundred twenty six Christopher Shemer a German Suisser Jesuit Ursica Rosa divides them in maculas et faculas and will have them to be fixed in Solis superficie and to absolve their periodical and regular motion in twenty seven or twenty eight days holding withal the rotation of the sun upon his centre and all are so confident that they have made schemes and tables of their motions The three thousand one hundred twenty seven Hollander in his dissertatiuncula cum Apelle censures all and thus they disagree amongst themselves old and new irreconcilable in their opinions thus Aristarchus thus Hipparchus thus Ptolemeus thus Albateginus thus Alfraganus thus Tycho thus Ramerus thus Roeslinus thus Fracastorius thus Copernicus and his adherents thus Clavius and Maginus c with their followers vary and determine of these celestial orbs and bodies and so whilst these men contend about the sun and moon like the philosophers in Lucian it is to be feared the sun and moon will hide themselves and be as much offended as three thousand one hundred twenty eight she was with those and send another messenger to Jupiter by some new fangled Icaromenippus to make an end of all those curious controversies and scatter them abroad But why should the sun and moon be angry or take exceptions at mathematicians and philosophers when as the like measure is offered unto God himself by a company of theologasters they are not contented to see the sun and moon measure their site and biggest distance in a glass calculate their motions or visit the moon in a poetical fiction or a dream as he saith three thousand one hundred twenty nine Audax facinus et memorabile nunc incipiam neque hoc saeculo usurpatum prius quid in Lunae regno hac nocte gestum sit exponam et quo nemo unquam nisi somniando pervenit three thousand one hundred thirty but he and Menippus or as three thousand one

causa not in jest but in good earnest these gigantical Cyclops will transcend spheres heaven stars into that Empyrean heaven soar higher yet and see what God himself doth The Jewish Talmudists take upon them to determine how God spends his whole time sometimes playing with Leviathan sometimes overseeing the world c like Lucian s Jupiter that spent much of the year in painting butterflies wings and seeing who offered sacrifice telling the hours when it should rain how much snow should fall in such a place which way the wind should stand in Greece which way in Africa In the Turks Alcoran Mahomet is taken up to heaven upon a Pegasus sent on purpose for him as he lay in bed with his wife and after some conference with God is set on ground again The pagans paint him and mangle him after a thousand fashions our heretics schismatics and some schoolmen come not far behind some paint him in the habit of an old man and make maps of heaven number the angels tell their several three thousand one hundred thirty three names offices some deny God and his providence some take his office out of his hands will three thousand one hundred thirty four bind and loose in heaven release pardon forgive and be quarter master with him some call his Godhead in question his power and attributes his mercy justice providence they will know with three thousand one hundred thirty five Cecilius why good and bad are punished together war fires plagues infest all alike why wicked men flourish good are poor in prison sick and ill at ease Why doth he suffer so much mischief and evil to be done if he be three thousand one hundred thirty six able to help why doth he not assist good or resist bad reform our wills if he be not the author of sin and let such enormities be committed unworthy of his knowledge wisdom government mercy and providence why lets he all things be done by fortune and chance Others as prodigiously inquire after his omnipotency an possit plures similes creare deos an ex scarcibaeo deum c et quo demum ruetis sacrificuli Some by visions and revelations take upon them to be familiar with God and to be of privy council with him they will tell how many and who shall be saved when the world shall come to an end what year what month and whatsoever else God hath reserved unto himself and to his angels Some again curious fantastics will know more than this and inquire with three thousand one hundred thirty seven Epicurus what God did before the world was made was he idle Where did he bide What did he make the world of why did he then make it and

three thousand one hundred thirty eight dialogue betwixt him and Peter and Ammonius the philosopher in that dialogical disputation with Zacharias the Christian If God be infinitely and only good why should he alter or destroy the world if he confound that which is good how shall himself continue good If he pull it down because evil how shall he be free from the evil that made it evil c with many such absurd and brain sick questions intricacies froth of human wit and excrements of curiosity c which as our Saviour told his inquisitive disciples are not fit for them to know But hoo I am now gone quite out of sight I am almost giddy with roving about I could have ranged farther yet but I am an infant and not three thousand one hundred thirty nine able to dive into these profundities or sound these depths not able to understand much less to discuss I leave the contemplation of these things to stronger wits that have better ability and happier leisure to wade into such philosophical mysteries for put case I were as able as willing yet what can one man do I will conclude with three thousand one hundred forty Scaliger Nequaquam nos homines sumus sed partes hominis ex omnibus aliquid fieri potest idque non magnum ex singulis fere nihil Besides as Nazianzen hath it Deus latere nos multa voluit and with Seneca cap thirty five de Cometis Quid miramur tam rara mundi spectacula non teneri certis legibus nondum intelligi multae sunt gentes quae tantum de facie sciunt coelum veniet tempus fortasse quo ista quae nunc latent in lucem dies extrahat longioris aevi diligentia una aetas non sufficit posteri c when God sees his time he will reveal these mysteries to mortal men and show that to some few at last which he hath concealed so long For I am of three thousand one hundred forty one his mind that Columbus did not find out America by chance but God directed him at that time to discover it it was contingent to him but necessary to God he reveals and conceals to whom and when he will And which three thousand one hundred forty two one said of history and records of former times God in his providence to check our presumptuous inquisition wraps up all things in uncertainty bars us from long antiquity and bounds our search within the compass of some few ages many good things are lost which our predecessors made use of as Pancirola will better inform you many new things are daily invented to the public good so kingdoms men and knowledge ebb and flow are hid and revealed and when you have all done as the Preacher concluded Nihil est sub sole novum nothing new under the sun But my melancholy spaniel s quest my game is sprung and I must suddenly come down and follow Jason Pratensis in his book de morbis capitis and chapter of Melancholy hath these words out of Galen three thousand one hundred forty three Let them come to me to know what meat and drink they shall use and besides that I will teach them what temper of ambient air they shall make choice of what wind what countries they shall choose and what avoid Out of which lines of his thus much we may gather that to this cure of melancholy amongst other things the rectification of air is necessarily required This is performed either in reforming natural or artificial air Natural is that which is in our election to choose or avoid and tis either general to countries provinces particular to cities towns villages or private houses What harm those extremities of heat or cold do in this malady I have formerly shown the medium must needs be good where the air is temperate serene quiet free from bogs fens mists all manner of putrefaction contagious and filthy noisome smells The three thousand one hundred forty four Egyptians by all geographers are commended to be hilares a conceited and merry nation which I can ascribe to no other cause than the serenity of their air They that live in the Orcades are registered by three thousand one hundred forty five Hector Boethius and three thousand one hundred forty six Cardan to be of fair complexion long lived most healthful free from all manner of infirmities of body and mind by reason of a sharp purifying air which comes from the sea The Boeotians in Greece were dull and heavy crassi Boeoti by reason of a foggy air in which they lived three thousand one hundred forty seven Boeotum in crasso jurares aere natum Attica most acute pleasant and refined The clime changes not so much customs manners wits as Aristotle Polit lib six cap four Vegetius Plato Bodine method hist cap five hath proved at large as constitutions of their bodies and temperature itself In all particular provinces we see it confirmed by experience as the air is so are the inhabitants dull heavy witty subtle neat cleanly clownish sick and sound In three thousand one hundred forty eight Perigord in France the air is subtle healthful seldom any plague or contagious disease but hilly and barren the men sound nimble and lusty but in some parts of Guienne full of moors and marshes the people dull heavy and subject to many infirmities Who sees not a great difference between Surrey Sussex and Romney Marsh the wolds in Lincolnshire and the fens He therefore that loves his health if his ability will give him leave must often shift places and make choice of such as are wholesome pleasant and convenient there is nothing better than change of air in this malady and generally for health to wander up and down as those three thousand one hundred forty nine Tartari Zamolhenses that live in hordes and take opportunity of times places seasons The kings of Persia had their summer and winter houses in winter at Sardis in summer at Susa now at Persepolis then at Pasargada Cyrus lived seven cold months at Babylon three at Susa two at Ecbatana saith three thousand one hundred fifty Xenophon and had by that means a perpetual spring The great Turk sojourns sometimes at Constantinople sometimes at Adrianople c The kings of Spain have their Escurial in heat of summer three thousand one hundred fifty one Madrid for a wholesome seat Valladolid a pleasant site c variety of secessus as all princes and great men have and their several progresses to this purpose Lucullus the Roman had his house at Rome at Baiae c three thousand one hundred fifty two When Cn Pompeius Marcus Cicero saith Plutarch and many noble men in the summer came to see him at supper Pompeius jested with him that it was an elegant and pleasant village full of windows galleries and all offices fit for a summer house but in his judgment very unfit for winter Lucullus made answer that the lord of the house had wit like a crane that changeth her country with the season he had other houses furnished and built for that purpose all out as commodious as this So Tully had his Tusculan Plinius his Lauretan village and every gentleman of any fashion in our times hath the like The three thousand one hundred fifty three bishop of Exeter had fourteen several houses all furnished in times past In Italy though they bide in cities in winter which is more gentlemanlike all the summer they come abroad to their country houses to recreate themselves Our gentry in England live most part in the country except it be some few castles building still in bottoms saith three thousand one hundred fifty four Jovius or near woods corona arborum virentium you shall know a village by a tuft of trees at or about it to avoid those strong winds wherewith the island is infested and cold winter blasts Some discommend moated houses as unwholesome so Camden saith of three thousand one hundred fifty five Ew elme that it was therefore unfrequented ob stagni vicini halitus and all such places as be near lakes or rivers But I am of opinion that these inconveniences will be mitigated or easily corrected by good fires as three thousand one hundred fifty six one reports of Venice that graveolentia and fog of the moors is sufficiently qualified by those innumerable smokes Nay more three thousand one hundred fifty seven Thomas Philol Ravennas a great physician contends that the Venetians are generally longer lived than any city in Europe and live many of them one hundred twenty years But it is not water simply that so much offends as the slime and noisome smells that accompany such overflowed places which is but at some few seasons after a flood and is sufficiently recompensed with sweet smells and aspects in summer Ver pinget vario gemmantia prata colore and many other commodities of pleasure and profit or else may be corrected by the site if it be somewhat remote from the water as Lindley three thousand one hundred fifty eight Orton super montem three thousand one hundred fifty nine Drayton or a little more elevated though nearer as three thousand one hundred sixty Caucut three thousand one hundred sixty one Amington three thousand one hundred sixty two Polesworth three thousand one hundred sixty three Weddington to insist in such places best to me known upon the river of Anker in Warwickshire three thousand one hundred sixty four Swarston and three thousand one hundred sixty five Drakesly upon Trent Or howsoever they be unseasonable in winter or at some times they have their good use in summer If so be that their means be so slender as they may not admit of any such variety but must determine once for all and make one house serve each season I know no men that have given better rules in this behalf than our husbandry writers three thousand one hundred sixty six Cato and Columella prescribe a good house to stand by a navigable river good highways near some city and in a good soil but that is more for commodity than health The best soil commonly yields the worst air a dry sandy plat is fittest to build upon and such as is rather hilly than plain full of downs a Cotswold country as being most commodious for hawking hunting wood waters and all manner of pleasures Perigord in France is barren yet by reason of the excellency of the air and such pleasures that it affords much inhabited by the nobility as Nuremberg in Germany Toledo in Spain Our countryman Tusser will tell us so much that the fieldone is for profit the woodland for pleasure and health the one commonly a deep clay therefore noisome in winter and subject to bad highways the other a dry sand Provision may be had elsewhere and our towns are generally bigger in the woodland than the fieldone more frequent and populous and gentlemen more delight to dwell in such places Sutton Coldfield in Warwickshire where I was once a grammar scholar may be a sufficient witness which stands as Camden notes loco ingrato et sterili but in an excellent air and full of all manner of pleasures three thousand one hundred sixty seven Wadley in Berkshire is situate in a vale though not so fertile a soil as some vales afford yet a most commodious site wholesome in a delicious air a rich and pleasant seat So Segrave in Leicestershire which town three thousand one hundred sixty eight I am now bound to remember is situated in a champaign at the edge of the wolds and more barren than the villages about it yet no place likely yields a better air And he that built that fair house three thousand one hundred sixty nine Wollerton in Nottinghamshire is much to be commended though the tract be sandy and barren about it for making choice of such a place Constantine lib two cap de Agricult praiseth mountains hilly steep places above the rest by the seaside and such as look toward the three thousand one hundred seventy north upon some great river as three thousand one hundred seventy one Farmack in Derbyshire on the Trent environed with hills open only to the north like Mount Edgecombe in Cornwall which mister three thousand one hundred seventy two Carew so much admires for an excellent seat such is the general site of Bohemia serenat Boreas the north wind clarifies three thousand one hundred seventy three but near lakes or marshes in holes obscure places or to the south and west he utterly disproves those winds are unwholesome putrefying and make men subject to diseases The best building for health according to him is in three thousand one hundred seventy four high places and in an excellent prospect like that of Cuddeston in Oxfordshire which place I must honoris ergo mention is lately and fairly three thousand one hundred seventy five built in a good air good prospect good soil both for profit and pleasure not so easily to be matched P Crescentius in his lib one de Agric cap five is very copious in this subject how a house should be wholesomely sited in a good coast good air wind c Varro de re rust lib one cap twelve three thousand one hundred seventy six forbids lakes and rivers marshy and manured grounds they cause a bad air gross diseases hard to be cured three thousand one hundred seventy seven if it be so that he cannot help it better as he adviseth sell thy house and land than lose thine health He that respects not this in choosing of his seat or building his house is mente captus mad three thousand one hundred seventy eight Cato saith and his dwelling next to hell itself according to Columella he commends in conclusion the middle of a hill upon a descent Baptista Porta Villae lib one cap twenty two censures Varro Cato Columella and those ancient rustics approving many things disallowing some and will by all means have the front of a house stand to the south which how it may be good in Italy and hotter climes I know not in our northern countries I am sure it is best Stephanus a Frenchman praedio rustic lib one cap four subscribes to this approving especially the descent of a hill south or south east with trees to the north so that it be well watered a condition in all sites which must not be omitted as Herbastein inculcates lib one Julius Caesar Claudinus a physician consult twenty four for a nobleman in Poland melancholy given adviseth him to dwell in a house inclining to the three thousand one hundred seventy nine east and three thousand one hundred eighty by all means to provide the air be clear and sweet which Montanus consil two hundred twenty nine counselleth the earl of Monfort his patient to inhabit a pleasant house and in a good air If it be so the natural site may not be altered of our city town village yet by artificial means it may be helped In hot countries therefore they make the streets of their cities very narrow all over Spain Africa Italy Greece and many cities of France in Languedoc especially and Provence those southern parts Montpelier the habitation and university of physicians is so built with high houses narrow streets to divert the sun s scalding rays which Tacitus commends lib fifteen Annat as most agreeing to their health three thousand one hundred eighty one because the height of buildings and narrowness of streets keep away the sunbeams Some cities use galleries or arched cloisters towards the street as Damascus Bologna Padua Berne in Switzerland Westchester with us as well to avoid tempests as the sun s scorching heat They build on high hills in hot countries for more air or to the seaside as Baiae Naples c In our northern countries we are opposite we commend straight broad open fair streets as most befitting and agreeing to our clime We build in bottoms for warmth and that site of Mitylene in the island of Lesbos in the Aegean sea which Vitruvius so much discommends magnificently built with fair houses sed imprudenter positam unadvisedly sited because it lay along to the south and when the south wind blew the people were all sick would make an excellent site in our northern climes Of that artificial site of houses I have sufficiently discoursed if the plan of the dwelling may not be altered yet there is much in choice of such a chamber or room in opportune opening and shutting of windows excluding foreign air and winds and walking abroad at convenient times three thousand one hundred eighty two Crato a German commends east and south site disallowing cold air and northern winds in this case rainy weather and misty days free from putrefaction fens bogs and muck hills If the air be such open no windows come not abroad Montanus will have his patient not to three thousand one hundred eighty three stir at all if the wind be big or tempestuous as most part in March it is with us or in cloudy lowering dark days as in November which we commonly call the black month or stormy let the wind stand how it will consil twenty seven and thirty he must not three thousand one hundred eighty four open a casement in bad weather or in a boisterous season consil two hundred ninety nine he especially forbids us to open windows to a south wind The best sites for chamber windows in my judgment are north east south and which is the worst west Levinus Lemnius lib three cap three de occult nat mir attributes so much to air and rectifying of wind and windows that he holds it alone sufficient to make a man sick or well to alter body and mind three thousand one hundred eighty five A clear air cheers up the spirits exhilarates the mind a thick black misty tempestuous contracts overthrows Great heed is therefore to be taken at what times we walk how we place our windows lights and houses how we let in or exclude this ambient air The Egyptians to avoid immoderate heat make their windows on the top of the house like chimneys with two tunnels to draw a thorough air In Spain they commonly make great opposite windows without glass still shutting those which are next to the sun so likewise in Turkey and Italy Venice excepted which brags of her stately glazed palaces they use paper windows to like purpose and lie sub dio in the top of their flat roofed houses so sleeping under the canopy of heaven In some parts of three thousand one hundred eighty six Italy they have windmills to draw a cooling air out of hollow caves and disperse the same through all the chambers of their palaces to refresh them as at Costoza the house of Caesareo Trento a gentleman of Vicenza and elsewhere Many excellent means are invented to correct nature by art If none of these courses help the best way is to make artificial air which howsoever is profitable and good still to be made hot and moist and to be seasoned with sweet perfumes three thousand one hundred eighty seven pleasant and lightsome as it may be to have roses violets and sweet smelling flowers ever in their windows posies in their hand Laurentius commends water lilies a vessel of warm water to evaporate in the room which will make a more delightful perfume if there be added orange flowers pills of citrons rosemary cloves bays rosewater rose vinegar benzoin laudanum styrax and such like gums which make a pleasant and acceptable perfume three thousand one hundred eighty eight Bessardus Bisantinus prefers the smoke of juniper to melancholy persons which is in great request with us at Oxford to sweeten our chambers three thousand one hundred eighty nine Guianerius prescribes the air to be moistened with water and sweet herbs boiled in it vine and sallow leaves c three thousand one hundred ninety to besprinkle the ground and posts with rosewater rose vinegar which Avicenna much approves Of colours it is good to behold green red yellow and white and by all means to have light enough with windows in the day wax candles in the night neat chambers good fires in winter merry companions for though melancholy persons love to be dark and alone yet darkness is a great increaser of the humour Although our ordinary air be good by nature or art yet it is not amiss as I have said still to alter it no better physic for a melancholy man than change of air and variety of places to travel abroad and see fashions three thousand one hundred ninety one Leo Afer speaks of many of his countrymen so cured without all other physic amongst the Negroes there is such an excellent air that if any of them be sick elsewhere and brought thither he is instantly recovered of which he was often an eyewitness three thousand one hundred ninety two Lipsius Zuinger and some others add as much of ordinary travel No man saith Lipsius in an epistle to Phil Lanoius a noble friend of his now ready to make a voyage three thousand one hundred ninety three can be such a stock or stone whom that pleasant speculation of countries cities towns rivers will not affect three thousand one hundred ninety four Seneca the philosopher was infinitely taken with the sight of Scipio Africanus house near Linternum to view those old buildings cisterns baths tombs c And how was three thousand one hundred ninety five Tully pleased with the sight of Athens to behold those ancient and fair buildings with a remembrance of their worthy inhabitants Paulus Aemilius that renowned Roman captain after he had conquered Perseus the last king of Macedonia and now made an end of his tedious wars though he had been long absent from Rome and much there desired about the beginning of autumn as three thousand one hundred ninety six Livy describes it made a pleasant peregrination all over Greece accompanied with his son Scipio and Atheneus the brother of king Eumenes leaving the charge of his army with Sulpicius Gallus By Thessaly he went to Delphos thence to Megaris Aulis Athens Argos Lacedaemon Megalopolis c He took great content exceeding delight in that his voyage as who doth not that shall attempt the like though his travel be ad jactationem magis quam ad usum reipub as three thousand one hundred ninety seven one well observes to crack gaze see fine sights and fashions spend time rather than for his own or public good as it is to many gallants that travel out their best days together with their means manners honesty religion yet it availeth howsoever For peregrination charms our senses with such unspeakable and sweet variety three thousand one hundred ninety eight that some count him unhappy that never travelled and pity his case that from his cradle to his old age beholds the same still still still the same the same Insomuch that three thousand one hundred ninety nine Rhasis cont lib one Tract two doth not only commend but enjoin travel and such variety of objects to a melancholy man and to lie in diverse inns to be drawn into several companies Montaltus cap thirty six and many neoterics are of the same mind Celsus adviseth him therefore that will continue his health to have varium vitae genus diversity of callings occupations to be busied about three thousand two hundred sometimes to live in the city sometimes in the country now to study or work to be intent then again to hawk or hunt swim run ride or exercise himself A good prospect alone will ease melancholy as Comesius contends lib two c seven de Sale The citizens of three thousand two hundred one Barcino saith he otherwise penned in melancholy and stirring little abroad are much delighted with that pleasant prospect their city hath into the sea which like that of old Athens besides Aegina Salamina and many pleasant islands had all the variety of delicious objects so are those Neapolitans and inhabitants of Genoa to see the ships boats and passengers go by out of their windows their whole cities being situated on the side of a hill like Pera by Constantinople so that each house almost hath a free prospect to the sea as some part of London to the Thames or to have a free prospect all over the city at once as at Granada in Spain and Fez in Africa the river running betwixt two declining hills the steepness causeth each house almost as well to oversee as to be overseen of the rest Every country is full of such three thousand two hundred two delightsome prospects as well within land as by sea as Hermon and three thousand two hundred three Rama in Palestina Colalto in Italy the top of Magetus or Acrocorinthus that old decayed castle in Corinth from which Peloponessus Greece the Ionian and Aegean seas were semel et simul at one view to be taken In Egypt the square top of the great pyramid three hundred yards in height and so the Sultan s palace in Grand Cairo the country being plain hath a marvellous fair prospect as well over Nilus as that great city five Italian miles long and two broad by the river side from mount Sion in Jerusalem the Holy Land is of all sides to be seen such high places are infinite with us those of the best note are Glastonbury tower Box Hill in Surrey Bever castle Rodway Grange three thousand two hundred four Walsby in Lincolnshire where I lately received a real kindness by the munificence of the right honourable my noble lady and patroness the Lady Frances countess dowager of Exeter and two amongst the rest which I may not omit for vicinity s sake Oldbury in the confines of Warwickshire where I have often looked about me with great delight at the foot of which hill three thousand two hundred five I was born and Hanbury in Staffordshire contiguous to which is Falde a pleasant village and an ancient patrimony belonging to our family now in the possession of mine elder brother William Burton Esquire three thousand two hundred six Barclay the Scot commends that of Greenwich tower for one of the best prospects in Europe to see London on the one side the Thames ships and pleasant meadows on the other There be those that say as much and more of saint Mark s steeple in Venice Yet these are at too great a distance some are especially affected with such objects as be near to see passengers go by in some great roadway or boats in a river in subjectum forum despicere to oversee a fair a marketplace or out of a pleasant window into some thoroughfare street to behold a continual concourse a promiscuous rout coming and going or a multitude of spectators at a theatre a mask or some such like show But I rove the sum is this that variety of actions objects air places are excellent good in this infirmity and all others good for man good for beast three thousand two hundred seven Constantine the emperor lib eighteen cap thirteen ex Leontio holds it an only cure for rotten sheep and any manner of sick cattle Laelius a Fonte Aegubinus that great doctor at the latter end of many of his consultations as commonly he doth set down what success his physic had in melancholy most especially approves of this above all other remedies whatsoever as appears consult sixty nine consult two hundred twenty nine c three thousand two hundred eight Many other things helped but change of air was that which wrought the cure and did most good MEMB IV Exercise rectified of Body and Mind To that great inconvenience which comes on the one side by immoderate and unseasonable exercise too much solitariness and idleness on the other must be opposed as an antidote a moderate and seasonable use of it and that both of body and mind as a most material circumstance much conducing to this cure and to the general preservation of our health The heavens themselves run continually round the sun riseth and sets the moon increaseth and decreaseth stars and planets keep their constant motions the air is still tossed by the winds the waters ebb and flow to their conservation no doubt to teach us that we should ever be in action For which cause Hieron prescribes Rusticus the monk that he be always occupied about some business or other three thousand two hundred nine that the devil do not find him idle three thousand two hundred ten Seneca would have a man do something though it be to no purpose three thousand two hundred eleven Xenophon wisheth one rather to play at tables dice or make a jester of himself though he might be far better employed than do nothing The three thousand two hundred twelve Egyptians of old and many flourishing commonwealths since have enjoined labour and exercise to all sorts of men to be of some vocation and calling and give an account of their time to prevent those grievous mischiefs that come by idleness for as fodder whip and burthen belong to the ass so meat correction and work unto the servant Ecclus xxxiii twenty three The Turks enjoin all men whatsoever of what degree to be of some trade or other the Grand Signior himself is not excused three thousand two hundred thirteen In our memory saith Sabellicus Mahomet the Turk he that conquered Greece at that very time when he heard ambassadors of other princes did either carve or cut wooden spoons or frame something upon a table three thousand two hundred fourteen This present sultan makes notches for bows The Jews are most severe in this examination of time All well governed places towns families and every discreet person will be a law unto himself But amongst us the badge of gentry is idleness to be of no calling not to labour for that s derogatory to their birth to be a mere spectator a drone fruges consumere natus to have no necessary employment to busy himself about in church and commonwealth some few governors exempted but to rise to eat c to spend his days in hawking hunting c and such like disports and recreations three thousand two hundred fifteen which our casuists tax are the sole exercise almost and ordinary actions of our nobility and in which they are too immoderate And thence it comes to pass that in city and country so many grievances of body and mind and this feral disease of melancholy so frequently rageth and now domineers almost all over Europe amongst our great ones They know not how to spend their time disports excepted which are all their business what to do or otherwise how to bestow themselves like our modern Frenchmen that had rather lose a pound of blood in a single combat than a drop of sweat in any honest labour Every man almost hath something or other to employ himself about some vocation some trade but they do all by ministers and servants ad otia duntaxat se natos existimant imo ad sui ipsius plerumque et aliorum perniciem three thousand two hundred sixteen as one freely taxeth such kind of men they are all for pastimes tis all their study all their invention tends to this alone to drive away time as if they were born some of them to no other ends Therefore to correct and avoid these errors and inconveniences our divines physicians and politicians so much labour and so seriously exhort and for this disease in particular three thousand two hundred seventeen there can be no better cure than continual business as Rhasis holds to have some employment or other which may set their mind awork and distract their cogitations Riches may not easily be had without labour and industry nor learning without study neither can our health be preserved without bodily exercise If it be of the body Guianerius allows that exercise which is gentle three thousand two hundred eighteen and still after those ordinary frications which must be used every morning Montaltus cap twenty six and Jason Pratensis use almost the same words highly commending exercise if it be moderate a wonderful help so used Crato calls it and a great means to preserve our health as adding strength to the whole body increasing natural heat by means of which the nutriment is well concocted in the stomach liver and veins few or no crudities left is happily distributed over all the body Besides it expels excrements by sweat and other insensible vapours insomuch that three thousand two hundred nineteen Galen prefers exercise before all physic rectification of diet or any regimen in what kind soever tis nature s physician three thousand two hundred twenty Fulgentius out of Gordonius de conserv vit hom lib one cap seven terms exercise a spur of a dull sleepy nature the comforter of the members cure of infirmity death of diseases destruction of all mischiefs and vices The fittest time for exercise is a little before dinner a little before supper three thousand two hundred twenty one or at any time when the body is empty Montanus consil thirty one prescribes it every morning to his patient and that as three thousand two hundred twenty two Calenus adds after he hath done his ordinary needs rubbed his body washed his hands and face combed his head and gargarised What kind of exercise he should use Galen tells us lib two et three de sanit tuend and in what measure three thousand two hundred twenty three till the body be ready to sweat and roused up ad ruborem some say non ad sudorem lest it should dry the body too much others enjoin those wholesome businesses as to dig so long in his garden to hold the plough and the like Some prescribe frequent and violent labour and exercises as sawing every day so long together epid six Hippocrates confounds them but that is in some cases to some peculiar men three thousand two hundred twenty four the most forbid and by no means will have it go farther than a beginning sweat as being three thousand two hundred twenty five perilous if it exceed Of these labours exercises and recreations which are likewise included some properly belong to the body some to the mind some more easy some hard some with delight some without some within doors some natural some are artificial Amongst bodily exercises Galen commends ludum parvae pilae to play at ball be it with the hand or racket in tennis courts or otherwise it exerciseth each part of the body and doth much good so that they sweat not too much It was in great request of old amongst the Greeks Romans Barbarians mentioned by Homer Herodotus and Plinius Some write that Aganella a fair maid of Corcyra was the inventor of it for she presented the first ball that ever was made to Nausica the daughter of King Alcinous and taught her how to use it The ordinary sports which are used abroad are hawking hunting hilares venandi labores three thousand two hundred twenty six one calls them because they recreate body and mind three thousand two hundred twenty seven another the three thousand two hundred twenty eight best exercise that is by which alone many have been three thousand two hundred twenty nine freed from all feral diseases Hegesippus lib one cap thirty seven relates of Herod that he was eased of a grievous melancholy by that means Plato seven de leg highly magnifies it dividing it into three parts by land water air Xenophon in Cyropaed graces it with a great name Deorum munus the gift of the gods a princely sport which they have ever used saith Langius epist fifty nine lib two as well for health as pleasure and do at this day it being the sole almost and ordinary sport of our noblemen in Europe and elsewhere all over the world Bohemus de mor gent lib three cap twelve styles it therefore studium nobilium communiter venantur quod sibi solis licere contendunt tis all their study their exercise ordinary business all their talk and indeed some dote too much after it they can do nothing else discourse of naught else Paulus Jovius descr Brit doth in some sort tax our three thousand two hundred thirty English nobility for it for living in the country so much and too frequent use of it as if they had no other means but hawking and hunting to approve themselves gentlemen with Hawking comes near to hunting the one in the air as the other on the earth a sport as much affected as the other by some preferred three thousand two hundred thirty one It was never heard of amongst the Romans invented some twelve hundred years since and first mentioned by Firmicus lib five cap eight The Greek emperors began it and now nothing so frequent he is nobody that in the season hath not a hawk on his fist A great art and many three thousand two hundred thirty two books written of it It is a wonder to hear three thousand two hundred thirty three what is related of the Turks officers in this behalf how many thousand men are employed about it how many hawks of all sorts how much revenues consumed on that only disport how much time is spent at Adrianople alone every year to that purpose The three thousand two hundred thirty four Persian kings hawk after butterflies with sparrows made to that use and stares lesser hawks for lesser games they have and bigger for the rest that they may produce their sport to all seasons The Muscovian emperors reclaim eagles to fly at hinds foxes c and such a one was sent for a present to three thousand two hundred thirty five Queen Elizabeth some reclaim ravens castrils pies c and man them for their pleasures Fowling is more troublesome but all out as delightsome to some sorts of men be it with guns lime nets glades gins strings baits pitfalls pipes calls stalking horses setting dogs decoy ducks c or otherwise Some much delight to take larks with day nets small birds with chaff nets plovers partridge herons snipe c Henry the Third king of Castile as Mariana the Jesuit reports of him lib three cap seven was much affected three thousand two hundred thirty six with catching of quails and many gentlemen take a singular pleasure at morning and evening to go abroad with their quail pipes and will take any pains to satisfy their delight in that kind The three thousand two hundred thirty seven Italians have gardens fitted to such use with nets bushes glades sparing no cost or industry and are very much affected with the sport Tycho Brahe that great astronomer in the chorography of his Isle of Huena and Castle of Uraniburge puts down his nets and manner of catching small birds as an ornament and a recreation wherein he himself was sometimes employed Fishing is a kind of hunting by water be it with nets weels baits angling or otherwise and yields all out as much pleasure to some men as dogs or hawks three thousand two hundred thirty eight When they draw their fish upon the bank saith Nic Henselius Silesiographiae cap three speaking of that extraordinary delight his countrymen took in fishing and in making of pools James Dubravius that Moravian in his book de pisc telleth how travelling by the highway side in Silesia he found a nobleman three thousand two hundred thirty nine booted up to the groins wading himself pulling the nets and labouring as much as any fisherman of them all and when some belike objected to him the baseness of his office he excused himself three thousand two hundred forty that if other men might hunt hares why should not he hunt carps Many gentlemen in like sort with us will wade up to the arm holes upon such occasions and voluntarily undertake that to satisfy their pleasures which a poor man for a good stipend would scarce be hired to undergo Plutarch in his book de soler animal speaks against all fishing three thousand two hundred forty one as a filthy base illiberal employment having neither wit nor perspicacity in it nor worth the labour But he that shall consider the variety of baits for all seasons and pretty devices which our anglers have invented peculiar lines false flies several sleights c will say that it deserves like commendation requires as much study and perspicacity as the rest and is to be preferred before many of them Because hawking and hunting are very laborious much riding and many dangers accompany them but this is still and quiet and if so be the angler catch no fish yet he hath a wholesome walk to the brookside pleasant shade by the sweet silver streams he hath good air and sweet smells of fine fresh meadow flowers he hears the melodious harmony of birds he sees the swans herons ducks water horns coots c and many other fowl with their brood which he thinketh better than the noise of hounds or blast of horns and all the sport that they can make Many other sports and recreations there be much in use as ringing bowling shooting which Ascam recommends in a just volume and hath in former times been enjoined by statute as a defensive exercise and an three thousand two hundred forty two honour to our land as well may witness our victories in France Keelpins tronks quoits pitching bars hurling

rings tilts and tournaments horse races wild goose chases which are the disports of greater men and good in themselves though many gentlemen by that means gallop quite out of their fortunes But the most pleasant of all outward pastimes is that of three thousand two hundred forty three Areteus deambulatio per amoena loca to make a petty progress a merry journey now and then with some good companions to visit friends see cities castles towns three thousand two hundred forty four Visere saepe amnes nitidos per amaenaque Tempe Et placidas summis sectari in montibus auras To see the pleasant fields the crystal fountains And take the gentle air amongst the mountains three thousand two hundred forty five To walk amongst orchards gardens bowers mounts and arbours artificial

seven Schottus highly magnifies with the groves mountains ponds for a delectable prospect he was much affected with it a Persian paradise or pleasant park could not be more delectable in his sight saint Bernard in the description of his monastery is almost ravished with the pleasures of it A sick three thousand two hundred forty eight man saith he sits upon a green bank and when the dog star parcheth the plains and dries up rivers he lies in a shady bower Fronde sub arborea ferventia temperat astra and feeds his eyes with variety of objects herbs trees to comfort his misery he receives many delightsome smells and fills his ears with that sweet and various harmony of birds good God saith he what a company of pleasures hast thou made for man He that should be admitted on a sudden to the sight of such a palace as that of Escurial in Spain or to that which the Moors built at Granada Fontainebleau in France the Turk s gardens in his seraglio wherein all manner of birds and beasts are kept for pleasure wolves bears lynxes tigers lions elephants c or upon the banks of that Thracian Bosphorus the pope s Belvedere in Rome three thousand two hundred forty nine as pleasing as those horti pensiles in Babylon or that Indian king s delightsome garden in three thousand two hundred fifty Aelian or three thousand two hundred fifty one those famous gardens of the Lord Cantelow in France could not choose though he were never so ill paid but be much recreated for the time or many of our noblemen s gardens at home To take a boat in a pleasant evening and with music three thousand two hundred fifty two to row upon the waters which Plutarch so much applauds Elian admires upon the river Pineus in those Thessalian fields beset with green bays where birds so sweetly sing that passengers enchanted as it were with their heavenly music omnium laborum et curarum obliviscantur forget forthwith all labours care and grief or in a gondola through the Grand Canal in Venice to see those goodly palaces must needs refresh and give content to a melancholy dull spirit Or to see the inner rooms of a fair built and sumptuous edifice as that of the Persian kings so much renowned by Diodorus and Curtius in which all was almost beaten gold three thousand two hundred fifty three chairs stools thrones tabernacles and pillars of gold plane trees and vines of gold grapes of precious

night incomparabilis luxus all delights and pleasures in each kind which to please the senses could possibly be devised or had convives coronati delitiis ebrii c Telemachus in Homer is brought in as one ravished almost at the sight of that magnificent palace and rich furniture of Menelaus when he beheld three thousand two hundred fifty seven Aeris fulgorem et resonantia tecta corusco Auro atque electro nitido sectoque elephanto Argentoque simul Talis Jovis ardua sedes Aulaque coelicolum stellans splendescit Olympo Such glittering of gold and brightest brass to shine Clear amber silver pure and ivory so fine Jupiter s lofty palace where the gods do dwell Was even such a one and did it not excel It will laxare animos refresh the soul of man to see fair built cities streets theatres temples obelisks c The temple of Jerusalem was so fairly built of white marble with so many pyramids covered with gold tectumque templi fulvo coruscans auro nimio suo fulgore obcaecabat oculos itinerantium was so glorious and so glistened afar off that the spectators might not well abide the sight of it But the inner parts were all so curiously set out with cedar gold jewels c as he said of Cleopatra s palace in Egypt three thousand two hundred fifty eight Crassumque trabes absconderat aurum that the beholders were amazed What so pleasant as to see some pageant or sight go by as at coronations weddings and such like solemnities to see an ambassador or a prince met received entertained with masks shows fireworks c To see two kings fight in single combat as Porus and Alexander Canute and Edmund Ironside Scanderbeg and Ferat Bassa the Turk when not honour alone but life itself is at stake as the three thousand two hundred fifty nine poet of Hector nec enim pro tergore Tauri Pro bove nec certamen erat quae praemia cursus Esse solent sed pro magni viraque animaque Hectoris To behold a battle fought like that of Crecy or Agincourt or Poitiers qua nescio saith Froissart an vetustas ullam proferre possit clariorem To see one of Caesar s triumphs in old Rome revived or the like To be present at an interview three thousand two hundred sixty as that famous of Henry the Eighth and Francis the First so much renowned all over Europe ubi tanto apparatu saith Hubertus Veillius tamque triumphali pompa ambo reges com eorum conjugibus coiere ut nulla unquam aetas tam celebria festa viderit aut audieriti no age ever saw the like So infinitely pleasant are such shows to the sight of which oftentimes they will come hundreds of miles give any money for a place and remember many years after with singular delight Bodine when he was ambassador in England said he saw the noblemen go in their robes to the parliament house summa cum jucunditate vidimus he was much affected with the sight of it Pomponius Columna saith Jovius in his life saw thirteen Frenchmen and so many Italians once fight for a whole army Quod jucundissimum spectaculum in vita dicit sua the pleasantest sight that ever he saw in his life Who would not have been affected with such a spectacle Or that single combat of three thousand two hundred sixty one Breaute the Frenchman and Anthony Schets a Dutchman before the walls of Sylvaducis in Brabant anno sixteen hundred They were twenty two horse on the one side as many on the other which like Livy s Horatii Torquati and Corvini fought for their own glory and country s honour in the sight and view of their whole city and army three thousand two hundred sixty two When Julius Caesar warred about the banks of Rhone there came a barbarian prince to see him and the Roman army and when he had beheld Caesar a good while three thousand two hundred sixty three I see the gods now saith he which before I heard of nec feliciorem ullam vitae meae aut optavi aut sensi diem it was the happiest day that ever he had in his life Such a sight alone were able of itself to drive away melancholy if not for ever yet it must needs expel it for a time Radzivilus was much taken with the pasha s palace in Cairo and amongst many other objects which that place afforded with that solemnity of cutting the banks of the Nile by Imbram Pasha when it overflowed besides two or three hundred gilded galleys on the water he saw two millions of men gathered together on the land with turbans as white as snow and twas a goodly sight The very reading of feasts triumphs interviews nuptials tilts tournaments combats and monomachies is most acceptable and pleasant three thousand two hundred sixty four Franciscus Modius hath made a large collection of such solemnities in two great tomes which whoso will may peruse The inspection alone of those curious iconographies of temples and palaces as that of the Lateran church in Albertus Durer that of the temple of Jerusalem in three thousand two hundred sixty five Josephus Adricomius and Villalpandus that of the Escurial in Guadas of Diana at Ephesus in Pliny Nero s golden palace in Rome three thousand two hundred sixty six Justinian s in Constantinople that Peruvian Jugo s in three thousand two hundred sixty seven Cusco ut non ab hominibus sed a daemoniis constructum videatur saint

country hath his recreations the city his several gymnics and exercises May games feasts wakes and merry meetings to solace themselves the very being in the country that life itself is a sufficient recreation to some men to enjoy such pleasures as those old patriarchs did Diocletian the emperor was so much affected with it that he gave over his sceptre and turned gardener Constantine wrote twenty books of husbandry Lysander when ambassadors came to see him bragged of nothing more than of his orchard hi sunt ordines mei What shall I say of Cincinnatus Cato Tully and many such how they have been pleased with it to prune plant inoculate and graft to show so many several kinds of pears apples plums peaches c three thousand two hundred sixty nine Nunc captare feras laqueo nunc fallere visco Atque etiam magnos canibus circundare saltus Insidias avibus moliri incendere vepres Sometimes with traps deceive with line and string To catch wild birds and beasts encompassing The grove with dogs and out of bushes firing et nidos aviumscrutari c Jucundus in his preface to Cato Varro Columella c put out by him confesseth of himself that he was mightily delighted with these husbandry studies and took extraordinary pleasure in them if the theory or speculation can so much affect what shall the place and exercise itself the practical part do The same confession I find in Herbastein Porta Camerarius and many others which have written of that subject If my testimony were aught worth I could say as much of myself I am vere Saturnus no man ever took more delight in springs woods groves gardens walks fishponds rivers c But three thousand two hundred seventy Tantalus a labris sitiens fugientia captat Flumina And so do I Velle licet potiri non licet three thousand two hundred seventy one Every palace every city almost hath its peculiar walks cloisters terraces groves theatres pageants games and several recreations every country some professed gymnics to exhilarate their minds and exercise their bodies The three thousand two hundred seventy two Greeks had their Olympian Pythian Isthmian Nemean games in honour of Neptune Jupiter Apollo Athens hers some for honour garlands crowns for three thousand two hundred seventy three beauty dancing running leaping like our silver games The three thousand two hundred seventy four Romans had their feasts as the Athenians and Lacedaemonians held their public banquets in Pritanaeo Panathenaeis Thesperiis Phiditiis plays naumachies places for sea fights three thousand two hundred seventy five theatres amphitheatres able to contain seventy thousand men wherein they had several delightsome shows to exhilarate the people three thousand two hundred seventy six gladiators combats of men with themselves with wild beasts and wild beasts one with another like our bull baitings or bear baitings in which many countrymen and citizens amongst us so much delight and so frequently use dancers on ropes Jugglers wrestlers comedies tragedies publicly exhibited at the emperor s and city s charge and that with incredible cost and magnificence In the Low Countries as three thousand two hundred seventy seven Meteran relates before these wars they had many solemn feasts plays challenges artillery gardens colleges of rhymers rhetoricians poets and to this day such places are curiously maintained in Amsterdam as appears by that description of Isaacus Pontanus rerum Amstelrod lib two cap twenty five So likewise not long since at Friburg in Germany as is evident by that relation of three thousand two hundred seventy eight Neander they had Ludos septennales solemn plays every seven years which Bocerus one of their own poets hath elegantly described three thousand two hundred seventy nine At nunc magnifico spectacula structa paratu Quid memorem veteri non concessura Quirino Ludorum pompa c In Italy they have solemn declamations of certain select young gentlemen in Florence like those reciters in old Rome and public theatres in most of their cities for stage players and others to exercise and recreate themselves All seasons almost all places have their several pastimes some in summer some in winter some abroad some within some of the body some of the mind and diverse men have diverse recreations and exercises Domitian the emperor was much delighted with catching flies Augustus to play with nuts amongst children three thousand two hundred eighty Alexander Severus was often pleased to play with whelps and young pigs three thousand two hundred eighty one Adrian was so wholly enamoured with dogs and horses that he bestowed monuments and tombs of them and buried them in graves In foul weather or when they can use no other convenient sports by reason of the time as we do cock fighting to avoid idleness I think though some be more seriously taken with it spend much time cost and charges and are too solicitous about it three thousand two hundred eighty two Severus used partridges and quails as many Frenchmen do still and to keep birds in cages with which he was much pleased when at any time he had leisure from public cares and businesses He had saith Lampridius tame pheasants ducks partridges peacocks and some twenty thousand ring doves and pigeons Busbequius the emperor s orator when he lay in Constantinople and could not stir much abroad kept for his recreation busying himself to see them fed almost all manner of strange birds and beasts this was something though not to exercise his body yet to refresh his mind Conradus Gesner at Zurich in Switzerland kept so likewise for his pleasure a great company of wild beasts and as he saith took great delight to see them eat their meat Turkey gentlewomen that are perpetual prisoners still mewed up according to the custom of the place have little else beside their household business or to play with their children to drive away time but to dally with their cats which they have in delitiis as many of our ladies and gentlewomen use monkeys and little dogs The ordinary recreations which we have in winter and in most solitary times busy our minds with are cards tables and dice shovelboard chess play the philosopher s game small trunks shuttlecock billiards music masks singing dancing Yule games frolics jests riddles catches purposes questions and commands three thousand two hundred eighty three merry tales of errant knights queens lovers lords ladies giants dwarfs thieves cheaters witches fairies goblins friars c such as the old woman told Psyche in three thousand two hundred eighty four Apuleius Boccace novels and the rest quarum auditione pueri delectantur senes narratione which some delight to hear some to tell all are well pleased with Amaranthus the philosopher met Hermocles Diophantus and Philolaus his companions one day busily discoursing about Epicurus and Democritus tenets very solicitous which was most probable and came nearest to truth to put them out of that surly controversy and to refresh their spirits he told them a pleasant tale of Stratocles the physician s wedding and of all the particulars the company the cheer the music c for he was new come from it with which relation they were so much delighted that Philolaus wished a blessing to his heart and many a good wedding three thousand two hundred eighty five many such merry meetings might he be at to please himself with the sight and others with the narration of it News are generally welcome to all our ears avide audimus aures enim hominum novitate laetantur three thousand two hundred eighty six as Pliny observes we long after rumour to hear and listen to it three thousand two hundred eighty seven densum humeris bibit aure vulgus We are most part too inquisitive and apt to hearken after news which Caesar in his three thousand two hundred eighty eight Commentaries observes of the old Gauls they would be inquiring of every carrier and passenger what they had heard or seen what news abroad quid toto fiat in orbe Quid Seres quid Thraces agant secreta novercae Et pueri quis amet c as at an ordinary with us bakehouse or barber s shop When that great Gonsalva was upon some displeasure confined by King Ferdinand to the city of Loxa in Andalusia the only comfort saith three thousand two hundred eighty nine Jovius he had to ease his melancholy thoughts was to hear news and to listen after those ordinary occurrences which were brought him cum primis by letters or otherwise out of the remotest parts of Europe Some men s whole delight is to take tobacco and drink all day long in a tavern or alehouse to discourse sing jest roar talk of a cock and bull over a pot c Or when three or four good companions meet tell old stories by the fireside or in the sun as old folks usually do quae aprici meminere senes remembering afresh and with pleasure ancient matters and such like accidents which happened in their younger years others best pastime is to game nothing to them so pleasant three thousand two hundred ninety Hic Veneri indulget hunc decoquit alea many too nicely take exceptions at cards three thousand two hundred ninety one tables and dice and such mixed lusorious lots whom Gataker well confutes Which though they be honest recreations in themselves yet may justly be otherwise excepted at as they are often abused and forbidden as things most pernicious insanam rem et damnosam three thousand two hundred ninety two Lemnius calls it For most part in these kind of disports tis not art or skill but subtlety cony catching knavery chance and fortune carries all away tis ambulatoria pecunia three thousand two hundred ninety three puncto mobilis horae Permutat dominos et cedit in altera jura They labour most part not to pass their time in honest disport but for filthy lucre and covetousness of money In foedissimum lucrum et avaritiam hominum convertitur as Daneus observes Fons fraudum et maleficiorum tis the fountain of cozenage and villainy three thousand two hundred ninety four A thing so common all over Europe at this day and so generally abused that many men are utterly undone by it their means spent patrimonies consumed they and their posterity beggared besides swearing wrangling drinking loss of time and such inconveniences which are ordinary concomitants three thousand two hundred ninety five for when once they have got a haunt of such companies and habit of gaming they can hardly be drawn from it but as an itch it will tickle them and as it is with whoremasters once entered they cannot easily leave it off Vexat mentes insania cupido they are mad upon their sport And in conclusion which Charles the Seventh that good French king published in an edict against gamesters unde piae et hilaris vitae suffugium sibi suisque liberis totique familiae c That which was once their livelihood should have maintained wife children family is now spent and gone maeror et egestas c sorrow and beggary succeeds So good things may be abused and that which was first invented to three thousand two hundred ninety six refresh men s weary spirits when they come from other labours and studies to exhilarate the mind to entertain time and company tedious otherwise in those long solitary winter nights and keep them from worse matters an honest exercise is contrarily perverted Chess play is a good and witty exercise of the mind for some kind of men and fit for such melancholy Rhasis holds as are idle and have extravagant impertinent thoughts or troubled with cares nothing better to distract their mind and alter their meditations invented some say by the three thousand two hundred ninety seven general of an army in a famine to keep soldiers from mutiny but if it proceed from overmuch study in such a case it may do more harm than good it is a game too troublesome for some men s brains too full of anxiety all out as bad as study besides it is a testy choleric game and very offensive to him that loseth the mate three thousand two hundred ninety eight William the Conqueror in his younger years playing at chess with the Prince of France Dauphine was not annexed to that crown in those days losing a mate knocked the chess board about his pate which was a cause afterward of much enmity between them For some such reason it is belike that Patritius in his three book tit twelve de reg instit forbids his prince to play at chess hawking and hunting riding c he will allow and this to other men but by no means to him In Muscovy where they live in stoves and hot houses all winter long come seldom or little abroad it is again very necessary and therefore in those parts saith three thousand two hundred ninety nine Herbastein much used At Fez in Africa where the like inconvenience of keeping within doors is through heat it is very laudable and as three thousand three hundred Leo Afer relates as much frequented A sport fit for idle gentlewomen soldiers in garrison and courtiers that have nought but love matters to busy themselves about but not altogether so convenient for such as are students The like I may say of colonel Bruxer s philosophy game D Fulke s Metromachia and his Ouronomachia with the rest of those intricate astrological and geometrical fictions for such especially as are mathematically given and the rest of those curious games Dancing singing masking mumming stage plays howsoever they be heavily censured by some severe Catos yet if opportunely and soberly used may justly be approved Melius est foedere quam saltare three thousand three hundred one saith Austin but what is that if they delight in it three thousand three hundred two Nemo saltat sobrius But in what kind of dance I know these sports have many oppugners whole volumes writ against them when as all they say if duly considered is but ignoratio Elenchi and some again because they are now cold and wayward past themselves cavil at all such youthful sports in others as he did in the comedy they think them illico nasci senes c Some out of preposterous zeal object many times trivial arguments and because of some abuse will quite take away the good use as if they should forbid wine because it makes men drunk but in my judgment they are too stern there is a time for all things a time to mourn a time to dance Eccles iii four a time to embrace a time not to embrace verse five and nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his own works verse twenty two for my part I will subscribe to the king s declaration and was ever of that mind those May games wakes and Whitsun ales c if they be not at unseasonable hours may justly be permitted Let them freely feast sing and dance have their puppet plays hobby horses tabors crowds bagpipes c play at ball and barley breaks and what sports and recreations they like best In Franconia a province of Germany saith three thousand three hundred three Aubanus Bohemus the old folks after evening prayer went to the alehouse the younger sort to dance and to say truth with three thousand three hundred four Salisburiensis satius fuerat sic otiari quam turpius occupari better to do so than worse as without question otherwise such is the corruption of man s nature many of them will do For that cause plays masks jesters gladiators tumblers jugglers c and all that crew is admitted and winked at three thousand three hundred five Tota jocularium scena procedit et ideo spectacula admissa sunt et infinita tyrocinia vanitatum ut his occupentur qui perniciosius otiari solent that they might be busied about such toys that would otherwise more perniciously be idle So that as three thousand three hundred six Tacitus said of the astrologers in Rome we may say of them genus hominum est quod in civitate nostra et vitabitur semper et retinebitur they are a debauched company most part still spoken against as well they deserve some of them for I so relish and distinguish them as fiddlers and musicians and yet ever retained Evil is not to be done I confess that good may come of it but this is evil per accidens and in a qualified sense to avoid a greater inconvenience may justly be tolerated Sir Thomas More in his Utopian Commonwealth three thousand three hundred seven as he will have none idle so will he have no man labour over hard to be toiled out like a horse tis more than slavish infelicity the life of most of our hired servants and tradesmen elsewhere excepting his Utopians but half the day allotted for work and half for honest recreation or whatsoever employment they shall think fit for themselves If one half day in a week were allowed to our household servants for their merry meetings by their hard masters or in a year some feasts like those Roman Saturnals I think they would labour harder all the rest of their time and both parties be better pleased but this needs not you will say for some of them do nought but loiter all the week long This which I aim at is for such as are fracti animis troubled in mind to ease them over toiled on the one part to refresh over idle on the other to keep themselves busied And to this purpose as any labour or employment will serve to the one any honest recreation will conduce to the other so that it be moderate and sparing as the use of meat and drink not to spend all their life in gaming playing and pastimes as too many gentlemen do but to revive our bodies and recreate our souls with honest sports of which as there be diverse sorts and peculiar to several callings ages sexes conditions so there be proper for several seasons and those of distinct natures to fit that variety of humours which is amongst them that if one will not another may some in summer some in winter some gentle some more violent some for the mind alone some for the body and mind as to some it is both business and a pleasant recreation to oversee workmen of all sorts husbandry cattle horses c To build plot project to make models cast up accounts c some without some within doors new old c as the season serveth and as men are inclined It is reported of Philippus Bonus that good duke of Burgundy by Lodovicus Vives in Epist and Pont three thousand three hundred eight Heuter in his history that the said duke at the marriage of Eleonora sister to the king of Portugal at Bruges in Flanders which was solemnised in the deep of winter when as by reason of unseasonable weather he could neither hawk nor hunt and was now tired with cards dice c and such other domestic sports or to see ladies dance with some of his courtiers he would in the evening walk disguised all about the town It so fortuned as he was walking late one night he found a country fellow dead drunk snorting on a bulk three thousand three hundred nine he caused his followers to bring him to his palace and there stripping him of his old clothes and attiring him after the court fashion when he waked he and they were all ready to attend upon his excellency persuading him he was some great duke The poor fellow admiring how he came there was served in state all the day long after supper he saw them dance heard music and the rest of those court like pleasures but late at night when he was well tippled and again fast asleep they put on his old robes and so conveyed him to the place where they first found him Now the fellow had not made them so good sport the day before as he did when he returned to himself all the jest was to see how he three thousand three hundred ten looked upon it In conclusion after some little admiration the poor man told his friends he had seen a vision constantly believed it would not otherwise be persuaded and so the jest ended three thousand three hundred eleven Antiochus Epiphanes would often disguise himself steal from his court and go into merchants goldsmiths and other tradesmen s shops sit and talk with them and sometimes ride or walk alone and fall aboard with any tinker clown serving man carrier or whomsoever he met first Sometimes he did ex insperato give a poor fellow money to see how he would look or on set purpose lose his purse as he went to watch who found it and withal how he would be affected and with such objects he was much delighted Many such tricks are ordinarily put in practice by great men to exhilarate themselves and others all which are harmless jests and have their good uses But amongst those exercises or recreations of the mind within doors there is none so general so aptly to be applied to all sorts of men so fit and proper to expel idleness and melancholy as that of study Studia senectutem oblectant adolescentiam alunt secundas res ornant adversis perfugium et solatium praebent domi delectant c find the rest in Tully pro Archia Poeta three thousand three hundred twelve What so full of content as to read walk and see maps pictures statues jewels marbles which some so much magnify as those that Phidias made of old so exquisite and pleasing to be beheld that as three thousand three hundred thirteen Chrysostom thinketh if any man be sickly troubled in mind or that cannot sleep for grief and shall but stand over against one of Phidias images he will forget all care or whatsoever else may molest him in an instant There be those as much taken with Michael Angelo s Raphael de Urbino s Francesco Francia s pieces and many of those Italian and Dutch painters which were excellent in their ages and esteem of it as a most pleasing sight to view those neat architectures devices escutcheons coats of arms read such books to peruse old coins of several sorts in a fair gallery artificial works perspective glasses old relics Roman antiquities variety of colours A good picture is falsa veritas et muta poesis and though as three thousand three hundred fourteen Vives saith artificialia delectant sed mox fastidimus artificial toys please but for a time yet who is he that will not be moved with them for the present When Achilles was tormented and sad for the loss of his dear friend Patroclus his mother Thetis brought him a most elaborate and curious buckler made by Vulcan in which were engraven sun moon stars planets sea land men fighting running riding women scolding hills dales towns castles brooks rivers trees c with many pretty landscapes and perspective pieces with sight of which he was infinitely delighted and much eased of his grief three thousand three hundred fifteen Continuo eo spectaculo captus delenito maerore Oblectabatur in manibus tenens dei splendida dona Who will not be affected so in like case or see those well furnished cloisters and galleries of the Roman cardinals so richly stored with all modern pictures old statues and antiquities Cum se spectando recreet simul et legendo to see their pictures alone and read the description as three thousand three hundred sixteen Boisardus well adds whom will it not affect which Bozius Pomponius Laetus Marlianus Schottus Cavelerius Ligorius c and he himself hath well performed of late Or in some prince s cabinets like that of the great dukes in Florence of Felix Platerus in Basil or noblemen s houses to see such variety of attires faces so many so rare and such exquisite pieces of men birds beasts c to see those excellent landscapes Dutch works and curious cuts of Sadlier of Prague Albertus Durer Goltzius Vrintes c such pleasant pieces of perspective Indian pictures made of feathers China works frames thaumaturgical motions exotic toys c Who is he that is now wholly overcome with idleness or otherwise involved in a labyrinth of worldly cares troubles and discontents that will not be much lightened in his mind by reading of some enticing story true or feigned whereas in a glass he shall observe what our forefathers have done the beginnings ruins falls periods of commonwealths private men s actions displayed to the life c three thousand three hundred seventeen Plutarch therefore calls them secundas mensas et bellaria the second course and junkets because they were usually read at noblemen s feasts Who is not earnestly affected with a passionate speech well penned an elegant poem or some pleasant bewitching discourse like that of three thousand three hundred eighteen Heliodorus ubi oblectatio quaedam placide fuit cum hilaritate conjuncta Julian the Apostate was so taken with an oration of Libanius the sophister that as he confesseth he could not be quiet till he had read it all out Legi orationem tuam magna ex

thousand three hundred twenty seven Plutarch ut his indignum sit divitiarum phaleras istas et bullas et puellaria spectacula comparari such is the excellency of these studies that all those ornaments and childish bubbles of wealth are not worthy to be compared to them credi mihi three thousand three hundred twenty eight saith one extingui dulce erit Mathematicarum artium studio I could even live and die with such meditation three thousand three hundred twenty nine and take more delight true content of mind in them than thou hast in all thy wealth and sport how rich soever thou art And as three thousand three hundred thirty Cardan well seconds me Honorificum magis est et gloriosum haec intelligere quam provinciis praeesse formosum aut ditem juvenem esse three thousand three hundred thirty one The like pleasure there is in all other studies to such as are truly addicted to them three thousand three hundred thirty two ea suavitas one holds ut cum quis ea degustaverit quasi poculis Circeis captus non possit unquam ab illis divelli the like sweetness which as Circe s cup bewitcheth a student he cannot leave off as well may witness those many laborious hours days and nights spent in the voluminous treatises written by them the same content three thousand three hundred thirty three Julius Scaliger was so much affected with poetry that he brake out into a pathetical protestation he had rather be the author of twelve verses in Lucan or such an ode in three thousand three hundred thirty four Horace than emperor of Germany three thousand three hundred thirty five Nicholas Gerbelius that good old man was so much ravished with a few Greek authors restored to light with hope and desire of enjoying the rest that he exclaims forthwith Arabibus atque Indis omnibus erimus ditiores we shall be richer than all the Arabic or Indian princes of such three thousand three hundred thirty six esteem they were with him incomparable worth and value Seneca prefers Zeno and Chrysippus two doting stoics he was so much enamoured of their works before any prince or general of an army and Orontius the mathematician so far admires Archimedes that he calls him Divinum et homine majorem a petty god more than a man and well he might for aught I see if you respect fame or worth Pindarus of Thebes is as much renowned for his poems as Epaminondas Pelopidas Hercules or Bacchus his fellow citizens for their warlike actions et si famam respicias non pauciores Aristotelis quam Alexandri meminerunt as Cardan notes Aristotle is more known than Alexander for we have a bare relation of Alexander s deeds but Aristotle totus vivit in monumentis is whole in his works yet I stand not upon this the delight is it which I aim at so great pleasure such sweet content there is in study three thousand three hundred thirty seven King James sixteen oh five when he came to see our University of Oxford and amongst other edifices now went to view that famous library renewed by Sir Thomas Bodley in imitation of Alexander at his departure brake out into that noble speech If I were not a king I would be a university man three thousand three hundred thirty eight and if it were so that I must be a prisoner if I might have my wish I would desire to have no other prison than that library and to be chained together with so many good authors et mortuis magistris So sweet is the delight of study the more learning they have as he that hath a dropsy the more he drinks the thirstier he is the more they covet to learn and the last day is prioris discipulus harsh at first learning is radices amarcae but fractus dulces according to that of Isocrates pleasant at last the longer they live the more they are enamoured with the Muses Heinsius the keeper of the library at Leyden in Holland was mewed up in it all the year long and that which to thy thinking should have bred a loathing caused in him a greater liking three thousand three hundred thirty nine I no sooner saith he come into the library but I bolt the door to me excluding lust ambition avarice and all such vices whose nurse is idleness the mother of ignorance and melancholy herself and in the very lap of eternity amongst so many divine souls I take my seat with so lofty a spirit and sweet content that I pity all our great ones and rich men that know not this happiness I am not ignorant in the meantime notwithstanding this which I have said how barbarously and basely for the most part our ruder gentry esteem of libraries and books how they neglect and contemn so great a treasure so inestimable a benefit as Aesop s cock did the jewel he found in the dunghill and all through error ignorance and want of education And tis a wonder withal to observe how much they will vainly cast away in unnecessary expenses quot modis pereant saith three thousand three hundred forty Erasmus magnatibus pecuniae quantum absumant alea scorta compotationes profectiones non necessariae pompae bella quaesita ambitio colax morio ludio c what in hawks hounds lawsuits vain building gormandising drinking sports plays pastimes c If a well minded man to the Muses would sue to some of them for an exhibition to the farther maintenance or enlargement of such a work be it college lecture library or whatsoever else may tend to the advancement of learning they are so unwilling so averse that they had rather see these which are already with such cost and care erected utterly ruined demolished or otherwise employed for they repine many and grudge at such gifts and revenues so bestowed and therefore it were in vain as Erasmus well notes vel ab his vel a negotiatoribus qui se Mammonae dediderunt improbum fortasse tale officium exigere to solicit or ask anything of such men that are likely damned to riches to this purpose For my part I pity these men stultos jubeo esse libenter let them go as they are in the catalogue of Ignoramus How much on the other side are all we bound that are scholars to those munificent Ptolemies bountiful Maecenases heroical patrons divine spirits three thousand three hundred forty one qui nobis haec otio fecerunt namque erit ille mihi semper Deus These blessings friend a Deity bestow d For never can I deem him less than God that have provided for us so many well furnished libraries as well in our public academies in most cities as in our private colleges How shall I remember three thousand three hundred forty two Sir Thomas Bodley amongst the rest three thousand three hundred forty three Otho Nicholson and the Right Reverend John Williams Lord Bishop of Lincoln with many other pious acts who besides that at saint John s College in Cambridge that in Westminster is now likewise in Fieri with a library at Lincoln a noble precedent for all corporate towns and cities to imitate O quam te memorem vir illustrissime quibus elogiis But to my task again Whosoever he is therefore that is overrun with solitariness or carried away with pleasing melancholy and vain conceits and for want of employment knows not how to spend his time or crucified with worldly care I can prescribe him no better remedy than this of study to compose himself to the learning of some art or science Provided always that this malady proceed not from overmuch study for in such case he adds fuel to the fire and nothing can be more pernicious let him take heed he do not overstretch his wits and make a skeleton of himself or such inamoratos as read nothing but play books idle poems jests Amadis de Gaul the Knight of the Sun the Seven Champions Palmerin de Oliva Huon of Bordeaux c Such many times prove in the end as mad as Don Quixote Study is only prescribed to those that are otherwise idle troubled in mind or carried headlong with vain thoughts and imaginations to distract their cogitations although variety of study or some serious subject would do the former no harm and divert their continual meditations another way Nothing in this case better than study semper aliquid memoriter ediscant saith Piso let them learn something without book transcribe translate c Read the Scriptures which Hyperius lib one de quotid script lec fol seventy seven holds available of itself three thousand three hundred forty four the mind is erected thereby from all worldly cares and hath much quiet and tranquillity For as three thousand three hundred forty five Austin well hath it tis scientia scientiarum omni melle dulcior omni pane suavior omni vino hilarior tis the best nepenthe surest cordial sweetest alterative presentest diverter for neither as three thousand three hundred forty six Chrysostom well adds those boughs and leaves of trees which are plashed for cattle to stand under in the heat of the day in summer so much refresh them with their acceptable shade as the reading of the Scripture doth recreate and comfort a distressed soul in sorrow and affliction Paul bids pray continually quod cibus corpori lectio animae facit saith Seneca as meat is to the body such is reading to the soul three thousand three hundred forty seven To be at leisure without books is another hell and to be buried alive three thousand three hundred forty eight Cardan calls a library the physic of the soul three thousand three hundred forty nine divine authors fortify the mind make men bold and constant and as Hyperius adds godly conference will not permit the mind to be tortured with absurd cogitations Rhasis enjoins continual conference to such melancholy men perpetual discourse of some history tale poem news c alternos sermones edere ac bibere aeque jucundum quam cibus sive potus which feeds the mind as meat and drink doth the body and pleaseth as much and therefore the said Rhasis not without good cause would have somebody still talk seriously or dispute with them and sometimes three thousand three hundred fifty to cavil and wrangle so that it break not out to a violent perturbation for such altercation is like stirring of a dead fire to make it burn afresh it whets a dull spirit and will not suffer the mind to be drowned in those profound cogitations which melancholy men are commonly troubled with three thousand three hundred fifty one Ferdinand and Alphonsus kings of Arragon and Sicily were both cured by reading the history one of Curtius the other of Livy when no prescribed physic would take place three thousand three hundred fifty two Camerarius relates as much of Lorenzo de Medici Heathen philosophers arc so full of divine precepts in this kind that as some think they alone are able to settle a distressed mind three thousand three hundred fifty three Sunt verba et voces quibus liunc lenire dolorem c Epictetus Plutarch and Seneca qualis ille quae tela saith Lipsius adversus omnes animi casus administrat et ipsam mortem quomodo vitia eripit infert virtutes when I read Seneca three thousand three hundred fifty four methinks I am beyond all human fortunes on the top of a hill above mortality Plutarch saith as much of Homer for which cause belike Niceratus in Xenophon was made by his parents to con Homer s Iliads and Odysseys without book ut in virum bonum evaderet as well to make him a good and honest man as to avoid idleness If this comfort be got from philosophy what shall be had from divinity What shall Austin Cyprian Gregory Bernard s divine meditations afford us three thousand three hundred fifty five Qui quid sit pulchrum quid turpe quid utile quid non Plenius et melius Chrysippo et Crantore dicunt Nay what shall the Scripture itself Which is like an apothecary s shop wherein are all remedies for all infirmities of mind purgatives cordials alteratives corroboratives lenitives c Every disease of the soul saith three thousand three hundred fifty six Austin hath a peculiar medicine in the Scripture this only is required that the sick man take the potion which God hath already tempered three thousand three hundred fifty seven Gregory calls it a glass wherein we may see all our infirmities ignitum colloquium Psalm cxix one hundred forty three thousand three hundred fifty eight Origen a charm And therefore Hierom prescribes Rusticus the monk three thousand three hundred fifty nine continually to read the Scripture and to meditate on that which he hath read for as mastication is to meat so is meditation on that which we read I would for these causes wish him that is melancholy to use both human and divine authors voluntarily to impose some task upon himself to divert his melancholy thoughts to study the art of memory Cosmus Rosselius Pet Ravennas Scenkelius Detectus or practise brachygraphy c that will ask a great deal of attention or let him demonstrate a proposition in Euclid in his five last books extract a square root or study Algebra than which as three thousand three hundred sixty Clavius holds in all human disciplines nothing can be more excellent and pleasant so abstruse and recondite so bewitching so miraculous so ravishing so easy withal and full of delight omnem humanum captum superare videtur By this means you may define ex ungue leonem as the diverb is by his thumb alone the bigness of Hercules or the true dimensions of the great three thousand three hundred sixty one Colossus Solomon s temple and Domitian s amphitheatre out of a little part By this art you may contemplate the variation of the twenty three letters which may be so infinitely varied that the words complicated and deduced thence will not be contained within the compass of the firmament ten words may be varied forty thousand three hundred twenty several ways by this art you may examine how many men may stand one by another in the whole superficies of the earth some say one hundred forty eight trillion four hundred fifty six billion eight hundred million assignando singulis passum quadratum assigning a square foot to each how many men supposing all the world as habitable as France as fruitful and so long lived may be born

know how much a small cube as big as a mustard seed might hold with infinite such But in all nature what is there so stupendous as to examine and calculate the motion of the planets their magnitudes

proposit thirteen that pleasant tract of Machometes Bragdedinus de superficierum divisionibus Apollonius s Conics or Commandinus s labours in that kind de centro gravitatis with many such geometrical theorems and problems Those rare instruments and mechanical inventions of Jac Bessonus and Cardan to this purpose with many such experiments intimated long since by Roger Bacon in his tract de three thousand three hundred sixty four Secretis artis et naturae as to make a chariot to move sine animali diving boats to walk on the water by art and to fly in the air to make several cranes and pulleys quibus homo trahat ad se mille homines lift up and remove great weights mills to move themselves Archita s dove Albertus s brazen head and such thaumaturgical works But especially to do strange miracles by glasses of which Proclus and Bacon writ of old burning glasses multiplying glasses perspectives ut unus homo appareat exercitus to see afar off to represent solid bodies by cylinders and concaves to walk in the air ut veraciter videant saith Bacon aurum et argentum et quicquid aliud volunt et quum veniant ad locum visionis nihil inveniant which glasses are much perfected of late by Baptista Porta and Galileo and much more is promised by Maginus and Midorgius to be performed in this kind Otocousticons some speak of to intend hearing as the other do sight Marcellus Vrencken a Hollander in his epistle to Burgravius makes mention of a friend of his that is about an instrument quo videbit quae in altero horizonte sint But our alchemists methinks and Rosicrucians afford most rarities and are fuller of experiments they can make gold separate and alter metals extract oils salts lees and do more strange works than Geber Lullius Bacon or any of those ancients Crollius hath made after his master Paracelsus aurum fulminans or aurum volatile which shall imitate thunder and lightning and crack louder than any gunpowder Cornelius Drible a perpetual motion inextinguishable lights linum non ardens with many such feats see his book de natura elementorum besides hail wind snow thunder lightning c those strange fireworks devilish petards and such like warlike machinations derived hence of which read Tartalea and others Ernestus Burgravius a disciple of Paracelsus hath published a discourse in which he specifies a lamp to be made of man s blood Lucerna vitae et mortis

nebulosus et depressus male afficitur et sic pro statu hominis variatur unde sumptus sanguis three thousand three hundred sixty five and which is most wonderful it dies with the party cum homine perit et evanescit the lamp and the man whence the blood was taken are extinguished together The same author hath another tract of Mumia all out as vain and prodigious as the first by which he will cure most diseases and transfer them from a man to a beast by drawing blood from one and applying it to the other vel in plantam derivare and an Alexi pharmacum of which Roger Bacon of old in his Tract de retardanda senectute to make a man young again live three or four hundred years Besides panaceas martial amulets unguentum armarium balsams strange extracts elixirs and such like magico magnetical cures Now what so pleasing can there be as the speculation of these things to read and examine such experiments or if a man be more mathematically given to calculate or peruse Napier s Logarithms or those tables of artificial three thousand three hundred sixty six sines and tangents not long since set out by mine old collegiate good friend and late fellow student of Christ Church in Oxford three thousand three hundred sixty seven mister Edmund Gunter which will perform that by addition and subtraction only which heretofore Regiomontanus s tables did by multiplication and division or those

make epithalamiums epitaphs elegies epigrams palindroma epigrammata anagrams chronograms acrostics upon his friends names or write a comment on Martianus Capella Tertullian de pallio the Nubian geography or upon Aelia Laelia Crispis as many idle fellows have essayed and rather than do nothing vary a three thousand three hundred seventy verse a thousand ways with Putean so torturing his wits or as Rainnerus of Luneburg three thousand three hundred seventy one twenty one fifty times in his Proteus Poeticus or Scaliger Chrysolithus Cleppissius and others have in like sort done If such voluntary tasks pleasure and delight or crabbedness of these studies will not yet divert their idle thoughts and alienate their imaginations they must be compelled saith Christophorus a Vega cogi debent l five c fourteen upon some mulct if they perform it not quod ex officio incumbat loss of credit or disgrace such as our public University exercises For as he that plays for nothing will not heed his game no more will voluntary employment so thoroughly affect a student except he be very intent of himself and take an extraordinary delight in the study about which he is conversant It should be of that nature his business which volens nolens he must necessarily undergo and without great loss mulct shame or hindrance he may not omit Now for women instead of laborious studies they have curious needleworks cut works spinning bone lace and many pretty devices of their own making to adorn their houses cushions carpets chairs stools for she eats not the bread of idleness Prov xxxi

themselves about household offices c three thousand three hundred seventy three neat gardens full of exotic versicolour diversely varied sweet smelling flowers and plants in all kinds which they are most ambitious to get curious to preserve and keep proud to possess and much many times brag of Their merry meetings and frequent visitations mutual invitations in good towns I voluntarily omit which are so much in use gossiping among the meaner sort c old folks have their beads an excellent invention to keep them from idleness that are by nature melancholy and past all affairs to say so many paternosters avemarias creeds if it were not profane and superstitious In a word body and mind must be exercised not one but both and that in a mediocrity otherwise it will cause a great inconvenience If the body be overtired it tires the mind The mind oppresseth the body as with students it oftentimes falls out who as three thousand three hundred seventy four Plutarch observes have no care of the body but compel that which is mortal to do as much as that which is immortal that which is earthly as that which is ethereal But as the ox tired told the camel both serving one master that refused to carry some part of his burden before it were long he should be compelled to carry all his pack and skin to boot which by and by the ox being dead fell out the body may say to the soul that will give him no respite or remission a little after an ague vertigo consumption seizeth on them both all his study is omitted and they must be compelled to be sick together he that tenders his own good estate and health must let them draw with equal yoke both alike three thousand three hundred seventy five that so they may happily enjoy their wished health MEMB V Waking and terrible Dreams rectified As waking that hurts by all means must be avoided so sleep which so much helps by like ways three thousand three hundred seventy six must be procured by nature or art inward or outward medicines and be protracted longer than ordinary if it may be as being an especial help It moistens and fattens the body concocts and helps digestion as we see in dormice and those Alpine mice that sleep all winter which Gesner speaks of when they are so found sleeping under the snow in the dead of winter as fat as butter It expels cares pacifies the mind refresheth the weary limbs after long work three thousand three hundred seventy seven Somne quies rerum placidissime somne deorum Pax animi quem cura fugit qui corpora duris Fessa ministeriis mulces reparasque labori Sleep rest of things O pleasing deity Peace of the soul which cares dost crucify Weary bodies refresh and mollify The chiefest thing in all physic three thousand three hundred seventy eight Paracelsus calls it omnia arcana gemmarum superans et metallorum The fittest time is three thousand three hundred seventy nine two or three hours after supper when as the meat is now settled at the bottom of the stomach and tis good to lie on the right side first because at that site the liver doth rest under the stomach not molesting any way but heating him as a fire doth a kettle that is put to it After the first sleep tis not amiss to lie on the left side that the meat may the better descend and sometimes again on the belly but never on the back Seven or eight hours is a competent time for a melancholy man to rest as Crato thinks but as some do to lie in bed and not sleep a day or half a day together to give assent to pleasing conceits and vain imaginations is many ways pernicious To procure this sweet moistening sleep it s best to take away the occasions if it be possible that hinder it and then to use such inward or outward remedies which may cause it Constat hodie saith Boissardus in his tract de magia cap four multos ita fascinari ut noctes integras exigant insomnes summa inquietudine animorum et corporum many cannot sleep for witches and fascinations which are too familiar in some places they call it dare alicui malam noctem But the ordinary causes are heat and dryness which must first be removed three thousand three hundred eighty a hot and dry brain never sleeps well grief fears cares expectations anxieties great businesses three thousand three hundred eighty one In aurum utramque otiose ut dormias and all violent perturbations of the mind must in some sort be qualified before we can hope for any good repose He that sleeps in the daytime or is in suspense fear any way troubled in mind or goes to bed upon a full three thousand three hundred eighty two stomach may never hope for quiet rest in the night nec enim meritoria somnos admittunt as the three thousand three hundred eighty three poet saith inns and such like troublesome places are not for sleep one calls ostler another tapster one cries and shouts another sings whoops halloos three thousand three hundred eighty four absentem cantat amicam Multa prolutus vappa nauta atque viator Who not accustomed to such noises can sleep amongst them He that will intend to take his rest must go to bed animo securo quieto et libero with a three thousand three hundred eighty five secure and composed mind in a quiet place omnia noctes erunt placida composta quiete and if that will not serve or may not be obtained to seek then such means as are requisite To lie in clean linen and sweet before he goes to bed or in bed to hear three thousand three hundred eighty six sweet music which Ficinus commends lib one cap twenty four or as Jobertus med pract lib three cap ten three thousand three hundred eighty seven to read some pleasant author till he be asleep to have a basin of water still dropping by his bedside or to lie near that pleasant murmur lene sonantis aquae Some floodgates arches falls of water like London Bridge or some continuate noise which may benumb the senses lenis motus silentium et tenebra tum et ipsa voluntas somnos faciunt as a gentle noise to some procures sleep so which Bernardinus Tilesius lib de somno well observes silence in a dark room and the will itself is most available to others Piso commends frications Andrew Borde a good draught of strong drink before one goes to bed I say a nutmeg and ale or a good draught of Muscadine with a toast and nutmeg or a posset of the same which many use in a morning but methinks for such as have dry brains are much more proper at night some prescribe a three thousand three hundred eighty eight sup of vinegar as they go to bed a spoonful saith Aetius Tetrabib lib two ser two cap ten lib six cap ten Aegineta lib three cap fourteen Piso a little after meat three

makes a question of it as for baths fomentations oils potions simples or compounds inwardly taken to this purpose three thousand three hundred ninety two I shall speak of them elsewhere If in the midst of the night when they lie awake which is usual to toss and tumble and not sleep three thousand three hundred ninety three Ranzovius would have them if it be in warm weather to rise and walk three or four turns till they be cold about the chamber and then go to bed again Against fearful and troublesome dreams Incubus and such inconveniences wherewith melancholy men are molested the best remedy is to eat a light supper and of such meats as are easy of digestion no hare venison beef c not to lie on his back not to meditate or think in the daytime of any terrible objects or especially talk of them before he goes to bed For as he said in Lucian after such conference Hecates somniare mihi videor I can think of nothing but hobgoblins and as Tully notes three thousand three hundred ninety four for the most part our speeches in the daytime cause our fantasy to work upon the like in our sleep which Ennius writes of Homer Et canis in somnis leporis vestigia latrat as a dog dreams of a hare so do men on such subjects they thought on last three thousand three hundred ninety five Somnia quae mentes ludunt volitantibus umbris Nec delubra deum nec ab aethere numina mittunt Sed sibi quisque facit c For that cause when Ptolemy king of Egypt had posed the seventy interpreters in order and asked the nineteenth man what would make one sleep quietly in the night he told him three thousand three hundred ninety six the best way was to have divine and celestial meditations and to use honest actions in the daytime three thousand three hundred ninety seven Lod Vives wonders how schoolmen could sleep quietly and were not terrified in the night or walk in the dark they had such monstrous questions and thought of such terrible matters all day long They had need amongst the rest to sacrifice to god Morpheus whom three thousand three hundred ninety eight Philostratus paints in a white and black coat with a horn and ivory box full of dreams of the same colours to signify good and bad If you will know how to interpret them read Artemidorus Sambucus and Cardan but how to help them three thousand three hundred ninety nine I must refer you to a more convenient place MEMB VI SUBSECT I Perturbations of the mind rectified From himself by resisting to the utmost confessing his grief to a friend c Whosoever he is that shall hope to cure this malady in himself or any other must first rectify these passions and perturbations of the mind the chiefest cure consists in them A quiet mind is that voluptas or summum bonum of Epicurus non dolere curis vacare animo tranquillo

puts upon him and for which he is still mistaken male audit et vapulat slandered without a cause and lashed by all posterity three thousand four hundred Fear and sorrow therefore are especially to be

molest or trouble the soul because that otherwise there is no good to be done three thousand four hundred three The body s mischiefs as Plato proves proceed from the soul and if the mind be not first satisfied the body can never be cured Alcibiades raves saith three thousand four hundred four Maximus Tyrius and is sick his furious desires carry him from Lyceus to the pleading place thence to the sea so into Sicily thence to Lacedaemon thence to Persia thence to Samos then again to Athens Critias tyranniseth over all the city Sardanapalus is lovesick these men are ill affected all and can

natural heat overthrows appetite hinders concoction dries up the temperature and perverts the understanding fear dissolves the spirits infects the heart attenuates the soul and for these causes all passions and perturbations must to the uttermost of our power and most seriously be removed Aelianus Montaltus attributes so much to them three thousand four hundred six that he holds the rectification of them alone to be sufficient to the cure of melancholy in most patients Many are fully cured when they have seen or heard c enjoy their desires or be secured and satisfied in their minds Galen the common master of them all from whose fountain they fetch water brags lib one de san tuend that he for his part hath cured divers of this infirmity solum animis ad rectum institutis by

perform it You may advise and give good precepts as who cannot But how shall they be put in practice I may not deny but our passions are violent and tyrannise of us yet there be means to curb them though they be headstrong they may be tamed they may be qualified if he himself or his friends will but use their honest endeavours or make use of such ordinary helps as are commonly prescribed He himself I say from the patient himself the first and chiefest remedy must be had for if he be averse peevish waspish give way wholly to his passions will not seek to be helped or be ruled by his friends how is it possible he should be cured But if he be willing at least gentle tractable and desire his own good no doubt but he may magnam morbi deponere partem be eased at least if not cured He

beginning by doing something or other that shall be opposite unto them thinking of something else persuading by reason or howsoever to make a sudden alteration of them Though he have hitherto run in a full career and precipitated himself following his passions giving reins to his appetite let him now stop upon a sudden curb himself in and as three thousand four hundred eight Lemnius adviseth strive

the saying is can tame a shrew but he that hath her si hic esses aliter sentires if you were in our misery you would find it otherwise tis not so easily performed We know this to be true we should

bid him that is diseased not to feel pain as a melancholy man not to fear not to be sad tis within his blood his brains his whole temperature it cannot be removed But he may choose whether he will give way too far unto it he may in some sort correct himself A philosopher was bitten with a mad dog and as the nature of that disease is to abhor all waters and liquid things and to think still they

deride and contemn in thyself when it is past Rule thyself then with reason satisfy thyself accustom thyself wean thyself from such fond conceits vain fears strong imaginations restless thoughts Thou mayst do it Est in nobis assuescere as Plutarch saith we may frame ourselves as we will As he that useth an upright shoe may correct the obliquity or crookedness by wearing it on the other side we may overcome passions if we will Quicquid sibi imperavit animus obtinuit as three thousand four hundred fourteen Seneca saith nulli tam feri affectus ut non disciplina perdomentur whatsoever the will

affections three thousand four hundred fifteen As in a city saith Melancthon they do by stubborn rebellious rogues that will not submit themselves to political judgment compel them by force so must we do by our affections If the heart will not lay aside those vicious motions and the fantasy those fond imaginations we have another form of government to enforce and refrain our outward members that they be not led by our passions If appetite will not obey let the moving faculty overrule her let her resist and compel her to do otherwise In an ague the appetite would drink sore eyes that itch would be rubbed but reason saith no and therefore the moving faculty will not do it Our fantasy would intrude a thousand fears suspicions chimeras upon us but we have reason to resist yet we let it be overborne by our appetite three thousand four hundred sixteen imagination enforceth spirits which by an admirable league of nature compel the nerves to obey and they our several limbs we give too much way to our passions And as to him that is sick of an ague all things are distasteful and unpleasant non ex cibi vitio saith Plutarch not in the meat but in our taste so many things are offensive to us not of themselves but out of our corrupt judgment jealousy suspicion and the like we pull these mischiefs upon our own heads If then our judgment be so depraved our reason overruled will precipitated that we cannot seek our own good or moderate ourselves as in this disease commonly it is the best way for ease is to impart our misery to some friend not to smother it up in our own breast aliter vitium crescitque tegendo c and that which was most offensive to us a cause of fear and grief quod nunc te coquit another hell for three thousand four hundred seventeen strangulat inclusus dolor atque exaestuat intus grief concealed strangles the soul but when as we shall but impart it to some discreet trusty loving friend it is three thousand four hundred eighteen instantly removed by his counsel happily wisdom persuasion advice his good means which we could not otherwise apply unto ourselves A friend s counsel is a charm like mandrake wine curas sopit and as a three thousand four hundred nineteen bull that is tied to a fig tree becomes gentle on a sudden which some saith three thousand four hundred twenty Plutarch interpret of good words so is a savage obdurate heart mollified by fair speeches All adversity finds ease in complaining as three thousand four hundred twenty one Isidore holds and tis a solace to relate it three thousand four hundred twenty two Greek Agathae de paraiphasis estin etairou Friends confabulations are comfortable at all times as fire in winter shade in summer quale sopor fessis in gramine meat and drink to him that is hungry or athirst Democritus

Nothing so available or that so much refresheth the soul of man Tully as I remember in an epistle to his dear friend Atticus much condoles the defect of such a friend three thousand four hundred

desire thee I send for thee for there be many things which trouble and molest me which had I but thee in presence I could quickly disburden myself of in a walking discourse The like peradventure may he and he say with that old man in the comedy three thousand four hundred twenty six Nemo est meorum amicorum hodie Apud quem expromere occulta mea audeam and much inconvenience may both he and he suffer in the meantime by it He or he or whosoever then labours of this malady by all means let him get some trusty friend three thousand four hundred twenty seven Semper habens Pylademque aliquem qui curet Orestem a Pylades to whom freely and securely he may open himself For as in all other occurrences so it is in this Si quis in coelum ascendisset c as he said in three thousand four hundred

It is the best thing in the world as three thousand four hundred twenty nine Seneca therefore adviseth in such a case to get a trusty friend to whom we may freely and sincerely pour out our secrets nothing so delighteth and easeth the mind as when we have a prepared bosom to which our secrets may descend of whose conscience we are assured as our own whose speech may ease our succourless estate counsel relieve mirth expel our mourning and whose very sight may be acceptable unto us It was the counsel which that politic three thousand four hundred thirty Comineus gave to all princes and others distressed in mind by occasion of Charles Duke of Burgundy that was much perplexed first to pray to God and lay himself open to him and then to some special friend whom we hold most dear to tell all our grievances to him nothing so forcible to strengthen recreate and heal the wounded soul of a miserable man SUBSECT II Help from friends by counsel comfort fair and foul means witty devices satisfaction alteration of his course of life removing objects c When the patient of himself is not able to resist or overcome these heart eating passions his friends or physician must be ready to supply that which is wanting Suae erit humanitatis et sapientiae which three thousand four hundred thirty one Tully enjoineth in like case siquid erratum curare aut improvisum sua diligentia corrigere They must all join nec satis medico saith three thousand four hundred thirty two Hippocrates suum fecisse officium nisi suum quoque aegrotus suum astantes c First they must especially beware a melancholy discontented person be it in what kind of melancholy soever never be left alone or idle but as physicians prescribe physic cum custodia let them not be left unto themselves but with some company or other lest by that means they aggravate and increase their disease non oportet aegros humjusmodi esse solos vel inter ignotos vel inter eos quos non amant aut negligunt as Rod a Fonseca tom one consul thirty five prescribes Lugentes custodire solemus saith three thousand four hundred thirty three Seneca ne solitudine male utantur we watch a sorrowful person lest he abuse his solitariness and so should we do a melancholy man set him about some business exercise or recreation which may divert his thoughts and still keep him otherwise intent for his fantasy is so restless operative and quick that if it be not in perpetual action ever employed it will work upon itself melancholise and be carried away instantly with some fear jealousy discontent suspicion some vain conceit or other If his weakness be such that he cannot discern what is amiss correct or satisfy it behoves them by counsel comfort or persuasion by fair or foul means to alienate his mind by some artificial invention or some contrary persuasion to remove all objects causes companies occasions as may any ways molest him to humour him please him divert him and if it be possible by altering his course of life to give him security and satisfaction If he conceal his grievances and will not be known of them three thousand four hundred thirty four they must observe by his looks gestures motions fantasy what it is that offends and then to apply remedies unto him many are instantly cured when their minds are satisfied three thousand four hundred thirty five Alexander makes mention of a woman that by reason of her husband s long absence in travel was exceeding peevish and melancholy but when she heard her husband was returned beyond all expectation at the first sight of him she was freed from all fear without help of any other physic restored to her former health Trincavellius consil twelve lib one hath such a story of a Venetian that being much troubled with melancholy three thousand four hundred thirty

inveterate by this art they may be cured especially if they proceed from such a cause No better way to satisfy than to remove the object cause occasion if by any art or means possible we may find it out If he grieve stand in fear be in suspicion suspense or any way molested secure him Solvitur malum give him satisfaction the cure is ended alter his course of life there needs no other physic If the party be sad or otherwise affected consider saith three thousand four hundred thirty eight Trallianus the manner of it all circumstances and forthwith make a sudden alteration by removing the occasions avoid all terrible objects heard or seen three thousand four hundred thirty nine monstrous and prodigious aspects tales of devils spirits ghosts tragical stories to such as are in fear they strike a great impression renewed many times and recall such chimeras and terrible fictions into their minds three thousand four hundred forty Make not so much as mention of them in private talk or a dumb show tending to that purpose such things saith Galateus are offensive to their imaginations And to those that are now in sorrow three thousand four hundred forty one Seneca forbids all sad companions and such as lament a groaning companion is an enemy to quietness three thousand four hundred forty two Or if there be any such party at whose presence the patient is not well pleased he must be removed gentle speeches and fair means must first be tried no harsh language used or uncomfortable words and not expel as some do one madness with another he that so doth is madder than the patient himself all things must be quietly composed eversa non evertenda sed erigenda things down must not be dejected but reared as Crato counselleth three thousand four hundred forty three he must be quietly and gently used and we should not do anything against his mind but by little and little effect it As a horse that starts at a drum or trumpet and will not endure the shooting of a piece may be so manned by art and animated that he cannot only endure but is much more generous at the hearing of such things much more courageous than before and much delighteth in it they must not be reformed ex abrupto but by all art and insinuation made to such companies aspects objects they could not formerly away with Many at first cannot endure the sight of a green wound a sick man which afterward become good chirurgeons bold empirics a horse starts at a rotten post afar off which coming near he quietly passeth Tis much in the manner of making such kind of persons be they never so averse from company bashful solitary timorous they may be made at last with those Roman matrons to desire nothing more than in a public show to see a full company of gladiators breathe out their last If they may not otherwise be accustomed to brook such distasteful and displeasing objects the best way then is generally to avoid them Montanus consil two hundred twenty nine to the Earl of Montfort a courtier and his melancholy patient adviseth him to leave the court by reason of those continual discontents crosses abuses three thousand four hundred forty four cares suspicions emulations ambition anger jealousy which that place afforded and which surely caused him to be so melancholy at the first Maxima quaeque domus servis est plena superbis a company of scoffers and proud jacks are commonly conversant and attend in such places and able to make any man that is of a soft quiet disposition as many times they do ex stulto insanum if once they humour him a very idiot or stark mad A thing too much practised in all common societies and they have no better sport than to make themselves merry by abusing some silly fellow or to take advantage of another man s weakness In such cases as in a plague the best remedy is cito longe tarde for to such a party especially if he be apprehensive there can be no greater misery to get him quickly gone far enough off and not to be overhasty in his return If he be so stupid that he do not apprehend it his friends should take some order and by their discretion supply that which is wanting in him as in all other cases they ought to do If they see a man melancholy given solitary averse from company please himself with such private and vain meditations though he delight in it they ought by all means seek to divert him to dehort him to tell him of the event and danger that may come of it If they see a man idle that by reason of his means otherwise will betake himself to no course of life they ought seriously to admonish him he makes a noose to entangle himself his want of employment will be his undoing If he have sustained any great loss suffered a repulse disgrace c if it be possible relieve him If he desire aught let him be satisfied if in suspense fear suspicion let him be secured and if it may conveniently be give him his heart s content for the body cannot be cured till the mind be satisfied three thousand four hundred forty

good word rejoiceth it Prov xii twenty five And there is he that speaketh words like the pricking of a sword but the tongue of a wise man is health ver eighteen Oratio namque saucii animi est remedium a gentle speech is the true cure of a wounded soul as three thousand four hundred forty eight Plutarch contends out of Aeschylus and Euripides if it be wisely administered it easeth grief and pain as diverse remedies do many other diseases Tis incantationis instar a charm aestuantis animi refrigerium that true Nepenthe of Homer which was no Indian plant or feigned medicine which Epidamna Thonis wife sent Helena for a token as Macrobius seven Saturnal Goropius Hermat lib nine Greg Nazianzen and others suppose but opportunity of speech for Helena s bowl Medea s unction Venus s girdle Circe s cup cannot so enchant so forcibly move or alter as it doth A letter sent or read will do as much multum allevor quum tuas literas lego I am much eased as three thousand four hundred forty nine Tully wrote to Pomponius Atticus when I read thy letters and as Julianus the Apostate once signified to Maximus the philosopher as Alexander slept with Homer s works so do I with thine epistles tanquam Paeoniis medicamentis easque assidue tanquam recentes et novas iteramus scribe ergo et assidue scribe or else come thyself amicus ad amicum venies Assuredly a wise and well spoken man may do what he will in such a case a good orator alone as three thousand four hundred fifty Tully holds can alter affections by power of his eloquence comfort such as are afflicted erect such as are depressed expel and mitigate fear lust anger c And how powerful is the charm of a discreet and dear friend Ille regit dictis animos et temperat iras What may not he effect As three thousand four hundred fifty one Chremes told Menedemus Fear not conceal it not O friend but tell me what it is that troubles thee and I shall surely help thee by comfort counsel or in the matter itself three thousand four hundred fifty two Arnoldus lib one breviar cap eighteen speaks of a usurer in his time that upon a loss much melancholy and discontent was so cured As imagination fear grief cause such passions so conceits alone rectified by good hope counsel c are able again to help and tis incredible how much they can do in such a case as three thousand four hundred fifty three Trincavellius illustrates by an example of a patient of his Porphyrius the philosopher in Plotinus s life written by him relates that being in a discontented humour through insufferable anguish of mind he was going to make away himself but meeting by chance his master Plotinus who perceiving by his distracted looks all was not well urged him to confess his grief which when he had heard he used such comfortable speeches that he redeemed him e faucibus Erebi pacified his unquiet mind insomuch that he was easily reconciled to himself and much abashed to think afterwards that he should ever entertain so vile a motion By all means therefore fair promises good words gentle persuasions are to be used not to be too rigorous at first three thousand four hundred fifty four or to insult over them not to deride neglect or contemn but rather as Lemnius exhorteth to pity and by all plausible means to seek to redress them but if satisfaction may not be had mild courses promises comfortable speeches and good counsel will not take place then as Christophorus a Vega determines lib three cap fourteen de Mel to handle them more roughly to threaten and chide saith three thousand four hundred fifty five Altomarus terrify sometimes or as Salvianus will have them to be lashed and whipped as we do by a starting horse three thousand four hundred fifty six that is affrighted without a cause or as three thousand four hundred fifty seven Rhasis adviseth one while to speak fair and flatter another while to terrify and chide as they shall see cause When none of these precedent remedies will avail it will not be amiss which Savanarola and Aelian Montaltus so much commend clavum clavo pellere three thousand four hundred fifty eight to drive out one passion with another or by some contrary passion as they do bleeding at nose by letting blood in the arm to expel one fear with another one grief with another three thousand four hundred fifty nine Christophorus a Vega accounts it rational physic non alienum a ratione and Lemnius much approves it to use a hard wedge to a hard knot to drive out one disease with another to pull out a tooth or wound him to geld him saith three thousand four hundred sixty Platerus as they did epileptical patients of old because it quite alters the temperature that the pain of the one may mitigate the grief of the other three thousand four hundred sixty one and I knew one that was so cured of a quartan ague by the sudden coming of his enemies upon him If we may believe three thousand four hundred sixty two Pliny whom Scaliger calls mendaciorum patrem the father of lies Q Fabius Maximus that renowned consul of Rome in a battle fought with the king of the Allobroges at the river Isaurus was so rid of a quartan ague Valesius in his controversies holds this an excellent remedy and if it be discreetly used in this malady better than any physic Sometimes again by some three thousand four hundred sixty three feigned lie strange news witty device artificial invention it is not amiss to deceive them three thousand four hundred sixty four As they hate those saith Alexander that neglect or deride so they will give ear to such as will soothe them up If they say they have swallowed frogs or a snake by all means grant it and tell them you can easily cure it tis an ordinary thing Philodotus the physician cured a melancholy king that thought his head was off by putting a leaden cap thereon the weight made him perceive it and freed him of his fond imagination A woman in the said Alexander swallowed a serpent as she thought he gave her a vomit and conveyed a serpent such as she conceived into the basin upon the sight of it she was amended The pleasantest dotage that ever I read saith three thousand four hundred sixty five Laurentius was of a gentleman at Senes in Italy who was afraid to piss lest all the town should be drowned the physicians caused the bells to be rung backward and told him the town was on fire whereupon he made water and was immediately cured Another supposed his nose so big that he should dash it against the wall if he stirred his physician took a great piece of flesh and holding it in his hand pinched him by the nose making him believe that flesh was cut from it Forestus obs lib one had a melancholy patient who thought he was dead three thousand four hundred sixty six he put a fellow in a chest like a dead man by his bedside and made him rear himself a little and eat the melancholy man asked the counterfeit whether dead men use to eat meat He told him yea whereupon he did eat likewise and was cured Lemnius lib two cap six de four complex hath many such instances and Jovianus Pontanus lib four cap two of Wisd of the like but amongst the rest I find one most memorable registered in the three thousand four hundred sixty seven French chronicles of an advocate of Paris before mentioned who believed verily he was dead c I read a multitude of examples of melancholy men cured by such artificial inventions SUBSECT III Music a remedy Many and sundry are the means which philosophers and physicians have prescribed to exhilarate a sorrowful heart to divert those fixed and intent cares and meditations which in this malady so much offend but in my judgment none so present none so powerful none so apposite as a cup of strong drink mirth music and merry company Ecclus xl twenty Wine and music rejoice the heart three thousand four hundred sixty eight Rhasis cont nine Tract fifteen Altomarus cap seven Aelianus Montaltus c twenty six Ficinus Bened Victor Faventinus are almost immoderate in the commendation of it a most forcible medicine three thousand four hundred sixty nine Jacchinus calls it Jason Pratensis a most admirable thing and worthy of consideration that can so mollify the mind and stay those tempestuous affections of it Musica est mentis medicina moestae a roaring meg against melancholy to rear and revive the languishing soul three thousand four hundred seventy affecting not only the ears but the very arteries the vital and animal spirits it erects the mind and makes it nimble Lemnius instit cap forty four This it will effect in the most dull severe and sorrowful souls three thousand four hundred seventy one expel grief with mirth and if there be any clouds dust or dregs of cares yet lurking in our thoughts most powerfully it wipes them all away Salisbur polit lib one cap six and that which is more it will perform all this in an instant three thousand four hundred seventy two Cheer up the countenance expel austerity bring in hilarity Girald Camb cap twelve Topog Hiber inform our manners mitigate anger Athenaeus Dipnosophist lib fourteen cap ten calleth it an infinite treasure to such as are endowed with it Dulcisonum reficit tristia corda melos Eobanus Hessus Many other properties three thousand four hundred seventy three Cassiodorus epist four reckons up of this our divine music not only to expel the greatest griefs but it doth extenuate fears and furies appeaseth cruelty abateth heaviness and to such as are watchful it causeth quiet rest it takes away spleen and hatred be it instrumental vocal with strings wind three thousand four hundred seventy four Quae a spiritu sine manuum dexteritate gubernetur c it cures all irksomeness and heaviness of the soul three thousand four hundred seventy five Labouring men that sing to their work can tell as much and so can soldiers when they go to fight whom terror of death cannot so much affright as the sound of trumpet drum fife and such like music animates metus enim mortis as three thousand four hundred seventy six Censorinus informeth us musica depellitur It makes a child quiet the nurse s song and many times the sound of a trumpet on a sudden bells ringing a carman s whistle a boy singing some ballad tune early in the streets alters revives recreates a restless patient that cannot sleep in the night c In a word it is so powerful a thing that it ravisheth the soul regina sensuum the queen of the senses by sweet pleasure which is a happy cure and corporal tunes pacify our incorporeal soul sine ore loquens dominatum in animam exercet and carries it beyond itself helps elevates extends it Scaliger exercit three hundred two gives a reason of these effects three thousand four hundred seventy seven because the spirits about the heart take in that trembling and dancing air into the body are moved together and stirred up with it or else the mind as some suppose harmonically composed is roused up at the tunes of music And tis not only men that are so affected but almost all other creatures You know the tale of Hercules Gallus Orpheus and Amphion felices animas Ovid calls them that could saxa movere sono testudinis c make stocks and stones as well as beasts and other animals dance after their pipes the dog and hare wolf and lamb vicinumque lupo praebuit agna latus clamosus graculus stridula cornix et Jovis aquila as Philostratus describes it in his images stood all gaping upon Orpheus and three thousand four hundred seventy eight trees pulled up by the roots came to hear him Et comitem quercum pinus amica trahit Arion made fishes follow him which as common experience evinceth three thousand four hundred seventy nine are much affected with music All singing birds are much pleased with it especially nightingales if we may believe Calcagninus and bees amongst the rest though they be flying away when they hear any tingling sound will tarry behind three thousand four hundred eighty Harts hinds horses dogs bears are exceedingly delighted with it Scal exerc three hundred two Elephants Agrippa adds lib two cap twenty four and in Lydia in the midst of a lake there be certain floating islands if ye will believe it that after music will dance But to leave all declamatory speeches in praise three thousand four hundred eighty one of divine music I will confine myself to my proper subject besides that excellent power it hath to expel many other diseases it is a sovereign remedy against three thousand four hundred eighty two despair and melancholy and will drive away the devil himself Canus a Rhodian fiddler in three thousand four hundred eighty three Philostratus when Apollonius was inquisitive to know what he could do with his pipe told him That he would make a melancholy man merry and him that was merry much merrier than before a lover more enamoured a religious man more devout Ismenias the Theban three thousand four hundred eighty four Chiron the centaur is said to have cured this and many other diseases by music alone as now they do those saith three thousand four hundred eighty five Bodine that are troubled with saint Vitus s Bedlam dance three thousand four hundred eighty six Timotheus the musician compelled Alexander to skip up and down and leave his dinner like the tale of the Friar and the Boy whom Austin de civ Dei lib seventeen cap fourteen so much commends for it Who hath not heard how David s harmony drove away the evil spirits from king Saul one Sam xvi and Elisha when he was much troubled by importunate kings called for a minstrel and when he played the hand of the Lord came upon him two Kings iii Censorinus de natali cap twelve reports how Asclepiades the physician helped many frantic persons by this means phreneticorum mentes morbo turbatas Jason Pratensis cap de Mania hath many examples how Clinias and Empedocles cured some desperately melancholy and some mad by this our music Which because it hath such excellent virtues belike three thousand four hundred eighty seven Homer brings in Phemius playing and the Muses singing at the banquet of the gods Aristotle Polit l eight c five Plato two de legibus highly approve it and so do all politicians The Greeks Romans have graced music and made it one of the liberal sciences though it be now become mercenary All civil Commonwealths allow it Cneius Manlius as three thousand four hundred eighty eight Livius relates anno ab urb cond five hundred sixty seven brought first out of Asia to Rome singing wenches players jesters and all kinds of music to their feasts Your princes emperors and persons of any quality maintain it in their courts no mirth without music Sir Thomas More in his absolute Utopian commonwealth allows music as an appendix to every meal and that throughout to all sorts Epictetus calls mensam mutam praesepe a table without music a manger for the concert of musicians at a banquet is a carbuncle set in gold and as the signet of an emerald well trimmed with gold so is the melody of music in a pleasant banquet Ecclus xxxii five six three thousand four hundred eighty nine Louis the Eleventh when he invited Edward the Fourth to come to Paris told him that as a principal part of his entertainment he should hear sweet voices of children Ionic and Lydian tunes exquisite music he should have a and the cardinal of Bourbon to be his confessor which he used as a most plausible argument as to a sensual man indeed it is three thousand four hundred ninety Lucian in his book de saltatione is not ashamed to confess that he took infinite delight in singing dancing music women s company and such like pleasures and if thou saith he didst but hear them play and dance I know thou wouldst be so well pleased with the object that thou wouldst dance for company thyself without doubt thou wilt be taken with it So Scaliger ingenuously confesseth exercit two hundred seventy four three thousand four hundred ninety one I am beyond all measure affected with music I do most willingly behold them dance I am mightily detained and allured with that grace and comeliness of fair women I am well pleased to be idle amongst them And what young man is not As it is acceptable and conducing to most so especially to a melancholy man Provided always his disease proceed not originally from it that he be not some light inamarato some idle fantastic who capers in conceit all the day long and thinks of nothing else but how to make jigs sonnets madrigals in commendation of his mistress In such cases music is most pernicious as a spur to a free horse will make him run himself blind or break his wind Incitamentum enim amoris musica for music enchants as Menander holds it will make such melancholy persons mad and the sound of those jigs and hornpipes will not be removed out of the ears a week after three thousand four hundred ninety two Plato for this reason forbids music and wine to all young men because they are most part amorous ne ignis addatur igni lest one fire increase another Many men are melancholy by hearing music but it is a pleasing melancholy that it causeth and therefore to such as are discontent in woe fear sorrow or dejected it is a most present remedy it expels cares alters their grieved minds and easeth in an instant Otherwise saith three thousand four hundred ninety three Plutarch Musica magis dementat quam vinum music makes some men mad as a tiger like Astolphos horn in Ariosto or Mercury s golden wand in Homer that made some wake others sleep it hath divers effects and three thousand four hundred ninety four Theophrastus right well prophesied that diseases were either procured by music or mitigated SUBSECT IV Mirth and merry company fair objects remedies Mirth and merry company may not be separated from music both concerning and necessarily required in this business Mirth saith three thousand four hundred ninety five Vives purgeth the blood confirms health causeth a fresh pleasing and fine colour prorogues life whets the wit makes the body young lively and fit for any manner of employment The merrier the heart the longer the life A merry heart is the life of the flesh Prov xiv thirty Gladness prolongs his days Ecclus xxx twenty two and this is one of the three Salernitan doctors doctor Merryman doctor Diet doctor Quiet three thousand four hundred ninety six which cure all diseases Mens hilaris requies moderata dieta three thousand four hundred ninety seven Gomesius praefat lib three de sal general is a great magnifier of honest mirth by which saith he we cure many passions of the mind in ourselves and in our friends which three thousand four hundred ninety eight Galateus assigns for a cause why we love merry companions and well they deserve it being that as three thousand four hundred ninety nine Magninus holds a merry companion is better than any music and as the saying is comes jucundus in via pro vehiculo as a wagon to him that is wearied on the way Jucunda confabulatio sales joci pleasant discourse jests conceits merry tales melliti verborum globuli as Petronius three thousand five hundred Pliny three thousand five hundred one Spondanus three thousand five hundred two Caelius and many good authors plead are that sole Nepenthes of Homer Helena s bowl Venus s girdle so renowned of old three thousand five hundred three to expel grief and care to cause mirth and gladness of heart if they be rightly understood or seasonably applied In a word three thousand five hundred four Amor voluptas Venus gaudium Jocus ludus sermo suavis suaviatio Gratification pleasure love joy Mirth sport pleasant words and no alloy are the true Nepenthes For these causes our physicians generally prescribe this as a principal engine to batter the walls of melancholy a chief antidote and a sufficient cure of itself By all means saith three thousand five hundred five Mesue procure mirth to these men in such things as are heard seen tasted or smelled or any way perceived and let them have all enticements and fair promises the sight of excellent beauties attires ornaments delightsome passages to distract their minds from fear and sorrow and such things on which they are so fixed and intent three thousand five hundred six Let them use hunting sports plays jests merry company as Rhasis prescribes which will not let the mind be molested a cup of good drink now and then hear music and have such companions with whom they are especially delighted three thousand five hundred seven merry tales or toys drinking singing dancing and whatsoever else may procure mirth and by no means saith Guianerius suffer them to be alone Benedictus Victorius Faventinus in his empirics accounts it an especial remedy against melancholy three thousand five hundred eight to hear and see singing dancing maskers mummers to converse with such merry fellows and fair maids For the beauty of a woman cheereth the countenance Ecclus xxxvi twenty two three thousand five hundred nine Beauty alone is a sovereign remedy against fear grief and all melancholy fits a charm as Peter de la Seine and many other writers affirm a banquet itself he gives instance in discontented Menelaus that was so often freed by Helena s fair face and three thousand five hundred ten Tully three Tusc cites Epicurus as a chief patron of this tenet To expel grief and procure pleasure sweet smells good diet touch taste embracing singing dancing sports plays and above the rest exquisite beauties quibus oculi jucunde moventur et animi are most powerful means obvia forma to meet or see a fair maid pass by or to be in company with her He found it by experience and made good use of it in his own person if Plutarch belie him not for he reckons up the names of some more elegant pieces three thousand five hundred eleven Leontia Boedina Hedieia Nicedia that were frequently seen in Epicurus garden and very familiar in his house Neither did he try it himself alone but if we may give credit to three thousand five hundred twelve Atheneus he practised it upon others For when a sad and sick patient was brought unto him to be cured he laid him on a down bed crowned him with a garland of sweet smelling flowers in a fair perfumed closet delicately set out and after a portion or two of good drink which he administered he brought in a beautiful young three thousand five hundred thirteen wench that could play upon a lute sing and dance c Tully three Tusc scoffs at Epicurus for this his profane physic as well he deserved and yet Phavorinus and Stobeus highly approve of it most of our looser physicians in some cases to such parties especially allow of this and all of them will have a melancholy sad and discontented person make frequent use of honest sports companies and recreations et incitandos ad Venerem as three thousand five hundred fourteen Rodericus a Fonseca will aspectu et contactu pulcherrimarum foeminarum to be drawn to such consorts whether they will or no Not to be an auditor only or a spectator but sometimes an actor himself Dulce est desipere in loco to play the fool now and then is not amiss there is a time for all things Grave Socrates would be merry by fits sing dance and take his liquor too or else Theodoret belies him so would old Cato three thousand five hundred fifteen Tully by his own confession and the rest Xenophon in his Sympos brings in Socrates as a principal actor no man merrier than himself and sometimes he would three thousand five hundred sixteen ride a cockhorse with his children equitare in arundine longa Though Alcibiades scoffed at him for it and well he might for now and then saith Plutarch the most virtuous honest and gravest men will use feasts jests and toys as we do sauce to our meats So did Scipio and Laelius three thousand five hundred seventeen Qui ubi se a vulgo et scena in secreta remorant Virtus Scipiadae et mitis sapientia Laeli Nugari cum illo et discincti ludere donec Decoqueretur olus soliti Valorous Scipio and gentle Laelius Removed from the scene and rout so clamorous Were wont to recreate themselves their robes laid by Whilst supper by the cook was making ready Machiavel in the eighth book of his Florentine history gives this note of Cosmo de Medici the wisest and gravest man of his time in Italy that he would three thousand five hundred eighteen now and then play the most egregious fool in his carriage and was so much given to jesters players and childish sports to make himself merry that he that should but consider his gravity on the one part his folly and lightness on the other would surely say there were two distinct persons in him Now methinks he did well in it though three thousand five hundred nineteen Salisburiensis be of opinion that magistrates senators and grave men should not descend to lighter sports ne respublica ludere videatur but as Themistocles still keep a stern and constant carriage I commend Cosmo de Medici and Castruccius Castrucanus than whom Italy never knew a worthier captain another Alexander if three thousand five hundred twenty Machiavel do not deceive us in his life when a friend of his reprehended him for dancing beside his dignity belike at some cushion dance he told him again qui sapit interdiu vix unquam noctii desipit he that is wise in the day may dote a little in the night Paulus Jovius relates as much of Pope Leo Decimus that he was a grave discreet staid man yet sometimes most free and too open in his sports And tis not altogether three thousand five hundred twenty one unfit or misbeseeming the gravity of such a man if that decorum of time place and such circumstances be observed three thousand five hundred twenty two Misce stultitiam consiliis brevem and as three thousand five hundred twenty three he said in an epigram to his wife I would have every man say to himself or to his friend Moll once in pleasant company by chance I wished that you for company would dance Which you refus d and said your years require Now matron like both manners and attire Well Moll if needs you will be matron like Then trust to this I will thee matron like Yet so to you my love may never lessen As you for church house bed observe this lesson Sit in the church as solemn as a saint No deed word thought your due devotion taint Veil if you will your head your soul reveal To him that only wounded souls can heal Be in my house as busy as a bee Having a sting for every one but me Buzzing in every corner gath ring honey Let nothing waste that costs or yieldeth money three thousand five hundred twenty four And when thou seest my heart to mirth incline Thy tongue wit blood warm with good cheer and wine Then of sweet sports let no occasion scape But be as wanton toying as an ape Those old three thousand five hundred twenty five Greeks had their Lubentiam Deam goddess of pleasure and the Lacedaemonians instructed from Lycurgus did Deo Risui sucrificare after their wars especially and in times of peace which was used in Thessaly as it appears by that of three thousand five hundred twenty six Apuleius who was made an instrument of their laughter himself three thousand five hundred twenty seven Because laughter and merriment was to season their labours and modester life three thousand five hundred twenty eight Risus enim divum atque hominum est aeterna voluptas Princes use jesters players and have those masters of revels in their courts The Romans at every supper for they had no solemn dinner used music gladiators jesters c as three thousand five hundred twenty nine Suetonius relates of Tiberius Dion of Commodus and so did the Greeks Besides music in Xenophon s Sympos Philippus ridendi artifex Philip a jester was brought to make sport Paulus Jovius in the eleventh book of his history hath a pretty digression of our English customs which howsoever some may misconstrue I for my part will interpret to the best three thousand five hundred thirty The whole nation beyond all other mortal men is most given to banqueting and feasts for they prolong them many hours together with dainty cheer exquisite music and facete jesters and afterwards they fall a dancing and courting their mistresses till it be late in the night Volateran gives the same testimony of this island commending our jovial manner of entertainment and good mirth and methinks he saith well there is no harm in it long may they use it and all such modest sports Ctesias reports of a Persian king that had one hundred fifty maids attending at his table to play sing and dance by turns and three thousand five hundred thirty one Lil Geraldus of an Egyptian prince that kept nine virgins still to wait upon him and those of most excellent feature and sweet voices which afterwards gave occasion to the Greeks of that fiction of the nine Muses The king of Ethiopia in Africa most of our Asiatic princes have done so and do those Sophies Mogors Turks c solace themselves after supper amongst their queens and concubines quae jucundioris oblectamenti causa three thousand five hundred thirty two saith mine author coram rege psallere et saltare consueverant taking great pleasure to see and hear them sing and dance This and many such means to exhilarate the heart of men have been still practised in all ages as knowing there is no better thing to the preservation of man s life What shall I say then but to every melancholy man three thousand five hundred thirty three Utere convivis non tristibus utere amicis Quos nugae et risus et joca salsa juvant Feast often and use friends not still so sad Whose jests and merriments may make thee glad Use honest and chaste sports scenical shows plays games three thousand five hundred thirty four Accedant juvenumque Chori mistaeque puellae And as Marsilius Ficinus concludes an epistle to Bernard Canisianus and some other of his friends will I this tract to all good students three thousand five hundred thirty five Live merrily O my friends free from cares perplexity anguish grief of mind live merrily laetitia caelum vos creavit three thousand five hundred thirty six Again and again I request you to be merry if anything trouble your hearts or vex your souls neglect and contemn it three thousand five hundred thirty seven let it pass three thousand five hundred thirty eight And this I enjoin you not as a divine alone but as a physician for without this mirth which is the life and quintessence of physic medicines and whatsoever is used and applied to prolong the life of man is dull dead and of no force Dum fata sinunt vivite laeti Seneca I say be merry three thousand five hundred thirty nine Nec lusibus virentem Viduemus hanc juventam It was Tiresias the prophet s council to three thousand five hundred forty Menippus that travelled all the world over even down to hell itself to seek content and his last farewell to Menippus to be merry three thousand five hundred forty one Contemn the world saith he and count that is in it vanity and toys this only covet all thy life long be not curious or over solicitous in anything but with a well composed and contented estate to enjoy thyself and above all things to be merry three thousand five hundred forty two Si Numerus uti censet sine amore jocisque Nil est jucundum vivas in amore jocisque Nothing better to conclude with Solomon Eccles iii twenty two than that a man should rejoice in his affairs Tis the same advice which every physician in this case rings to his patient as Capivaccius to his three thousand five hundred forty three avoid overmuch study and perturbations of the mind and as much as in thee lies live at heart s ease Prosper Calenus to that melancholy Cardinal Caesius three thousand five hundred forty four amidst thy serious studies and business use jests and conceits plays and toys and whatsoever else may recreate thy mind Nothing better than mirth and merry company in this malady three thousand five hundred forty five It begins with sorrow saith Montanus it must be expelled with hilarity But see the mischief many men knowing that merry company is the only medicine against melancholy will therefore neglect their business and in another extreme spend all their days among good fellows in a tavern or an alehouse and know not otherwise how to bestow their time but in drinking malt worms men fishes or water snakes three thousand five hundred forty six Qui bibunt solum ranarum more nihil comedentes like so many frogs in a puddle Tis their sole exercise to eat and drink to sacrifice to Volupia Rumina Edulica Potina Mellona is all their religion They wish for Philoxenus neck Jupiter s trinoctium and that the sun would stand still as in Joshua s time to satisfy their lust that they might dies noctesque pergraecari et bibere Flourishing wits and men of good parts good fashion and good worth basely prostitute themselves to every rogue s company to take tobacco and drink to roar and sing scurrilous songs in base places three thousand five hundred forty seven Invenies aliquem cum percussore jacentem Permistum nautis aut furibus aut fugitivis Which Thomas Erastus objects to Paracelsus that he would be drinking all day long with carmen and tapsters in a brothel house is too frequent among us with men of better note like Timocreon of Rhodes multa bibens et multa vorans c They drown their wits seethe their brains in ale consume their fortunes lose their time weaken their temperatures contract filthy diseases rheums dropsies calentures tremor get swollen jugulars pimpled red faces sore eyes c heat their livers alter their complexions spoil their stomachs overthrow their bodies for drink drowns more than the sea and all the rivers that fall into it mere funges and casks confound their souls suppress reason go from Scylla to Charybdis and use that which is a help to their undoing three thousand five hundred forty eight Quid refert morbo an ferro pereamve ruina three thousand five hundred forty nine When the Black Prince went to set the exiled king of Castile into his kingdom there was a terrible battle fought between the English and the Spanish at last the Spanish fled the English followed them to the river side where some drowned themselves to avoid their enemies the rest were killed Now tell me what difference is between drowning and killing As good be melancholy still as drunken beasts and beggars Company a sole comfort and an only remedy to all kind of discontent is their sole misery and cause of perdition As Hermione lamented in Euripides malae mulieres me fecerunt malam Evil company marred her may they justly complain bad companions have been their bane For three thousand five hundred fifty malus malum vult ut sit sui similis one drunkard in a company one thief one whoremaster will by his goodwill make all the rest as bad as himself three thousand five hundred fifty one Et si Nocturnos jures te formidare vapores be of what complexion you will inclination love or hate be it good or bad if you come amongst them you must do as they do yea three thousand five hundred fifty two though it be to the prejudice of your health you must drink venenum pro vino And so like grasshoppers whilst they sing over their cups all summer they starve in winter and for a little vain merriment shall find a sorrowful reckoning in the end SECT III MEMB I A Consolatory Digression containing the Remedies of all manner of Discontents Because in the preceding section I have made mention of good counsel comfortable speeches persuasion how necessarily they are required to the cure of a discontented or troubled mind how present a remedy they yield and many times a sole sufficient cure of themselves I have thought fit in this following section a little to digress if at least it be to digress in this subject to collect and glean a few remedies and comfortable speeches out of our best orators philosophers divines and fathers of the church tending to this purpose I confess many have copiously written of this subject Plato Seneca Plutarch Xenophon Epictetus Theophrastus Xenocrates Grantor Lucian Boethius and some of late Sadoletus Cardan Budaeus Stella Petrarch Erasmus besides Austin Cyprian Bernard c And they so well that as Hierome in like case said si nostrum areret ingenium de illorum posset fontibus irrigari if our barren wits were dried up they might be copiously irrigated from those well springs and I shall but actum agere yet because these tracts are not so obvious and common I will epitomise and briefly insert some of their divine precepts reducing their voluminous and vast treatises to my small scale for it were otherwise impossible to bring so great vessels into so little a creek And although as Cardan said of his book de consol three thousand five hundred fifty three I know beforehand this tract of mine many will contemn and reject they that are fortunate happy and in flourishing estate have no need of such consolatory speeches they that are miserable and unhappy think them insufficient to ease their grieved minds and comfort their misery yet I will go on for this must needs do some good to such as are happy to bring them to a moderation and make them reflect and know themselves by seeing the inconstancy of human felicity others misery and to such as are distressed if they will but attend and consider of this it cannot choose but give some content and comfort three thousand five hundred fifty four Tis true no medicine can cure all diseases some affections of the mind are altogether incurable yet these helps of art physic and philosophy must not be contemned Arrianus and Plotinus are stiff in the contrary opinion that such precepts can do little good Boethius himself cannot comfort in some cases they will reject such speeches like bread of stones Insana stultae mentis haec solatia three thousand five hundred fifty five Words add no courage which three thousand five hundred fifty six Catiline once said to his soldiers a captain s oration doth not make a coward a valiant man and as Job three thousand five hundred fifty seven feelingly said to his friends you are but miserable comforters all Tis to no purpose in that vulgar phrase to use a company of obsolete sentences and familiar sayings as three thousand five hundred fifty eight Plinius Secundus being now sorrowful and heavy for the departure of his dear friend Cornelius Rufus a Roman senator wrote to his fellow Tiro in like case adhibe solatia sed nova aliqua sed fortia quae audierim nunquam legerim nunquam nam quae audivi quae legi omnia tanto dolore superantur either say something that I never read nor heard of before or else hold thy peace Most men will here except trivial consolations ordinary speeches and known persuasions in this behalf will be of small force what can any man say that hath not been said To what end are such paraenetical discourses you may as soon remove Mount Caucasus as alter some men s affections Yet sure I think they cannot choose but do some good and comfort and ease a little though it be the same again I will say it and upon that hope I will adventure three thousand five hundred fifty nine Non meus hic sermo tis not my speech this but of Seneca Plutarch Epictetus Austin Bernard Christ and his Apostles If I make nothing as three thousand five hundred sixty Montaigne said in like case I will mar nothing tis not my doctrine but my study I hope I shall do nobody wrong to speak what I think and deserve not blame in imparting my mind If it be not for thy ease it may for mine own so Tully Cardan and Boethius wrote de consol as well to help themselves as others be it as it may I will essay Discontents and grievances are either general or particular general are wars plagues dearths famine fires inundations unseasonable weather epidemical diseases which afflict whole kingdoms territories cities or peculiar to private men three thousand five hundred sixty one as cares crosses losses death of friends poverty want sickness orbities injuries abuses c Generally all discontent three thousand five hundred sixty two homines quatimur fortunae salo No condition free quisque suos patimur manes Even in the midst of our mirth and jollity there is some grudging some complaint as three thousand five hundred sixty three he saith our whole life is a glycypicron a bitter sweet passion honey and gall mixed together we are all miserable and discontent who can deny it If all and that it be a common calamity an inevitable necessity all distressed then as Cardan infers three thousand five hundred sixty four who art thou that hopest to go free Why dost thou not grieve thou art a mortal man and not governor of the world Ferre quam sortem patiuntur omnes Nemo recuset three thousand five hundred sixty five If it be common to all why should one man be more disquieted than another If thou alone wert distressed it were indeed more irksome and less to be endured but when the calamity is common comfort thyself with this thou hast more fellows Solamen miseris socios habuisse doloris tis not thy sole case and why shouldst thou be so impatient three thousand five hundred sixty six Aye but alas we are more miserable than others what shall we do Besides private miseries we live in perpetual fear and danger of common enemies we have Bellona s whips and pitiful outcries for epithalamiums for pleasant music that fearful noise of ordnance drums and warlike trumpets still sounding in our ears instead of nuptial torches we have firing of towns and cities for triumphs lamentations for joy tears three thousand five hundred sixty seven So it is and so it was and so it ever will be He that refuseth to see and hear to suffer this is not fit to live in this world and knows not the common condition of all men to whom so long as they live with a reciprocal course joys and sorrows are annexed and succeed one another It is inevitable it may not be avoided and why then shouldst thou be so much troubled Grave nihil est homini quod fert necessitas as three thousand five hundred sixty eight Tully deems out of an old poet that which is necessary cannot be grievous If it be so then comfort thyself in this three thousand five hundred sixty nine that whether thou wilt or no it must be endured make a virtue of necessity and conform thyself to undergo it three thousand five hundred seventy Si longa est levis est si gravis est brevis est If it be long tis light if grievous it cannot last It will away dies dolorem minuit and if nought else time will wear it out custom will ease it three thousand five hundred seventy one oblivion is a common medicine for all losses injuries griefs and detriments whatsoever three thousand five hundred seventy two and when they are once past this commodity comes of infelicity it makes the rest of our life sweeter unto us three thousand five hundred seventy three Atque haec olim meminisse juvabit recollection of the past is pleasant the privation and want of a thing many times makes it more pleasant and delightsome than before it was We must not think the happiest of us all to escape here without some misfortunes three thousand five hundred seventy four Usque adeo nulla est sincera voluptas Solicitumque aliquid laetis intervenit Heaven and earth are much unlike three thousand five hundred seventy five Those heavenly bodies indeed are freely carried in their orbs without any impediment or interruption to continue their course for innumerable ages and make their conversions but men are urged with many difficulties and have diverse hindrances oppositions still crossing interrupting their endeavours and desires and no mortal man is free from this law of nature We must not therefore hope to have all things answer our own expectation to have a continuance of good success and fortunes Fortuna nunquam perpetuo est bona And as Minutius Felix the Roman consul told that insulting Coriolanus drunk with his good fortunes look not for that success thou hast hitherto had three thousand five hundred seventy six It never yet happened to any man since the beginning of the world nor ever will to have all things according to his desire or to whom fortune was never opposite and adverse Even so it fell out to him as he foretold And so to others even to that happiness of Augustus though he were Jupiter s almoner Pluto s treasurer Neptune s admiral it could not secure him Such was Alcibiades s fortune Narsetes that great Gonsalvus and most famous men s that as three thousand five hundred seventy seven Jovius concludes it is almost fatal to great princes through their own default or otherwise circumvented with envy and malice to lose their honours and die contumeliously Tis so still hath been and ever will be Nihil est ab omni parte beatum There s no perfection is so absolute That some impurity doth not pollute Whatsoever is under the moon is subject to corruption alteration and so long as thou livest upon earth look not for other three thousand five hundred seventy eight Thou shalt not here find peaceable and cheerful days quiet times but rather clouds storms calumnies such is our fate And as those errant planets in their distinct orbs have their several motions sometimes direct stationary retrograde in apogee perigee oriental occidental combust feral free and as our astrologers will have their fortitudes and debilities by reason of those good and bad irradiations conferred to each other s site in the heavens in their terms houses case detriments c So we rise and fall in this world ebb and flow in and out reared and dejected lead a troublesome life subject to many accidents and casualties of fortunes variety of passions infirmities as well from ourselves as others Yea but thou thinkest thou art more miserable than the rest other men are happy but in respect of thee their miseries are but flea bitings to thine thou alone art unhappy none so bad as thyself Yet if as Socrates said three thousand five hundred seventy nine All men in the world should come and bring their grievances together of body mind fortune sores ulcers madness epilepsies agues and all those common calamities of beggary want servitude imprisonment and lay them on a heap to be equally divided wouldst thou share alike and take thy portion or be as thou art Without question thou wouldst be as thou art If some Jupiter should say to give us all content three thousand five hundred eighty Jam faciam quod vultis eris tu qui modo miles Mercator tu consultus modo rusticus hinc vos Vos hinc mutatis discedite partibus eia Quid slatis nolint Well be t so then you master soldier Shall be a merchant you sir lawyer A country gentlemen go you to this That side you why stand ye it s well as tis three thousand five hundred eighty one Every man knows his own but not others defects and miseries and tis the nature of all men still to reflect upon themselves their own misfortunes not to examine or consider other men s not to compare themselves with others To recount their miseries but not their good gifts fortunes benefits which they have or ruminate on their adversity but not once to think on their prosperity not what they have but what they want to look still on them that go before but not on those infinite numbers that come after three thousand five hundred eighty two Whereas many a man would think himself in heaven a pretty prince if he had but the least part of that fortune which thou so much repinest at abhorrest and accountest a most vile and wretched estate How many thousands want that which thou hast how many myriads of poor slaves captives of such as work day and night in coal pits tin mines with sore toil to maintain a poor living of such as labour in body and mind live in extreme anguish and pain all which thou art free from O fortunatos nimium bona si sua norint Thou art most happy if thou couldst be content and acknowledge thy happiness three thousand five hundred eighty three Rem carendo non fruendo cognoscimus when thou shalt hereafter come to want that which thou now loathest abhorrest and art weary of and tired with when tis past thou wilt say thou wert most happy and after a little miss wish with all thine heart thou hadst the same content again mightst lead but such a life a world for such a life the remembrance of it is pleasant Be silent then three thousand five hundred eighty four rest satisfied desine intuensque in aliorum infortunia solare mentem comfort thyself with other men s misfortunes and as the mouldwarp in Aesop told the fox complaining for want of a tail and the rest of his companions tacete quando me occulis captum videtis you complain of toys but I am blind be quiet I say to thee be thou satisfied It is three thousand five hundred eighty five recorded of the hares that with a general consent they went to drown themselves out of a feeling of their misery but when they saw a company of frogs more fearful than they were they began to take courage and comfort again Compare thine estate with others Similes aliorum respice casus mitius ista feres Be content and rest satisfied for thou art well in respect to others be thankful for that thou hast that God hath done for thee he hath not made thee a monster a beast a base creature as he might but a man a Christian such a man consider aright of it thou art full well as thou art three thousand five hundred eighty six Quicquid vult habere nemo potest no man can have what he will Illud potest nolle quod non habet he may choose whether he will desire that which he hath not Thy lot is fallen make the best of it three thousand five hundred eighty seven If we should all sleep at all times as Endymion is said to have done who then were happier than his fellow Our life is but short a very dream and while we look about three thousand five hundred eighty eight immortalitas adest eternity is at hand three thousand five hundred eighty nine Our life is a pilgrimage on earth which wise men pass with great alacrity If thou be in woe sorrow want distress in pain or sickness think of that of our apostle God chastiseth them whom he loveth they that sow in tears shall reap in joy Psal cxxvi six As the furnace proveth the potter s vessel so doth temptation try men s thoughts Eccl xxv five tis for three thousand five hundred ninety thy good Periisses nisi periisses hadst thou not been so visited thou hadst been utterly undone as gold in the fire so men are tried in adversity Tribulatio ditut and which Camerarius hath well shadowed in an emblem of a thresher and corn Si tritura absit paleis sunt abdita grana Nos crux mundanis separat a paleis As threshing separates from straw the corn By crosses from the world s chaff are we born Tis the very same which three thousand five hundred ninety one Chrysostom comments hom two in three Mat Corn is not separated but by threshing nor men from worldly impediments but by tribulation Tis that which three thousand five hundred ninety two Cyprian ingeminates Ser four de immort Tis that which three thousand five hundred ninety three Hierom which all the fathers inculcate so we are catechised for eternity Tis that which the proverb insinuates Nocumentum documentum tis that which all the world rings in our ears Deus unicum habet filium sine peccato nullum sine flagello God saith three thousand five hundred ninety four Austin hath one son without sin none without correction three thousand five hundred ninety five An expert seaman is tried in a tempest a runner in a race a captain in a battle a valiant man in adversity a Christian in tentation and misery Basil hom eight We are sent as so many soldiers into this world to strive with it the flesh the devil our life is a warfare and who knows it not three thousand five hundred ninety six Non est ad astra mollis e terris via three thousand five hundred ninety seven and therefore peradventure this world here is made troublesome unto us that as Gregory notes we should not be delighted by the way and forget whither we are going three thousand five hundred ninety eight Ite nunc fortes ubi celsa magni Ducit exempli via cur inertis Terga nudatis superata tellus Sidera donat Go on then merrily to heaven If the way be troublesome and you in misery in many grievances on the other side you have many pleasant sports objects sweet smells delightsome tastes music meats herbs flowers c to recreate your senses Or put case thou art now forsaken of the world dejected contemned yet comfort thyself as it was said to Agar in the wilderness three thousand five hundred ninety nine God sees thee he takes notice of thee there is a God above that can vindicate thy cause that can relieve thee And surely three thousand six hundred Seneca thinks he takes delight in seeing thee The gods are well pleased when they see great men contending with adversity as we are to see men fight or a man with a beast But these are toys in respect three thousand six hundred one Behold saith he a spectacle worthy of God a good man contented with his estate A tyrant is the best sacrifice to Jupiter as the ancients held and his best object a contented mind For thy part then rest satisfied cast all thy care on him thy burthen on him three thousand six hundred two rely on him trust on him and he shall nourish thee care for thee give thee thine heart s desire say with David God is our hope and strength in troubles ready to be found Psal

be rid at last In the mean time let it take its course thy mind is not any way disabled Bilibaldus Pirkimerus senator to Charles the Fifth ruled all Germany lying most part of his days sick of the gout upon his bed The more violent thy torture is the less it will continue and though it be severe and hideous for the time comfort thyself as martyrs do with honour and immortality three thousand six hundred twenty seven That famous philosopher Epicurus being in as miserable pain of stone and colic as a man might endure solaced himself with a conceit of immortality the joy of his soul for his rare inventions repelled the pain of his bodily torments Baseness of birth is a great disparagement to some men especially if they be wealthy bear office and come to promotion in a commonwealth then as three thousand six hundred twenty eight he observes if their birth be not answerable to their calling and to their fellows they are much abashed and ashamed of themselves Some scorn their own father and mother deny brothers and sisters with the rest of their kindred and friends and will not suffer them to come near them when they are in their pomp accounting it a scandal to their greatness to have such beggarly beginnings Simon in Lucian having now got a little wealth changed his name from Simon to Simonides for that there were so many beggars of his kin and set the house on fire where he was born because no body should point at it Others buy titles coats of arms and by all means screw themselves into ancient families falsifying pedigrees usurping scutcheons and all because they would not seem to be base The reason is for that this gentility is so much admired by a company of outsides and such honour attributed unto it as amongst three thousand six hundred twenty nine Germans Frenchmen and Venetians the gentry scorn the commonalty and will not suffer them to match with them they depress and make them as so many asses to carry burdens In our ordinary talk and fallings out the most opprobrious and scurrile name we can fasten upon a man or first give is to call him base rogue beggarly rascal and the like Whereas in my judgment this ought of all other grievances to trouble men least Of all vanities and fopperies to brag of gentility is the greatest for what is it they crack so much of and challenge such superiority as if they were demigods Birth Tantane vos generis tenuit fiducia vestri three thousand six hundred thirty It is non ens a mere flash a ceremony a toy a thing of nought Consider the beginning present estate progress ending of gentry and then

lascivious prince and for that he is exalted Tiberius preferred many to honours in his time because they were famous whoremasters and sturdy drinkers many come into this parchment row so three thousand six hundred thirty four one calls it by flattery or cozening search your old families and you shall scarce find of a multitude as Aeneas Sylvius observes qui sceleratum non habent ortum that have not a wicked beginning aut qui vi et dolo eo fastigii non ascendunt as that plebeian in three thousand six hundred thirty five Machiavel in a set oration proved to his fellows that do not rise by knavery force foolery villainy or such indirect means They are commonly able that are wealthy virtue and riches seldom settle on one man who then sees not the beginning of nobility spoils enrich one usury another treason a third witchcraft a fourth flattery a fifth lying stealing bearing false witness a sixth adultery the seventh c One makes a fool of himself to make his lord merry another dandles my young master bestows a little nag on him a third marries a cracked piece c Now may it please your good worship your lordship who was the first founder of your family The poet answers three thousand six hundred thirty six Aut Pastor fuit aut illud quod dicere nolo Are he or you the better gentleman If he then we have traced him to his form If you what is it of which thou boastest so much That thou art his son It may be his heir his reputed son and yet indeed a priest or a serving man may be the true father of him but we will not controvert that now married women are all honest thou art his son s son s son begotten and born infra quatuor maria c Thy great great great grandfather was a rich citizen and then in all likelihood a usurer a lawyer and then a a courtier and then a a country gentleman and then he scraped it out of sheep c And you are the heir of all his virtues fortunes titles so then what is your gentry but as Hierom saith Opes antiquae inveteratae divitiae ancient wealth that is the definition of gentility The father goes often to the devil to make his son a gentleman For the present what is it It began saith three thousand six hundred thirty seven Agrippa with strong impiety with tyranny oppression c and so it is maintained wealth began it no matter how got wealth continueth and increaseth it Those Roman knights were so called if they could dispend per annum so much three thousand six hundred thirty eight In the kingdom of Naples and France he that buys such lands buys the honour title barony together with it and they that can dispend so much amongst us must be called to bear office to be knights or fine for it as one observes three thousand six hundred thirty nine nobiliorum ex censu judicant our nobles are measured by their means And what now is the object of honour What maintains our gentry but wealth three thousand six hundred forty Nobilitas sine re projecta vilior alga Without means gentry is naught worth nothing so contemptible and base three thousand six hundred forty one Disputare de nobilitate generis sine divitiis est disputare de nobilitate stercoris saith Nevisanus the lawyer to dispute of gentry without wealth is saving your reverence to discuss the original of a merd So that it is wealth alone that denominates money which maintains it gives esse to it for which every man may have it And what is their ordinary exercise three thousand six hundred forty two sit to eat drink lie down to sleep and rise to play wherein lies their worth and sufficiency in a few coats of arms eagles lions serpents bears tigers dogs crosses bends fesses c and such like baubles which they commonly set up in their galleries porches windows on bowls platters coaches in tombs churches men s sleeves c three thousand

talk big fustian three thousand six hundred forty four insult scorn strut contemn others and use a little mimical and apish compliment above the rest he is a complete Egregiam vero laudem a well qualified gentleman these are most of their employments this their greatest commendation What is gentry this parchment nobility then but as three thousand six hundred forty five Agrippa defines it a sanctuary of knavery and naughtiness a cloak for wickedness and execrable vices of pride fraud contempt boasting oppression dissimulation lust gluttony malice fornication adultery ignorance impiety A nobleman therefore in some likelihood as he concludes is an atheist an oppressor an epicure a three thousand six hundred forty six gull a dizzard an illiterate idiot an outside a glowworm a proud fool an arrant ass Ventris et inguinis mancipium a slave to his lust and belly solaque libidine fortis And as Salvianus observed of his countrymen the Aquitanes in France sicut titulis primi fuere sic et vitiis as they were the first in rank so also in rottenness and Cabinet du Roy their own writer distinctly of the rest The nobles of Berry are most part lechers they of Touraine thieves they of Narbonne covetous they of Guienne coiners they of Provence atheists they of Rheims superstitious they of Lyons treacherous of Normandy proud of Picardy insolent c We may generally conclude the greater men the more vicious In fine as three thousand six hundred forty seven Aeneas Sylvius adds they are most part miserable sottish and filthy fellows like the walls of their houses fair without foul within What dost thou vaunt of now three thousand six hundred forty eight What dost thou gape and wonder at admire him for his brave apparel horses dogs fine houses manors orchards gardens walks Why a fool may be possessor of this as well as he and he that accounts him a better man a nobleman for having of it he is a fool himself Now go and brag of thy gentility This is it belike which makes the three thousand six hundred forty nine Turks at this day scorn nobility and all those huffing bombast titles which so much elevate their poles except it be such as have got it at first maintain it by some supereminent quality or excellent worth And for this cause the Ragusian commonwealth Switzers and the united provinces in all their aristocracies or democratical monarchies if I may so call them exclude all these degrees of hereditary honours and will admit of none to bear office but such as are learned like those Athenian Areopagites wise discreet and well brought up The three thousand six hundred fifty Chinese observe the same customs no man amongst them noble by birth out of their philosophers and doctors they choose magistrates their politic nobles are taken from such as be moraliter nobiles virtuous noble nobilitas ut olim ab officio non a natura as in Israel of old and their office was to defend and govern their country in war and peace not to hawk hunt eat drink game alone as too many do Their Loysii Mandarini literati licentiati and such as have raised themselves by their worth are their noblemen only though fit to govern a state and why then should any that is otherwise of worth be ashamed of his birth why should not he be as much respected that leaves a noble posterity as he that hath had noble ancestors nay why not more for plures solem orientem we adore the sun rising most part and how much better is it to say Ego meis majoribus virtute praeluxi I have outshone my ancestors in virtues to boast himself of his virtues than of his birth Cathesbeius sultan of Egypt and Syria was by his condition a slave but for worth valour and manhood second to no king and for that cause as three thousand six hundred fifty one Jovius writes elected emperor of the Mamelukes That poor Spanish Pizarro for his valour made by Charles the fifth marquess of Anatillo the Turkey Pashas are all such Pertinax Philippus Arabs Maximinus Probus Aurelius c from common soldiers became emperors Cato Cincinnatus c consuls Pius Secundus Sixtus Quintus Johan Secundus Nicholas Quintus c popes Socrates Virgil Horace libertino parte natus three thousand six hundred fifty

Castrucanus a poor child found in the field exposed to misery became prince of Lucca and Senes in Italy a most complete soldier and worthy captain Machiavel compares him to Scipio or Alexander And tis a wonderful thing three thousand six hundred fifty five saith he to him that shall consider of it that all those or the greatest part of them that have done the bravest exploits here upon earth and excelled the rest of the nobles of their time have been still born in some abject obscure place or of base and obscure abject parents A most memorable observation three thousand six hundred fifty six Scaliger accounts it et non praetereundum maximorum virorum plerosque patres ignoratos matres impudicas fuisse three thousand six hundred fifty seven I could recite a great catalogue of them every kingdom every province will yield innumerable examples and why then should baseness of birth be objected to any man Who thinks worse of Tully for being arpinas an upstart Or Agathocles that Silician king for being a potter s son Iphicrates and Marius were meanly born What wise man thinks better of any person for his nobility as he said in three thousand six hundred fifty eight Machiavel omnes eodem patre nati Adam s sons conceived all and born in sin c We are by nature all as one all alike if you see us naked let us wear theirs and they our clothes and what is the difference To speak truth as three thousand six hundred fifty nine Bale did of P Schalichius I more esteem thy worth learning honesty than thy nobility honour thee more that thou art a writer a doctor of divinity than Earl of the Huns Baron of Skradine or hast title to such and such provinces c Thou art more fortunate and great so three thousand six hundred sixty Jovius writes to Cosmo de Medici then Duke of Florence for thy virtues than for thy lovely wife and happy children friends fortunes or great duchy of Tuscany So I account thee and who doth not so indeed three thousand six hundred sixty one Abdolominus was a gardener and yet by Alexander for his virtues made King of Syria How much better is it to be born of mean parentage and to excel in worth to be morally noble which is preferred before that natural nobility by divines philosophers and three thousand six hundred sixty two politicians to be learned honest discreet well qualified to be fit for any manner of employment in country and commonwealth war and peace than to be Degeneres Neoptolemi as many brave nobles are only wise because rich otherwise idiots illiterate unfit for any manner of service three thousand six hundred sixty three Udalricus Earl of Cilia upbraided John Huniades with the baseness of his birth but he replied in te Ciliensis comitatus turpiter extinguitur in me gloriose Bistricensis exoritur thine earldom is consumed with riot mine begins with honour and renown Thou hast had so many noble ancestors what is that to thee Vix ea nostra voco three thousand six hundred sixty four when thou art a dizzard

good thou art a true nobleman perfectly noble although born of Thersites dum modo tu sis Aeacidae similis non natus sed factus noble Greek kat exochaen three thousand six hundred sixty five for neither sword nor fire nor water nor sickness nor outward violence nor the devil himself can take thy good parts from thee Be not ashamed of thy birth then thou art a gentleman all the world over and shalt be honoured when as he strip him of his fine clothes three thousand six hundred sixty six dispossess him of his wealth is a funge which three thousand six hundred sixty seven Polynices in his banishment found true by experience gentry was not esteemed like a piece of coin in another country that no man will take and shall be contemned Once more though thou be a barbarian born at Tontonteac a villain a slave a Saldanian Negro or a rude Virginian in Dasamonquepec he a French monsieur a Spanish don a signor of Italy I care not how descended of what family of what order baron count prince if thou be well qualified and he not but a degenerate Neoptolemus I tell thee in a word thou art a man and he is a beast Let no terrae filius or upstart insult at this which I have said no worthy gentleman take offence I speak it not to detract from such as are well deserving truly virtuous and noble I do much respect and honour true gentry and nobility I was born of worshipful parents myself in an ancient family but I am a younger brother it concerns me not or had I been some great heir richly endowed so minded as I am I should not have been elevated at all but so esteemed of it as of all other human happiness honours c they have their period are brittle and inconstant As three thousand six hundred sixty eight he said of that great river Danube it riseth from a small fountain a little brook at first sometimes broad sometimes narrow now slow then swift increased at last to an incredible greatness by the confluence of sixty navigable rivers it vanisheth in conclusion loseth his name and is suddenly swallowed up of the Euxine sea I may say of our greatest families they were mean at first augmented by rich marriages purchases offices they continue for some ages with some little alteration of circumstances fortunes places c by some prodigal son for some default or for want of issue they are defaced in an instant and their memory blotted out So much in the mean time I do attribute to Gentility that if he be well descended of worshipful or noble parentage he will express it in his conditions three thousand six hundred sixty nine nec enim feroces Progenerant aquilae columbas And although the nobility of our times be much like our coins more in number and value but less in weight and goodness with finer stamps cuts or outsides than of old yet if he retain those ancient characters of true gentry he will be more affable courteous gently disposed of fairer carriage better temper or a more magnanimous heroical and generous spirit than that vulgus hominum those ordinary boors and peasants qui adeo improbi agrestes et inculti plerumque sunt ne dicam maliciosi ut nemini ullum humanitatis officium praestent ne ipsi Deo si advenerit as three thousand six hundred seventy one observes of them a rude brutish uncivil wild a currish generation cruel and malicious incapable of discipline and such as have scarce common sense And it may be generally spoken of all which three thousand six hundred seventy one Lemnius the physician said of his travel into England the common people were silly sullen dogged clowns sed mitior nobilitas ad omne humanitatis officium paratissima the gentlemen were courteous and civil If it so fall out as often it doth that such peasants are preferred by reason of their wealth chance error c or otherwise yet as the cat in the fable when she was turned to a fair maid would play with mice a cur will be a cur a clown will be a clown he will likely savour of the stock whence he came and that innate rusticity can hardly be shaken off three thousand six hundred seventy two Licet superbus ambulet pecunia Fortuna non mutat genus And though by their education such men may be better qualified and more refined yet there be many symptoms by which they may likely be descried an affected fantastical carriage a tailor like spruceness a peculiar garb in all their proceedings choicer than ordinary in his diet and as three thousand six hundred seventy three Hierome well describes such a one to his Nepotian An upstart born in a base cottage that scarce at first had coarse bread to fill his hungry guts must now feed on kickshaws and made dishes will have all variety of flesh and fish the best oysters c A beggar s brat will be commonly more scornful imperious insulting insolent than another man of his rank Nothing so intolerable as a fortunate fool as three thousand six hundred seventy four Tully found out long since out of his experience Asperius nihil est humili cum surgit in altum set a beggar on horseback and he will ride a gallop a gallop c three thousand six hundred seventy five desaevit in omnes Dum se posse putat nec bellua saevior ulla est Quam servi rabies in libera colla furentis he forgets what he was domineers c and many such other symptoms he hath by which you may know him from a true gentleman Many errors and obliquities are on both sides noble ignoble factis natis yet still in all callings as some degenerate some are well deserving and most worthy of their honours And as Busbequius said of Suleiman the Magnificent he was tanto dignus imperio worthy of that great empire Many meanly descended are most worthy of their honour politice nobiles and well deserve it Many of our nobility so born which one said of Hephaestion Ptolemeus Seleucus Antigonus c and the rest of Alexander s followers they were all worthy to be monarchs and generals of armies deserve to be princes And I am so far forth of three thousand six hundred seventy six Sesellius s mind that they ought to be preferred if capable before others as being nobly born ingenuously brought up and from their infancy trained to all manner of civility For learning and virtue in a nobleman is more eminent and as a jewel set in gold is more precious and much to be respected such a man deserves better than others and is as great an honour to his family as his noble family to him In a word many noblemen are an ornament to their order many poor men s sons are singularly well endowed most eminent and well deserving for their worth wisdom learning virtue valour integrity excellent members and pillars of a commonwealth And therefore to conclude that which I first intended to be base by birth meanly born is no such disparagement Et sic demonstratur quod erat demonstrandum MEMB III Against Poverty and Want with such other Adversities One of the greatest miseries that can befall a man in the world s esteem is poverty or want which makes men steal bear false witness swear forswear contend murder and rebel which breaketh sleep and causeth death itself Greek ouden penias baruteron esti phortion no burden saith three thousand six hundred seventy seven Menander so intolerable as poverty it makes men desperate it erects and dejects census honores census amicitias money makes but poverty mars c and all this in the world s esteem yet if considered aright it is a great blessing in itself a happy estate and yields no cause of discontent or that men should therefore account themselves vile hated of God forsaken miserable unfortunate Christ himself was poor born in a manger and had not a house to hide his head in all his life three thousand six hundred seventy eight lest any man should make poverty a judgment of God or an odious estate And as he was himself so he informed his Apostles and Disciples they were all poor Prophets poor Apostles poor Act iii Silver and gold have I none As sorrowing saith Paul and yet always rejoicing as having nothing and yet possessing all things one Cor vi ten Your great Philosophers have been voluntarily poor not only Christians but many others Crates Thebanus was adored for a God in Athens three thousand six hundred seventy nine a nobleman by birth many servants he had an honourable attendance much wealth many manors fine apparel but when he saw this that all the wealth of the world was but brittle uncertain and no whit availing to live well he flung his burden into the sea and renounced his estate Those Curii and Fabricii will be ever renowned for contempt of these fopperies wherewith the world is so much affected Amongst Christians I could reckon up many kings and queens that have forsaken their crowns and fortunes and wilfully abdicated themselves from these so much esteemed toys three thousand six hundred eighty many that have refused honours titles and all this vain pomp and happiness which others so ambitiously seek and carefully study to compass and attain Riches I deny not are God s good gifts and blessings and honor est in honorante honours are from God both rewards of virtue and fit to be sought after sued for and may well be possessed yet no such great happiness in having or misery in wanting of them Dantur quidem bonis saith Austin ne quis mala aestimet mails autem ne quis nimis bona good men have wealth that we should not think it evil and bad men that they should not rely on or hold it so good as the rain falls on both sorts so are riches given to good and bad sed bonis in bonum but they are good only to the godly But three thousand six hundred eighty one compare both estates for natural parts they are not unlike and a beggar s child as three thousand six hundred eighty two Cardan well observes is no whit inferior to a prince s most part better and for those accidents of fortune it will easily appear there is no such odds no such extraordinary happiness in the one or misery in the other He is rich wealthy fat what gets he by it pride insolency lust ambition cares fears suspicion trouble anger emulation and many filthy diseases of body and mind He hath indeed variety of dishes better fare sweet wine pleasant sauce dainty music gay clothes lords it bravely out c and all that which Misillus admired in three thousand six hundred eighty three Lucian but with them he hath the gout dropsies apoplexies palsies stone pox rheums catarrhs crudities oppilations three thousand six hundred eighty four melancholy c lust enters in anger ambition according to three thousand six hundred eighty five Chrysostom the sequel of riches is pride riot intemperance arrogancy fury and all irrational courses three thousand six hundred eighty six turpi fregerunt saecula luxu Divitiae molles with their variety of dishes many such maladies of body and mind get in which the poor man knows not of As Saturn in three thousand six hundred eighty seven Lucian answered the discontented commonalty which because of their neglected Saturnal feasts in Rome made a grievous complaint and exclamation against rich men that they were much mistaken in supposing such happiness in riches three thousand six hundred eighty eight you see the best said he but you know not their several gripings and discontents they are like painted walls fair without rotten within diseased filthy crazy full of intemperance s effects three thousand six hundred eighty nine and who can reckon half if you but knew their fears cares anguish of mind and vexation to which they are subject you would hereafter renounce all riches three thousand six hundred ninety O si pateant pectora divitum Quantos intus sublimis agit Fortuna metus

was served Sejanus by Tiberius and Haman by Ahasuerus I resolve with Gregory potestas culminis est tempestas mentis et quo dignitas altior casus gravior honour is a tempest the higher they are elevated the more grievously depressed For the rest of his prerogatives which wealth affords as he hath more his expenses are the greater When goods increase they are increased that eat them and what good cometh to the owners but the beholding thereof with the eyes Eccles iv ten three thousand six hundred ninety seven Millia frumenti tua triverit area centum Non tuus hinc capiet venter plus quam

perdition one Tim vi nine Gold and silver hath destroyed many Ecclus viii two divitia saeculi sunt laquei diaboli so writes Bernard worldly wealth is the devil s bait and as the Moon when she is fuller of light is still farthest from the Sun the more wealth they have the farther they are commonly from God If I had said this of myself rich men would have pulled me to pieces but hear who saith and who seconds it an Apostle therefore saint James bids them weep and howl for the miseries that shall come upon them their gold shall rust and canker and eat their flesh as fire James v one two

Serrano dormit in ostro and naught withal I beseech you call him not happy but esteem him unfortunate because he hath many occasions offered to live unjustly on the other side a poor man is not

relicta Lis nunquam c I say again thou hast or at least mayst have it if thou wilt thyself and that which I am sure he wants a merry heart Passing by a village in the territory of Milan saith three thousand seven hundred seventy three saint Austin I saw a poor beggar that had got belike his bellyful of meat jesting and merry I sighed and said to some of my friends that were then with me what a deal of trouble madness pain and grief do we sustain and exaggerate unto ourselves to get that secure happiness which this poor beggar hath prevented us of and which we peradventure shall never have For that which he hath now attained with the begging of some small pieces of silver a temporal happiness and present heart s ease I cannot compass with all my careful windings and running in and out three thousand seven hundred seventy four And surely the beggar was very merry but I was heavy he was secure but I timorous And if any man should ask me now whether I had rather be merry or still so solicitous and sad I should say merry If he should ask me again whether I had rather be as I am or as this beggar was I should sure choose to be as I am tortured still with cares and fears but out of peevishness and not out of truth That which saint Austin said of himself here in this place I may truly say to thee thou discontented wretch thou covetous niggard thou churl thou ambitious and swelling toad tis not want but peevishness which is the cause of thy woes settle thine affection thou hast enough three thousand seven hundred seventy five Denique sit finis quaerendi quoque habeas

therefore be composed in thy fortune Thou hast enough he that is wet in a bath can be no more wet if he be flung into Tiber or into the ocean itself and if thou hadst all the world or a solid mass of gold as big as the world thou canst not have more than enough enjoy thyself at length and that which thou hast the mind is all be content thou art not poor but rich and so much the richer as three thousand seven hundred seventy nine Censorinus well writ to Cerellius quanto pauciora optas non quo plura possides in wishing less not having more I say then Non adjice opes sed minue cupiditates tis three thousand seven hundred eighty Epicurus advice add no more wealth but diminish thy desires and as three thousand seven hundred eighty one Chrysostom well seconds him Si vis ditari contemne divitias that s true plenty not to have but not to want riches non habere sed non indigere vera abundantia tis more glory to contemn than to possess et nihil agere est deorum and to want nothing is

contented then I say repine and mutter no more for thou art not poor indeed but in opinion Yea but this is very good counsel and rightly applied to such as have it and will not use it that have a competency that are able to work and get their living by the sweat of their brows by their trade that have something yet he that hath birds may catch birds but what shall we do that are slaves by nature impotent and unable to help ourselves mere beggars that languish and pine away that have no means at all no hope of means no trust of delivery or of better success as those old Britons complained to their lords and masters the Romans oppressed by the Picts mare ad barbaros barbari ad mare the barbarians drove them to the sea the sea drove them back to the barbarians our present misery compels us to cry out and howl to make our moan to rich men they turn us back with a scornful answer to our misfortune again and will take no pity of us they commonly overlook their poor friends in adversity if they chance to meet them they voluntarily forget and will take no notice of them they will not they cannot help us Instead of comfort they threaten us miscall scoff at us to aggravate our misery give us bad language or if they do give good words what s that to relieve us According to that of Thales Facile est alios monere who cannot give good counsel tis cheap it costs them nothing It is an easy matter when one s belly is full to declaim against fasting Qui satur est pleno laudat jejunia ventre Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass or loweth the ox when he hath fodder Job vi five three thousand seven hundred eighty three Neque enim populo Romano quidquam potest esse laetius no man living so jocund so merry as the people of Rome when they had plenty but when they came to want to be hunger starved neither shame nor laws nor arms nor magistrates could keep them in obedience Seneca pleadeth hard for poverty and so did those lazy philosophers but in the meantime three thousand seven hundred eighty four he was rich they had wherewithal to maintain themselves but doth any poor man extol it There are those saith three thousand seven hundred eighty five Bernard that approve of a mean estate but on that condition they never want themselves and some again are meek so long as they may say or do what they list but if occasion be offered how far are they from all patience I would to God as he said three thousand seven hundred eighty six No man should commend poverty but he that is poor or he that so much admires it would relieve help or ease others three thousand seven hundred eighty seven Nunc si nos audis atque es divinus Apollo Dic mihi qui nummos non habet unde petat Now if thou hear saint us and art a good man Tell him that wants to get means if you can But no man hears us we are most miserably dejected the scum of the world three thousand seven hundred eighty eight Vix habet in nobis jam nova plaga locum We can get no relief no comfort no succour three thousand seven hundred eighty nine Et nihil inveni quod mihi ferret opem We have tried all means yet find no remedy no man living can express the anguish and bitterness of our souls but we that endure it we are distressed forsaken in torture of body and mind in another hell and what shall we do When three thousand seven hundred ninety Crassus the Roman consul warred against the Parthians after an unlucky battle fought he fled away in the night and left four thousand men sore sick and wounded in his tents to the fury of the enemy which when the poor men perceived clamoribus et ululatibus omnia complerunt they made lamentable moan and roared downright as loud as Homer s Mars when he was hurt which the noise of ten thousand men could not drown and all for fear of present death But our estate is far more tragical and miserable much more to be deplored and far greater cause have we to lament the devil and the world persecute us all good fortune hath forsaken us we are left to the rage of beggary cold hunger thirst nastiness sickness irksomeness to continue all torment labour and pain to derision and contempt bitter enemies all and far worse than any death death alone we desire death we seek yet cannot have it and what shall we do Quod male fers assuesce feres bene accustom thyself to it and it will be tolerable at last Yea but I may not I cannot In me consumpsit vires fortuna nocendo I am in the extremity of human adversity and as a shadow leaves the body when the sun is gone I am now left and lost and quite forsaken of the world Qui jacet in terra non habet unde cadat comfort thyself with this yet thou art at the worst and before it be long it will either overcome thee or thou it If it be violent it cannot endure aut solvetur aut solvet let the

with dangers and damages as experience evinceth they will make the rest of thy life relish the better But put case they continue thou art not so poor as thou wast born and as some hold much better to be pitied than envied But be it so thou hast lost all poor thou art dejected in pain of body grief of mind thine enemies insult over thee thou art as bad as Job yet tell me saith Chrysostom was Job or the devil the greater conqueror surely Job the three thousand seven hundred ninety two devil had his goods he sat on the muck hill and kept his good name he lost his children health friends but he kept his innocency he lost his money but he kept his confidence in God which was better than any treasure Do thou then as Job did triumph as Job did three thousand seven hundred ninety three and be not molested as every fool is Sed qua ratione potero How shall this be done Chrysostom answers facile si coelum cogitaveris with great facility if thou shalt but meditate on heaven three thousand

temporalities and momentary pleasures of the world be then pacified And though thou beest now peradventure in extreme want three thousand seven hundred ninety six it may be tis for thy further good to try thy patience as it did Job s and exercise thee in this life trust in God and rely upon him and thou shalt be three thousand seven hundred ninety seven crowned in the end What s this life to eternity The world hath forsaken thee thy friends and fortunes all are gone yet know this that the very hairs of thine head are numbered that God is a spectator of all thy miseries he sees thy wrongs woes and wants three thousand seven hundred ninety eight Tis his goodwill and pleasure it should be so and he knows better what is for thy good than thou thyself His providence is over all at all times he hath set a guard of angels over us and keeps us as the apple of his eye Ps xvii eight Some he doth exalt prefer bless with worldly riches honours offices and preferments as so many glistering stars he makes to shine above the rest some he doth miraculously protect from thieves incursions sword fire and all violent mischances and as the three thousand seven hundred ninety nine poet feigns of that Lycian Pandarus Lycaon s son when he shot at Menelaus the Grecian with a strong arm and deadly arrow Pallas as a good mother keeps flies from her child s face asleep turned by the shaft and made it hit on the buckle of his girdle so some he solicitously defends others he exposeth to danger poverty sickness want misery he chastiseth and corrects as to him seems best in his deep unsearchable and secret judgment and all for our good The tyrant took the city saith three thousand eight hundred Chrysostom God did not hinder it led them away captives so God would have it he bound them God yielded to it flung them into the furnace God permitted it heat the oven hotter it was granted and when the tyrant had done his worst God showed his power and the children s patience he freed

and miserable at first but afterwards most happy and oftentimes it so falls out as three thousand eight hundred sixteen Machiavel relates of Cosmo de Medici that fortunate and renowned citizen of Europe that all his youth was full of perplexity danger and misery till forty years were past and then upon a sudden the sun of his honour broke out as through a cloud Huniades was fetched out of prison and Henry the Third of Portugal out of a poor monastery to be crowned kings Multa cadunt inter calicem supremaque labra Many things happen between the cup and the lip beyond all hope and

scorn of men a burden to the world irksome to thyself and others thou hast lost all Miserum est fuisse felicem and as Boethius calls it Infelicissimum genus infortunii this made Timon half mad with melancholy to think of his former fortunes and present misfortunes this alone makes many miserable wretches discontent I confess it is a great misery to have been happy the quintessence of infelicity to have been honourable and rich but yet easily to be endured three thousand eight hundred seventeen security succeeds and to a judicious man a far better estate The loss of thy goods and money is no loss three thousand eight hundred eighteen thou hast lost them they would otherwise have lost thee If thy money be gone three thousand eight hundred nineteen thou art so much the lighter and as Saint Hierome persuades Rusticus the monk to forsake all and follow Christ Gold and silver are too heavy metals for him to carry that seeks heaven three thousand eight hundred twenty Vel nos in mare proximum Gemmas et lapides aurum et inutile Summi materiam mali Mittamus scelerum si hene poenitet Zeno the philosopher lost all his goods by shipwreck three thousand eight hundred twenty one he might like of it fortune had done him a good turn Opes a me animum auferre non potest she can take away my means but not my mind He set her at defiance ever after for she could not rob him that had nought to lose for he was able to contemn more than they could possess or desire Alexander sent a hundred talents of gold to Phocion of Athens for a present because he heard he was a good man but Phocion returned his talents back again with a permitte me in posterum virum bonum esse to be a good man still let me be as I am Non mi aurum posco nec mi precium three thousand eight hundred twenty two That Theban Crates flung of his own accord his money into the sea abite nummi ego vos mergam ne mergar a vobis I had rather drown you than you should drown me Can stoics and epicures thus contemn wealth and shall not we that are Christians It was mascula vox et praeclara a generous speech of Cotta in three thousand eight hundred twenty three Sallust Many miseries have happened unto me at home and in the wars abroad of which by the help of God some I have endured some I have repelled and by mine own valour overcome courage was never wanting to my designs nor industry to my intents prosperity or adversity could never alter my disposition A wise man s mind as Seneca holds three thousand eight hundred twenty four is like the state of the world above the moon ever serene Come then what can come

quod est maxime opus jactu non cadit Illud quod cecidit forte id arte ut corrigas If thou canst not fling what thou wouldst play thy cast as well as thou canst Everything saith three thousand eight hundred thirty Epictetus hath two handles the one to be held by the other not tis in our choice to take and leave whether we will all which Simplicius s Commentator hath illustrated by many examples and tis in our power as they say to make or mar ourselves Conform thyself then to thy present fortune and cut thy coat according to thy cloth three thousand eight hundred thirty one Ut quimus quod aiunt quando quod volumus non licet Be contented with thy loss state and calling whatsoever it is and rest as well satisfied with thy present condition in this life Este quod es quod sunt alii sine

all gentlemen all Catos or Laelii as Tully telleth us all honourable illustrious and serene all rich but because mortal men want many things three thousand eight hundred thirty three therefore saith Theodoret hath God diversely distributed his gifts wealth to one skill to another that rich men might encourage and set poor men at work poor men might learn several trades to the common good As a piece of arras is composed of several parcels some wrought of silk some of gold silver crewel of diverse colours all to serve for the exornation of the whole music is made of diverse discords and keys a total sum of many small numbers so is a commonwealth of several unequal trades and callings three thousand eight hundred thirty four If all should be Croesi and Darii all idle all in fortunes equal who should till the land As three thousand eight hundred thirty five Menenius Agrippa well satisfied the tumultuous rout of Rome in his elegant apologue of the belly and the rest of the members Who should build houses make our several stuffs for raiments We should all be starved for company as Poverty declared at large in Aristophanes Plutus and sue at last to be as we were at first And therefore God hath appointed this inequality of states orders and degrees a subordination as in all other things The earth yields nourishment to vegetables sensible creatures feed on vegetables both are substitutes to reasonable souls and men are subject amongst themselves and all to higher powers so God would have it All things then being rightly examined and duly considered as they ought there is no such cause of so general discontent tis not in the matter itself but in our mind as we moderate our passions and esteem of things Nihil aliud necessarium ut sis miser saith three thousand eight hundred thirty six Cardan quam ut te miserum credas let thy fortune be what it will tis thy mind alone that makes thee poor or rich miserable or happy Vidi ego saith divine Seneca in villa hilari et amaena maestos et media solitudine occupatos non locus sed animus facit ad tranquillitatem I have seen men miserably dejected in a pleasant village and some again well occupied and at good ease in a solitary desert Tis the mind not the place causeth tranquillity and that gives true content I will yet add a word or two for a corollary Many rich men I dare boldly say it that lie on down beds with delicacies pampered every day in their well furnished houses live at less heart s ease with more anguish more bodily pain and through their intemperance more bitter hours than many a prisoner or galley slave three thousand eight hundred thirty seven Maecenas in pluma aeque vigilat ac Regulus in dolio those poor starved Hollanders whom three thousand eight hundred thirty eight Bartison their captain left in Nova Zembla anno fifteen ninety six or those three thousand eight hundred thirty nine eight miserable Englishmen that were lately left behind to winter in a stove in Greenland in seventy seven deg of lat sixteen thirty so pitifully forsaken and forced to shift for themselves in a vast dark and desert place to strive and struggle with hunger cold desperation and death itself Tis a patient and quiet mind I say it again and again gives true peace and content So for all other things they are as old three thousand eight hundred forty Chremes told us as we use them Parentes patriam amicos genus cognates divitias Haec perinde sunt ac illius animus qui ea possidet Qui uti scit ei bona qui utitur non recte mala Parents friends fortunes country birth alliance c ebb and flow with our conceit please or displease as we accept and construe them or apply them to ourselves Faber quisque fortunae suae and in some sort I may truly say prosperity and adversity are in our own hands Nemo laeditur nisi a seipso and which Seneca confirms out of his judgment and experience three thousand eight hundred forty one Every man s mind is stronger than fortune and leads him to what side he will a cause to himself each one is of his good or bad life But will we or nill we make the worst of it and suppose a man in the greatest extremity tis a fortune which some indefinitely prefer before prosperity of two extremes it is the best Luxuriant animi rebus plerumque secundis men in three thousand eight hundred forty two prosperity forget God and themselves they are besotted with their wealth as birds with henbane three thousand eight hundred forty three miserable if fortune forsake them but more miserable if she tarry and overwhelm them for when they come to be in great place rich they that were most temperate sober and discreet in their private fortunes as Nero Otho Vitellius Heliogabalus optimi imperatores nisi imperassent degenerate on a sudden into brute beasts so prodigious in lust such tyrannical oppressors c they cannot moderate themselves they become monsters odious harpies what not Cum triumphos opes honores adepti sunt ad voluptatem et otium deinceps se convertunt twas three thousand eight hundred forty four Cato s note they cannot contain For that cause belike three thousand eight hundred forty five Eutrapilus cuicunque nocere volebat Vestimenta dabat pretiosa beatus enim jam Cum pulchris tunicis sumet nova consilia et spes Dormiet in lucem scorto postponet honestum Officium Eutrapilus when he would hurt a knave Gave him gay clothes and wealth to make him brave Because now rich he would quite change his mind Keep whores fly out set honesty behind On the other side in adversity many mutter and repine despair c both bad I confess three thousand eight hundred forty six ut calceus olim Si pede major erit subvertet si minor uret As a shoe too big or too little one pincheth the other sets the foot awry sed e malis minimum If adversity hath killed his thousand prosperity hath killed his ten thousand therefore adversity is to be preferred three thousand eight hundred forty seven haec froeno indiget illa solatio illa fallit haec instruit the one deceives the other instructs the one miserably happy the other happily miserable and therefore many philosophers have voluntarily sought adversity and so much commend it in their precepts Demetrius in Seneca esteemed it a great infelicity that in his lifetime he had no misfortune miserum cui nihil unquam accidisset adversi Adversity then is not so heavily to be taken and we ought not in such cases so much to macerate ourselves there is no such odds in poverty and riches To conclude in three thousand eight hundred forty eight Hierom s words I will ask our magnificoes that build with marble and bestow a whole manor on a thread what difference between them and Paul the Eremite that bare old man They drink in jewels he in his hand he is poor and goes to heaven they are rich and go to hell MEMB IV Against Servitude Loss of Liberty Imprisonment Banishment Servitude loss of liberty imprisonment are no such miseries as they are held to be we are slaves and servants the best of us all as we do reverence our masters so do our masters their superiors gentlemen serve nobles and nobles subordinate to kings omne sub regno graviore regnum princes themselves are God s servants reges in ipsos imperium est Jovis They are subject to their own laws and as the kings of China endure more than slavish imprisonment to maintain their state and greatness they never come abroad Alexander was a slave to fear Caesar of pride Vespasian to his money nihil enim refert rerum sis servus an hominum three thousand eight hundred forty nine Heliogabalus to his gut and so of the rest Lovers are slaves to their mistresses rich men to their gold courtiers generally to lust and ambition and all slaves to our affections as Evangelus well discourseth in three thousand eight hundred fifty Macrobius and three thousand eight hundred fifty one Seneca the philosopher assiduam servitutem extremam et ineluctabilem he calls it a continual slavery to be so captivated by vices and who is free Why then dost thou repine Satis est potens Hierom saith qui servire non cogitur Thou carriest no burdens thou art no prisoner no drudge and thousands want that liberty those pleasures which thou hast Thou art not sick and what wouldst thou have But nitimur in vetitum we must all eat of the forbidden fruit Were we enjoined to go to such and such places we would not willingly go but being barred of our liberty this alone torments our wandering soul that we may not go A citizen of ours saith three thousand eight hundred fifty two Cardan was sixty years of age and had never been forth of the walls of the city of Milan the prince hearing of it commanded him not to stir out being now forbidden that which all his life he had neglected he earnestly desired and being denied dolore confectus mortem obiit he died for grief What I have said of servitude I again say of imprisonment we are all prisoners three thousand eight hundred fifty three What is our life but a prison We are all imprisoned in an island The world itself to some men is a prison our narrow seas as so many ditches and when they have compassed the globe of the earth they would fain go see what is done in the moon In three thousand eight hundred fifty four Muscovy and many other northern parts all over Scandia they are imprisoned half the year in stoves they dare not peep out for cold At three thousand eight hundred fifty five Aden in Arabia they are penned in all day long with that other extreme of heat and keep their markets in the night What is a ship but a prison And so many cities are but as so many hives of bees anthills but that which thou abhorrest many seek women keep in all winter and most part of summer to preserve their beauties some for love of study Demosthenes shaved his beard because he would cut off all occasions from going abroad how many monks and friars anchorites abandon the world Monachus in urbe piscis in arido Art in prison Make right use of it and mortify thyself three thousand eight hundred fifty six Where may a man contemplate better than in solitariness or study more than in quietness Many worthy men have been imprisoned all their lives and it hath been occasion of great honour and glory to them much public good by their excellent meditation three thousand eight hundred fifty seven Ptolomeus king of Egypt cum viribus attenuatis infirma valetudine laboraret miro descendi studio affectus c now being taken with a grievous infirmity of body that he could not stir abroad became Strato s scholar fell hard to his book and gave himself wholly to contemplation and upon that occasion as mine author adds pulcherrimum regiae opulentiae monumentum c to his great honour built that renowned library at Alexandria wherein were forty thousand volumes Severinus Boethius never writ so elegantly as in prison Paul so devoutly for most of his epistles were dictated in his bands Joseph saith three thousand eight hundred fifty eight Austin got more credit in prison than when he distributed corn and was lord of Pharaoh s house It brings many a lewd riotous fellow home many wandering rogues it settles that would otherwise have been like raving tigers ruined themselves and others Banishment is no grievance at all Omne solum forti patria c et patria est ubicunque bene est that s a man s country where he is well at ease Many travel for pleasure to that city saith Seneca to which thou art banished and what a part of the citizens are strangers born in other places three thousand eight hundred fifty nine Incolentibus patria tis their country that are born in it and they would think themselves banished to go to the place which thou leavest and from which thou art so loath to depart Tis no disparagement to be a stranger or so irksome to be an exile three thousand eight hundred sixty The rain is a stranger to the earth rivers to the sea Jupiter in Egypt the sun to us all The soul is an alien to the body a nightingale to the air a swallow in a house and Ganymede in heaven an elephant at Rome a Phoenix in India and such things commonly please us best which are most strange and come the farthest off Those old Hebrews esteemed the whole world Gentiles the Greeks held all barbarians but themselves our modern Italians account of us as dull Transalpines by way of reproach they scorn thee and thy country which thou so much admirest Tis a childish humour to hone after home to be discontent at that which others seek to prefer as base islanders and Norwegians do their own ragged island before Italy or Greece the gardens of the world There is a base nation in the north saith three thousand eight hundred sixty one Pliny called Chauci that live amongst rocks and sands by the seaside feed on fish drink water and yet these base people account themselves slaves in respect when they come to Rome Ita est profecto as he concludes multis fortuna parcit in poenam so it is fortune favours some to live at home to their further punishment tis want of judgment All places are distant from heaven alike the sun shines happily as warm in one city as in another and to a wise man there is no difference of climes friends are everywhere to him that behaves himself well and a prophet is not esteemed in his own country Alexander Caesar Trajan Adrian were as so many land leapers now in the east now in the west little at home and Polus Venetus Lod Vertomannus Pinzonus Cadamustus Columbus Americus Vespucius Vascus Gama Drake Candish Oliver Anort Schoutien got all their honour by voluntary expeditions But you say such men s travel is voluntary we are compelled and as malefactors must depart yet know this of three thousand eight hundred sixty two Plato to be true ultori Deo summa cura peregrinus est God hath an especial care of strangers and when he wants friends and allies he shall deserve better and find more favour with God and men Besides the pleasure of peregrination variety of objects will make amends and so many nobles Tully Aristides Themistocles Theseus Codrus c as have been banished will give sufficient credit unto it Read Pet Alcionius his two books of this subject MEMB V Against Sorrow for Death of Friends or otherwise vain Fear c Death and departure of friends are things generally grievous three thousand eight hundred sixty three Omnium quae in humana vita contingunt luctus atque mors sunt acerbissima the most austere and bitter accidents that can happen to a man in this life in aeternum valedicere to part for ever to forsake the world and all our friends tis ultimum terribilium the last and the greatest terror most irksome and troublesome unto us three thousand eight hundred sixty four Homo toties moritur quoties amittit suos And though we hope for a better life eternal happiness after these painful and miserable days yet we cannot compose ourselves willingly to die the remembrance of it is most grievous unto us especially to such who are fortunate and rich they start at the name of death as a horse at a rotten post Say what you can of that other world three thousand eight hundred sixty five Montezuma that Indian prince Bonum est esse hic they had rather be here Nay many generous spirits and grave staid men otherwise are so tender in this that at the loss of a dear friend they will cry out roar and tear their hair lamenting some months after howling O Hone as those Irish women and three thousand eight hundred sixty six Greeks at their graves commit many indecent actions and almost go beside themselves My dear father my sweet husband mine only brother s dead to whom shall I make my moan O me miserum Quis dabit in lachrymas fontem c What shall I do three thousand eight hundred sixty seven Sed totum hoc studium luctu fraterna mihi mors Abstulit hei misero frater adempte mihi My brother s death my study hath undone Woe s me alas my brother he is gone Mezentius would not live after his son three thousand eight hundred sixty eight Nunc vivo nec adhuc homines lucemque relinquo Sed linquam And Pompey s wife cried out at the news of her husband s death three thousand eight hundred sixty nine Turpe mori post te solo non posse dolore Violenta luctu et nescia tolerandi as three thousand eight hundred seventy Tacitus of Agrippina not able to moderate her passions So when she heard her son was slain she abruptly broke off her work changed countenance and colour tore her hair and fell a roaring downright three thousand eight hundred seventy one subitus miserae color ossa reliquit Excussi manibus radii revolutaque pensa Evolat infelix et foemineo ululatu Scissa comam Another would needs run upon the sword s point after Euryalus departure three thousand eight hundred seventy two Figite me si qua est pietas in me omnia tela Conjicite o Rutili O let me die some good man or other make an end of me How did Achilles take on for Patroclus departure A black cloud of sorrows overshadowed him saith Homer Jacob rent his clothes put sackcloth about his loins sorrowed for his son a long season and could not be comforted but would needs go down into the grave unto his son general xxxvii thirty seven Many years after the remembrance of such friends of such accidents is most grievous unto us to see or hear of it though it concern not ourselves but others Scaliger saith of himself that he never read Socrates death in Plato s Phaedon but he wept three thousand eight hundred seventy three Austin shed tears when he read the destruction of Troy But howsoever this passion of sorrow be violent bitter and seizeth familiarly on wise valiant discreet men yet it may surely be withstood it may be diverted For what is there in this life that it should be so dear unto us or that we should so much deplore the departure of a friend The greatest pleasures are common society to enjoy one another s presence feasting hawking hunting brooks woods hills music dancing c all this is but vanity and loss of time as I have sufficiently declared three thousand eight hundred seventy four dum bibimus dum serta unguenta puellas Poscimus obrepit non intellecta senectus Whilst we drink prank ourselves with wenches dally Old age upon s at unawares doth sally As alchemists spend that small modicum they have to get gold and never find it we lose and neglect eternity for a little momentary pleasure which we cannot enjoy nor shall ever attain to in this life We abhor death pain and grief all yet we will do nothing of that which should vindicate us from but rather voluntarily thrust ourselves upon it three thousand eight hundred seventy five The lascivious prefers his whore before his life or good estate an angry man his revenge a parasite his gut ambitious honours covetous wealth a thief his booty a soldier his spoil we abhor diseases and yet we pull them upon us We are never better or freer from cares than when we sleep and yet which we so much avoid and lament death is but a perpetual sleep and why should it as three thousand eight hundred seventy six Epicurus argues so much affright us When we are death is not but when death is then we are not our life is tedious and troublesome unto him that lives best three thousand eight hundred seventy seven tis a misery to be born a pain to live a trouble to die death makes an end of our miseries and yet we cannot consider of it a little before three thousand eight hundred seventy eight Socrates drank his portion of cicuta he bid the citizens of Athens cheerfully farewell and concluded his speech with this short sentence My time is now come to be gone I to my death you to live on but which of these is best God alone knows For there is no pleasure here but sorrow is annexed to it repentance follows it three thousand eight hundred seventy nine If I feed liberally I am likely sick or surfeit if I live sparingly my hunger and thirst is not allayed I am well neither full nor fasting if I live honest I burn in lust if I take my pleasure I tire and starve myself and do injury to my body and soul three thousand eight hundred eighty Of so small a quantity of mirth how much sorrow after so little pleasure how great misery Tis both ways troublesome to me to rise and go to bed to eat and provide my meat cares and contentions attend me all day long fears and suspicions all my life I am discontented and why should I desire so much to live But a happy death will make an end of all our woes and miseries omnibus una meis certa medela malis why shouldst not thou then say with old Simeon since thou art so well affected Lord now let thy servant depart in peace or with Paul I desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ Beata mors quae ad beatam vitam aditum aperit tis a blessed hour that leads us to a three thousand eight hundred eighty one blessed life and blessed are they that die in the Lord But life is sweet and death is not so terrible in itself as the concomitants of it a loathsome disease pain horror c and many times the manner of it to be hanged to be broken on the wheel to be burned alive three thousand eight hundred eighty two Servetus the heretic that suffered in Geneva when he was brought to the stake and saw the executioner come with fire in his hand homo viso igne tam horrendum exclamavit ut universum populum perterrefecerit roared so loud that he terrified the people An old stoic would have scorned this It troubles some to be unburied or so non te optima mater Condet humi patriove onerabit membra sepulchro Alitibus linguere feris et gurgite mersum Unda feret piscesque impasti vulnera lambent Thy gentle parents shall not bury thee Amongst thine ancestors entomb d to be But feral fowl thy carcass shall devour Or drowned corps hungry fish maws shall scour As Socrates told Crito it concerns me not what is done with me when I am dead Facilis jactura sepulchri I care not so long as I feel it not let them set mine head on the pike of Tenerife and my quarters in the four parts of the world pascam licet in cruce corvos let wolves or bears devour me three thousand eight hundred eighty three Caelo tegitur qui non habet urnam the canopy of heaven covers him that hath no tomb So likewise for our friends why should their departure so much trouble us They are better as we hope and for what then dost thou lament as those do whom Paul taxed in his time one Thes iv thirteen that have no hope Tis fit there should be some solemnity three thousand eight hundred eighty four Sed sepelire decet defunctum pectore forti Constantes unumque diem fletui indulgentes Job s friends said not a word to him the first seven days but let sorrow and discontent take their course themselves sitting sad and silent by him When Jupiter himself wept for Sarpedon what else did the poet insinuate but that some sorrow is good three thousand eight hundred eighty five Quis matrem nisi mentis inops in funere nati Flere vetat who can blame a tender mother if she weep for her children Beside as three thousand eight hundred eighty six Plutarch holds tis not in our power not to lament Indolentia non cuivis contingit it takes away mercy and pity not to be sad tis a natural passion to weep for our friends an irresistible passion to lament and grieve I know not how saith Seneca but sometimes tis good to be miserable in misery and for the most part all grief evacuates itself by tears three thousand eight hundred eighty seven est quaedam flere voluptas Expletur lachrymis egeriturque dolor yet after a day s mourning or two comfort thyself for thy heaviness Eccles xxxviii seventeen three thousand eight hundred eighty eight Non decet defunctum ignavo quaestu prosequi twas Germanicus advice of old that we should not dwell too long upon our passions to be desperately sad immoderate grievers to let them tyrannise there s indolentiae ars a medium to be kept we do not saith three thousand eight hundred eighty nine Austin forbid men to grieve but to grieve overmuch I forbid not a man to be angry but I ask for what cause he is so Not to be sad but why is he sad Not to fear but wherefore is he afraid I require a moderation as well as a just reason three thousand eight hundred ninety The Romans and most civil commonwealths have set a time to such solemnities they must not mourn after a set day or if in a family a child be born a daughter or son married some state or honour be conferred a brother be redeemed from his bands a friend from his enemies or the like they must lament no more And tis fit it should be so to what end is all their funeral pomp complaints and tears When Socrates was dying his friends Apollodorus and Crito with some others were weeping by him which he perceiving asked them what they meant three thousand eight hundred ninety one for that very cause he put all the women out of the room upon which words of his they were abashed and ceased from their tears Lodovicus Cortesius a rich lawyer of Padua as three thousand eight hundred ninety two Bernardinus Scardeonius relates commanded by his last will and a great mulct if otherwise to his heir that no funeral should be kept for him no man should lament but as at a wedding music and minstrels to be provided and instead of black mourners he took order three thousand eight hundred ninety three that twelve virgins clad in green should carry him to the church His will and testament was accordingly performed and he buried in saint Sophia s church three thousand eight hundred ninety four Tully was much grieved for his daughter Tulliola s death at first until such time that he had confirmed his mind with some philosophical precepts three thousand eight hundred ninety five then he began to triumph over fortune and grief and for her reception into heaven to be much more joyed than before he was troubled for her loss If a heathen man could so fortify himself from philosophy what shall a Christian from divinity Why dost thou so macerate thyself Tis an inevitable chance the first statute in Magna Charta an everlasting Act of Parliament all must three thousand eight hundred ninety six die three thousand eight hundred ninety seven Constat aeterna positumque lege est Ut constet genitum nihil It cannot be revoked we are all mortal and these all commanding gods and princes die like men three thousand eight hundred ninety eight involvit humile pariter et celsum caput aquatque summis infima O weak

midst of all his friends amongst so many three thousand nine hundred physicians now ready to be three thousand nine hundred one married in thirty six hours sickened and died We must so be gone sooner or later all and as Calliopeius in the comedy took his leave of his spectators and auditors Vos valete et plaudite Calliopeius recensui must we bid the world farewell Exit Calliopeius and having now played our parts for ever be gone Tombs and monuments have the like fate data sunt ipsis quoque fata sepulchris kingdoms provinces towns and cities have their periods and are consumed In those flourishing times of Troy Mycenae was the fairest city in Greece Graeciae cunctae imperitabat but it alas and that three thousand nine hundred two Assyrian Nineveh are quite overthrown the like fate

part of it Caeterae igitur urbes sunt mortales as Peter three thousand nine hundred six Gillius concludes of Constantinople haec sane quamdiu erunt homines futura mihi videtur immortalis but tis not so nor site nor strength nor sea nor land can vindicate a city but it and all must vanish at last And as to a traveller great mountains seem plains afar off at last are not discerned at all cities men monuments decay nec solidis prodest sua machina terris three thousand nine hundred seven the names are only left those at length forgotten and are involved in perpetual night three thousand nine hundred eight Returning out of Asia when I sailed from Aegina toward Megara I began saith Servius Sulpicius in a consolatory epistle of his to Tully to view the country round about Aegina was behind me Megara before Piraeus on the right hand Corinth on the left what flourishing towns heretofore now prostrate and overwhelmed before mine eyes I began to think with myself alas why are we men so much disquieted with the departure of a friend whose life is much shorter three thousand nine hundred nine When so many goodly cities lie buried before us Remember O Servius thou art a man and with that I was much confirmed and corrected myself Correct then likewise and comfort thyself in this that we must necessarily die and all die that we shall rise again as Tully held Jucundiorque multo congressus noster futurus quam insuavis et acerbus digressus our second meeting shall be much more pleasant than our departure was grievous Aye but he was my most dear and loving friend my sole friend three thousand nine hundred ten Quis deciderio sit pudor aut modus Tam chari capitis And who can blame my woe Thou mayst be ashamed I say with three thousand nine hundred eleven Seneca to confess it in such a three thousand nine hundred twelve tempest as this to have but one anchor go seek another and for his part thou dost him great injury to desire his longer life three thousand nine hundred thirteen Wilt thou have him crazed and sickly still like a tired traveller that comes weary to his inn begin his journey afresh or to be freed from his miseries thou hast more need rejoice that he is gone Another complains of a most sweet wife a young wife Nondum sustulerat flavum Proserpina crinem such a wife as no mortal man ever had so good a wife but she is now dead and gone laethaeoque jacet condita sarcophago I reply to him in Seneca s words if such a woman at least ever was to be had three thousand nine hundred fourteen He did either so find or make her if he found her he may as happily find another if he made her as Critobulus in Xenophon did by his he may as good cheap inform another et bona tam sequitur quam bona prima fuit he need not despair so long as the same master is to be had But was she good Had she been so tired peradventure as that Ephesian widow in Petronius by some swaggering soldier she might not have held out Many a man would have been willingly rid of his before thou wast bound now thou art free three thousand nine hundred fifteen and tis but a folly to love thy fetters though they be of gold Come into a third place you shall have an aged father sighing for a son a pretty child three thousand nine hundred sixteen Impube pectus quale vel impia Molliret Thracum pectora He now lies asleep Would make an impious Thracian weep Or some fine daughter that died young Nondum experta novi gaudia prima tori Or a forlorn son for his deceased father But why Prior exiit prior intravit he came first and he must go first three thousand nine hundred seventeen Tu frustra pius heu c What wouldst thou have the laws of nature altered and him to live always Julius Caesar Augustus Alcibiades Galen Aristotle lost their fathers young And why on the other side shouldst thou so heavily take the death of thy little son three thousand nine hundred eighteen Num quia nec fato merita nec morte peribat Sed miser ante diem he died before his time perhaps not yet come to the solstice of his age yet was he not mortal Hear that divine three thousand nine hundred nineteen Epictetus If thou covet thy wife friends children should live always thou art a fool He was a fine child indeed dignus Apollineis lachrymis a sweet a loving a fair a witty child of great hope another Eteoneus whom Pindarus the poet and Aristides the rhetorician so much lament but who can tell whether he would have been an honest man He might have proved a thief a rogue a spendthrift a disobedient son vexed and galled thee more than all the world beside he might have wrangled with thee and disagreed or with his brothers as Eteocles and Polynices and broke thy heart he is now gone to eternity as another Ganymede in the three thousand nine hundred twenty flower of his youth as if he had risen saith three thousand nine hundred twenty one Plutarch from the midst of a feast before he was drunk the longer he had lived the worse he would have been et quo vita longior Ambrose thinks culpa numerosior more sinful more to answer he would have had If he was naught thou mayst be glad he is gone if good be glad thou hadst such a son Or art thou sure he was good It may be he was an hypocrite as many are and howsoever he spake thee fair peradventure he prayed amongst the rest that Icaro Menippus heard at Jupiter s whispering place in Lucian for his father s death because he now kept him short he was to inherit much goods and many fair manors after his decease Or put case he was very good suppose the best may not thy dead son expostulate with thee as he did in the same three thousand nine hundred twenty two Lucian why dost thou lament my death or call me miserable that am much more happy than thyself what misfortune is befallen me Is it because I am not so bald crooked old rotten as thou art What have I lost some of your good cheer gay clothes music singing dancing kissing merry meetings thalami lubentias c is that it Is it not much better not to hunger at all than to eat not to thirst than to drink to satisfy thirst not to be cold than to put on clothes to drive away cold You had more need rejoice that I am freed from diseases agues cares anxieties livor love

aerumnis facilisque lubensque Ne perjora ipsa morte dehinc videam I left this irksome life with all mine heart Lest worse than death should happen to my part three thousand nine hundred twenty five Cardinal Brundusinus caused this epitaph in Rome to be inscribed on his tomb to show his willingness to die and tax those that were so both to depart Weep and howl no more then tis to small purpose and as Tully adviseth us in the like case Non quos amisimus sed quantum lugere par sit cogitemus think what we do not whom we have lost So David did two Sam xxii While the child was yet alive I fasted and wept but being now dead why should I fast Can I bring him again I shall go to him but he cannot return to me He that doth otherwise is an intemperate a weak a silly and indiscreet man Though Aristotle deny any part of intemperance to be conversant about sorrow I am of three thousand nine hundred twenty six Seneca s mind he that is wise is temperate and he that is temperate is constant free from passion and he that is such a one is without sorrow as all wise men should be The three thousand nine hundred twenty seven Thracians wept still when a child was born feasted and made mirth when any man was buried and so should we rather be glad for such as die well that they are so happily freed from the miseries of this life When Eteoneus that noble young Greek was so generally lamented by his friends Pindarus the poet feigns some god saying Silete homines non enim miser est c be quiet good folks this young man is not so miserable as you think he is neither gone to Styx nor Acheron sed gloriosus et senii expers heros he lives for ever in the Elysian fields He now enjoys that happiness which your great kings so earnestly seek and wears that garland for which ye contend If our present weakness is such we cannot moderate our passions in this behalf we must divert them by all means by doing something else thinking of another subject The Italians most part sleep away care and grief if it unseasonably seize upon them Danes Dutchmen Polanders and Bohemians drink it down our countrymen go to plays do something or other let it not transpose thee or by three thousand nine hundred twenty eight premeditation make such accidents familiar as Ulysses that wept for his dog but not for his wife quod paratus esset animo obfirmato Plut de anim tranq accustom thyself and harden beforehand by seeing other men s calamities and applying them to thy present estate Praevisum est levius quod fuit ante malum I will conclude with three thousand nine hundred twenty nine Epictetus If thou lovest a pot remember tis but a pot thou lovest and thou wilt not be troubled when tis broken if thou lovest a son or wife remember they were mortal and thou wilt not be so impatient And for false fears and all other fortuitous inconveniences mischances calamities to resist and prepare ourselves not to faint is best three thousand nine hundred thirty Stultum est timere quod vitari non potest tis a folly to fear that which cannot be avoided or to be discouraged at all three thousand nine hundred thirty one Nam quisquis trepidus pavet vel optat Abjecit clypeum locoque motus Nectit qua valeat trahi catenam For he that so faints or fears and yields to his passion flings away his own weapons makes a cord to bind himself and pulls a beam upon his own head MEMB VI Against Envy Livor Emulation Hatred Ambition Self love and all other Affections Against those other three thousand nine hundred thirty two passions and affections there is no better remedy than as mariners when they go to sea provide all things necessary to resist a tempest to furnish ourselves with philosophical and Divine precepts other men s examples three thousand nine hundred thirty three Periculum ex aliis facere sibi quod ex usu siet To balance our hearts with love charity meekness patience and counterpoise those irregular motions of envy livor spleen hatred with their opposite virtues as we bend a crooked staff another way to oppose three thousand nine hundred thirty four sufferance to labour patience to reproach bounty to covetousness fortitude to pusillanimity meekness to anger humility to pride to examine ourselves for what cause we are so much disquieted on what ground what occasion is it just or feigned And then either to pacify ourselves by reason to divert by some other object contrary passion or premeditation three thousand nine hundred thirty five Meditari secum oportet quo pacto adversam aerumnam ferat Paricla damna exilia peregre rediens semper cogitet aut filii peccatum aut uxoris mortem aut morbum filiae communia esse haec fieri posse ut ne quid animo sit novum To make them familiar even all kind of calamities that when they happen they may be less troublesome unto us In secundis meditare quo pacto feras adversa or out of mature judgment to avoid the effect or disannul the cause as they do that are troubled with toothache pull them quite out three thousand nine hundred thirty six Ut vivat castor sibi testes amputat ipse Tu quoque siqua nocent abjice tutus eris The beaver bites off s stones to save the rest Do thou the like with that thou art opprest Or as they that play at wasters exercise themselves by a few cudgels how to avoid an enemy s blows let us arm ourselves against all such violent incursions which may invade our minds A little experience and practice will inure us to it vetula vulpes as the proverb saith laqueo haud capitur an old fox is not so easily taken in a snare an old soldier in the world methinks should not be disquieted but ready to receive all fortunes encounters and with that resolute captain come what may come to make answer three thousand nine hundred thirty seven non ulla laborum O virgo nova mi

war a fit motto for every man s private house happy is the man that provides for a future assault But many times we complain repine and mutter without a cause we give way to passions we may resist and will not Socrates was bad by nature envious as he confessed to Zophius the physiognomer accusing him of it froward and lascivious but as he was Socrates he did correct and amend himself Thou art malicious envious covetous impatient no doubt and lascivious yet as thou art a Christian correct and moderate thyself Tis something I confess and able to move any man to see himself contemned obscure neglected disgraced undervalued three thousand nine hundred forty left behind some cannot endure it no not constant Lipsius a man discreet otherwise yet too weak and passionate in this as his words express three thousand nine hundred forty one collegas olim quos ego sine fremitu non intueor nuper terrae filios nunc Maecenates et Agrippas habeo summo jam monte potitos But he was much to blame for it to a wise staid man this is nothing we cannot all be honoured and rich all Caesars if we will be content our present state is good and in some men s opinion to be preferred Let them go on get wealth offices titles honours preferments and what they will themselves by chance fraud imposture simony and indirect means as too many do by bribery flattery and parasitical insinuation by impudence

not serve lies still I have laboured in vain rest satisfied and if I may usurp that of three thousand nine hundred fifty Prudentius Inveni portum spes et fortuna valete Nil mihi vobiscum ludite nunc

conclude think to appease passions or quiet the mind till such time as I have likewise removed some other of their more eminent and ordinary causes which produce so grievous tortures and discontents to divert all I cannot hope to point alone at some few of the chiefest is that which I aim at Repulse Repulse and disgrace are two main causes of discontent but to an understanding man not so hardly to be taken Caesar himself hath been denied three thousand nine hundred fifty one and when two stand equal in fortune birth and all other qualities alike one of necessity must lose Why shouldst thou take it so grievously It hath a familiar thing for thee thyself to deny others If every man might have what he would we should all be deified emperors kings princes if whatsoever vain hope suggests insatiable appetite affects our preposterous judgment thinks fit were granted we should have another chaos in an instant a mere confusion It is some satisfaction to him that is repelled that dignities honours offices are not always given by desert or worth but for love affinity friendship affection three thousand nine hundred fifty two great men s letters or as commonly they are bought and sold three thousand nine hundred fifty three Honours in court are bestowed not according to men s virtues and good conditions as an old courtier observes but as every man hath means or more potent friends so he is preferred With us in France three thousand nine hundred fifty four for so their own countryman relates most part the matter is carried by favour and grace he that can get a great man to be his mediator runs away with all the preferment Indignissimus plerumque praefertur Vatinius Catoni illaudatus laudatissimo three thousand nine hundred fifty five servi dominantur aselli Ornantur phaleris dephalerantur equi An illiterate fool sits in a man s seat and the common people hold him learned grave and wise One professeth three thousand nine hundred fifty six Cardan well notes for a thousand crowns but he deserves not ten when as he that deserves a thousand cannot get ten Solarium non dat multis salem As good horses draw in carts as coaches And oftentimes which Machiavel seconds three thousand nine hundred fifty seven Principes non sunt qui ob insignem virtutem principatu digni sunt he that is most worthy wants employment he that hath skill to be a pilot wants a ship and he that could govern a commonwealth a world itself a king in conceit wants means to exercise his worth hath not a poor office to manage and yet all this while he is a better man that is fit to reign etsi careat regno though he want a kingdom three thousand nine hundred fifty eight than he that hath one and knows not how to rule it a lion serves not always his keeper but oftentimes the keeper the lion and as three thousand nine hundred fifty nine Polydore Virgil hath it multi reges ut pupilli ob inscitiam non regunt sed reguntur Hieron of Syracuse was a brave king but wanted a kingdom Perseus of Macedon had nothing of a king but the bare name and title for he could not govern it so great places are often ill bestowed worthy persons unrespected Many times too the servants have more means than the masters whom they serve which three thousand nine hundred sixty Epictetus counts an eyesore and inconvenient But who can help it It is an ordinary thing in these days to see a base impudent ass illiterate unworthy insufficient to be preferred before his betters because he can put himself forward because he looks big can bustle in the world hath a fair outside can temporise collogue insinuate or hath good store of friends and money whereas a more discreet modest and better deserving man shall lie hid or have a repulse Twas so of old and ever will be and which Tiresias advised Ulysses in the three thousand nine hundred sixty one poet Accipe qua ratione queas ditescere c is still in use lie flatter and dissemble if not as he concludes Ergo pauper eris then go like a beggar as thou art Erasmus Melancthon Lipsius Budaeus Cardan lived and died poor Gesner was a silly old man baculo innixus amongst all those huffing cardinals swelling bishops that flourished in his time and rode on foot clothes It is not honesty learning worth wisdom that prefers men The race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong but as the wise man said three thousand nine hundred sixty two Chance and sometimes a ridiculous chance three thousand nine hundred sixty three Casus plerumque ridiculus multos elevavit Tis fortune s doings as they say which made Brutus now dying exclaim O misera virtus ergo nihil quam verba eras atqui ego te tanquam rem exercebam sed tu serviebas fortunae three thousand nine hundred sixty four Believe it hereafter O my friends virtue serves fortune Yet be not discouraged O my well deserving spirits with this which I have said it may be otherwise though seldom I confess yet sometimes it is But to your farther content I ll tell you a three thousand nine hundred sixty five tale In Maronia pia or Maronia felix I know not whether nor how long since nor in what cathedral church a fat prebend fell void The carcass scarce cold many suitors were up in an instant The first had rich friends a good purse and he was resolved to outbid any man before he would lose it every man supposed he should carry it The second was my lord Bishop s chaplain in whose gift it was and he thought it his due to have it The third was nobly born and he meant to get it by his great parents patrons and allies The fourth stood upon his worth he had newly found out strange mysteries in chemistry and other rare inventions which he would detect to the public good The fifth was a painful preacher and he was commended by the whole parish where he dwelt he had all their hands to his certificate The sixth was the prebendary s son lately deceased his father died in debt for it as they say left a wife and many poor children The seventh stood upon fair promises which to him and his noble friends had been formerly made for the next place in his lordship s gift The eighth pretended great losses and what he had suffered for the church what pains he had taken at home and abroad and besides he brought noblemen s letters The ninth had married a kinswoman and he sent his wife to sue for him The tenth was a foreign doctor a late convert and wanted means The eleventh would exchange for another he did not like the former s site could not agree with his neighbours and fellows upon any terms he would be gone The twelfth and last was a suitor in conceit a right honest civil sober man an excellent scholar and such a one as lived private in the university but he had neither means nor money to compass it besides he hated all such courses he could not speak for himself neither had he any friends to solicit his cause and therefore made no suit could not expect neither did he hope for or look after it The good bishop amongst a jury of competitors thus perplexed and not yet resolved what to do or on whom to bestow it at the last of his own accord mere motion and bountiful nature gave it freely to the university student altogether unknown to him but by fame and to be brief the academical scholar had the prebend sent him for a present The news was no sooner published abroad but all good students rejoiced and were much cheered up with it though some would not believe it others as men amazed said it was a miracle but one amongst the rest thanked God for it and said Nunc juvat tandem studiosum esse et Deo integro corde servire You have heard my tale but alas it is but a tale a mere fiction twas never so never like to be and so let it rest Well be it so then they have wealth and honour fortune and preferment every man there s no remedy must scramble as he may and shift as he can yet Cardan comforted himself with this three thousand nine hundred sixty six the star Fomahant would make him immortal and that three thousand nine hundred sixty seven after his decease his books should be found in ladies studies three thousand nine hundred sixty eight Dignum laude virum Musa vetat mori But why shouldst thou take thy neglect thy canvas so to heart It may be thou art not fit but a three thousand nine hundred sixty nine child that puts on his father s shoes hat headpiece breastplate breeches or holds his spear but is neither able to wield the one or wear the other so wouldst thou do by such an office place or magistracy thou art unfit And what is dignity to an unworthy man but as three thousand nine hundred seventy Salvianus holds a gold ring in a swine s snout Thou art a brute Like a bad actor so three thousand nine hundred seventy one Plutarch compares such men in a tragedy diadema fert at vox non auditur Thou wouldst play a king s part but actest a clown speakest like an ass three thousand nine hundred seventy two Magna petis Phaeton et quae non viribus istis c as James and John the sons of Zebedee did ask they knew not what nescis temerarie nescis thou dost as another Suffenus overween thyself thou art wise in thine own conceit but in other more mature judgment altogether unfit to manage such a business Or be it thou art more deserving than any of thy rank God in his providence hath reserved thee for some other fortunes sic superis visum Thou art humble as thou art it may be hadst thou been preferred thou wouldst have forgotten God and thyself insulted over others contemned thy friends three thousand nine hundred seventy three been a block a tyrant or a demigod sequiturque superbia formam three thousand nine hundred seventy four Therefore saith Chrysostom good men do not always find grace and favour lest they should be puffed up with turgent titles grow insolent and proud Injuries abuses are very offensive and so much the more in that they think veterem ferendo invitant novam by taking one they provoke another but it is an erroneous opinion for if that were true there would be no end of abusing each other lis litem generat tis much better with patience to bear or quietly to put it up If an ass kick me saith Socrates shall I strike him again And when three thousand nine hundred seventy five his wife Xantippe struck and misused him to some friends that would have had him strike her again he replied that he would not make them sport or that they should stand by and say Eia Socrates eia Xantippe as we do when dogs fight animate them the more by clapping of hands Many men spend themselves their goods friends fortunes upon small quarrels and sometimes at other men s procurements with much vexation of spirit and anguish of mind all which with good advice or mediation of friends might have been happily composed or if patience had taken place Patience in such cases is a most sovereign remedy to put up conceal or dissemble it to three thousand nine hundred seventy six forget and forgive three thousand nine hundred seventy seven not seven but seventy seven times as often as he repents forgive him Luke xvii three as our Saviour enjoins us stricken to turn the other side as our three thousand nine hundred seventy eight Apostle persuades us to recompense no man evil for evil but as much as is possible to have peace with all men not to avenge ourselves and we shall heap burning coals upon our adversary s head For three thousand nine hundred seventy nine if you put up wrong as Chrysostom comments you get the victory he that loseth his money loseth not the conquest in this our philosophy If he contend with thee submit thyself unto him first yield to him Durum et durum non faciunt murum as the diverb is two refractory spirits will never agree the only means to overcome is to relent obsequio vinces Euclid in Plutarch when his brother had angered him swore he would be revenged but he gently replied three thousand nine hundred eighty Let me not live if I do not make thee to love me again upon which meek answer he was pacified three thousand nine hundred eighty one Flectitur obsequio curvatus ab arbore ramus Frangis si vires experire tuas A branch if easily bended yields to thee Pull hard it breaks the difference you see The noble family of the Colonni in Rome when they were expelled the city by that furious Alexander the Sixth gave the bending branch therefore as an impress with this motto Flecti potest frangi non potest to signify that he might break them by force but so never make them stoop for they fled in the midst of their hard usage to the kingdom of Naples and were honourably entertained by Frederick the king according to their callings Gentleness in this case might have done much more and let thine adversary be never so perverse it may be by that means thou mayst win him three thousand nine hundred eighty two favore et benevolentia etiam immanis animus mansuescit soft words pacify wrath and the fiercest spirits are so soonest overcome three thousand nine hundred eighty three a generous lion will not hurt a beast that lies prostrate nor an elephant an innocuous creature but is infestus infestis a terror and scourge alone to such as are stubborn and make resistance It was the symbol of Emanuel Philibert Duke of Savoy and he was not mistaken in it for three thousand nine hundred eighty four Quo quisque est major magis est placabilis irae Et faciles motus mens generosa capit A greater man is soonest pacified A noble spirit quickly satisfied It is reported by three thousand nine hundred eighty five Gualter Mapes an old historiographer of ours who lived four hundred years since that King Edward senior and Llewellyn prince of Wales being at an interview near Aust upon Severn in Gloucestershire and the prince sent for refused to come to the king he would needs go over to him which Llewellyn perceiving three thousand nine hundred eighty six went up to the arms in water and embracing his boat would have carried him out upon his shoulders adding that his humility and wisdom had triumphed over his pride and folly and thereupon he was reconciled unto him and did his homage If thou canst not so win him put it up if thou beest a true Christian a good divine an imitator of Christ three thousand nine hundred eighty seven for he was reviled and put it up whipped and sought no revenge thou wilt pray for thine enemies three thousand nine hundred eighty eight and bless them that persecute thee be patient meek humble c An honest man will not offer thee injury probus non vult if he were a brangling knave tis his fashion so to do where is least heart is most tongue quo quisque stultior eo magis insolescit the more sottish he is still the more insolent three thousand nine hundred eighty nine Do not answer a fool according to his folly If he be thy superior three thousand nine hundred ninety bear it by all means grieve not at it let him take his course Anitus and Melitus three thousand nine hundred ninety one may kill me they cannot hurt me as that generous Socrates made answer in like case Mens immota manet though the body be torn in pieces with wild horses broken on the wheel pinched with fiery tongs the soul cannot be distracted Tis an ordinary thing for great men to vilify and insult oppress injure tyrannise to take what liberty they list and who dare speak against Miserum est ab eo laedi a quo non possis queri a miserable thing tis to be injured of him from whom is no appeal three thousand nine hundred ninety two and not safe to write against him that can proscribe and punish a man at his pleasure which Asinius Pollio was aware of when Octavianus provoked him Tis hard I confess to be so injured one of Chilo s three difficult things three thousand nine hundred ninety three To keep counsel spend his time well put up injuries but be thou patient and three thousand nine hundred ninety four leave revenge unto the Lord three thousand nine hundred ninety five Vengeance is mine and I will repay saith the Lord I know the Lord saith three thousand nine hundred ninety six David will avenge the afflicted and judge the poor No man as three thousand nine hundred ninety seven Plato farther adds can so severely punish his adversary as God will such as oppress miserable men three thousand nine hundred ninety eight Iterum ille rem judicatam judicat Majoreque mulcta mulctat If there be any religion any God and that God be just it shall be so if thou

how shall it be done Easily as he follows it if thou shalt look to heaven behold the beauty of it and what God hath promised to such as put up injuries But if thou resist and go about vim vi repellere as the custom of the world is to right thyself or hast given just cause of offence tis no injury then but a condign punishment thou hast deserved as much A te principium in te recredit crimen quod a

galled back in revenge and the humble bee in the fable flung down the eagle s eggs out of Jupiter s lap Bracides in Plutarch put his hand into a mouse s nest and hurt her young ones she bit him by the

endure grief and suffer wrong undeserved for what praise is it if when ye be buffeted for you faults ye take it patiently But if when you do well ye suffer wrong and take it patiently there is thanks with God for hereunto verily we are called Qui mala non fert ipse sibi testis est per impatientiam quod bonus non est he that cannot bear injuries witnesseth against himself that he is no good man as Gregory holds four thousand ten Tis the nature of wicked men to do injuries as it is the property of all honest men patiently to bear them Improbitas nullo flectitur obsequio The wolf in the four thousand eleven emblem sucked the goat so the shepherd would have it but he kept nevertheless a wolf s nature four thousand twelve a knave will be a knave Injury is on the other side a good man s

four thousand fourteen fifty times indicted and accused by his fellow citizens and as four thousand fifteen Ammianus well hath it Quis erit innocens si clam vel palam accusasse sufficiat if it be sufficient to accuse a man openly or in private who shall be free If there were no other respect than that of Christianity religion and the like to induce men to be long suffering and patient yet methinks the nature of injury itself is sufficient to keep them quiet the tumults uproars miseries discontents anguish loss dangers that attend upon it might restrain the calamities of contention for as it is with ordinary gamesters the gains go to the box so falls it out to such as contend the lawyers get all and therefore if they would consider of it aliena pericula cantos other men s misfortunes in this kind and common experience might detain them four thousand sixteen The more they contend the more they are involved in a labyrinth of woes and the catastrophe is to consume one

killed him with the fall so both were ruined Tis a hydra s head contention the more they strive the more they may and as Praxiteles did by his glass when he saw a scurvy face in it brake it in pieces

amongst us but being most part so irreconcilable as we are perverse proud insolent factious and malicious prone to contention anger and revenge of such fiery spirits so captious impious irreligious so opposite to virtue void of grace how should it otherwise be Many men are very testy by nature apt to mistake apt to quarrel apt to provoke and misinterpret to the worst everything that is said or done and thereupon heap unto themselves a great deal of trouble and disquietness to others smatterers in other men s matters tale bearers whisperers liars they cannot speak in season or hold their tongues

evil to their own souls qui contendit sibi convicium facit their life is a perpetual brawl they snarl like so many dogs with their wives children servants neighbours and all the rest of their friends they can agree with nobody But to such as are judicious meek submissive and quiet these matters are easily remedied they will forbear upon all such occasions neglect contemn or take no notice of them dissemble or wisely turn it off If it be a natural impediment as a red nose squint eyes crooked legs or any such imperfection infirmity disgrace reproach the best way is to speak of it first thyself four thousand thirty four and so thou shalt surely take away all occasions from others to jest at or contemn that they may perceive thee to be careless of it Vatinius was wont to scoff at his own deformed feet to prevent his enemies obloquies and sarcasms in that kind or else by prevention as Cotys king of Thrace that brake a company of fine glasses presented to him with his own hands lest he should be overmuch moved when they were broken by chance And sometimes again so that it be discreetly and moderately done it shall not be amiss to make resistance to take down such a saucy companion no better means to vindicate himself to purchase final peace for he that suffers himself to be ridden or through pusillanimity or sottishness will let every man baffle him shall be a common laughing stock to flout at As a cur that goes through a village if he clap his tail between his legs and run away every cur will insult over him but if he bristle up himself and stand to it give but a counter snarl there s not a dog dares meddle with him much is in a man s courage and discreet carriage of himself Many other grievances there are which happen to mortals in this life from friends wives children servants masters companions neighbours our own defaults ignorance errors intemperance indiscretion infirmities c and many good remedies to mitigate and oppose them many divine precepts to counterpoise our hearts special antidotes both in Scriptures and human authors which whoso will observe shall purchase much ease and quietness unto himself I will point out a few Those prophetical apostolical admonitions are well known to all what Solomon Siracides our Saviour Christ himself hath said tending to this purpose as fear God obey the prince be sober and watch pray continually be angry but sin not remember thy last fashion not yourselves to this world c apply yourselves to the times strive not with a mighty man recompense good for evil let nothing be done through contention or vainglory but with meekness of mind every man esteeming of others better than himself love one another or that epitome of the law and the prophets which our Saviour inculcates love God above all thy neighbour as thyself and whatsoever you would that men should do unto you so do unto them which Alexander Severus writ in letters of gold and used as a motto four thousand thirty five Hierom commends to Celantia as an excellent way amongst so many enticements and worldly provocations to rectify her life Out of human authors take these few cautions four thousand thirty six know thyself four

trenchers and painted cloths MEMB VIII Against Melancholy itself Every man saith four thousand seventy Seneca thinks his own burthen the heaviest and a melancholy man above all others complains most weariness of life abhorring all company and light fear sorrow suspicion anguish of mind bashfulness and those other dread symptoms of body and mind must needs aggravate this misery yet compared to other maladies they are not so heinous as they be taken For first this disease is either in habit or disposition curable or incurable If new and in disposition tis commonly pleasant and it may be helped If inveterate or a habit yet they have lucida intervalla sometimes well and sometimes ill or if more continuate as the four thousand seventy one Vejentes were to the Romans tis hostis magis assiduus quam gravis a more durable enemy than dangerous and amongst many inconveniences some comforts are annexed to it First it is not catching and as Erasmus comforted himself when he was grievously sick of the stone though it was most troublesome and an intolerable pain to him yet it was no whit offensive to others not loathsome to the spectators ghastly fulsome terrible as plagues apoplexies leprosies wounds sores tetters pox pestilent agues are which either admit of no company terrify or offend those that are present In this malady that which is is wholly to themselves and those symptoms not so dreadful if they be compared to the opposite extremes They are most part bashful suspicious solitary c therefore no such ambitious impudent intruders as some are no sharkers no cony catchers no prowlers no smell feasts praters panders parasites bawds drunkards whoremasters necessity and defect compel them to be honest as Mitio told Demea in the four thousand seventy two comedy Haec si neque ego neque tu fecimus Non sinit egestas facere nos If we be honest twas poverty made us so if we melancholy men be not as bad as he that is worst tis our dame melancholy kept us so Non deerat voluntas sed facultas four thousand seventy three Besides they are freed in this from many other infirmities solitariness makes them more apt to contemplate suspicion wary which is a necessary humour in these times four thousand seventy four Nam pol que maxime cavet is saepe cautor captus est he that takes most heed is often circumvented and overtaken Fear and sorrow keep them temperate and sober and free them from any dissolute acts which jollity and boldness thrust men upon they are therefore no sicarii roaring boys thieves or assassins As they are soon dejected so they are as soon by soft words and good persuasions reared Wearisomeness of life makes them they are not so besotted on the transitory vain pleasures of the world If they dote in one thing they are wise and well understanding in most other If it be inveterate they are insensati most part doting or quite mad insensible of any wrongs ridiculous to others but most happy and secure to themselves Dotage is a state which many much magnify and commend so is simplicity and folly as he said four thousand seventy five sic hic furor o superi sit mihi perpetuus Some think fools and dizzards live the merriest lives as Ajax in Sophocles Nihil scire vita jucundissima tis the pleasantest life to know nothing iners malorum remedium ignorantia ignorance is a downright remedy of evils These curious arts and laborious sciences Galen s Tully s Aristotle s Justinian s do but trouble the world some think we might live better with that illiterate Virginian simplicity and gross ignorance entire idiots do best they are not macerated with cares tormented with fears and anxiety as other wise men are for as four thousand seventy six he said if folly were a pain you should hear them howl roar and cry out in every house as you go by in the street but they are most free jocund and merry and in some four thousand seventy seven countries as amongst the Turks honoured for saints and abundantly maintained out of the common stock four thousand seventy eight They are no dissemblers liars hypocrites for fools and madmen tell commonly truth In a word as they are distressed so are they pitied which some hold better than to be envied better to be sad than merry better to be foolish and quiet quam sapere et ringi to be wise and still vexed better to be miserable than happy of two extremes it is the best SECT IV MEMB I SUBSECT I Of Physic which cureth with Medicines After a long and tedious discourse of these six non natural things and their several rectifications all which are comprehended in diet I am come now at last to Pharmaceutice or that kind of physic which cureth by medicines which apothecaries most part make mingle or sell in their shops Many cavil at this kind of physic and hold it unnecessary unprofitable to this or any other disease because those countries which use it least live longest and are best in health as four thousand seventy nine Hector Boethius relates of the isles of Orcades the people are still sound of body and mind without any use of physic they live commonly one hundred twenty years and Ortelius in his itinerary of the inhabitants of the Forest of Arden four thousand eighty they are very painful long lived sound c four thousand eighty one Martianus Capella speaking of the Indians of his time saith they were much like our western Indians now bigger than ordinary men bred coarsely very long lived insomuch that he that died at a hundred years of age went before his time c Damianus A Goes Saxo Grammaticus Aubanus Bohemus say the like of them that live in Norway Lapland Finmark Biarmia Corelia all over Scandia and those northern countries they are most healthful and very long lived in which places there is no use at all of physic the name of it is not once heard Dithmarus Bleskenius in his accurate description of Iceland sixteen oh seven makes mention amongst other matters of the inhabitants and their manner of living four thousand eighty two which is dried fish instead of bread butter cheese and salt meats most part they drink water and whey and yet without physic or physician they live many of them two hundred fifty years I find the same relation by Lerius and some other writers of Indians in America Paulus Jovius in his description of Britain and Levinus Lemnius observe as much of this our island that there was of old no use of four thousand eighty three physic amongst us and but little at this day except it be for a few nice idle citizens surfeiting courtiers and stall fed gentlemen lubbers The country people use kitchen physic and common experience tells vis that they live freest from all manner of infirmities that make least use of apothecaries physic Many are overthrown by preposterous use of it and thereby get their bane that might otherwise have escaped four thousand eighty four some think physicians kill as many as they save and who can tell four thousand eighty five Quot Themison aegros autumno occiderit uno How many murders they make in a year quibus impune licet hominem occidere that may freely kill folks and have a reward for it and according to the Dutch proverb a new physician must have a new churchyard and who daily observes it not Many that did ill under physicians hands have happily escaped when they have been given over by them left to God and nature and themselves twas Pliny s dilemma of old four thousand eighty six every disease is either curable or incurable a man recovers of it or is killed by it both ways physic is to be rejected If it be deadly it cannot be cured if it may be helped it requires no physician nature will expel it of itself Plato made it a great sign of an intemperate and corrupt commonwealth where lawyers and physicians did abound and the Romans distasted them so much that they were often banished out of their city as Pliny and Celsus relate for six hundred years not admitted It is no art at all as some hold no not worthy the name of a liberal science nor law neither as four thousand eighty seven Pet And Canonherius a patrician of Rome and a great doctor himself one of their own tribe proves by sixteen arguments because it is mercenary as now used base and as fiddlers play for a reward Juridicis medicis fisco fas vivere rapto tis a corrupt trade no science art no profession the beginning practice and progress of it all is naught full of imposture uncertainty and doth generally more harm than good The devil himself was the first inventor of it Inventum est medicina meum said Apollo and what was Apollo but the devil The Greeks first made an art of it and they were all deluded by Apollo s sons priests oracles If we may believe Varro Pliny Columella most of their best medicines were derived from his oracles Aesculapius his son had his temples erected to his deity and did many famous cures but as Lactantius holds he was a magician a mere impostor and as his successors Phaon Podalirius Melampius Menecrates another God by charms spells and ministry of bad spirits performed most of their cures The first that ever wrote in physic to any purpose was Hippocrates and his disciple and commentator Galen whom Scaliger calls Fimbriam Hippocratis but as four thousand eighty eight Cardan censures them both immethodical and obscure as all those old ones are their precepts confused their medicines obsolete and now most part rejected Those cures which they did Paracelsus holds were rather done out of their patients confidence four thousand eighty nine and good opinion they had of them than out of any skill of theirs which was very small he saith they themselves idiots and infants as are all their academical followers The Arabians received it from the Greeks and so the Latins adding new precepts and medicines of their own but so imperfect still that through ignorance of professors impostors mountebanks empirics disagreeing of sectaries which are as many almost as there be diseases envy covetousness and the like they do much harm amongst us They are so different in their consultations prescriptions mistaking many times the parties constitution four thousand ninety disease and causes of it they give quite contrary physic four thousand ninety one one saith this another that out of singularity or opposition as he said of Adrian multitudo medicorum principem interfecit a multitude of physicians hath killed the emperor plus a medico quam a morbo periculi more danger there is from the physician than from the disease Besides there is much imposture and malice amongst them All arts saith four thousand ninety two Cardan admit of cozening physic amongst the rest doth appropriate it to herself and tells a story of one Curtius a physician in Venice because he was a stranger and practised amongst them the rest of the physicians did still cross him in all his precepts If he prescribed hot medicines they would prescribe cold miscentes pro calidis frigida pro frigidis humida pro purgantibus astringentia binders for purgatives omnia perturbabant If the party miscarried Curtium damnabant Curtius killed him that disagreed from them if he recovered then four thousand ninety three they cured him themselves Much emulation imposture malice there is amongst them if they be honest and mean well yet a knave apothecary that administers the physic and makes the medicine may do infinite harm by his old obsolete doses adulterine drugs bad mixtures quid pro quo c See Fuchsius lib one sect one cap eight Cordus Dispensatory and Brassivola s Examen simpl c But it is their ignorance that doth more harm than rashness their art is wholly conjectural if it be an art uncertain imperfect and got by killing of men they are a kind of butchers leeches men slayers chirurgeons and apothecaries especially that are indeed the physicians hangman carnifices and common executioners though to say truth physicians themselves come not far behind for according to that facete epigram of Maximilianus Urentius what s the difference four thousand ninety four Chirurgicus medico quo differt scilicet isto Enecat hic succis enecat ille manu Carnifice hoc ambo tantum differre videntur Tardius hi faciunt quod facit ille cito But I return to their skill many diseases they cannot cure at all as apoplexy epilepsy stone strangury gout Tollere nodosam nescit medicina Podagram four thousand ninety five quartan agues a common ague sometimes stumbles them all they cannot so much as ease they know not how to judge of it If by pulses that doctrine some hold is wholly superstitious and I dare boldly say with four thousand ninety six Andrew Dudeth that variety of pulses described by Galen is neither observed nor understood of any And for urine that is meretrix medicorum the most deceitful thing of all as Forestus and some other physicians have proved at large I say nothing of critic days errors in indications c The most rational of them and skilful are so often deceived that as four thousand ninety seven Tholosanus infers I had rather believe and commit myself to a mere empiric than to a mere doctor and I cannot sufficiently commend that custom of the Babylonians that have no professed physicians but bring all their patients to the market to be cured which Herodotus relates of the Egyptians Strabo Sardus and Aubanus Bohemus of many other nations And those that prescribed physic amongst them did not so arrogantly take upon them to cure all diseases as our professors do but some one some another as their skill and experience did serve four thousand ninety eight One cured the eyes a second the teeth a third the head another the lower parts c not for gain but in charity to do good they made neither art profession nor trade of it which in other places was accustomed and therefore Cambyses in four thousand ninety nine Xenophon told Cyrus that to his thinking physicians were like tailors and cobblers the one mended our sick bodies as the other did our clothes But I will urge these cavilling and contumelious arguments no farther lest some physician should mistake me and deny me physic when I am sick for my part I am well persuaded of physic I can distinguish the abuse from the use in this and many other arts and sciences four thousand one hundred Alliud vinum aliud ebrietas wine and drunkenness are two distinct things I acknowledge it a most noble and divine science in so much that Apollo Aesculapius and the first founders of it merito pro diis habiti were worthily counted gods by succeeding ages for the excellency of their invention And whereas Apollo at Delos Venus at Cyprus Diana at Ephesus and those other gods were confined and adored alone in some peculiar places Aesculapius and his temple and altars everywhere in Corinth Lacedaemon Athens Thebes Epidaurus c Pausanius records for the latitude of his art deity worth and necessity With all virtuous and wise men therefore I honour the name and calling as I am enjoined to honour the physician for necessity s sake The knowledge of the physician lifteth up his head and in the sight of great men he shall be admired The Lord hath created medicines of the earth and he that is wise will not abhor them Eccles lviii one But of this noble subject how many panegyrics are worthily written For my part as Sallust said of Carthage praestat silere quam pauca dicere I have said yet one thing I will add that this kind of physic is very moderately and advisedly to be used upon good occasion when the former of diet will not take place And tis no other which I say than that which Arnoldus prescribes in his eight Aphoris four thousand one hundred one A discreet and goodly physician doth first endeavour to expel a disease by medicinal diet than by pure medicine and in his ninth four thousand one hundred two he that may be cured by diet must not meddle with physic So in eleven Aphoris four thousand one hundred three A modest and wise physician will never hasten to use medicines but upon urgent necessity and that sparingly too because as he adds in his thirteen Aphoris four thousand one hundred four Whosoever takes much physic in his youth shall soon bewail it in his old age purgative physic especially which doth much debilitate nature For which causes some physicians refrain from the use of purgatives or else sparingly use them four thousand one hundred five Henricus Ayrerus in a consultation for a melancholy person would have him take as few purges as he could because there be no such medicines which do not steal away some of our strength and rob the parts of our body weaken nature and cause that cacochymia which four thousand one hundred six Celsus and others observe or ill digestion and bad juice through all the parts of it Galen himself confesseth four thousand one hundred seven that purgative physic is contrary to nature takes away some of our best spirits and consumes the very substance of our bodies But this without question is to be understood of such purges as are unseasonably or immoderately taken they have their excellent use in this as well as most other infirmities

anthropoisi eph aemerae aed epi nukti automatoi phoitosi kaka thnaetoisi pherousai sigae epei phonaen aexeileto maetieta zeus Diseases steal both day and night on men For Jupiter hath taken voice from them So there be several remedies as four thousand one hundred nine he saith each disease a medicine for every humour and as some hold every clime every country and more than that every private place hath his proper remedies growing in it peculiar almost to the domineering and most frequent maladies of it As four thousand one hundred ten one discourseth wormwood grows sparingly in Italy because most part there they be misaffected with hot diseases but henbane poppy and such cold herbs with us in Germany and Poland great store of it in every waste Baracellus Horto geniali and Baptista Porta Physiognomicae lib six cap twenty three give many instances and examples of it and bring many other proofs For that cause belike that learned Fuchsius of Nuremberg four thousand one hundred eleven when he came into a village considered always what herbs did grow most frequently about it and those he distilled in a silver alembic making use of others amongst them as occasion served I know that many are of opinion our northern simples are weak imperfect not so well concocted of such force as those in the southern parts not so fit to be used in physic and will therefore fetch their drugs afar off senna cassia out of Egypt rhubarb from Barbary aloes from Socotra turbith agaric mirabolanes hermodactils from the East Indies tobacco from the west and some as far as China hellebore from the Anticyrae or that of Austria which bears the purple flower which Mathiolus so much approves and so of the rest In the kingdom of Valencia in Spain four thousand one hundred twelve Maginus commends two mountains Mariola and Renagolosa famous for simples four thousand one hundred thirteen Leander Albertus four thousand one hundred fourteen Baldus a mountain near the Lake Benacus in the territory of Verona to which all the herbalists in the country continually flock Ortelius one in Apulia Munster Mons major in Istria others Montpelier in France Prosper Altinus prefers Egyptian simples Garcias ab

they do nothing except they rake all over India Arabia Ethiopia for remedies and fetch their physic from the three quarters of the world and from beyond the Garamantes Many an old wife or country woman doth often more good with a few known and common garden herbs than our bombast physicians with all their prodigious sumptuous far fetched rare conjectural medicines without all question if we have not these rare exotic simples we hold that at home which is in virtue equivalent unto them ours will serve as well as theirs if they be taken in proportionable quantity fitted and qualified aright if not much better and more proper to our constitutions But so tis for the most part as Pliny writes to Gallus four thousand one hundred sixteen We are careless of that which is near us and follow that which is afar off to know which we will travel and sail beyond the seas wholly neglecting that which is under our eyes Opium in Turkey doth scarce offend with us in a small quantity it stupefies cicuta or hemlock is a strong poison in Greece but with us it hath no such violent effects I conclude with I Voschius who as he much inveighs against those exotic medicines so he promiseth by our European a full cure and absolute of all diseases a capite ad calcem nostrae regionis herbae nostris corporibus magis conducunt our own simples agree best with us It was a thing that Fernelius much laboured in his French practice to reduce all his cure to our proper and domestic physic so did four thousand one hundred seventeen Janus Cornarius and Martin Rulandus in Germany T B with us as appeareth by a treatise of his divulged in our tongue sixteen fifteen to prove the sufficiency of English medicines to the cure of all manner of diseases If our simples be not altogether of such force or so apposite it may be if like industry were used those far fetched drugs would prosper as well with us as in those countries whence now we have them as well as cherries artichokes tobacco and many such There have been diverse worthy physicians which have tried excellent conclusions in this kind and many diligent painful apothecaries as Gesner Besler Gerard c but amongst the rest those famous

Danby are much to be commended wherein all exotic plants almost are to be seen and liberal allowance yearly made for their better maintenance that young students may be the sooner informed in the knowledge of them which as four thousand one hundred eighteen Fuchsius holds is most necessary for that exquisite manner of curing and as great a shame for a physician not to observe them as for a workman not to know his axe saw square or any other tool which he must of necessity use SUBSECT III Alteratives Herbs other Vegetables c Amongst these eight hundred simples which Galeottus reckons up lib three de promise doctor cap three and many exquisite herbalists have written of these few following alone I find appropriated to this humour of which some be alteratives four thousand one hundred nineteen which by a secret force saith Renodeus and special quality expel future diseases perfectly cure those which are and many such incurable effects This is as well observed in other plants stones minerals and creatures as in herbs in other maladies as in this How many things are related of a man s skull What several virtues of corns in a horse leg four thousand one hundred twenty of a wolf s

proper and that in every part See more in Wecker Renodeus Heurnius lib two cap nineteen c I will briefly speak of them as first of alteratives which Galen in his third book of diseased parts prefers before diminutives and Trallianus brags that he hath done more cures on melancholy men four thousand one hundred twenty five by moistening than by purging of them Borage In this catalogue borage and bugloss may challenge the chiefest place whether in substance juice roots seeds flowers leaves decoctions distilled waters extracts oils c for such kind of herbs be diversely varied Bugloss is hot and moist and therefore worthily reckoned up amongst those herbs which expel melancholy and four thousand one hundred twenty six exhilarate the heart Galen lib six cap eighty de simpl med Dioscorides lib four cap one hundred twenty three Pliny much magnifies this plant It may be diversely used as in broth in four thousand one hundred twenty seven wine in conserves syrups c It is an excellent cordial and against this malady most frequently prescribed a herb indeed of such sovereignty that as Diodorus lib seven bibl Plinius lib twenty five cap two et lib twenty one cap twenty two Plutarch sympos lib one cap one Dioscorides lib five cap forty Caelius lib nineteen c three suppose it was that famous Nepenthes of four thousand one hundred twenty eight Homer which Polydaenna Thonis s wife then king of Thebes in Egypt sent Helena for a token of such rare virtue that if taken steeped in wine if wife and children father and mother brother and sister and all thy dearest friends should die before thy face thou couldst not grieve or shed a tear for them Qui semel id patera mistum Nepenthes Iaccho Hauserit hic lachrymam non si suavissima proles Si germanus ei charus materque paterque Oppetat ante oculos ferro confossus atroci Helena s commended bowl to exhilarate the heart had no other ingredient as most of our critics conjecture than this of borage Balm Melissa balm hath an admirable virtue to alter melancholy be it steeped in our ordinary drink extracted or otherwise taken Cardan lib eight much admires this herb It heats and dries saith four thousand one hundred twenty nine Heurnius in the second degree with a wonderful virtue comforts the heart and purgeth all melancholy vapours from the spirits Matthiol in lib three cap ten in Dioscoridem Besides they ascribe other virtues to it four thousand one hundred thirty as to help concoction to cleanse the brain expel all careful thoughts and anxious imaginations the same words in effect are in Avicenna Pliny Simon Sethi Fuchsius Leobel Delacampius and every herbalist Nothing better for him that is melancholy than to steep this and borage in his ordinary drink Mathiolus in his fifth book of Medicinal Epistles reckons up scorzonera four thousand one hundred thirty one not against poison only falling sickness and such as are vertiginous but to this malady the root of it taken by itself expels sorrow causeth mirth and lightness of heart Antonius Musa that renowned physician to Caesar Augustus in his book which he writ of the virtues of betony cap six wonderfully commends that herb animas hominum et corpora custodit securas de metu reddit it preserves both body and mind from fears cares griefs cures falling sickness this and many other diseases to whom Galen subscribes lib seven simp med Dioscorides lib four cap one c Marigold is much approved against melancholy and often used therefore in our ordinary broth as good against this and many other diseases Hop Lupulus hop is a sovereign remedy Fuchsius cap fifty eight Plant hist much extols it four thousand one hundred thirty two it purgeth all choler and purifies the blood Matthiol cap one hundred forty in four Dioscor wonders the physicians of his time made no more use of it because it rarefies and cleanseth we use it to this purpose in our ordinary beer which before was thick and fulsome Wormwood centaury pennyroyal are likewise magnified and much prescribed as I shall after show especially in hypochondriac melancholy daily to be used sod in whey and as Ruffus Ephesias four thousand one hundred thirty three Areteus relate by breaking wind helping concoction many melancholy men have been cured with the frequent use of them alone And because the spleen and blood are often misaffected in melancholy I may not omit endive succory dandelion fumitory c which cleanse the blood Scolopendria cuscuta ceterache mugwort liverwort ash tamarisk genist maidenhair c which must help and ease the spleen To these I may add roses violets capers featherfew scordium staechas rosemary ros solis saffron ochyme sweet apples wine tobacco sanders c That Peruvian chamico monstrosa facultate c Linshcosteus Datura and to such as are cold the four thousand one hundred thirty four decoction of guiacum China sarsaparilla sassafras the flowers of carduus benedictus which I find much used by Montanus in his Consultations Julius Alexandrinus Lelius Egubinus and others four thousand one hundred thirty five Bernardus Penottus prefers his herba solis or Dutch sindaw before all the rest in this disease and will admit of no herb upon the earth to be comparable to it It excels Homer s moly cures this falling sickness and almost all other infirmities The same Penottus speaks of an excellent balm out of Aponensis which taken to the quantity of three drops in a cup of wine four thousand one hundred thirty six will cause a sudden alteration drive away dumps and cheer up the heart Ant Guianerius in his Antidotary hath many such

Precious Stones Metals Minerals Alteratives Precious stones are diversely censured many explode the use of them or any minerals in physic of whom Thomas Erastus is the chief in his tract against Paracelsus and in an epistle of his to Peter Monavius four thousand one hundred forty That stones can work any wonders let them believe that list no man shall persuade me for my part I have found by experience there is no virtue in them But Matthiolus in his comment upon four thousand one hundred forty one Dioscorides is as profuse on the other side in their commendation so is Cardan Renodeus Alardus Rueus Encelius Marbodeus c four thousand one hundred forty two Matthiolus specifies in coral and Oswaldus Crollius Basil Chym prefers the salt of coral four thousand one hundred forty three

for which cause rich men so much covet to have them four thousand one hundred fifty nine and those smaller unions which are found in shells amongst the Persians and Indians by the consent of all writers are very cordial and most part avail to the exhilaration of the heart Minerals Most men say as much of gold and some other minerals as these have done of precious stones Erastus still maintains the opposite part Disput in Paracelsum cap four fol one hundred ninety six he confesseth of gold four thousand one hundred sixty that it makes the heart merry but in no other sense but as it is in a miser s chest at mihi plaudo simul ac nummos contemplor in arca as he said in the poet it so revives the spirits and is an excellent recipe against melancholy four thousand one hundred sixty

are used in it which argument our doctor Guin urgeth against D Antonius four thousand one hundred sixty three Erastus concludes their philosophical stones and potable gold c to be no better than poison a mere imposture a non ens dug out of that broody hill belike this golden stone is ubi nascetur ridiculus mus Paracelsus and his chemistical followers as so many Promethei will fetch fire from heaven will cure all manner of diseases with minerals accounting them the only physic on the other side four thousand one hundred sixty four Paracelsus calls Galen Hippocrates and all their adherents infants idiots sophisters c Apagesis istos qui Vulcanias istas metamorphoses sugillant inscitiae soboles supinae pertinaciae alumnos c not worthy the name of physicians for want of these remedies and

magnetical cures Lampas vitae et mortis Balneum Dianae Balsamum Electrum Magico physicum Amuleta Martialia c What will not he and his followers effect He brags moreover that he was primus medicorum

fulsome filthy potions heteroclitical pills so he calls them horse medicines ad quoram aspectum Cyclops Polyphemus exhorresceret And though some condemn their skill and magnetical cures as tending to magical superstition witchery charms c yet they admire stiffly vindicate nevertheless and infinitely prefer them But these are both in extremes the middle sort approve of minerals though not in so

Arnoldus and many others four thousand one hundred sixty seven Matthiolus in the same place approves of potable gold mercury with many such chemical confections and goes so far in approbation of them that he holds four thousand one hundred sixty eight no man can be an excellent physician that hath not some skill in chemistical distillations and that chronic diseases can hardly be cured without mineral medicines look for antimony among purgers SUBSECT V Compound Alteratives censure of Compounds and mixed Physic Pliny lib twenty four c one bitterly taxeth all compound medicines four thousand one hundred sixty nine Men s knavery imposture and captious wits have invented those shops in which every man s life is set to sale and by and by came in those compositions and inexplicable mixtures far fetched out of India and Arabia a medicine for a botch must be had as far as the Red Sea And tis not without cause which he saith for out of question they are much to four thousand one hundred seventy blame in their compositions whilst they make infinite variety of mixtures as four thousand one hundred seventy one Fuchsius notes They think they get themselves great credit excel others and to be more learned than the rest because they make many variations but he accounts them fools and whilst they brag of their skill and think to get themselves a name they become ridiculous betray their ignorance and error A few simples well prepared and understood are better than such a heap of nonsense confused compounds which are in apothecaries shops ordinarily sold In which many vain superfluous corrupt exolete things out of date are to be had saith Cornarius a company of barbarous names given to syrups juleps an unnecessary company of mixed medicines rudis indigestaque moles Many times as Agrippa taxeth there is by this means four thousand one hundred seventy two more danger from the medicine than from the disease when they put together they know not what or leave it to an illiterate apothecary to be made they cause death and horror for health Those old physicians had no such mixtures a simple potion of hellebore in Hippocrates time was the ordinary purge and at this day saith four thousand one hundred seventy three Mat Riccius in that flourishing commonwealth of China their physicians give precepts quite opposite to ours not unhappy in their physic they use altogether roots herbs and simples in their medicines and all their physic in a manner is comprehended in a herbal no science no school no art no degree but like a trade every man in private is instructed of his master four thousand one hundred seventy four Cardan cracks that he can cure all diseases with water alone as Hippocrates of old did most infirmities with one medicine Let the best of our rational physicians demonstrate and give a sufficient reason for those intricate mixtures why just so many simples in mithridate or treacle why such and such quantity may they not be reduced to half or a quarter Frustra fit per plura as the saying is quod fieri potest per pauciora three hundred simples in a julep potion or a little pill to what end or purpose I know not what four thousand one hundred seventy five Alkindus Capivaccius Montagna and Simon Eitover the best of them all and most rational have said in this kind but neither he they nor any one of them gives his reader to my judgment that satisfaction which he ought why such so many simples Rog Bacon hath taxed many errors in his tract de graduationibus explained some things but not cleared Mercurialis in his book de composit medicin gives instance in Hamech and Philonium Romanum which Hamech an Arabian and Philonius a Roman long since composed but crasse as the rest If they be so exact as by him it seems they were and those mixtures so perfect why doth Fernelius alter the one and why is the other obsolete four thousand one hundred seventy six Cardan taxeth Galen for presuming out of his ambition to correct Theriachum Andromachi and we as justly may carp at all the rest Galen s medicines are now exploded and rejected what Nicholas Meripsa Mesue Celsus Scribanius Actuarius c writ of old are most part contemned Mellichius Cordus Wecker Quercetan Renodeus the Venetian Florentine states have their several receipts and magistrals they of Nuremberg have theirs and Augustana Pharmacopoeia peculiar medicines to the meridian of the city London hers every city town almost every private man hath his own mixtures compositions receipts magistrals precepts as if he scorned antiquity and all others in respect of himself But each man must correct and alter to show his skill every opinionative fellow must maintain his own paradox be it what it will Delirant reges plectuntur Achivi they dote and in the meantime the poor patients pay for their new experiments the commonalty rue it Thus others object thus I may conceive out of the weakness of my apprehension but to say truth there is no such fault no such ambition no novelty or ostentation as some suppose but as four thousand one hundred seventy seven one answers this of compound medicines is a most noble and profitable invention found out and brought into physic with great judgment wisdom counsel and discretion Mixed diseases must have mixed remedies and such simples are commonly mixed as have reference to the part affected some to qualify the rest to comfort some one part some another Cardan and Brassavola both hold that Nullum simplex medicamentum sine noxa no simple medicine is without hurt or offence and although Hippocrates Erasistratus Diocles of old in the infancy of this art were content with ordinary simples yet now saith four thousand one hundred seventy eight Aetius necessity compelleth to seek for new remedies and to make compounds of simples as well to correct their harms if cold dry hot thick thin insipid noisome to smell to make them savoury to the palate pleasant to taste and take and to preserve them for continuance by admixtion of sugar honey to make them last months and years for several uses In such cases compound medicines may be approved and Arnoldus in his eighteen aphorism doth allow of it four thousand one hundred seventy nine If simples cannot necessity compels us to use compounds so for receipts and magistrals dies diem docet one day teacheth another and they are as so many words or phrases Que nunc sunt in honore vocabula si volet usus ebb and flow with the season and as wits vary so they may be infinitely varied Quisque suum placitum quo capiatur habet Every man as he likes so many men so many minds and yet all tending to good purpose though not the same way As arts and sciences so physic is still perfected amongst the rest Horae musarum nutrices and experience teacheth us every day four thousand one hundred eighty many things which our predecessors knew not of Nature is not effete as he saith or so lavish to bestow all her gifts upon an age but hath reserved some for posterity to show her power that she is still the same and not old or consumed Birds and beasts can cure themselves by nature four thousand one hundred eighty one naturae usu ea plerumque cognoscunt quae homines vix longo labore et doctrina assequuntur but men must use much labour and industry to find it out But I digress Compound medicines are inwardly taken or outwardly applied Inwardly taken be either liquid or solid liquid are fluid or consisting Fluid as wines and syrups The wines ordinarily used to this disease are wormwood wine tamarisk and buglossatum wine made of borage and bugloss the composition of which is specified in Arnoldus Villanovanus lib de vinis of borage balm bugloss cinnamon c and highly commended for its virtues four thousand one hundred eighty two it drives away leprosy scabs clears the blood recreates the spirits exhilarates the mind purgeth the brain of those anxious black melancholy fumes and cleanseth the whole body of that black humour by urine To which I add saith Villanovanus that it will bring madmen and such raging bedlamites as are tied in chains to the use of their reason again My conscience bears me witness that I do not lie I saw a grave matron helped by this means she was so choleric and so furious sometimes that she was almost mad and beside herself she said and did she knew not what scolded beat her maids and was now ready to be bound till she drank of this borage wine and by this excellent remedy was cured which a poor foreigner a silly beggar taught her by chance that came to crave an alms from door to door The juice of borage if it be clarified and drunk in wine will do as much the roots sliced and steeped c saith Ant Mizaldus art med who cities this story verbatim out of Villanovanus and so doth Magninus a physician of Milan in his regimen of health Such another excellent compound water I find in Rubeus de distill sect three which he highly magnifies out of Savanarola four thousand one hundred eighty

downward These following purge upward four thousand one hundred eighty five Asarum or Asrabecca which as Mesue saith is hot in the second degree and dry in the third it is commonly taken in wine whey or as with us the juice of two or three leaves or more sometimes pounded in posset drink qualified with a little liquorice or aniseed to avoid the fulsomeness of the taste or as Diaserum Fernelii Brassivola in Catart reckons it up amongst those simples that only purge melancholy and Ruellius confirms as much out of his experience that it purgeth four thousand one hundred eighty six black choler like hellebore itself Galen lib G simplic and four thousand one hundred eighty seven Matthiolus ascribe other virtues to it and will have it purge other humours as well as this Laurel by Heurnius s method ad prax lib two cap twenty four is put amongst the strong purgers of melancholy it is hot and dry in the fourth degree Dioscorides lib eleven cap one hundred fourteen adds other effects to it four thousand one hundred eighty eight Pliny sets down fifteen berries in drink for a sufficient potion it is commonly corrected with his opposites cold and moist as juice of endive

the third degree Brassivola in Catart out of Mesue others and his own experience will have this simple to purge four thousand one hundred eighty nine melancholy alone It is an ordinary vomit vinum scilliticum mixed with rubel in a little white wine White hellebore which some call sneezing powder a strong purger upward which many reject as being too violent Mesue and Averroes will not admit of it four thousand one hundred ninety by reason of danger of suffocation four thousand one hundred ninety one great pain and trouble it puts the poor patient to saith Dodonaeus Yet Galen lib six simpl med and Dioscorides cap one hundred forty five allow of it It was indeed four thousand one hundred ninety two terrible in former times as Pliny notes but now familiar insomuch that many took it in those days four thousand one hundred ninety three that were students to quicken their wits which Persius Sat one objects to Accius the poet Illas Acci ebria veratro four thousand one hundred ninety

saith Dioscorides four thousand one hundred ninety five Oribasius an old physician hath written very copiously and approves of it in such affections which can otherwise hardly be cured Hernius lib two prax med de vomitoriis will not have it used four thousand one hundred ninety six but with great caution by reason of its strength and then when antimony will do no good which caused Hermophilus to compare it to a stout captain as Codroneus observes cap seven comment de Helleb that will see all his soldiers go before him and come post principia like the bragging soldier last himself four thousand one hundred ninety seven when other helps fail in inveterate melancholy in a desperate case this vomit is to be taken And yet for all this if it be well prepared it may be four thousand one

hath happily used it prepared after his own prescript and with good success Christophorus a Vega lib three c forty one is of the same opinion that it may be lawfully given and our country gentlewomen find it by their common practice that there is no such great danger in it doctor Turner speaking of this plant in his Herbal telleth us that in his time it was an ordinary receipt among good wives to give hellebore in powder to ii d weight and he is not much against it But they do commonly exceed for who so bold as blind Bayard and prescribe it by pennyworths and such irrational ways as I have heard myself market folks ask for it in an apothecary s shop but with what success God knows they smart often for their rash boldness and folly break a vein make their eyes ready to start out of their heads or kill themselves So that the fault is not in the physic but in the rude and indiscreet handling of it He that will know therefore when to use how to prepare it aright and in what dose let him

frequently prescribed in this disease It helps all infirmities saith four thousand two hundred one Matthiolus which proceed from black choler falling sickness and hypochondriacal passions and for farther proof of his assertion he gives several instances of such as have been freed with it four thousand two hundred two one of Andrew Gallus a physician of Trent that after many other essays imputes the recovery of his health next after God to this remedy alone Another of George Handshius that in like sort when other medicines failed four thousand two hundred three was by this restored to his former health and which of his knowledge others have likewise tried and by the help of this admirable medicine been recovered A third of a parish priest at Prague in Bohemia four thousand two hundred four that was so far gone with melancholy that he doted and spake he knew not what but after he had taken twelve grains of stibium as I myself saw and can witness for I was called to see this miraculous accident he was purged of a deal of black choler like little gobbets of flesh and all his excrements were as black blood a medicine fitter for a horse than a man yet it did him so much good that the next day he was perfectly cured This very story of the Bohemian priest Sckenkius relates verbatim Exoter experiment ad var morb cent six observ six with great approbation of it Hercules de Saxonia calls it a profitable medicine if it be taken after meat to six or eight grains of such as are apt to vomit Rodericus a Fonseca the Spaniard and late professor of Padua in Italy extols it to this disease Tom two consul eighty five so doth Lod Mercatus de inter morb cur lib one cap seventeen with many others Jacobus Gervinus a French physician on the other side lib two de venemis confut explodes all this and saith he took three grains only upon Matthiolus and some others commendation but it almost killed him whereupon he concludes four thousand two hundred five antimony is rather poison than a medicine Th Erastus concurs with him in his opinion and so doth Aelian Montaltus cap thirty de melan But what do I talk tis the subject of whole books I might cite a century of authors pro and con I will conclude with four thousand two hundred six Zuinger antimony is like Scanderbeg s sword which is either good or bad strong or weak as the party is that prescribes or useth it a

melancholy it scours the blood lightens the spirits shakes off sorrow a most profitable medicine as four thousand two hundred eleven Dodonaeus terms it invented by the Arabians and not heard of before It is taken diverse ways in powder infusion but most commonly in the infusion with ginger or some cordial flowers added to correct it Actuarius commends it sodden in broth with an old cock or in whey which is the common conveyor of all such things as purge black choler or steeped in wine which Heurnius accounts sufficient without any farther correction Aloes by most is said to purge choler but Aurelianus lib two c six de morb chron Arculanus cap six in nine Rhasis Julius Alexandrinus consil one hundred eighty five Scoltz Crato consil one hundred eighty nine Scoltz prescribe it to this

the water be no more coloured fifty times some say four thousand two hundred fifteen That good Alexander saith Guianerus puts such confidence in this one medicine that he thought all melancholy passions might be cured by it and I for my part have oftentimes happily used it and was never deceived in the operation of it The like may be said of lapis lazuli though it be somewhat weaker than the other Garcias ab Horto hist lib one cap sixty five relates that the four thousand two hundred sixteen physicians of the Moors familiarly prescribe it to all melancholy passions and Matthiolus ep lib three four thousand two hundred seventeen brags of that happy success which he still had in the administration of it Nicholas Meripsa puts it amongst the best remedies sect one cap twelve in Antidotis

is made of it James Damascen two cap twelve Hercules de Saxonia c speaks well of it Crato will not approve this it and both hellebores he saith are no better than poison Victor Trincavelius lib two cap fourteen found it in his experience four thousand two hundred nineteen to be very noisome to trouble the stomach and hurt their bodies that take it overmuch Black hellebore that most renowned plant and famous purger of melancholy which all antiquity so much used and admired was first found out by Melanpodius a shepherd as Pliny records lib twenty five cap five four thousand two hundred twenty who seeing it to purge his goats when they raved practised it upon Elige and Calene King Praetus daughters that ruled in Arcadia near the fountain Clitorius and restored them to their former health In Hippocrates s time it was in only request insomuch that he writ a book of it a fragment of which remains yet Theophrastus four thousand two hundred twenty one Galen Pliny Caelius Aurelianus

of the ancients for this disease amongst the rest that they sent all such as were crazed or that doted to the Anticyrae or to Phocis in Achaia to be purged where this plant was in abundance to be had In Strabo s time it was an ordinary voyage Naviget Anticyras a common proverb among the Greeks and Latins to bid a dizzard or a mad man go take hellebore as in Lucian Menippus to Tantalus Tantale desipis helleboro epoto tibi opus est eoque sane meraco thou art out of thy little wit O Tantalus and must needs drink hellebore and that without mixture Aristophanes in Vespis drink hellebore c and Harpax in the four thousand two hundred twenty two Comoedian told Simo and Ballio two doting fellows that they had need to be purged with this plant When that proud Menacrates Greek o zeus had writ an arrogant letter to Philip of Macedon he sent back no other answer but this Consulo tibi ut ad Anticyram te conferas noting thereby that he was crazed atque ellebore indigere had much need of a good purge Lilius Geraldus saith that Hercules after all his mad pranks upon his wife and children was perfectly cured by a purge of hellebore which an Anticyrian administered unto him They that were sound commonly took it to quicken their wits as Ennis of old four thousand two hundred twenty three Qui non nisi potus ad arma prosiluit dicenda and as our poets drink sack to improve their inventions I find it so registered by Agellius lib seventeen cap fifteen Cameades the academic when he was to write against Zeno the stoic purged himself with hellebore first which four thousand two hundred twenty four Petronius puts upon Chrysippus In such esteem it continued for many ages till at length Mesue and some other Arabians began to reject and reprehend it upon whose authority for many following lustres it was much debased and quite out of request held to be poison and no medicine and is still oppugned to this day by four thousand two hundred twenty five Crato and some junior physicians Their reasons are because Aristotle l one de plant c three said henbane and hellebore were poison and Alexander Aphrodiseus in the preface of his problems gave out that speaking of hellebore four thousand two hundred twenty six Quails fed on that which was poison to men Galen l six Epid com five Text thirty five confirms as much four thousand two hundred twenty seven Constantine the emperor in his Geoponicks attributes no other virtue to it than to kill mice and rats flies and mouldwarps and so Mizaldus Nicander of old Gervinus Sckenkius and some other Neoterics that have written of poisons speak of hellebore in a chief place four thousand two hundred twenty eight Nicholas Leonicus hath a story of Solon that besieging I know not what city steeped hellebore in a spring of water which by pipes was conveyed into the middle of the town and so either poisoned or else made them so feeble and weak by purging that they were not able to bear arms Notwithstanding all these cavils and objections most of our late writers do much approve of it four thousand two hundred twenty nine Gariopontus lib one cap thirteen Codronchus com de helleb Fallopius lib de med purg simpl cap sixty nine

hath many examples how it should be used with diversity of receipts Heurnius lib seven prax med cap fourteen calls it an four thousand two hundred thirty one innocent medicine howsoever if it be well prepared The root of it is only in use which may be kept many years and by some given in substance as by Fallopius and Brassivola amongst the rest who four thousand two hundred thirty two brags that he was the first that restored it again to its use and tells a story how he cured one Melatasta a madman that was thought to be possessed in the Duke of Ferrara s court with one purge of black hellebore in substance the receipt is there to be seen his excrements were like ink four thousand two hundred thirty three he perfectly healed at once Vidus Vidius a Dutch physician will not admit of it in substance to whom most subscribe but as before in the decoction infusion or which is all in all in the extract which he prefers before the rest and calls suave medicamentum a sweet medicine an easy that may be securely given to women children and weaklings Baracellus horto geniali terms it maximae praestantia medicamentum a medicine of great worth and note Quercetan in his Spagir Phar and many others tell wonders of the extract Paracelsus above all the rest is the greatest admirer of this plant and especially the extract he calls it Theriacum terrestre Balsamum another treacle a terrestrial balm instar omnium all in all the four thousand two hundred thirty four sole and last refuge to cure this malady the gout epilepsy leprosy c If this will not help no physic in the world can but mineral it is the upshot of all Matthiolus laughs at those that except against it and though some abhor it out of the authority of Mesue and dare not adventure to prescribe it four thousand two hundred thirty five yet I saith he have happily used it six hundred times without offence and communicated it to divers worthy physicians who have given me great thanks for it Look for receipts dose preparation and other cautions concerning this simple in him Brassivola Baracelsus Codronchus and the rest SUBSECT III Compound Purgers Compound medicines which purge melancholy are either taken in the superior or inferior parts superior at mouth or nostrils At the mouth swallowed or not swallowed If swallowed liquid or solid liquid as compound wine of hellebore scilla or sea onion senna Vinum Scilliticum Helleboratum which four thousand two hundred thirty six Quercetan so much applauds for melancholy and madness either inwardly taken or outwardly applied to the head with little pieces of linen dipped warm in it Oxymel Scilliticum Syrupus Helleboratus major and minor in Quercetan and Syrupus Genistae for hypochondriacal melancholy in the same author compound syrup of succory of fumitory polypody c Heurnius his purging cock broth Some except against these syrups as appears by four thousand two hundred thirty seven Udalrinus Leonoras his epistle to Matthiolus as most pernicious and that out of Hippocrates cocta movere et medicari non cruda no raw things to be used in physic but this in the following epistle is exploded and soundly confuted by Matthiolus many juleps potions receipts are composed of these as you shall find in Hildesheim spicel two Heurnius lib two cap fourteen George Sckenkius Ital med prax c Solid purges are confections electuaries pills by themselves or compound with others as de lapide lazulo armeno pil indae of fumitory c Confection of Hamech which though most approve Solenander sec five consil twenty two bitterly inveighs against

aggregat pills de Epithymo pil Ind Mesue describes in the Florentine Antidotary Pilulae sine quibus esse nolo Pilulae Cochics cum Helleboro Pil Arabicae Faetida de quinque generibus mirabolanorum c More proper to melancholy not excluding in the meantime turbith manna rhubarb agaric elescophe c which are not so proper to this humour For as Montaltus holds cap thirty and Montanus cholera etiam purganda quod atrae sit pabulum choler is to be purged because it feeds the other and some are of an opinion as Erasistratus and Asclepiades maintained of old against whom Galen disputes four thousand two hundred thirty eight that no physic doth purge one humour alone but all alike or what is next Most therefore in their receipts and magistrals which are coined here make a mixture of several simples and compounds to purge all humours in general as well as this Some rather use potions than pills to purge this humour because that as Heurnius and Crato observe hic succus a sicco remedio agre trahitur this juice is not so easily drawn by dry remedies and as Montanus adviseth twenty five cons All four thousand two hundred thirty nine drying medicines are to be repelled as aloe hiera and all pills whatsoever because the disease is dry of itself I might here insert many receipts of prescribed potions boles c The doses of these but that they are common in every good physician and that I am loath to incur the censure of Forestus lib three cap six de urinis four thousand two hundred forty against those that divulge and publish medicines in their mother tongue and lest I should give occasion thereby to some ignorant reader to practise on himself without the consent of a good physician Such as are not swallowed but only kept in the mouth are gargarisms used commonly after a purge when the body is soluble and loose Or apophlegmatisms masticatories to be held and chewed in the mouth which are gentle as hyssop origan pennyroyal thyme mustard strong as pellitory pepper ginger c Such as are taken into the nostrils errhina are liquid or dry juice of pimpernel onions c castor pepper white hellebore c To these you may add odoraments perfumes and suffumigations c Taken into the inferior parts are clysters strong or weak suppositories of Castilian soap honey boiled to a consistence or stronger of scammony hellebore c These are all used and prescribed to this malady upon several occasions as shall be shown in its place MEMB III Chirurgical Remedies In letting of blood three main circumstances are to be considered four thousand two hundred forty one Who how much when That is that it be done to such a one as may endure it or to whom it may belong that he be of a competent age not too young nor too old overweak fat or lean sore laboured but to such as have need are full of bad blood noxious humours and may be eased by it The quantity depends upon the party s habit of body as he is strong or weak full or empty may spare more or less In the morning is the fittest time some doubt whether it be best fasting or full whether the moon s motion or aspect of planets be to be observed some affirm some deny some grant in acute but not in chronic diseases whether before or after physic Tis Heurnius aphorism a phlebotomia auspicandum esse curiationem non a pharmacia you must begin with bloodletting and not physic some except this peculiar malady But what do I Horatius Augenius a physician of Padua hath lately writ seventeen books of this subject Jobertus c Particular kinds of bloodletting in use four thousand two hundred forty two are three first is that opening a vein in the arm with a sharp knife or in the head knees or any other parts as shall be thought fit Cupping glasses with or without scarification ocyssime compescunt saith Fernelius they work presently and are applied to several parts to divert humours aches winds c Horseleeches are much used in melancholy applied especially to the haemorrhoids Horatius Augenius lib ten cap ten Platerus de mentis alienat cap three Altomarus Piso and many others prefer them before any evacuations in this kind four thousand two hundred forty three Cauteries or searing with hot irons combustions borings lancings which because they are terrible Dropax and Sinapismus are invented by plasters to raise blisters and eating medicines of pitch mustard seed and the like Issues still to be kept open made as the former and applied in and to several parts have their use here on divers occasions as shall be shown SECT V MEMB I SUBSECT I Particular Cure of the three several Kinds of Head Melancholy The general cures thus briefly examined and discussed it remains now to apply these medicines to the three particular species or kinds that according to the several parts affected each man may tell in some sort how to help or ease himself I will treat of head melancholy first in which as in all other good cures we must begin with diet as a matter of most moment able oftentimes of itself to work this effect I have read saith Laurentius cap eight de Melanch that in old diseases which have gotten the upper hand or a habit the manner of living is to more purpose than whatsoever can be drawn out of the most precious boxes of the apothecaries This diet as I have said is not only in choice of meat and drink but of all those other non natural things Let air be clear and moist most part diet moistening of good juice easy of digestion and not windy drink clear and well brewed not too strong nor too small Make a melancholy man fat as four thousand two hundred forty four Rhasis saith and thou hast finished the cure Exercise not too remiss nor too violent Sleep a little more than ordinary four thousand two hundred forty five Excrements daily to be voided by art or nature and which Fernelius enjoins his patient consil forty four above the rest to avoid all passions and perturbations of the mind Let him not be alone or idle in any kind of melancholy but still accompanied with such friends and familiars he most affects neatly dressed washed and combed according to his ability at least in clean sweet linen spruce handsome decent and good apparel for nothing sooner dejects a man than want squalor and nastiness foul or old clothes out of fashion Concerning the medicinal part he that will satisfy himself at large in this precedent of diet and see all at once the whole cure and manner of it in every distinct species let him consult with Gordonius Valescus with Prosper Calenius lib de atra bile ad Card Caesium Laurentius cap eight et nine de mela Aelian Montaltus de mel cap twenty six

averters cordials in great variety and abundance out of which because every man cannot attend to read or peruse them I will collect for the benefit of the reader some few more notable medicines SUBSECT II Bloodletting Phlebotomy is promiscuously used before and after physic commonly before and upon occasion is often reiterated if there be any need at least of it For Galen and many others make a doubt of bleeding at all in this kind of head melancholy If the malady saith Piso cap twenty three and Altomarus cap seven Fuchsius cap thirty three four thousand two hundred forty six shall proceed primarily from the misaffected brain the patient in such case shall not need at all to bleed except the blood otherwise abound the veins be full inflamed blood and the party ready to run mad In immaterial melancholy which especially comes from a cold distemperature of spirits Hercules de Saxonia cap seventeen will not admit of phlebotomy Laurentius cap nine approves it out of the authority of the Arabians but as Mesue Rhasis Alexander appoint four thousand two hundred forty seven especially in the head to open the veins of the forehead nose and ears is good They commonly set cupping glasses on the party s shoulders having first scarified the place they apply horseleeches on the head and in all melancholy diseases whether essential or accidental they cause the haemorrhoids to be opened having the eleventh aphorism of the sixth book of Hippocrates for their ground and warrant which saith That in melancholy and mad men the varicose tumour or haemorrhoids appearing doth heal the same Valescus prescribes bloodletting in all three kinds whom Sallust Salvian follows four thousand two hundred forty eight If the blood abound which is discerned by the fullness of the veins his precedent diet the party s laughter age c begin with the median or middle vein of the arm if the blood be ruddy and clear stop it but if black in the spring time or a good season or thick let it run according to the party s strength and some eight or twelve days after open the head vein and the veins in the forehead or provoke it out of the nostrils or cupping glasses c Trallianus allows of this four thousand two hundred forty nine If there have been any suppression or stopping of blood at nose or haemorrhoids or women s months then to open a vein in the head or about the ankles Yet he doth hardly approve of this course if melancholy be situated in the head alone or in any other dotage four thousand two hundred fifty except it primarily proceed from blood or that the malady be increased by it for bloodletting refrigerates and dries up except the body be very full of blood and a kind of ruddiness in the face Therefore I conclude with Areteus four thousand two hundred fifty one before you let blood deliberate of it and well consider all circumstances belonging to it SUBSECT III Preparatives and Purgers After bloodletting we must proceed to other medicines first prepare and then purge Augeae stabulum purgare make the body clean before we hope to do any good Walter Bruel would have a practitioner begin first with a clyster of his which he prescribes before bloodletting the common sort as Mercurialis Montaltus cap thirty c proceed from lenitives to preparatives and so to purgers Lenitives are well known electuarium lenitivum diaphenicum diacatholicon c Preparatives are usually syrups of borage bugloss apples fumitory thyme and epithyme with double as much of the same decoction or distilled water or of the waters of bugloss balm hops endive scolopendry fumitory c or these sodden in whey which must be reiterated and used for many days together Purges come last which must not be used at all if the malady may be otherwise helped because they weaken nature and dry so much and in giving of them four thousand two hundred fifty two we must begin with the gentlest first Some forbid all hot medicines as Alexander and Salvianus c Ne insaniores inde fiant hot medicines increase the disease four thousand two hundred fifty three by drying too much Purge downward rather than upward use potions rather than pills and when you begin physic persevere and continue in a course for as one observes four thousand two hundred fifty four movere et non educere in omnibus malum est to stir up the humour as one purge commonly doth and not to prosecute doth more harm than good They must continue in a course of physic yet not so that they tire and oppress nature danda quies naturae they must now and then remit and let nature have some rest The most gentle purges to begin with are four thousand two hundred fifty five senna cassia epithyme myrabolanea catholicon if these prevail not we may proceed to stronger as the confection of hamech pil Indae fumitoriae de assaieret of lapis armenus and lazuli diasena Or if pills be too dry four thousand two hundred fifty six some prescribe both hellebores in the last place amongst the rest Aretus four thousand two hundred fifty seven because this disease will resist a gentle medicine Laurentius and Hercules de Saxonia would have antimony tried last if the four thousand two hundred fifty eight party be strong and it warily given four thousand two hundred fifty nine Trincavelius prefers hierologodium to whom Francis Alexander in his Apol rad five subscribes a very good medicine they account it But Crato in a counsel of his for the duke of Bavaria s chancellor wholly rejects it I find a vast chaos of medicines a confusion of receipts and magistrals amongst writers appropriated to this disease some of the chiefest I will rehearse four thousand two hundred sixty To be seasick first is very good at seasonable times Helleborismus Matthioli with which he vaunts and boasts he did so many several cures four thousand two hundred sixty one I never gave it saith he but after once or twice by the help of God they were happily cured The manner of making it he sets down at large in his third book of Epist to George Hankshius a physician Walter Bruel and Heurnius make mention of it with great approbation so doth Sckenkius in his memorable cures and experimental medicines cen six obser thirty seven That famous Helleborisme of Montanus which he so often repeats in his consultations and counsels as twenty eight pro melan sacerdote et consil one hundred forty eight pro hypochondriaco and cracks four thousand two hundred sixty two to be a most sovereign remedy for all melancholy persons which he hath often given without offence and found by long experience and observations to be such Quercetan prefers a syrup of hellebore in his Spagirica Pharmac and Hellebore s extract cap five of his invention likewise a most safe medicine and not unfit to be given children before all remedies whatsoever four thousand two hundred sixty three Paracelsus in his book of black hellebore admits this medicine but as it is prepared by him four thousand two hundred sixty four It is most certain saith he that the virtue of this herb is great and admirable in effect and little differing from balm itself and he that knows well how to make use of it hath more art than all their books contain or all the doctors in Germany can show Aelianus Montaltus in his exquisite work de morb capitis cap thirty one de mel sets a special receipt of his own which in his practice four thousand two hundred sixty five he fortunately used because it is but short I will set it down Symbol Rx Syrupe de pomis Symbol Ounce ij aquae borag Symbol Ounce iiij Ellebori nigri per

Hyacinthi with which in his book de curis admirandis he boasts that he had cured many melancholy persons in eight days which four thousand two hundred sixty nine Sckenkius puts amongst his observable

number of eggs and will have one hundred one to be taken by three and three in like sort which Sallust Salvian approves de red med lib two c one with some of the same powder till all be spent a most excellent remedy for all melancholy and mad men Symbol Rx Epithymi thymi ana drachmas duas sacchari albi unciam unam croci grana tria Cinamomi drachmam unam misce fiat pulvis All these yet are nothing to those four thousand two hundred seventy two chemical preparatives of Aqua Chalidonia quintessence of hellebore salts extracts distillations oils Aurum potabile c doctor Anthony in his book de auro potab edit sixteen hundred is all in all for it four thousand two hundred seventy three And though all the schools of Galenists with a wicked and unthankful pride and scorn detest it in their practice yet in more grievous diseases when their vegetals will do no good they are compelled to seek the help of minerals though they use them rashly unprofitably slackly and to no purpose Rhenanus a Dutch chemist in his book de Sale e puteo emergente takes upon him to apologise for Anthony and sets light by all that speak against him But what do I meddle with this great controversy which is the subject of many volumes Let Paracelsus Quercetan Crollius and the brethren of the rosy cross defend themselves as they may Crato Erastus and the Galenists oppugn Paracelsus he brags on the other side he did more famous cures by this means than all the Galenists in Europe and calls himself a monarch Galen Hippocrates infants illiterate c As Thessalus of old railed against those ancient Asclepiadean writers four thousand two hundred seventy four he condemns others insults triumphs overcomes all antiquity saith Galen as if he spake to him declares himself a conqueror and crowns his own doings four thousand two hundred seventy five One drop of their chemical preparatives shall do more good than all their fulsome potions Erastus and the rest of the Galenists vilify them on the other side as heretics in physic four thousand two hundred seventy six Paracelsus did that in physic which Luther in Divinity four thousand two hundred seventy seven A drunken rogue he was a base fellow a magician he had the devil for his master devils his familiar companions and what he did was done by the help of the devil Thus they contend and rail and every mart write books pro and con et adhuc sub judice lis est let them agree as they will I proceed SUBSECT IV Averters Averters and purgers must go together as tending all to the same purpose to divert this rebellious humour and turn it another way In this range clysters and suppositories challenge a chief place to draw this humour from the brain and heart to the more ignoble parts Some would have them still used a few days between and those to be made with the boiled seeds of anise fennel and bastard saffron hops thyme epithyme mallows fumitory bugloss polypody senna diasene hamech cassia diacatholicon hierologodium oil of violets sweet almonds c For without question a clyster opportunely used cannot choose in this as most other maladies but to do very much good Clysteres nutriunt sometimes clysters nourish as they may be prepared as I was informed not long since by a learned lecture of our natural philosophy four thousand two hundred seventy eight reader which he handled by way of discourse out of some other noted physicians Such things as provoke urine most commend but not sweat Trincavelius consil sixteen cap one in head melancholy forbids it P Byarus and others approve frictions of the outward parts and to bathe them with warm water Instead of ordinary frictions Cardan prescribes rubbing with nettles till they blister the skin which likewise four thousand two hundred seventy nine Basardus Visontinus so much magnifies Sneezing masticatories and nasals are generally received Montaltus c thirty four Hildesheim spicel three fol one hundred thirty six and two hundred thirty eight give several receipts of all three Hercules de Saxonia relates of an empiric in Venice four thousand two hundred eighty that had a strong water to purge by the mouth and nostrils which he still used in head melancholy and would sell for no gold To open months and haemorrhoids is very good physic four thousand two hundred eighty one If they have been formerly stopped Faventinus would have them opened with horseleeches so would Hercul de Sax Julius Alexandrinus consil one hundred eighty five Scoltzii thinks aloes fitter four thousand two hundred eighty two most approve horseleeches in this case to be applied to the forehead four thousand two hundred eighty three nostrils and other places Montaltus cap twenty nine out of Alexander and others prescribes four thousand two hundred eighty four cupping glasses and issues in the left thigh Aretus lib seven cap five four thousand two hundred eighty five Paulus Regolinus Sylvius will have them without scarification applied to the shoulders and back thighs and feet four thousand two hundred eighty six Montaltus cap thirty four bids open an issue in the arm or hinder part of the head four thousand two hundred eighty seven Piso enjoins ligatures frictions suppositories and cupping glasses still without scarification and the rest Cauteries and hot irons are to be used four thousand two hundred eighty eight in the suture of the crown and the seared or ulcerated place suffered to run a good while Tis not amiss to bore the skull with an instrument to let out the fuliginous vapours Sallus Salvianus de re medic lib two cap one four thousand two hundred eighty nine because this humour hardly yields to other physic would have the leg cauterised or the left leg below the knee four thousand two hundred ninety and the head bored in two or three places for that it much avails to the exhalation of the vapours four thousand two hundred ninety one I saw saith he a melancholy man at Rome that by no remedies could be healed but when by chance he was wounded in the head and the skull broken he was excellently cured Another to the admiration of the beholders four thousand two hundred ninety two breaking his head with a fall from on high was instantly recovered of his dotage Gordonius cap thirteen part two would have these cauteries tried last when no other physic will serve four thousand two hundred ninety three The head to be shaved and bored to let out fumes which without doubt will do much good I saw a melancholy man wounded in the head with a sword his brainpan broken so long as the wound was open he was well but when his wound was healed his dotage returned again But Alexander Messaria a professor in Padua lib one pract med cap twenty one de melanchol will allow no cauteries at all tis too stiff a humour and too thick as he holds to be so evaporated Guianerius c eight Tract fifteen cured a nobleman in Savoy by boring alone four thousand two hundred ninety four leaving the hole open a month together by means of which after two years melancholy and madness he was delivered All approve of this remedy in the suture of the crown but Arculanus would have the cautery to be made with gold In many other parts these cauteries are prescribed for melancholy men as in the thighs Mercurialis consil eighty six arms legs Idem consil six nineteen twenty five Montanus eighty six Rodericus a Fonseca tom two cousult eighty four pro hypochond coxa dextra c but most in the head if other physic will do no good SUBSECT V Alteratives and Cordials corroborating resolving the Reliques and mending the Temperament Because this humour is so malign of itself and so hard to be removed the reliques are to be cleansed by alteratives cordials and such means the temper is to be altered and amended with such things as fortify and strengthen the heart and brain four thousand two hundred ninety five which are commonly both affected in this malady and do mutually misaffect one another which are still to be given every other day or some few days inserted after a purge or like physic as occasion serves and are of such force that many times they help alone and as four thousand two hundred ninety six Arnoldus holds in his Aphorisms are to

in the head if black blood issue forth bleed on if it be clear and good let it be instantly suppressed four thousand three hundred seventy three because the malice of melancholy is much corrected by the goodness of the blood If the party s strength will not admit much evacuation in this kind at once it must be assayed again and again if it may not be conveniently taken from the arm it must be taken from the knees and ankles especially to such men or women whose haemorrhoids or months have been stopped four thousand three hundred seventy four If the malady continue it is not amiss to evacuate in a part in the forehead and to virgins in the ankles who are melancholy for love matters so to widows that are much grieved and troubled with sorrow and cares for bad blood flows in the

French nobleman to have an especial care of it without which all other remedies are in vain Bloodletting is not to be used except the patient s body be very full of blood and that it be derived from the liver and spleen to the stomach and his vessels then four thousand three hundred seventy nine to draw it back to cut the inner vein of either arm some say the salvatella and if the malady be continuate four thousand three hundred eighty to open a vein in the forehead Preparatives and alteratives may be used as before saving that there must be respect had as well to the liver spleen stomach hypochondries as to the heart and brain To comfort the four thousand three hundred eighty one stomach and inner parts against wind and obstructions by Areteus Galen Aetius Aurelianus c and many latter writers are still prescribed the decoctions of wormwood centaury pennyroyal betony sodden in whey and daily drunk many have been cured by this medicine alone Prosper Altinus and some others as much magnify the water of Nile against this malady an especial good remedy for windy melancholy For which reason belike Ptolemeus Philadelphus when he married his daughter Berenice to the king of Assyria as Celsus lib two records magnis impensis Nili aquam afferri jussit to his great charge caused the water of Nile to be carried with her and gave command that during her life she should use no other drink I find those that commend use of apples in splenetic and this kind of melancholy lamb s wool some call it which howsoever approved must certainly be corrected of cold rawness and wind Codronchus in his book de sale absyn magnifies the oil and salt of wormwood above all other remedies four thousand three hundred eighty two which works better and speedier than any simple whatsoever and much to be preferred before all those fulsome decoctions and infusions which must offend by reason of their quantity this alone in a small measure taken expels wind and that most forcibly moves urine cleanseth the stomach of all gross humours crudities helps appetite c Arnoldus hath a wormwood wine which he would have used which every pharmacopoeia speaks of Diminutives and purges may four thousand three hundred eighty three be taken as before of hiera manna cassia which Montanus consil two hundred thirty for an Italian abbot in this kind prefers before all other simples four thousand three hundred eighty four And these must be often used still abstaining from those which are more violent lest they do exasperate the stomach c and the mischief by that means be increased Though in some physicians I find very strong purgers hellebore itself prescribed in this affection If it long continue vomits may be taken after meat or otherwise gently procured with warm water oxymel c now and then Fuchsius cap thirty three prescribes hellebore but still take heed in this malady which I have often warned of hot medicines four thousand three hundred eighty five because as Salvianus adds drought follows heat which increaseth the disease and yet Baptista Sylvaticus controv thirty two forbids cold medicines four thousand three hundred eighty six because they increase obstructions and other bad symptoms But this varies as the parties do and tis not easy to determine which to use four thousand three hundred eighty seven The stomach most part in this infirmity is cold the liver hot scarce therefore which Montanus insinuates consil two hundred twenty nine for the Earl of Manfort can you help the one and not hurt the other much discretion must be used take no physic at all he concludes without great need Laelius Aegubinus consil for an hypochondriacal German prince used many medicines but it was after signified to him in four thousand three hundred eighty eight letters that the decoction of China and sassafras and salt of sassafras wrought him an incredible good In his one hundred eight consult he used as happily the same remedies this to a third might have been poison by overheating his liver and blood For the other parts look for remedies in Savanarola Gordonius Massaria Mercatus Johnson c One for the spleen amongst many other I will not omit cited by Hildesheim spicel two prescribed by Mat Flaccus and out of the authority of Benevenius Antony Benevenius in a hypochondriacal passion four thousand three hundred eighty nine cured an

holds Sallust Salvian will admit no other phlebotomy but this and by his experience in an hospital which he kept he found all mad and melancholy men worse for other bloodletting Laurentius cap fifteen calls this of horseleeches a sure remedy to empty the spleen and mesaraic membrane Only Montanus consil two hundred forty one is against it four thousand three hundred ninety four to other men saith he this opening of the haemorrhoids seems to be a profitable remedy for my part I do not approve of it because it draws away the thinnest blood and leaves the thickest behind Aetius Vidus Vidius Mercurialis Fuchsius recommend diuretics or such things as provoke urine as aniseeds dill fennel germander ground pine sodden in water or drunk in powder and yet four thousand three hundred ninety five P Bayerus is against them and so is Hollerius All melancholy men saith he must avoid such things as provoke urine because by them the subtile or thinnest is evacuated the thicker matter remains Clysters are in good request Trincavelius lib three cap thirty eight for a young nobleman esteems of them in the first place and Hercules de Saxonia Panth lib one cap sixteen is a great approver of them four thousand three hundred ninety six I have found saith he by experience that many hypochondriacal melancholy men have been cured by the sole use of clysters receipts are to be had in him Besides those fomentations irrigations inunctions odoraments prescribed for the head there must be the like used for the liver spleen stomach hypochondries c four thousand three hundred ninety seven In crudity saith Piso tis good to bind the stomach hard to hinder wind and to help concoction Of inward medicines I need not speak use the same cordials as before In this kind of melancholy some prescribe four thousand three hundred ninety eight treacle in winter especially before or after purges or in the spring as Avicenna four thousand three hundred ninety nine Trincavellius mithridate four thousand four hundred Montaltus paeony seed unicorn s horn os de corde cervi c Amongst topics or outward medicines none are more precious than baths but of them I have spoken Fomentations to the hypochondries are very good of wine and water in which are sodden southernwood melilot epithyme mugwort senna polypody as also four thousand four hundred one cerotes four thousand four hundred two plaisters liniments ointments for the spleen liver and hypochondries of which look for examples in Laurentius Jobertus lib three c pra med Montanus consil two hundred thirty one Montaltus cap thirty three Hercules de Saxonia Faventinus And so of epithems digestive powders bags oils Octavius Horatianus lib two c five prescribes calastic cataplasms or dry purging medicines Piso four thousand four hundred three dropaces of pitch and oil of rue applied at certain times to the stomach to the metaphrene or part of the back which is over against the heart Aetius sinapisms Montaltus cap thirty five would have the thighs to be four thousand four hundred four cauterised Mercurialis prescribes beneath the knees Laelius Aegubinus consil seventy seven for a hypochondriacal Dutchman will have the cautery made in the right thigh and so Montanus consil fifty five The same Montanus consil thirty four approves of issues in the arms or hinder part of the head Bernardus Paternus in Hildesheim spicel two would have four thousand four hundred five issues made in both the thighs four thousand four hundred six Lod Mercatus prescribes them near the spleen aut prope ventriculi regimen or in either of the thighs Ligatures frictions and cupping glasses above or about the belly without scarification which four thousand four hundred seven Felix Platerus so much approves may be used as before SUBSECT II Correctors to expel Wind Against Costiveness c In this kind of melancholy one of the most offensive symptoms is wind which as in the other species so in this hath great need to be corrected and expelled The medicines to expel it are either inwardly taken or outwardly Inwardly to expel wind are simples or compounds simples are herbs roots c as galanga gentian angelica enula calamus aromaticus valerian zeodoti iris condite ginger aristolochy cicliminus China dittander pennyroyal rue calamint bay berries and bay leaves betony rosemary hyssop sabine centaury mint camomile staechas agnus castus broom flowers origan orange pills c spices as saffron cinnamon bezoar stone myrrh mace nutmegs pepper cloves ginger seeds of annis fennel amni cari nettle rue c juniper berries grana paradisi compounds dianisum diagalanga diaciminum diacalaminth electuarium de baccis lauri benedicta laxativa pulvis ad status antid florent pulvis carminativus aromaticum rosatum treacle mithridate c This one caution of four thousand four hundred eight Gualter Bruell is to be observed in the administering of these hot medicines and dry that whilst they covet to expel wind they do not inflame the blood and increase the disease sometimes as he saith medicines must more decline to heat sometimes more to cold as the circumstances require and as the parties are inclined to heat or cold Outwardly taken to expel winds are oils as of camomile rue bays c fomentations of the hypochondries with the decoctions of dill pennyroyal rue bay leaves cumin c bags of camomile flowers aniseed cumin bays rue wormwood ointments of the oil of spikenard wormwood rue c four thousand four hundred nine Areteus prescribes cataplasms of camomile flowers fennel aniseeds cumin rosemary wormwood leaves c four thousand four hundred ten Cupping glasses applied to the hypochondries without scarification do wonderfully resolve wind Fernelius consil forty three much approves of them at the lower end of the belly four thousand four hundred eleven Lod Mercatus calls them a powerful remedy and testifies moreover out of his own knowledge how many he hath seen suddenly eased by them Julius Caesar Claudinus respons med resp thirty three admires these cupping glasses which he calls out of Galen four thousand four hundred twelve a kind of enchantment they cause such present help Empirics have a myriad of medicines as to swallow a bullet of lead c which I voluntarily omit Amatus Lusitanus cent four curat fifty four for a hypochondriacal person that was extremely tormented with wind prescribes a strange remedy Put a pair of bellows end into a clyster pipe and applying it into the fundament open the bowels so draw forth the wind natura non admittit vacuum He vaunts he was the first invented this remedy and by means of it speedily eased a melancholy man Of the cure of this flatuous melancholy read more in Fienus de Flatibus cap twenty six et passim alias Against headache vertigo vapours which ascend forth of the stomach to molest the head read Hercules de Saxonia and others If costiveness offend in this or any other of the three species it is to be corrected with suppositories clysters or lenitives powder of senna condite prunes c Symbol Rx Elect lenit e succo rosar ana Symbol Ounce j misce Take as much as a nutmeg at a time half an hour before dinner or supper or pil mastichin Symbol Ounce j in six pills a pill or two at a time See more in Montan consil two hundred twenty nine Hildesheim spicel two P Cnemander and Montanus commend four thousand four hundred thirteen Cyprian turpentine which they would have familiarly taken to the quantity of a small nut two or three hours before dinner and supper twice or thrice a week if need be for besides that it keeps the belly soluble it clears the stomach opens obstructions cleanseth the liver provokes urine These in brief are the ordinary medicines which belong to the cure of melancholy which if they be used aright no doubt may do much good Si non levando saltem leniendo valent peculiaria bene selecta saith Bessardus a good choice of particular receipts must needs ease if not quite cure not one but all or most as occasion serves Et quae non

The Preface There will not be wanting I presume one or other that will much discommend some part of this treatise of love melancholy and object which four thousand four hundred fourteen Erasmus in his preface to Sir Thomas More suspects of his that it is too light for a divine too comical a subject to speak of love symptoms too fantastical and fit alone for a wanton poet a feeling young lovesick gallant an effeminate courtier or some such idle person And tis true they say for by the naughtiness of men it is so come to pass as four thousand four hundred fifteen Caussinus observes ut castis auribus vox amoris suspecta sit et invisa the very name of love is odious to chaster ears and therefore some again out of an affected gravity will dislike all for the name s sake before they read a word dissembling with him in four thousand four hundred sixteen Petronius and seem to be angry that their ears are violated with such obscene speeches that so they may be admired for grave philosophers and staid carriage They cannot abide to hear talk of love toys or amorous discourses vultu gestu oculis in their outward actions averse and yet in their cogitations they are all out as bad if not worse than others four thousand four hundred seventeen Erubuit posuitque meum Lucretia librum Sed coram Bruto Brute recede legit But let these cavillers and counterfeit Catos know that as the Lord John answered the Queen in that Italian four thousand four hundred eighteen Guazzo an old a grave discreet man is fittest to discourse of love matters because he hath likely more experience observed more hath a more staid judgment can better discern resolve discuss advise give better cautions and more solid precepts better inform his auditors in such a subject and by reason of his riper years sooner divert Besides nihil in hac amoris voce subtimendum there is nothing here to be excepted at love is a species of melancholy and a necessary part of this my treatise which I may not omit operi suscepto inserviendum fuit so Jacobus Mysillius pleadeth for himself in his translation of Lucian s dialogues and so do I I must and will perform my task And that short excuse of Mercerus for his edition of Aristaenetus shall be mine four thousand four hundred nineteen If I have spent my time ill to write let not them be so idle as to read But I am persuaded it is not so ill spent I ought not to excuse or repent myself of this subject on which many grave and worthy men have written whole volumes Plato Plutarch Plotinus Maximus Tyrius Alcinous Avicenna Leon Hebreus in three large dialogues Xenophon sympos Theophrastus if we may believe Athenaeus lib thirteen cap nine Picus Mirandula Marius Aequicola both in Italian Kornmannus de linea Amoris lib three Petrus Godefridus hath handled in three books P Haedus and which almost every physician as Arnoldus Villanovanus Valleriola observat med lib two observ seven Aelian Montaltus and Laurentius in their treatises of melancholy Jason Pratensis de morb cap Valescus de Taranta Gordonius Hercules de Saxonia Savanarola Langius c have treated of apart and in their works I excuse myself therefore with Peter Godefridus Valleriola Ficinus and in four thousand four hundred twenty Langius words Cadmus Milesius writ fourteen books of love and why should I be ashamed to write an epistle in favour of young men of this subject A company of stern readers dislike the second of the Aeneids and Virgil s gravity for inserting such amorous passions in an heroical subject but four thousand four hundred twenty one Servius his commentator justly vindicates the poet s worth wisdom and discretion in doing as he did Castalio would not have young men read the four thousand four hundred twenty two Canticles because to his thinking it was too light and amorous a tract a ballad of ballads as our old English translation hath it He might as well forbid the reading of Genesis because of the loves of Jacob and Rachael the stories of Sichem and Dinah Judah and Thamar reject the Book of Numbers for the fornications of the people of Israel with the Moabites that of Judges for Samson and Dalilah s embracings that of the Kings for David and Bersheba s adulteries the incest of Ammon and Thamar Solomon s concubines c The stories of Esther Judith Susanna and many such Dicearchus and some other carp at Plato s majesty that he would vouchsafe to indite such love toys amongst the rest for that dalliance with Agatho Suavia dans Agathoni animam ipse in labra tenebam Aegra etenim properans tanquam abitura fuit For my part saith four thousand four hundred twenty three Maximus Tyrius a great Platonist himself me non tantum admiratio habet sed eliam stupor I do not only admire but stand amazed to read that Plato and Socrates both should expel Homer from their city because he writ of such light and wanton subjects Quod Junonem cum Jove in Ida concumbentes inducit ab immortali nube contectos Vulcan s net Mars and Venus fopperies before all the gods because Apollo fled when he was persecuted by Achilles the four thousand four hundred twenty four gods were wounded and ran whining away as Mars that roared louder than Stentor and covered nine acres of ground with his fall Vulcan was a summer s day falling down from heaven and in Lemnos Isle brake his leg c with such ridiculous passages when as both Socrates and Plato by his testimony writ lighter themselves quid enim tam distat as he follows it quam amans a temperante formarum admirator a demente what can be more absurd than for grave philosophers to treat of such fooleries to admire Autiloquus Alcibiades for their beauties as they did to run after to gaze to dote on fair Phaedrus delicate Agatho young Lysis fine Charmides haeccine Philosophum decent Doth this become grave philosophers Thus peradventure Callias Thrasimachus Polus Aristophanes or some of his adversaries and emulators might object but neither they nor four thousand four hundred twenty five Anytus and Melitus his bitter enemies that condemned him for teaching Critias to tyrannise his impiety for swearing by dogs and plain trees for his juggling sophistry c never so much as upbraided him with impure love writing or speaking of that subject and therefore without question as he concludes both Socrates and Plato in this are justly to be excused But suppose they had been a little overseen should divine Plato be defamed no rather as he said of Cato s drunkenness if Cato were drunk it should be no vice at all to be drunk They reprove Plato then but without cause as four thousand four hundred twenty six Ficinus pleads for all love is honest and good and they are worthy to be loved that speak well of love Being to speak of this admirable affection of love saith four thousand four hundred twenty seven Valleriola there lies open a vast and philosophical field to my discourse by which many lovers become mad let me leave my more serious meditations wander in these philosophical fields and look into those pleasant groves of the Muses where with unspeakable variety of flowers we may make garlands to ourselves not to adorn us only but with their pleasant smell and juice to nourish our souls and fill our minds desirous of knowledge c After a harsh and unpleasing discourse of melancholy which hath hitherto molested your patience and tired the author give him leave with four thousand four hundred twenty eight Godefridus the lawyer and Laurentius cap five to recreate himself in this kind after his laborious studies since so many grave divines and worthy men have without offence to manners to help themselves and others voluntarily written of it Heliodorus a bishop penned a love story of Theagines and Chariclea and when some Catos of his time reprehended him for it chose rather saith four thousand four hundred twenty nine Nicephorus to leave his bishopric than his book Aeneas Sylvius an ancient divine and past forty years of age as four thousand four hundred thirty he confesseth himself after Pope Pius Secundus indited that wanton history of Euryalus and Lucretia And how many superintendents of learning could I reckon up that have written of light fantastical subjects Beroaldus Erasmus Alpheratius twenty four times printed in Spanish c Give me leave then to refresh my muse a little and my weary readers to expatiate in this delightsome field hoc deliciarum campo as Fonseca terms it to four thousand four hundred thirty one season a surly discourse with a more pleasing aspersion of love matters Edulcare vitam convenit as the poet invites us curas nugis c tis good to sweeten our life with some pleasing toys to relish it and as Pliny tells us magna pars studiosorum amaenitates quaerimus most of our students love such pleasant four thousand four hundred thirty two subjects Though Macrobius teach us otherwise four thousand four hundred thirty three that those old sages banished all such light tracts from their studies to nurse s cradles to please only the ear yet out of Apuleius I will oppose as honourable patrons Solon Plato four thousand four hundred thirty four Xenophon Adrian c that as highly approve of these treatises On the other side methinks they are not to be disliked they are not so unfit I will not peremptorily say as one did four thousand four hundred thirty five tam suavia dicam facinora ut male sit ei qui talibus non delectetur I will tell you such pretty stories that foul befall him that is not pleased with them Neque dicam ea quae vobis usui sit audivisse et voluptati meminisse with that confidence as Beroaldus doth his enarrations on Propertius I will not expert or hope for that approbation which Lipsius gives to his Epictetus pluris facio quum relego semper ut novum et quum repetivi repetendum the more I read the more shall I covet to read I will not press you with my pamphlets or beg attention but if you like them you may Pliny holds it expedient and most fit severitatem jucunditate etiam in scriptis condire to season our works with some pleasant discourse Synesius approves it licet in ludicris ludere the four thousand four hundred thirty six poet admires it Omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci and there be those without question that are more willing to read such toys than four thousand four hundred thirty seven I am to write Let me not live saith Aretine s Antonia If I had not rather hear thy discourse four thousand four hundred thirty eight than see a play No doubt but there be more of her mind ever have been ever will be as four thousand four hundred thirty nine Hierome bears me witness A far greater part had rather read Apuleius than Plato Tully himself confesseth he could not understand Plato s Timaeus and therefore cared less for it but every schoolboy hath that famous testament of Grunnius Corocotta Porcellus at his fingers ends The comical poet four thousand four hundred forty Id sibi negoti credidit solum dari Populo ut placrent quas fecissit fabulas made this his only care and sole study to please the people tickle the ear and to delight but mine earnest intent is as much to profit as to please non tam ut populo placerem quam ut populum juvarem and these my writings I hope shall take like gilded pills which are so composed as well to tempt the appetite and deceive the palate as to help and medicinally work upon the whole body my lines shall not only recreate but rectify the mind I think I have said enough if not let him that is otherwise minded remember that of four thousand four hundred forty one Maudarensis he was in his life a philosopher as Ausonius apologiseth for him in his epigrams a lover in his precepts most severe in his epistle to Caerellia a wanton Annianus Sulpicius Evemus Menander and many old poets besides did in scriptis prurire write Fescennines Atellans and lascivious songs laetam materiam yet they had in moribus censuram et severitatem they were chaste severe and upright livers four thousand four hundred forty two Castum esse decet pium poetam Ipsum versiculos nihil necesse est Qui tum denique habent salem et leporem I am of Catullus opinion and make the same apology in mine own behalf Hoc etiam quod scribo pendet plerumque ex aliorum sententia et auctoritate nec ipse forsan insanio sed insanientes sequor Atqui detur hoc insanire me Semel insanivimus omnes et tute ipse opinor insanis aliquando et is et ille et ego scilicet four thousand four hundred forty three Homo sum humani a me nihil alienum puto four thousand four hundred forty four And which he urgeth for himself accused of the like fault I as justly plead four thousand four hundred forty five lasciva est nobis pagina vita proba est Howsoever my lines err my life is honest four thousand four hundred forty six vita verecunda est musa jocosa mihi But I presume I need no such apologies I need not as Socrates in Plato cover his face when he spake of love or blush and hide mine eyes as Pallas did in her hood when she was consulted by Jupiter about Mercury s marriage quod super nuptiis virgo consulitur it is no such lascivious obscene or wanton discourse I have not offended your chaster ears with anything that is here written as many French and Italian authors in their modern language of late have done nay some of our Latin pontificial writers Zanches Asorius Abulensis Burchardus c whom four thousand four hundred forty seven Rivet accuseth to be more lascivious than Virgil in Priapeiis Petronius in Catalectis Aristophanes in Lycistratae Martialis or any other pagan profane writer qui tam atrociter four thousand four hundred forty eight one notes hoc genere peccarunt ut multa ingeniosissime scripta obscaenitatum gratia castae mentes abhorreant Tis not scurrile this but chaste honest most part serious and even of religion itself four thousand four hundred forty nine Incensed as he said with the love of finding love we have sought it and found it More yet I have augmented and added something to this light treatise if light which was not in the former editions I am not ashamed to confess it with a good four thousand four hundred fifty author quod extendi et locupletari hoc subjectum plerique postulabant et eorum importunitate victus animum utcunque renitentem eo adegi ut jam sexta vice calamum in manum sumerem scriptionique longe et a studiis et professione mea alienae me accingerem horas aliquas a seriis meis occupationibus interim suffuratus easque veluti ludo cuidam ac recreationi destinans four thousand four hundred fifty one Cogor retrorsum Vela dare atque literare cursus Olim relictos etsi non ignorarem novos fortasse detractores novis hisce interpolationibus meis minime defuturos four thousand four hundred fifty two And thus much I have thought good to say by way of preface lest any man which four thousand four hundred fifty three Godefridus feared in his book should blame in me lightness wantonness rashness in speaking of love s causes enticements symptoms remedies lawful and unlawful loves and lust itself four thousand four hundred fifty four I speak it only to tax and deter others from it not to teach but to show the vanities and fopperies of this heroical or Herculean love four thousand four hundred fifty five and to apply remedies unto it I will treat of this with like liberty as of the rest four thousand four hundred fifty six Sed dicam vobis vos porro dicite multis Millibus et facite haec charta loquatur anus Condemn me not good reader then or censure me hardly if some part of this treatise to thy thinking as yet be too light but consider better of it Omnia munda mundis four thousand four hundred fifty seven a naked man to a modest woman is no otherwise than a picture as Augusta Livia truly said and four thousand four hundred fifty eight mala mens malus animus tis as tis taken If in thy censure it be too light I advise thee as Lipsius did his reader for some places of Plautus istos quasi Sirenum scopulos praetervehare if they like thee not let them pass or oppose that which is good to that which is bad and reject not therefore all For to invert that verse of Martial and with Hierom Wolfius to apply it to my present purpose sunt mala sunt quaedam mediocria sunt bona plura some is good some bad some is indifferent I say further with him yet I have inserted four thousand four hundred fifty nine levicula quaedam et ridicula ascribere non sum gravatus circumforanea quaedam e theatris e plateis etiam e popinis some things more homely light or comical litans gratiis c which I would request every man to interpret to the best and as Julius Caesar Scaliger besought Cardan si quid urbaniuscule lusum a nobis per deos immortales te oro Hieronyme Cardane ne me male capias I beseech thee good reader not to mistake me or misconstrue what is here written Per Musas et Charites et omnia Poetarum numina benigne lector oro te ne me male capias Tis a comical subject in sober sadness I crave pardon of what is amiss and desire thee to suspend thy judgment wink at small faults or to be silent at least but if thou likest speak well of it and wish me good success Extremum hunc Arethusa mihi concede laborem four thousand four hundred sixty I am resolved howsoever velis nolis audacter stadium intrare in the Olympics with those Aeliensian wrestlers in Philostratus boldly to show myself in this common stage and in this tragicomedy of love to act several parts some satirically some comically some in a mixed tone as the subject I have in hand gives occasion and present scene shall require or offer itself SUBSECT II Love s Beginning Object Definition Division Love s limits are ample and great and a spacious walk it hath beset with thorns and for that cause which four thousand four hundred sixty one Scaliger reprehends in Cardan not lightly to be passed over Lest I incur the same censure one will examine all the kinds of love his nature beginning difference objects how it is honest or dishonest a virtue or vice a natural passion or a disease his power and effects how far it extends of which although something has been said in the first partition in those sections of perturbations four thousand four hundred sixty two for love and hatred are the first and most common passions from which all the rest arise and are attendant as Picolomineus holds or as Nich Caussinus the primum mobile of all other affections which carry them all about them I will now more copiously dilate through all his parts and several branches that so it may better appear what love is and how it varies with the objects how in defect or which is most ordinary and common immoderate and in excess causeth melancholy Love universally taken is defined to be a desire as a word of more ample signification and though Leon Hebreus the most copious writer of this subject in his third dialogue make no difference yet in his first he distinguisheth them again and defines love by desire four thousand four hundred sixty three Love is a voluntary affection and desire to enjoy that which is good four thousand four hundred sixty four Desire wisheth love enjoys the end of the one is the beginning of the other that which we love is present that which we desire is absent four thousand four hundred sixty five It is worth the labour saith Plotinus to consider well of love whether it be a god or a devil or passion of the mind or partly god partly devil partly passion He concludes love to participate of all three to arise from desire of that which is beautiful and fair and defines it to be an action of the mind desiring that which is good four thousand four hundred sixty six Plato calls it the great devil for its vehemency and sovereignty over all other passions and defines it an appetite four thousand four hundred sixty seven by which we desire some good to be present Ficinus in his comment adds the word fair to this definition Love is a desire of enjoying that which is good and fair Austin dilates this common definition and will have love to be a delectation of the heart four thousand four hundred sixty eight for something which we seek to win or joy to have coveting by desire resting in joy four thousand four hundred sixty nine Scaliger exerc three hundred one taxeth these former definitions and will not have love to be defined by desire or appetite for when we enjoy the things we desire there remains no more appetite as he defines it Love is an affection by which we are either united to the thing we love or perpetuate our union which agrees in part with Leon Hebreus Now this love varies as its object varies which is always good amiable fair gracious and pleasant four thousand four hundred seventy All things desire that which is good as we are taught in the Ethics or at least that which to them seems to be good quid enim vis mali as Austin well infers dic mihi puto nihil in omnibus actionibus thou wilt wish no harm I suppose no ill in all thine actions thoughts or desires nihil mali vis four thousand four hundred seventy one thou wilt not have bad corn bad soil a naughty tree but all good a good servant a good horse a good son a good friend a good neighbour a good wife From this goodness comes beauty from beauty grace and comeliness which result as so many rays from their good parts make us to love and so to covet it for were it not pleasing and gracious in our eyes we should not seek four thousand four hundred seventy two No man loves saith Aristotle nine mor cap five but he that was first delighted with comeliness and beauty As this fair object varies so doth our love for as Proclus holds Omne pulchrum amabile every fair thing is amiable and what we love is fair and gracious in our eyes or at least we do so apprehend and still esteem of it four thousand four hundred seventy three Amiableness is the object of love the scope and end is to obtain it for whose sake we love and which our mind covets to enjoy And it seems to us especially fair and good for good fair and unity cannot be separated Beauty shines Plato saith and by reason of its splendour and shining causeth admiration and the fairer the object is the more eagerly it is sought For as the same Plato defines it four thousand four hundred seventy four Beauty is a lively shining or glittering brightness resulting from effused good by ideas seeds reasons shadows stirring up our minds that by this good they may be united and made one Others will have beauty to be the perfection of the whole composition four thousand four hundred seventy five caused out of the congruous symmetry measure order and manner of parts and that comeliness which proceeds from this beauty is called grace and from thence all fair things are gracious For grace and beauty are so wonderfully annexed four thousand four hundred seventy six so sweetly and gently win our souls and strongly allure that they confound our judgment and cannot be distinguished Beauty and grace are like those beams and shinings that come from the glorious and divine sun which are diverse as they proceed from the diverse objects to please and affect our several senses four thousand four hundred seventy seven As the species of beauty are taken at our eyes ears or conceived in our inner soul as Plato disputes at large in his Dialogue de pulchro Phaedro Hyppias and after many sophistical errors confuted concludes that beauty is a grace in all things delighting the eyes ears and soul itself so that as Valesius infers hence whatsoever pleaseth our ears eyes and soul must needs be beautiful fair and delightsome to us four thousand four hundred seventy eight And nothing can more please our ears than music or pacify our minds Fair houses pictures orchards gardens fields a fair hawk a fair horse is most acceptable unto us whatsoever pleaseth our eyes and ears we call beautiful and fair four thousand four hundred seventy nine Pleasure belongeth to the rest of the senses but grace and beauty to these two alone As the objects vary and are diverse so they diversely affect our eyes ears and soul itself Which gives occasion to some to make so many several kinds of love as there be objects One beauty ariseth from God of which and divine love S Dionysius four thousand four hundred eighty with many fathers and neoterics have written just volumes De amore Dei as they term it many paraenetical discourses another from his creatures there is a beauty of the body a beauty of the soul a beauty from virtue formam martyrum Austin calls it quam videmus oculis animi which we see with the eyes of our mind which beauty as Tully saith if we could discern with these corporeal eyes admirabili sui amores excitaret would cause admirable affections and ravish our souls This other beauty which ariseth from those extreme parts and graces which proceed from gestures speeches several motions and proportions of creatures men and women especially from women which made those old poets put the three graces still in Venus company as attending on her and holding up her train are infinite almost and vary their names with their objects as love of money covetousness love of beauty lust immoderate desire of any pleasure concupiscence friendship love goodwill c and is either virtue or vice honest dishonest in excess defect as shall be showed in his place Heroical love religious love c which may be reduced to a twofold division according to the principal parts which are affected the brain and liver Amor et amicitia which Scaliger exercitat three hundred one Valesius and Melancthon warrant out of Plato Greek philein and Greek eran from that speech of Pausanias belike that makes two Veneres and two loves four thousand four hundred eighty one One Venus is ancient without a mother and descended from heaven whom we call celestial the younger begotten of Jupiter and Dione whom commonly we call Venus Ficinus in his comment upon this place cap eight following Plato calls these two loves two devils four thousand four hundred eighty two or good and bad angels according to us which are still hovering about our souls four thousand four hundred eighty three The one rears to heaven the other depresseth us to hell the one good which stirs us up to the contemplation of that divine beauty for whose sake we perform justice and all godly offices study philosophy c the other base and though bad yet to be respected for indeed both are good in their own natures procreation of children is as necessary as that finding out of truth but therefore called bad because it is abused and withdraws our souls from the speculation of that other to viler objects so far Ficinus S Austin lib fifteen de civ Dei et sup Psal lxiv hath delivered as much in effect four thousand four hundred eighty four Every creature is good and may be loved well or ill and four thousand four hundred eighty five Two cities make two loves Jerusalem and Babylon the love of God the one the love of the world the other of these two cities we all are citizens as by examination of ourselves we may soon find and of which The one love is the root of all mischief the other of all good So in his fifteen cap lib de amor Ecclesiae he will have those four cardinal virtues to be nought else but love rightly composed in his fifteen book de civ Dei cap twenty two he calls virtue the order of love whom Thomas following one part two quaest fifty five art one and quaest fifty six three quaest sixty two art two confirms as much and amplifies in many words four thousand four hundred eighty six Lucian to the same purpose hath a division of his own One love was born in the sea which is as various and raging in young men s breasts as the sea itself and causeth burning lust the other is that golden chain which was let down from heaven and with a divine fury ravisheth our souls made to the image of God and stirs us up to comprehend the innate and incorruptible beauty to which we were once created Beroaldus hath expressed all this in an epigram of his Dogmata divini memorant si vera Platonis Sunt geminae Veneres et geminatus amor Coelestis Venus est nullo generata parente Quae casto sanctos nectit amore viros Altera sed Venus est totum vulgata per orbem Quae divum mentes alligat atque hominum Improba seductrix petulans c If divine Plato s tenets they be true Two Veneres two loves there be The one from heaven unbegotten still Which knits our souls in unity The other famous over all the world Binding the hearts of gods and men Dishonest wanton and seducing she Rules whom she will both where and when This twofold division of love Origen likewise follows in his Comment on the Canticles one from God the other from the devil as he holds understanding it in the worse sense which many others repeat and imitate Both which to omit all subdivisions in excess or defect as they are abused or degenerate cause melancholy in a particular kind as shall be shown in his place Austin in another Tract makes a threefold division of this love which we may use well or ill four thousand four hundred eighty seven God our neighbour and the world God above us our neighbour next us the world beneath us In the course of our desires God hath three things the world one our neighbour two Our desire to God is either from God with God or to God and ordinarily so runs From God when it receives from him whence and for which it should love him with God when it contradicts his will in nothing to God when it seeks to him and rests itself in him Our love to our neighbour may proceed from him and run with him not to him from him as when we rejoice of his good safety and well doing with him when we desire to have him a fellow and companion of our journey in the way of the Lord not in him because there is no aid hope or confidence in man From the world our love comes when we begin to admire the Creator in his works and glorify God in his creatures with the world it should run if according to the mutability of all temporalities it should be dejected in adversity or over elevated in prosperity to the world if it would settle itself in its vain delights and studies Many such partitions of love I could repeat and subdivisions but least which Scaliger objects to Cardan Exercitat five hundred one four thousand four hundred eighty eight I confound filthy burning lust with pure and divine love I will follow that accurate division of Leon Hebreus dial two betwixt Sophia and Philo where he speaks of natural sensible and rational love and handleth each apart Natural love or hatred is that sympathy or antipathy which is to be seen in animate and inanimate creatures in the four elements metals stones gravia tendunt deorsum as a stone to his centre fire upward and rivers to the sea The sun moon and stars go still around four thousand four hundred eighty nine Amantes naturae debita exercere for love of perfection This love is manifest I say in inanimate creatures How comes a loadstone to draw iron to it jet chaff the ground to covet showers but for love No creature S Hierom concludes is to be found quod non aliquid amat no stock no stone that hath not some feeling of love Tis more eminent in plants herbs and is especially observed in vegetables as between the vine and elm a great sympathy between the vine and the cabbage between the vine and the olive four thousand four hundred ninety Virgo fugit Bromium between the vine and bays a great antipathy the vine loves not the bay four thousand four hundred ninety one nor his smell and will kill him if he grow near him the bur and the lentil cannot endure one another the olive four thousand four hundred ninety two and the myrtle embrace each other in roots and branches if they grow near Read more of this in

with every astrologer Leon Hebreus gives many fabulous reasons and moraliseth them withal Sensible love is that of brute beasts of which the same Leon Hebreus dial two assigns these causes First for the pleasure they take in the act of generation male and female love one another Secondly for the preservation of the species and desire of young brood Thirdly for the mutual agreement as being of the same kind Sus sui canis cani bos bovi et asinus asino pulcherrimus videtur as Epicharmus held and according to that adage of Diogenianus Adsidet usque graculus apud graculum they much delight in one another s company four thousand four hundred ninety three Formicae grata est formica cicada cicadae and birds of a feather will gather together Fourthly for custom use and familiarity as if a dog be trained up with a lion and a bear contrary to their natures they will love each other Hawks dogs horses love their masters and keepers many stories I could relate in this kind but see Gillius de hist anim lib three cap fourteen those two Epistles of Lipsius of dogs and horses Agellius c Fifthly for bringing up as if a bitch bring up a kid a hen ducklings a hedge sparrow a cuckoo c The third kind is Amor cognitionis as Leon calls it rational love Intellectivus amor and is proper to men on which I must insist This appears in God angels men God is love itself the fountain of love the disciple of love as Plato styles him the servant of peace the God of love and peace have peace with all men and God is with you four thousand four hundred ninety four Quisquis veneratur Olympum Ipse sibi mundum subjicit atque Deum four thousand four hundred ninety five By this love saith Gerson we purchase heaven and buy the kingdom of God This four thousand four hundred ninety six love is either in the Trinity itself for the Holy Ghost is the love of the Father and the Son c John iii thirty five and v twenty and xiv thirty one or towards us his creatures as in making the world Amor mundum fecit love built cities mundi anima invented arts sciences and all four thousand four hundred ninety seven good things incites us to virtue and humanity combines and quickens keeps peace on earth quietness by sea mirth in the winds and elements expels all fear anger and rusticity Circulus a bono in bonum a round circle still from good to good for love is the beginner and end of all our actions the efficient and instrumental cause as our poets in their symbols impresses four thousand four hundred ninety eight emblems of rings squares c shadow unto us Si rerum quaeris fuerit quis finis et ortus Desine nam causa est unica solus amor If first and last of anything you wit Cease love s the sole and only cause of it Love saith four thousand four hundred ninety nine Leo made the world and afterwards in redeeming of it God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son for it John iii sixteen Behold what love the Father hath showed on us that we should be called the sons of God one John iii one Or by His sweet Providence in protecting of it either all in general or His saints elect and church in particular whom He keeps as the apple of His eye whom He loves freely as Hosea xiv five speaks and dearly respects four thousand five hundred Charior est ipsis homo quam sibi Not that we are fair nor for any merit or grace of ours for we are most vile and base but out of His incomparable love and goodness out of His Divine Nature And this is that Homer s golden chain which reacheth down from heaven to earth by which every creature is annexed and depends on his Creator He made all saith four thousand five hundred one Moses and it was good He loves it as good The love of angels and living souls is mutual amongst themselves towards us militant in the church and all such as love God as the sunbeams irradiate the earth from those celestial thrones they by their well wishes reflect on us four thousand five hundred two in salute hominum promovenda alacres et constantes administri there is joy in heaven for every sinner that repenteth they pray for us are solicitous for our good four thousand five hundred three Casti genii four thousand five hundred four Ubi regnat charitas suave desiderium Laetitiaque et amor Deo conjunctus Love proper to mortal men is the third member of this subdivision and the subject of my following discourse MEMB II SUBSECT I Love of Men which varies as his Objects Profitable Pleasant Honest Valesius lib three contr thirteen defines this love which is in men to be four thousand five hundred five an affection of both powers appetite and reason The rational resides in the brain the other in the liver as before hath been said out of Plato and others the heart is diversely affected of both and carried a thousand ways by consent The sensitive faculty most part overrules reason the soul is carried hoodwinked and the understanding captive like a beast four thousand five hundred six The heart is variously inclined sometimes they are merry sometimes sad and from love arise hope and fear jealousy fury desperation Now this love of men is diverse and varies as the object varies by which they are enticed as virtue wisdom eloquence profit wealth money fame honour or comeliness of person c Leon Hubreus in his first dialogue reduceth them all to these three utile jucundum honestum profitable pleasant honest out of Aristotle belike eight moral of which he discourseth at large and whatsoever is beautiful and fair is referred to them or any way to be desired four thousand five hundred seven To profitable is ascribed health wealth honour c which is rather ambition desire covetousness than love friends children love of women four thousand five hundred eight all delightful and pleasant objects are referred to the second The love of honest things consists in virtue and wisdom and is preferred before that which is profitable and pleasant intellectual about that which is honest four thousand five hundred nine saint Austin calls profitable worldly pleasant carnal honest spiritual four thousand five hundred ten Of and from all three result charity friendship and true love which respects God and our neighbour Of each of these I will briefly dilate and show in what sort they cause melancholy Amongst all these fair enticing objects which procure love and bewitch the soul of man there is none so moving so forcible as profit and that which carrieth with it a show of commodity Health indeed is a precious thing to recover and preserve which we will undergo any misery drink bitter potions freely give our goods restore a man to his health his purse lies open to thee bountiful he is thankful and beholding to thee but give him wealth and honour give him gold or what shall be for his advantage and preferment and thou shalt command his affections oblige him eternally to thee heart hand life and all is at thy service thou art his dear and loving friend good and gracious lord and master his Mecaenas he is thy slave thy vassal most devote affectioned and bound in all duty tell him good tidings in this kind there spoke an angel a blessed hour that brings in gain he is thy creature and thou his creator he hugs and admires thee he is thine for ever No loadstone so attractive as that of profit none so fair an object as this of gold four thousand five hundred eleven nothing wins a man sooner than a good turn bounty and liberality command body and soul Munera crede mihi placant hominesque deosque Placatur donis Jupiter ipse datis Good turns doth pacify both God and men And Jupiter himself is won by them Gold of all other is a most delicious object a sweet light a goodly lustre it hath gratius aurum quam solem intuemur saith Austin and we had rather see it than the sun Sweet and pleasant in getting in keeping it seasons all our labours intolerable pains we take for it base employments endure bitter flouts and taunts long journeys heavy burdens all are made light and easy by this hope of gain At mihi plaudo ipse domi simul ac nummos contemplor in arca The sight of gold refresheth our spirits and ravisheth our hearts as that Babylonian garment and four thousand five hundred twelve golden wedge did Achan in the camp the very sight and hearing sets on fire his soul with desire of it It will make a man run to the antipodes or tarry at home and turn parasite lie flatter prostitute himself swear and bear false witness he will venture his body kill a king murder his father and damn his soul to come at it Formosior auri massa as four thousand five hundred thirteen he well observed the mass of gold is fairer than all your Grecian pictures that Apelles Phidias or any doting painter could ever make we are enamoured with it four thousand five hundred fourteen Prima fere vota et cunctis notissima templis Divitiae ut crescant All our labours studies endeavours vows prayers and wishes are to get how to compass it four thousand five hundred fifteen Haec est illa cui famulatur maximus orbis Diva potens rerum domitrixque pecunia fati This is the great goddess we adore and worship this is the sole object of our desire If we have it as we think we are made for ever thrice happy princes lords c If we lose it we are dull heavy dejected discontent miserable desperate and mad Our estate and bene esse ebbs and flows with our commodity and as we are endowed or enriched so are we beloved and esteemed it lasts no longer than our wealth when that is gone and the object removed farewell friendship as long as bounty good cheer and rewards were to be hoped friends enough they were tied to thee by the teeth and would follow thee as crows do a carcass but when thy goods are gone and spent the lamp of their love is out and thou shalt be contemned scorned hated injured four thousand five hundred sixteen Lucian s Timon when he lived in prosperity was the sole spectacle of Greece only admired who but Timon Everybody loved honoured applauded him each man offered him his service and sought to be kin to him but when his gold was spent his fair possessions gone farewell Timon none so ugly none so deformed so odious an object as Timon no man so ridiculous on a sudden they gave him a penny to buy a rope no man would know him Tis the general humour of the world commodity steers our affections throughout we love those that are fortunate and rich that thrive or by whom we may receive mutual kindness hope for like courtesies get any good gain or profit hate those and abhor on the other side which are poor and miserable or by whom we may sustain loss or inconvenience And even those that were now familiar and dear unto us our loving and long friends neighbours kinsmen allies with whom we have conversed and lived as so many Geryons for some years past striving still to give one another all good content and entertainment with mutual invitations feastings disports offices for whom we would ride run spend ourselves and of whom we have so freely and honourably spoken to whom we have given all those turgent titles and magnificent eulogiums most excellent and most noble worthy wise grave learned valiant c and magnified beyond measure if any controversy arise between us some trespass injury abuse some part of our goods be detained a piece of land come to be litigious if they cross us in our suit or touch the string of our commodity we detest and depress them upon a sudden neither affinity consanguinity or old acquaintance can contain us but four thousand five hundred seventeen rupto jecore exierit Caprificus A golden apple sets altogether by the ears as if a marrowbone or honeycomb were flung amongst bears father and son brother and sister kinsmen are at odds and look what malice deadly hatred can invent that shall be done Terrible dirum pestilens atrox ferum mutual injuries desire of revenge and how to hurt them him and his are all our studies If our pleasures be interrupt we can tolerate it our bodies hurt we can put it up and be reconciled but touch our commodities we are most impatient fair becomes foul the graces are turned to harpies friendly salutations to bitter imprecations mutual feastings to plotting villainies minings and counterminings good words to satires and invectives we revile e contra nought but his imperfections are in our eyes he is a base knave a devil a monster a caterpillar a viper a hog rubber c Desinit in piscem mulier formosa superne four thousand five hundred eighteen the scene is altered on a sudden love is turned to hate mirth to melancholy so furiously are we most part bent our affections fixed upon this object of commodity and upon money the desire of which in excess is covetousness ambition tyranniseth over our souls as four thousand five hundred nineteen I have shown and in defect crucifies as much as if a man by negligence ill husbandry improvidence prodigality waste and consume his goods and fortunes beggary follows and melancholy he becomes an abject four thousand five hundred twenty odious and worse than an infidel in not providing for his family SUBSECT II Pleasant Objects of Love Pleasant objects are infinite whether they be such as have life or be without life inanimate are countries provinces towers towns cities as he said four thousand five hundred twenty one Pulcherrimam insulam videmus etiam cum non videmus we see a fair island by description when we see it not The four thousand five hundred twenty two sun never saw a fairer city Thessala Tempe orchards gardens pleasant walks groves fountains c The heaven itself is said to be four thousand five hundred twenty three fair or foul fair buildings four thousand five hundred twenty four fair pictures all artificial elaborate and curious works clothes give an admirable lustre we admire and gaze upon them ut pueri Junonis avem as children do on a peacock a fair dog a fair horse and hawk c four thousand five hundred twenty five Thessalus amat equum pullinum buculum Aegyptius Lacedaemonius Catulum c such things we love are most gracious in our sight acceptable unto us and whatsoever else may cause this passion if it be superfluous or immoderately loved as Guianerius observes These things in themselves are pleasing and good singular ornaments necessary comely and fit to be had but when we fix an immoderate eye and dote on them over much this pleasure may turn to pain bring much sorrow and discontent unto us work our final overthrow and cause melancholy in the end Many are carried away with those bewitching sports of gaming hawking hunting and such vain pleasures as four thousand five hundred twenty six I have said some with immoderate desire of fame to be crowned in the Olympics knighted in the field c and by these means ruinate themselves The lascivious dotes on his fair mistress the glutton on his dishes which are infinitely varied to please the palate the epicure on his several pleasures the superstitious on his idol and fats himself with future joys as Turks feed themselves with an imaginary persuasion of a sensual paradise so several pleasant objects diversely affect diverse men But the fairest objects and enticings proceed from men themselves which most frequently captivate allure and make them dote beyond all measure upon one another and that for many respects first as some suppose by that secret force of stars quod me tibi temperat astrum They do singularly dote on such a man hate such again and can give no reason for it four thousand five hundred twenty seven Non amo te Sabidi c Alexander admired Ephestion Adrian Antinous Nero Sporus c The physicians refer this to their temperament astrologers to trine and sextile aspects or opposite of their several ascendants lords of their genitures love and hatred of planets four thousand five hundred twenty eight Cicogna to concord and discord of spirits but most to outward graces A merry companion is welcome and acceptable to all men and therefore saith four thousand five hundred twenty nine Gomesius princes and great men entertain jesters and players commonly in their courts But four thousand five hundred thirty Pares cum paribus facillime congregantur tis that four thousand five hundred thirty one similitude of manners which ties most men in an inseparable link as if they be addicted to the same studies or disports they delight in one another s companies birds of a feather will gather together if they be of divers inclinations or opposite in manners they can seldom agree Secondly four thousand five hundred thirty two affability custom and familiarity may convert nature many times though they be different in manners as if they be countrymen fellow students colleagues or have been fellow soldiers four thousand five hundred thirty three brethren in affliction four thousand five hundred thirty four acerba calamitatum societas diversi etiam ingenii homines conjungit affinity or some such accidental occasion though they cannot agree amongst themselves they will stick together like burrs and bold against a third so after some discontinuance or death enmity ceaseth or in a foreign place Pascitur in vivis livor post fata quiescit Et cecidere odia et tristes mors obruit iras A third cause of love and hate may be mutual offices acceptum beneficium four thousand five hundred thirty five commend him use him kindly take his part in a quarrel relieve him in his misery thou winnest him for ever do the opposite and be sure of a perpetual enemy Praise and dispraise of each other do as much though unknown as four thousand five hundred thirty six Schoppius by Scaliger and Casaubonus mulus mulum scabit who but Scaliger with him what encomiums epithets eulogiums Antistes sapientiae perpetuus dictator literarum ornamentum Europae miraculum noble Scaliger four thousand five hundred thirty seven incredibilis ingenii praestantia c diis potius quam hominibus per omnia comparandus scripta ejus aurea ancylia de coelo delapsa poplitibus veneramur flexis c four thousand five hundred thirty eight but when they began to vary none so absurd as Scaliger so vile and base as his books de Burdonum familia and other satirical invectives may witness Ovid in Ibin Archilocus himself was not so bitter Another great tie or cause of love is consanguinity parents are clear to their children children to their parents brothers and sisters cousins of all sorts as a hen and chickens all of a knot every crow thinks her own bird fairest Many memorable examples are in this kind and tis portenti simile if they do not four thousand five hundred thirty nine a mother cannot forget her child Solomon so found out the true owner love of parents may not be concealed tis natural descends and they that are inhuman in this kind are unworthy of that air they breathe and of the four elements yet many unnatural examples we have in this rank of hard hearted parents disobedient children of four thousand five hundred forty disagreeing brothers nothing so common The love of kinsmen is grown cold four thousand five hundred forty one many kinsmen as the saying is few friends if thine estate be good and thou able par pari referre to requite their kindness there will be mutual correspondence otherwise thou art a burden most odious to them above all others The last object that ties man and man is comeliness of person and beauty alone as men love women with a wanton eye which Greek kat exochaen is termed heroical or love melancholy Other loves saith Picolomineus are so called with some contraction as the love of wine gold c but this of women is predominant in a higher strain whose part affected is the liver and this love deserves a longer explication and shall be dilated apart in the next section SUBSECT III Honest Objects of Love Beauty is the common object of all love four thousand five hundred forty two as jet draws a straw so doth beauty love virtue and honesty are great motives and give as fair a lustre as the rest especially if they be sincere and right not fucate but proceeding from true form and an incorrupt judgment those two Venus twins Eros and Anteros are then most firm and fast For many times otherwise men are deceived by their flattering gnathos dissembling camelions outsides hypocrites that make a show of great love learning pretend honesty virtue zeal modesty with affected looks and counterfeit gestures feigned protestations often steal away the hearts and favours of men and deceive them specie virtutis et umbra when as revera and indeed there is no worth or honesty at all in them no truth but mere hypocrisy subtlety knavery and the like As true friends they are as he that Caelius Secundus met by the highway side and hard it is in this temporising age to distinguish such companions or to find them out Such gnathos as these for the most part belong to great men and by this glozing flattery affability and such like philters so dive and insinuate into their favours that they are taken for men of excellent worth wisdom learning demigods and so screw themselves into dignities honours offices but these men cause harsh confusion often and as many times stirs as Rehoboam s counsellors in a commonwealth overthrew themselves and others Tandlerus and some authors make a doubt whether love and hatred may be compelled by philters or characters Cardan and Marbodius by precious stones and amulets astrologers by election of times c as four thousand five hundred forty three I shall elsewhere discuss The true object of this honest love is virtue wisdom honesty four thousand five hundred forty four real worth Interna forma and this love cannot deceive or be compelled ut ameris amabilis esto love itself is the most potent philtrum virtue and wisdom gratia gratum faciens the sole and only grace not counterfeit but open honest simple naked four thousand five hundred forty five descending from heaven as our apostle hath it an infused habit from God which hath given several gifts as wit learning tongues for which they shall be amiable and gracious Eph iv eleven as to Saul stature and a goodly presence one Sam ix one Joseph found favour in Pharaoh s court general xxxix for four thousand five hundred forty six his person and Daniel with the princes of the eunuchs Dan xix nineteen Christ was gracious with God and men Luke ii fifty two There is still some peculiar grace as of good discourse eloquence wit honesty which is the primum mobile first mover and a most forcible loadstone to draw the favours and good wills of men s eyes ears and affections unto them When Jesus spake they were all astonished at his answers Luke ii forty seven and wondered at his gracious words which proceeded from his mouth An orator steals away the hearts of men and as another Orpheus quo vult unde vult he pulls them to him by speech alone a sweet voice causeth admiration and he that can utter himself in good words in our ordinary phrase is called a proper man a divine spirit For which cause belike our old poets Senatus populusque poetarum made Mercury the gentleman usher to the Graces captain of eloquence and those charities to be Jupiter s and Eurymone s daughters descended from above Though they be otherwise deformed crooked ugly to behold those good parts of the mind denominate them fair Plato commends the beauty of Socrates yet who was more grim of countenance stern and ghastly to look upon So are and have been many great philosophers as four thousand five hundred forty seven Gregory Nazianzen observes deformed most part in that which is to be seen with the eyes but most elegant in that which is not to be seen Saepe sub attrita latitat sapientia veste Aesop Democritus Aristotle Politianus Melancthon Gesner c withered old men Sileni Alcibiadis very harsh and impolite to the eye but who were so terse polite eloquent generally learned temperate and modest No man then living was so fair as Alcibiades so lovely quo ad superficiem to the eye as four thousand five hundred forty eight Boethius observes but he had Corpus turpissimum interne a most deformed soul honesty virtue fair conditions are great enticers to such as are well given and much avail to get the favour and goodwill of men Abdolominus in Curtius a poor man but which mine author notes four thousand five hundred forty nine the cause of this poverty was his honesty for his modesty and continency from a private person for they found him digging in his garden was saluted king and preferred before all the magnificoes of his time injecta ei vestis purpura auroque distincta a purple embroidered garment was put upon him four thousand five hundred fifty and they bade him wash himself and as he was worthy take upon him the style and spirit of a king continue his continency and the rest of his good parts Titus Pomponius Atticus that noble citizen of Rome was so fair conditioned of so sweet a carriage that he was generally beloved of all good men of Caesar Pompey Antony Tully of divers sects c multas haereditates four thousand five hundred fifty one Cornelius Nepos writes sola bonitate consequutus Operae pretium audire c It is worthy of your attention Livy cries four thousand five hundred fifty two you that scorn all but riches and give no esteem to virtue except they be wealthy withal Q Cincinnatus had but four acres and by the consent of the senate was chosen dictator of Rome Of such account were Cato Fabricius Aristides Antonius Probus for their eminent worth so Caesar Trajan Alexander admired for valour four thousand five hundred fifty three Haephestion loved Alexander but Parmenio the king Titus deliciae humani generis and which Aurelius Victor hath of Vespasian the darling of his time as four thousand five hundred fifty four Edgar Etheling was in England for his four thousand five hundred fifty five excellent virtues their memory is yet fresh sweet and we love them many ages after though they be dead Suavem memoriam sui reliquit saith Lipsius of his friend living and dead they are all one four thousand five hundred fifty six I have ever loved as thou knowest so Tully wrote to Dolabella Marcus Brutus for his great wit singular honesty constancy sweet conditions and believe it four thousand five hundred fifty seven there is nothing so amiable and fair as virtue I four thousand five hundred fifty eight do mightily love Calvisinus so Pliny writes to Sossius a most industrious eloquent upright man which is all in all with me the affection came from his good parts And as saint Austin comments on the eighty fourth Psalm four thousand five hundred fifty nine there is a peculiar beauty of justice and inward beauty which we see with the eyes of our hearts love and are enamoured with as in martyrs though their bodies be torn in pieces with wild beasts yet this beauty shines and we love their virtues The four thousand five hundred sixty stoics are of opinion that a wise man is only fair and Cato in Tully three de Finibus contends the same that the lineaments of the mind are far fairer than those of the body incomparably beyond them wisdom and valour according to four thousand five hundred sixty one Xenophon especially deserve the name of beauty and denominate one fair et incomparabiliter pulchrior est as Austin holds veritas Christianorum quam Helena Graecorum Wine is strong the king is strong women are strong but truth overcometh all things Esd i three ten eleven twelve Blessed is the man that findeth wisdom and getteth understanding for the merchandise thereof is better than silver and the gain thereof better than gold it is more precious than pearls and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared to her Prov ii thirteen fourteen fifteen a wise true just upright and good man I say it again is only fair four thousand five hundred sixty two it is reported of Magdalene Queen of France and wife to Lewis eleventh a Scottish woman by birth that walking forth in an evening with her ladies she spied M Alanus one of the king s chaplains a silly old four thousand five hundred sixty three hard favoured man fast asleep in a bower and kissed him sweetly when the young ladies laughed at her for it she replied that it was not his person that she did embrace and reverence but with a platonic love the divine beauty of four thousand five hundred sixty four his soul Thus in all ages virtue hath been adored admired a singular lustre hath proceeded from it and the more virtuous he is the more gracious the more admired No man so much followed upon earth as Christ himself and as the Psalmist saith xlv two He was fairer than the sons of men Chrysostom Hom eight in Mat Bernard Ser one de omnibus sanctis Austin Cassiodore Hier in nine Mat interpret it of the four thousand five hundred sixty five beauty of his person there was a divine majesty in his looks it shined like lightning and drew all men to it but Basil Cyril lib six super fifty five Esay Theodoret Arnobius c of the beauty of his divinity justice grace eloquence c Thomas in Psal xliv of both and so doth Baradius and Peter Morales lib de pulchritud Jesu et Mariae adding as much of Joseph and the Virgin Mary haec alias forma praecesserit omnes four thousand five hundred sixty six according to that prediction of Sibylla Cumea Be they present or absent near us or afar off this beauty shines and will attract men many miles to come and visit it Plato and Pythagoras left their country to see those wise Egyptian priests Apollonius travelled into Ethiopia Persia to consult with the Magi Brachmanni gymnosophists The Queen of Sheba came to visit Solomon and many saith four thousand five hundred sixty seven Hierom went out of Spain and remote places a thousand miles to behold that eloquent Livy four thousand five hundred sixty eight Multi Romam non ut urbem pulcherrimam aut urbis et orbis dominum Octavianum sed ut hunc unum inviserent audirentque a Gadibus profecti sunt No beauty leaves such an impression strikes so deep four thousand five hundred sixty nine or links the souls of men closer than virtue four thousand five hundred seventy Non per deos aut pictor posset Aut statuarius ullus fingere Talem pulchritudinem qualem virtus habet no painter no graver no carver can express virtue s lustre or those admirable rays that come from it those enchanting rays that enamour posterity those everlasting rays that continue to the world s end Many saith Phavorinus that loved and admired Alcibiades in his youth knew not cared not for Alcibiades a man nunc intuentes quaerebant Alcibiadem but the beauty of Socrates is still the same four thousand five hundred seventy one virtue s lustre never fades is ever fresh and green semper viva to all succeeding ages and a most attractive loadstone to draw and combine such as are present For that reason belike Homer feigns the three Graces to be linked and tied hand in hand because the hearts of men are so firmly united with such graces four thousand five hundred seventy two O sweet bands Seneca exclaims which so happily combine that those which are bound by them love their binders desiring withal much more harder to be bound and as so

of this comeliness and beauty which proceeds from women that causeth heroical or love melancholy is more eminent above the rest and properly called love The part affected in men is the liver and therefore called heroical because commonly gallants Noblemen and the most generous spirits are possessed with it His power and extent is very large four thousand six hundred thirty and in that twofold division of love Greek philein and Greek eran four thousand six hundred thirty one those two veneries which Plato and some other make mention of it is most eminent and Greek kat exochaen called Venus as I have said or love itself Which although it be denominated from men and most evident in them yet it extends and shows itself in vegetal and sensible creatures those incorporeal substances as shall be specified and hath a large dominion of sovereignty over them His pedigree is very ancient derived from the beginning of the world as four thousand six hundred thirty two Phaedrus contends and his four thousand six hundred thirty three parentage of such antiquity that no poet could ever find it out Hesiod makes four thousand six hundred thirty four Terra and Chaos to be Love s parents before the Gods were born Ante deos omnes primum generavit amorem Some think it is the self same fire Prometheus fetched from heaven Plutarch amator libello will have Love to be the son of Iris and Favonius but Socrates in that pleasant dialogue of Plato when it came to his turn to speak of love of which subject Agatho the rhetorician magniloquus Agatho that chanter Agatho had newly given occasion in a poetical strain telleth this tale when Venus was born all the gods were invited to a banquet and amongst the rest four thousand six hundred thirty five Porus the god of bounty and wealth Penia or Poverty came a begging to the door Porus well whittled with nectar for there was no wine in those days walking in Jupiter s garden in a bower met with Penia and in his drink got her with child of whom was born Love and because he was begotten on Venus s birthday Venus still attends upon him The moral of this is in four thousand six hundred thirty six Ficinus Another tale is there borrowed out of Aristophanes four thousand six hundred thirty seven in the beginning of the world men had four arms and four feet but for their pride because they compared themselves with the gods were parted into halves and now peradventure by love they hope to be united again and made one Otherwise thus four thousand six hundred thirty eight Vulcan met two lovers and bid them ask what they would and they should have it but they made answer O Vulcane faber Deorum c O Vulcan the gods great smith we beseech thee to work us anew in thy furnace and of two make us one which he presently did and ever since true lovers are either all one or else desire to be united Many such tales you shall find in Leon Hebreus dial three and their moral to them The reason why Love was still painted young as Phornutus four thousand six hundred thirty nine and others will four thousand six hundred forty is because young men are most apt to love soft fair and fat because such folks are soonest taken naked because all true affection is simple and open he smiles because merry and given to delights hath a quiver to show his power none can escape is blind because he sees not where he strikes whom he hits c His power and sovereignty is expressed by the four thousand six hundred forty one poets in that he is held to be a god and a great commanding god above Jupiter himself Magnus Daemon as Plato calls him the strongest and merriest of all the gods according to Alcinous and four thousand six hundred forty two Athenaeus Amor virorum rex amor rex et deum as Euripides the god of gods and governor of men for we must all do homage to him keep a holiday for his deity adore in his temples worship his image numen enim hoc non est nudum nomen and sacrifice to his altar that conquers all and rules all four

is so powerful enforceth four thousand six hundred forty four all to pay tribute to him domineers over all and can make mad and sober whom he list insomuch that Caecilius in Tully s Tusculans holds him to be no better than a fool or an idiot that doth not acknowledge Love to be a great god four thousand six hundred forty five Cui in manu sit quem esse dementem velit Quem sapere quam in morbum

though Aristophanes degrade him and say that he was four thousand six hundred forty seven scornfully rejected from the council of the gods had his wings clipped besides that he might come no more amongst them and to his farther disgrace banished heaven for ever and confined to dwell on earth yet he is of that four thousand six hundred forty eight power majesty omnipotency and dominion that no

triumph of Love and Fracastorius in an elegant poem expresseth at large Cupid riding Mars and Apollo following his chariot Psyche weeping c In vegetal creatures what sovereignty love hath by many pregnant proofs and familiar examples may be proved especially of palm trees which are both he and she and express not a sympathy but a love passion and by many observations have been confirmed four

Philostratus in Imaginibus observes as much and Galen lib six de locis affectis cap five they will be sick for love ready to die and pine away which the husbandmen perceiving saith four thousand six

to the stem of the other will make them both flourish and prosper a great deal better four thousand six hundred sixty one which are enamoured they can perceive by the bending of boughs and inclination

Assyria so affected towards one of my men that it cannot be denied but that he was in love with him When my man was present the beast would use many notable enticements and pleasant motions and when he was going hold him back and look after him when he was gone very sad in his absence but most jocund when he returned and when my man went from me the beast expressed his love with continual sickness and after he had pined away some few days died Such another story he hath of a crane of Majorca that loved a Spaniard that would walk any way with him and in his absence seek about for him

Scottish history hath three or four such examples which Cardan confirms out of him lib sixteen cap forty three of such as have had familiar company many years with them and that in the habit of men and women Philostratus in his fourth book de vita Apollonii hath a memorable instance in this kind which I may not omit of one Menippus Lycius a young man twenty five years of age that going between Cenchreas and Corinth met such a phantasm in the habit of a fair gentlewoman which taking him by the hand carried him home to her house in the suburbs of Corinth and told him she was a Phoenician by birth and if he would tarry with her four thousand six hundred seventy six he should hear her sing and play and drink such wine as never any drank and no man should molest him but she being fair and lovely would live and die with him that was fair and lovely to behold The young man a philosopher otherwise staid and discreet able to moderate his passions though not this of love tarried with her awhile to his great content and at last married her to whose wedding amongst other guests came Apollonius who by some probable conjectures found her out to be a serpent a lamia and that all her furniture was like Tantalus s gold described by Homer no substance but mere illusions When she saw herself descried she wept and desired Apollonius to be silent but he would not be moved and thereupon she plate house and all that was in it vanished in an instant four thousand six hundred seventy seven many thousands took notice of this fact for it was done in the midst of Greece Sabine in his Comment on the tenth of Ovid s Metamorphoses at the tale of Orpheus telleth us of a gentleman of Bavaria that for many months together bewailed the loss of his dear wife at length the devil in her habit came and comforted him and told him because he was so importunate for her that she would come and live with him again on that condition he would be new married never swear and blaspheme as he used formerly to do for if he did she should be gone four thousand six hundred seventy eight he vowed it married and lived with her she brought him children and governed his house but was still pale and sad and so continued till one day falling out with him he fell a swearing she vanished thereupon and was never after seen four thousand six hundred seventy nine This I have heard saith Sabine from persons of good credit which told me that the Duke of Bavaria did tell it for a certainty to the Duke of Saxony One more I will relate out of Florilegus ad annum ten fifty eight an honest historian of our nation because he telleth it so confidently as a thing in those days talked of all over Europe a young gentleman of Rome the same day that he was married after dinner with the bride and his friends went a walking into the fields and towards evening to the tennis court to recreate himself whilst he played he put his ring upon the finger of Venus statua which was thereby made in brass after he had sufficiently played and now made an end of his sport he came to fetch his ring but Venus had bowed her finger in and he could not get it off Whereupon loath to make his company tarry at present there left it intending to fetch it the next day or at some more convenient time went thence to supper and so to bed In the night when he should come to perform those nuptial rites Venus steps between him and his wife unseen or felt of her and told her that she was his wife that he had betrothed himself unto her by that ring which he put upon her finger she troubled him for some following nights He not knowing how to help himself made his moan to one Palumbus a learned magician in those days who gave him a letter and bid him at such a time of the night in such a cross way at the town s end where old Saturn would pass by with his associates in procession as commonly he did deliver that script with his own hands to Saturn himself the young man of a bold spirit accordingly did it and when the old fiend had read it he called Venus to him who rode before him and commanded her to deliver his ring which forthwith she did and so the gentleman was freed Many such stories I find in several four thousand six hundred eighty authors to confirm this which I have said as that more notable amongst the rest of Philinium and Machates in four thousand six hundred eighty one Phlegon s Tract de rebus mirabilibus and though many be against it yet I for my part will subscribe to Lactantius lib fourteen cap fifteen four thousand six hundred eighty two God sent angels to the tuition of men but whilst they lived amongst us that mischievous all commander of the earth and hot in lust enticed them by little and little to this vice and defiled them with the company of women and to Anaxagoras de resurrect four thousand six hundred eighty three Many of those spiritual bodies overcome by the love of maids and lust failed of whom those were born we call giants Justin Martyr Clemens Alexandrinus Sulpicius Severus Eusebius et cetera to this sense make a twofold fall of angels one from the beginning of the world another a little before the deluge as Moses teacheth us four thousand six hundred eighty four openly professing that these genii can beget and have carnal copulation with women At Japan in the East Indies at this present if we may believe the relation of four thousand six hundred eighty five travellers there is an idol called Teuchedy to whom one of the fairest virgins in the country is monthly brought and left in a private room in the fotoqui or church where she sits alone to be deflowered At certain times four thousand six hundred eighty six the Teuchedy which is thought to be the devil appears to her and knoweth her carnally Every month a fair virgin is taken in but what becomes of the old no man can tell In that goodly temple of Jupiter Belus in Babylon there was a fair chapel four thousand six hundred eighty seven saith Herodotus an eyewitness of it in which was splendide stratus lectus et apposita mensa aurea a brave bed a table of gold c into which no creature came but one only woman which their god made choice of as the Chaldean priests told him and that their god lay with her himself as at Thebes in Egypt was the like done of old So that you see this is no news the devils themselves or their juggling priests have played such pranks in all ages Many divines stiffly contradict this but I will conclude with four thousand six hundred eighty eight Lipsius that since examples testimonies and confessions of those unhappy women are so manifest on the other side and many even in this our town of Louvain that it is likely to be so four thousand six hundred eighty nine One thing I will add that I suppose that in no age past I know not

miserum me cepit ocellis Of all eyes by the way black are most amiable enticing and fairer which the poet observes in commending of his mistress four thousand nine hundred forty six Spectandum nigris oculis nigroque capillo which Hesiod admires in his Alemena four thousand nine hundred forty seven Cujus a vertice ac nigricantibus oculis Tale quiddam spiral ac ab aurea Venere From her black eyes and from her golden face As if from Venus came a lovely grace and four thousand nine hundred forty eight Triton in his Milaene nigra oculos formosa mihi four thousand nine hundred forty nine Homer useth that epithet of ox eyed in describing Juno because a round black eye is the best the son of beauty and farthest from black the worse which four thousand nine hundred fifty Polydore Virgil taxeth in our nation Angli ut plurimum caesiis oculis we have grey eyes for the most part Baptisma Porta Physiognom lib three puts grey colour upon children they be childish eyes dull and heavy Many commend on the other side Spanish ladies and those four thousand nine hundred fifty one Greek dames at this day for the blackness of their eyes as Porta doth his Neapolitan young wives Suetonius describes Julius Caesar to have been nigris vegetisque oculis micantibus of a black quick sparkling eye and although Averroes in his Colliget will have such persons timorous yet without question they are most amorous Now last of all I will show you by what means beauty doth fascinate bewitch as some hold and work upon the soul of a man by the eye For certainly I am of the poet s mind love doth bewitch and strangely change us four thousand nine hundred fifty two Ludit amor sensus oculos perstringit et aufert Libertatem animi mira nos fascinat arte Credo aliquis daemon subiens praecordia flammam Concitat et raptam tollit de cardine mentem Love mocks our senses curbs our liberties And doth bewitch us with his art and rings I think some devil gets into our entrails And kindles coals and heaves our souls from th hinges Heliodorus lib three proves at large four thousand nine hundred fifty three that love is witchcraft it gets in at our eyes pores nostrils engenders the same qualities and affections in us as were in the party whence it came The manner of the fascination as Ficinus ten cap com in Plat declares it is thus Mortal men are then especially bewitched when as by often gazing one on the other they direct sight to sight join eye to eye and so drink and suck in love between them for the beginning of this disease is the eye And therefore he that hath a clear eye though he be otherwise deformed by often looking upon him will make one mad and tie him fast to him by the eye Leonard Varius lib one cap two de fascinat telleth us that by this interview four thousand nine hundred fifty four the purer spirits are infected the one eye pierceth through the other with his rays which he sends forth and many men have those excellent piercing eyes that which Suetonius relates of Augustus their brightness is such they compel their spectators to look off and can no more endure them than the sunbeams four thousand nine hundred fifty five Barradius lib six cap ten de Harmonia Evangel reports as much of our Saviour Christ and four thousand nine hundred fifty six Peter Morales of the Virgin Mary whom Nicephorus describes likewise to have been yellow haired of a wheat colour but of a most amiable and piercing eye The rays as some think sent from the eyes carry certain spiritual vapours with them and so infect the other party and that in a moment I know they that hold visio fit intra mittendo will make a doubt of this but Ficinus proves it from blear eyes four thousand nine hundred fifty seven That by sight alone make others blear eyed and it is more than manifest that the vapour of the corrupt blood doth get in together with the rays and so by the contagion the spectators eyes are infected Other arguments there are of a basilisk that kills afar off by sight as that Ephesian did of whom four thousand nine hundred fifty eight Philostratus speaks of so pernicious an eye he poisoned all he looked steadily on and that other argument menstruae faminae out of Aristotle s Problems morbosae Capivaccius adds and four thousand nine hundred fifty nine Septalius the commentator that contaminate a looking glass with beholding it four thousand nine hundred sixty So the beams that come from the agent s heart by the eyes infect the spirits about the patients inwardly wound and thence the spirits infect the blood To this effect she complained in four thousand nine hundred sixty one Apuleius Thou art the cause of my grief thy eyes piercing through mine eyes to mine inner parts have set my bowels on fire and therefore pity me that am now ready to die for thy sake Ficinus illustrates this with a familiar example of that Marrhusian Phaedrus and Theban Lycias four thousand nine hundred sixty two Lycias he stares on Phaedrus face and Phaedrus fastens the balls of his eyes upon Lycias and with those sparkling rays sends out his spirits The beams of Phaedrus eyes are easily mingled with the beams of Lycias and spirits are joined to spirits This vapour begot in Phaedrus heart enters into Lycias bowels and that which is a greater wonder Phaedrus blood is in Lycias heart and thence come those ordinary love speeches my sweetheart Phaedrus and mine own self my dear bowels And Phaedrus again to Lycias O my light my joy my soul my life Phaedrus follows Lycias because his heart would have his spirits and Lycias follows Phaedrus because he loves the seat of his spirits both follow but Lycias the earnester of the two the river hath more need of the fountain than the fountain of the river as iron is drawn to that which is touched with a loadstone but draws not it again so Lycias draws Phaedrus But how comes it to pass then that the blind man loves that never saw We read in the Lives of the Fathers a story of a child that was brought up in the wilderness from his infancy by an old hermit now come to man s estate he saw by chance two comely women wandering in the woods he asked the old man what creatures they were he told him fairies after a while talking obiter the hermit demanded of him which was the pleasantest sight that ever he saw in his life He readily replied the two four thousand nine hundred sixty three fairies he spied in the wilderness So that without doubt there is some secret loadstone in a beautiful woman a magnetic power a natural inbred affection which moves our concupiscence and as he sings Methinks I have a mistress yet to come And still I seek I love I know not whom Tis true indeed of natural and chaste love but not of this heroical passion or rather brutish burning lust of which we treat we speak of wandering wanton adulterous eyes which as four thousand nine hundred sixty four he saith lie still in wait as so many soldiers and when they spy an innocent spectator fixed on them shoot him through and presently bewitch him especially when they shall gaze and gloat as wanton lovers do one upon another and with a pleasant eye conflict participate each other s souls Hence you may perceive how easily and how quickly we may be taken in love since at the twinkling of an eye Phaedrus spirits may so perniciously infect Lycias blood four thousand nine hundred sixty five Neither is it any wonder if we but consider how many other diseases closely and as suddenly are caught by infection plague itch scabs flux c The spirits taken in will not let him rest that hath received them but egg him on four thousand nine hundred sixty six Idque petit corpus mens unde est saucia amore and we may manifestly perceive a strange eduction of spirits by such as bleed at nose after they be dead at the presence of the murderer but read more of this in Lemnius lib two de occult nat mir cap seven Valleriola lib two observ cap seven Valesius controv Ficinus Cardan Libavius de cruentis cadaveribus c SUBSECT III Artificial allurements of Love Causes and Provocations to Lust Gestures Clothes Dower c Natural beauty is a stronger loadstone of itself as you have heard a great temptation and pierceth to the very heart four thousand nine hundred sixty seven forma verecundae nocuit mihi visa puellae but much more when those artificial enticements and provocations of gestures clothes jewels pigments exornations shall be annexed unto it those other circumstances opportunity of time and place shall concur which of themselves alone were all sufficient each one in particular to produce this effect It is a question much controverted by some wise men forma debeat plus arti an naturae Whether natural or artificial objects be more powerful but not decided for my part I am of opinion that though beauty itself be a great motive and give an excellent lustre in sordibus in beggary as a jewel on a dunghill will shine and cast his rays it cannot be suppressed which Heliodorus feigns of Chariclia though she were in beggar s weeds yet as it is used artificial is of more force and much to be preferred four thousand nine hundred sixty eight Sic dentata sibi videtur Aegle Emptis ossibus Indicoque cornu Sic quae nigrior est cadente moro Cerussata sibi placet Lychoris So toothless Aegle seems a pretty one Set out with new bought teeth of Indy bone So foul Lychoris blacker than berry Herself admires now finer than cherry John Lerius the Burgundian cap eight hist navigat in Brazil is altogether on my side For whereas saith he at our coming to Brazil we found both men and women naked as they were born without any covering so much as of their privities and could not be persuaded by our Frenchmen that lived a year with them to wear any four thousand nine hundred sixty nine Many will think that our so long commerce with naked women must needs be a great provocation to lust but he concludes otherwise that their nakedness did much less entice them to lasciviousness than our women s clothes And I dare boldly affirm saith he that those glittering attires counterfeit colours headgears curled hairs plaited coats cloaks gowns costly stomachers guarded and loose garments and all those other accoutrements wherewith our countrywomen counterfeit a beauty and so curiously set out themselves cause more inconvenience in this kind than that barbarian homeliness although they be no whit inferior unto them in beauty I could evince the truth of this by many other arguments but I appeal saith he to my companions at that present which were all of the same mind His countryman Montague in his essays is of the same opinion and so are many others out of whose assertions thus much in brief we may conclude that beauty is more beholden to art than nature and stronger provocations proceed from outward ornaments than such as nature hath provided It is true that those fair sparkling eyes white neck coral lips turgent paps rose coloured cheeks c of themselves are potent enticers but when a comely artificial well composed look pleasing gesture an affected carriage shall be added it must needs be far more forcible than it was when those curious needleworks variety of colours purest dyes jewels spangles pendants lawn lace tiffanies fair and fine linen embroideries calamistrations ointments et cetera shall be added they will make the veriest dowdy otherwise a goddess when nature shall be furthered by art For it is not the eye of itself that enticeth to lust but an adulterous eye as Peter terms it two ii fourteen a wanton a rolling lascivious eye a wandering eye which Isaiah taxeth iii sixteen Christ himself and the Virgin Mary had most beautiful eyes as amiable eyes as any persons saith four thousand nine hundred seventy Baradius that ever lived but withal so modest so chaste that whosoever looked on them was freed from that passion of burning lust if we may believe four thousand nine hundred seventy one Gerson and four thousand nine hundred seventy two Bonaventure there was no such antidote against it as the Virgin Mary s face tis not the eye but carriage of it as they use it that causeth such effects When Pallas Juno Venus were to win Paris favour for the golden apple as it is elegantly described in that pleasant interlude of four thousand nine hundred seventy three Apuleius Juno came with majesty upon the stage Minerva gravity but Venus dulce subridens constitit amaene et gratissimae Graticae deam propitiantes c came in smiling with her gracious graces and exquisite music as if she had danced et nonnunquam saltare solis oculis and which was the main matter of all she danced with her rolling eyes they were the brokers and harbingers of her suite So she makes her brags in a modern poet four thousand nine hundred seventy four Soon could I make my brow to tyrannise And force the world do homage to mine eyes The eye is a secret orator the first bawd Amoris porta and with private looks winking glances and smiles as so many dialogues they make up the match many times and understand one another s meanings before they come to speak a word four thousand nine hundred seventy five Euryalus and Lucretia were so mutually enamoured by the eye and prepared to give each other entertainment before ever they had conference he asked her good will with his eyes she did suffragari and gave consent with a pleasant look That four thousand nine hundred seventy six Thracian Rodophe was so excellent at this dumb rhetoric that if she had but looked upon any one almost saith Calisiris she would have bewitched him and he could not possibly escape it For as four thousand nine hundred seventy seven Salvianus observes the eyes are the windows of our souls by which as so many channels all dishonest concupiscence gets into our hearts They reveal our thoughts and as they say frons animi index but the eye of the countenance four thousand nine hundred seventy eight Quid procacibus intuere ocellis c I may say the same of smiling gait nakedness of parts plausible gestures c To laugh is the proper passion of a man an ordinary thing to smile but those counterfeit composed affected artificial and reciprocal those counter smiles are the dumb shows and prognostics of greater matters which they most part use to inveigle and deceive though many fond lovers again are so frequently mistaken and led into a fool s paradise For if they see but a fair maid laugh or show a pleasant countenance use some gracious words or gestures they apply it all to themselves as done in their favour sure she loves them she is willing coming c Stultus quando videt quod pulchra puellula ridet Tum fatuus credit se quod amare velit When a fool sees a fair maid for to smile He thinks she loves him tis but to beguile They make an art of it as the poet telleth us four thousand nine hundred seventy nine Quis credat discunt etiam ridere puellae Quaeritur atque illis hac quoque parte decor Who can believe to laugh maids make an art And seek a pleasant grace to that same part And tis as great an enticement as any of the rest four thousand nine hundred eighty subrisit molle puella Cor tibi rite salit She makes thine heart leap with four thousand nine hundred eighty one a pleasing gentle smile of hers four thousand nine hundred eighty two Dulce ridentem Lalagen amabo Dulce loquentem I love Lalage as much for smiling as for discoursing delectata illa risit tam blandum as he said in Petronius of his mistress being well pleased she gave so sweet a smile It won Ismenias as he four thousand nine hundred eighty three confesseth Ismene subrisit amatorium Ismene smiled so lovingly the second time I saw her that I could not choose but admire her and Galla s sweet smile quite overcame four thousand nine hundred eighty four Faustus the shepherd Me aspiciens moils blande subrisit ocellis All other gestures of the body will enforce as much Daphnis in four thousand nine hundred eighty five Lucian was a poor tattered wench when I knew her first said Corbile pannosa et Zacera but now she is a stately piece indeed hath her maids to attend her brave attires money in her purse c and will you know how this came to pass by setting out herself after the best fashion by her pleasant carriage affability sweet smiling upon all c Many women dote upon a man for his compliment only and good behaviour they are won in an instant too credulous to believe that every light wanton suitor who sees or makes love to them is instantly enamoured he certainly dotes on admires them will surely marry when as he means nothing less tis his ordinary carriage in all such companies So both delude each other by such outward shows and amongst the rest an upright a comely grace courtesies gentle salutations cringes a mincing gait a decent and an affected pace are most powerful enticers and which the prophet Isaiah a courtier himself and a great observer objected to the daughters of Zion iii sixteen they minced as they went and made a tinkling with their feet To say the truth what can they not effect by such means Whilst nature decks them in their best attires Of youth and beauty which the world admires four thousand nine hundred eighty six Urit voce manu gressu pectore fronte oculis When art shall be annexed to beauty when wiles and guiles shall concur for to speak as it is love is a kind of legerdemain mere juggling a fascination When they show their fair hand fine foot and leg withal magnum sui desiderium nobis relinquunt saith four thousand nine hundred eighty seven Balthazar Castilio lib one they set us a longing and so when they pull up their petticoats and outward garments as usually they do to show their fine stockings and those of purest silken dye gold fringes laces embroiderings it shall go hard but when they go to church or to any other place all shall be seen tis but a springe to catch woodcocks and as four thousand nine hundred eighty eight Chrysostom telleth them downright though they say nothing with their mouths they speak in their gait they speak with their eyes they speak in the carriage of their bodies And what shall we say otherwise of that baring of their necks shoulders naked breasts arms and wrists to what end are they but only to tempt men to lust four thousand nine hundred eighty nine Nam quid lacteolus sinus et ipsas Prae te fers sine linteo papillas Hoc est dicere posce posce trado Hoc est ad Venerem vocare amantes There needs no more as four thousand nine hundred ninety Fredericus Matenesius well observes but a crier to go before them so dressed to bid us look out a trumpet to sound or for defect a sow gelder to blow four thousand nine hundred ninety one Look out look out and see What object this may be That doth perstringe mine eye A gallant lady goes In rich and gaudy clothes But whither away God knows look out c et quae sequuntur or to what end and purpose But to leave all these fantastical raptures I ll prosecute my intended theme Nakedness as I have said is an odious thing of itself remedium amoris yet it may be so used in part and at set times that there can be no such enticement as it is four thousand nine hundred ninety two Nec mihi cincta Diana placet nec nuda Cythere Illa voluptatis nil habet haec nimium David so espied Bathsheba the elders Susanna four thousand nine hundred ninety three Apelles was enamoured with Campaspe when he was to paint her naked Tiberius in Suet cap forty two supped with Sestius Gallus an old lecher libidinoso sene ea lege ut nudae puellae administrarent some say as much of Nero and Pontus Huter of Carolus Pugnax Amongst the Babylonians it was the custom of some lascivious queans to dance frisking in that fashion saith Curtius lib five and Sardus de mor gent lib one writes of others to that effect The four thousand nine hundred ninety four Tuscans at some set banquets had naked women to attend upon them which Leonicus de Varia hist lib three cap ninety six confirms of such other bawdy nations Nero would have filthy pictures still hanging in his chamber which is too commonly used in our times and Heliogabalus etiam coram agentes ut ad venerem incitarent So things may be abused A servant maid in Aristaenetus spied her master and mistress through the key hole four thousand nine hundred ninety five merrily disposed upon the sight she fell in love with her master four thousand nine hundred ninety six Antoninus Caracalla observed his mother in law with her breasts amorously laid open he was so much moved that he said Ah si liceret O that I might which she by chance overhearing replied as impudently four thousand nine hundred ninety seven Quicquid libet licet thou mayst do what thou wilt and upon that temptation he married her this object was not in cause not the thing itself but that unseemly indecent carriage of it When you have all done veniunt a veste sagittae the greatest provocations of lust are from our apparel God makes they say man shapes and there is no motive like unto it four thousand nine hundred ninety eight Which doth even beauty beautify And most bewitch a wretched eye a filthy knave a deformed quean a crooked carcass a mawkin a witch a rotten post a hedgestake may be so set out and tricked up that it shall make as fair a show as much enamour as the rest many a silly fellow is so taken Primum luxuriae aucupium one calls it the first snare of lust four thousand nine hundred ninety nine Bossus aucupium animarum lethalem arundinem a fatal reed the greatest bawd forte lenocinium sanguineis lachrymis deplorandum saith five thousand Matenesius and with tears of blood to be deplored Not that comeliness of clothes is therefore to be condemned and those usual ornaments there is a decency and decorum in this as well as in other things fit to be used becoming several persons and befitting their estates he is only fantastical that is not in fashion and like an old image in arras hangings when a manner of attire is generally received but when they are so new fangled so unstaid so prodigious in their attires beyond their means and fortunes unbefitting their age place quality condition what should we otherwise think of them Why do they adorn themselves with so many colours of herbs fictitious flowers curious needleworks quaint devices sweet smelling odours with those inestimable riches of precious stones pearls rubies diamonds emeralds c Why do they crown themselves with gold and silver use coronets and tires of several fashions deck themselves with pendants bracelets earrings chains girdles rings pins spangles embroideries shadows rebatoes versicolour ribands why do they make such glorious shows with their scarves feathers fans masks furs laces tiffanies ruffs falls calls cuffs damasks velvets tinsels cloth of gold silver tissue with colours of heavens stars planets the strength of metals stones odours flowers birds beasts fishes and whatsoever Africa Asia America sea land art and industry of man can afford Why do they use and covet such novelty of inventions such new fangled tires and spend such inestimable sums on them To what end are those crisped false hairs painted faces as five thousand one the satirist observes such a composed gait not a step awry Why are they like so many Sybarites or Nero s Poppaea Ahasuerus concubines so costly so long a dressing as Caesar was marshalling his army or a hawk in pruning five thousand two Dum moliuntur dum comuntur annus est a five thousand three gardener takes not so much delight and pains in his garden a horseman to dress his horse scour his armour a mariner about his ship a merchant his shop and shop book as they do about their faces and all those other parts such setting up with corks straightening with whalebones why is it but as a day net catcheth larks to make young men stoop unto them Philocharus a gallant in Aristenaetus advised his friend Poliaenus to take heed of such enticements five thousand four for it was the sweet sound and motion of his mistress s spangles and bracelets the smell of her ointments that captivated him first Illa fuit mentis prima ruina meae Quid sibi vult pixidum turba saith five thousand five Lucian to what use are pins pots glasses ointments irons combs bodkins setting sticks why bestow they all their patrimonies and husbands yearly revenues on such fooleries five thousand six bina patrimonia singulis

some of them be tied in bedlam with iron chains have a whip for a fan and hair cloths next to their skins and instead of wrought smocks have their cheeks stigmatised with a hot iron I say some of our Jezebels instead of painting if they were well served But why is all this labour all this cost preparation riding running far fetched and dear bought stuff five thousand seven Because forsooth they would be fair and fine and where nature is defective supply it by art five thousand eight Sanguine quae vero non rubet arte rubet Ovid and to that purpose they anoint and paint their faces to make Helen of Hecuba parvamque exortamque puellam Europen five thousand nine To this intent they crush in their feet and bodies hurt and crucify themselves sometimes in lax clothes a hundred yards I think in a gown a sleeve and sometimes again so close ut nudos exprimant artus five thousand ten Now long tails and trains and then short up down high low thick thin c now little or no bands then as big as cart wheels now loose bodies then great farthingales and close girt c Why is all this but with the whore in the Proverbs to intoxicate some or other oculorum decipulam five thousand eleven one therefore calls it et indicem libidinis the trap of lust and sure token as an ivy bush is to a tavern Quod pulchros Glycere sumas de pixide vultus Quod tibi compositae nec sine lege comae Quod niteat digitis adamas Beryllus in aure Non sum divinus sed scio quid cupias O Glycere in that you paint so much Your hair is so bedeckt in order such With rings on fingers bracelets in your ear Although no prophet tell I can I fear To be admired to be gazed on to circumvent some novice as many times they do that instead of a lady he loves a cap and a feather instead of a maid that should have verum colorem corpus solidum et succi plenum as Chaerea describes his mistress in the five thousand twelve poet a painted face a ruff band fair and fine linen a coronet a flower five thousand thirteen Naturaeque putat quod fuit artificis a wrought waistcoat he dotes on or a pied petticoat a pure dye instead of a proper woman For generally as with rich furred conies their cases are far better than their bodies and like the bark of a cinnamon tree which is dearer than the whole bulk their outward accoutrements are far more precious than their inward endowments Tis too commonly so five thousand fourteen Auferimur cultu et gemmis auroque teguntur Omnia pars minima est ipsa puella sui With gold and jewels all is covered And with a strange tire we are won Whilst she s the least part of herself And with such baubles quite undone Why do they keep in so long together a whole winter sometimes and will not be seen but by torch or candlelight and come abroad with all the preparation may be when they have no business but only to show themselves Spectatum veniunt veniunt spectentur ut ipsae five thousand fifteen For what is beauty if it be not seen Or what is t to be seen if not admir d And though admir d unless in love desir d why do they go with such counterfeit gait which five thousand sixteen Philo Judeus reprehends them for and use I say it again such gestures apish ridiculous indecent attires sybaritical tricks fucos genis purpurissam venis cerussam fronti leges occulis c use those sweet perfumes powders and ointments in public flock to hear sermons so frequent is it for devotion or rather as five thousand seventeen Basil tells them to meet their sweethearts and see fashions for as he saith commonly they come so provided to that place with such curious compliments with such gestures and tires as if they should go to a dancing school a stage play or bawdy house fitter than a church When such a she priest comes her mass to say Twenty to one they all forget to pray They make those holy temples consecrated to godly martyrs and religious uses the shops of impudence dens of whores and thieves and little better than brothel houses When we shall see these things daily done their husbands bankrupts if not cornutos their wives light housewives daughters dishonest and hear of such dissolute acts as daily we do how should we think otherwise what is their end but to deceive and inveigle young men As tow takes fire such enticing objects produce their effect how can it be altered When Venus stood before Anchises as five thousand eighteen Homer feigns in one of his hymns in her costly robes he was instantly taken Cum ante ipsum staret Jovis filia videns eam Anchises admirabatur formam et stupendas vestes Erat enim induta peplo igneis radiis spiendidiore Habebat quoque torques fulgidos flexiles haelices Tenerum collum ambiebant monilia pulchra Aurea variegata When Venus stood before Anchises first He was amaz d to see her in her tires For she had on a hood as red as fire And glittering chains and ivy twisted spires About her tender neck were costly brooches And necklaces of gold enamell d ouches So when Medea came in presence of Jason first attended by her nymphs and ladies as she is described by five thousand nineteen Apollonius Cunctas vero ignis instar sequebatur splendor Tantum ab aureis fimbriis resplendebat jubar Accenditque in oculis dulce desiderium A lustre followed them like flaming fire And from their golden borders came such beams Which in his eyes provok d a sweet desire Such a relation we have in five thousand twenty Plutarch when the queens came and offered themselves to Antony five thousand twenty one with diverse presents and enticing ornaments Asiatic allurements with such wonderful joy and festivity they did so inveigle the Romans that no man could contain himself all was turned to delight and pleasure The women transformed themselves to Bacchus shapes the men children to Satyrs and Pans but Antony himself was quite besotted with Cleopatra s sweet speeches philters beauty pleasing tires for when she sailed along the river Cydnus with such incredible pomp in a gilded ship herself dressed like Venus her maids like the Graces her pages like so many Cupids Antony was amazed and rapt beyond himself Heliodorus lib one brings in Dameneta stepmother to Cnemon whom she five thousand twenty two saw in his scarves rings robes and coronet quite mad for the love of him It was Judith s pantofles that ravished the eyes of Holofernes And five thousand twenty three Cardan is not ashamed to confess that seeing his wife the first time all in white he did admire and instantly love her If these outward ornaments were not of such force why doth five thousand twenty four Naomi give Ruth counsel how to please Boaz and five thousand twenty five Judith seeking to captivate Holofernes washed and anointed herself with sweet ointments dressed her hair and put on costly attires The riot in this kind hath been excessive in times past no man almost came abroad but curled and anointed five thousand twenty six Et matutino suadans Crispinus amomo Quantum vix redolent duo funera one spent as much as two funerals at once and with perfumed hairs five thousand twenty seven et rosa canos odorati capillos Assyriaque nardo What strange thing doth five thousand twenty eight Sueton relate in this matter of Caligula s riot And Pliny lib twelve thirteen Read more in Dioscorides Ulmus Arnoldus Randoletius de fuco et decoratione for it is now an art as it was of old so five thousand twenty nine Seneca records officinae sunt adores coquentium Women are bad and men worse no difference at all between their and our times five thousand thirty good manners as Seneca complains are extinct with wantonness in tricking up themselves men go beyond women they wear harlots colours and do not walk but jet and dance hic mulier haec vir more like players butterflies baboons apes antics than men So ridiculous moreover we are in our attires and for cost so excessive that as Hierome said of old Uno filio villarum insunt pretia uno lino decies sestertium inseritur tis an ordinary thing to put a thousand oaks and a hundred oxen into a suit of apparel to wear a whole manor on his back What with shoe ties hangers points caps and feathers scarves bands curls c in a short space their whole patrimonies are consumed Heliogabalus is taxed by Lampridius and admired in his age for wearing jewels in his shoes a common thing in our times not for emperors and princes but almost for serving men and tailors all the flowers stars constellations gold and precious stones do condescend to set out their shoes To repress the luxury of those Roman matrons there was five thousand thirty one Lex Valeria and Oppia and a Cato to contradict but no laws will serve to repress the pride and insolency of our days the prodigious riot in this kind Lucullus s wardrobe is put down by our ordinary citizens and a cobbler s wife in Venice a courtesan in Florence is no whit inferior to a queen if our geographers say true and why is all this Why do they glory in their jewels as five thousand thirty two he saith or exult and triumph in the beauty of clothes why is all this cost to incite men the sooner to burning lust They pretend decency and ornament but let them take heed that while they set out their bodies they do not damn their souls tis five thousand thirty three Bernard s counsel shine in jewels stink in conditions have purple robes and a torn conscience Let them take heed of Isaiah s prophecy that their slippers and attires be not taken from them sweet balls bracelets earrings veils wimples crisping pins glasses fine linen hoods lawns and sweet savours they become not bald burned and stink upon a sudden And let maids beware as five thousand thirty four Cyprian adviseth that while they wander too loosely abroad they lose not their virginities and like Egyptian temples seem fair without but prove rotten carcases within How much better were it for them to follow that good counsel of Tertullian five thousand thirty five To have their eyes painted with chastity the Word of God inserted into their ears Christ s yoke tied to the hair to subject themselves to their husbands If they would do so they should be comely enough clothe themselves with the silk of sanctity damask of devotion purple of piety and chastity and so painted they shall have God himself to be a suitor let whores and queans prank up themselves five thousand thirty six let them paint their faces with minion and ceruse they are but fuels of lust and signs of a corrupt soul if ye be good honest virtuous and religious matrons let sobriety modesty and chastity be your honour and God himself your love and desire Mulier recte olet ubi nihil olet then a woman smells best when she hath no perfume at all no crown chain or jewel Guivarra adds is such an ornament to a virgin or virtuous woman quam virgini pudor as chastity is more credit in a wise man s eye and judgment they get by their plainness and seem fairer than they that are set out with baubles as a butcher s meat is with pricks puffed up and adorned like so many jays with variety of colours It is reported of Cornelia that virtuous Roman lady great Scipio s daughter Titus Sempronius wife and the mother of the Gracchi that being by chance in company with a companion a strange gentlewoman some light housewife belike that was dressed like a May lady and as most of our gentlewomen are was five thousand thirty seven more solicitous of her head tire than of her health that spent her time between a comb and a glass and had rather be fair than honest as Cato said and have the commonwealth turned topsy turvy than her tires marred and she did nought but brag of her fine robes and jewels and provoked the Roman matron to show hers Cornelia kept her in talk till her children came from school and these said she are my jewels and so deluded and put off a proud vain fantastical housewife How much better were it for our matrons to do as she did to go civilly and decently five thousand thirty eight Honestae mulieris instar quae utitur auro pro eo quod est ad ea tantum quibus opus est to use gold as it is gold and for that use it serves and when they need it than to consume it in riot beggar their husbands prostitute themselves inveigle others and peradventure damn their own souls How much more would it be for their honour and credit Thus doing as Hierom said of Blesilla five thousand thirty nine Furius did not so triumph over the Gauls Papyrius of the Samnites Scipio of Numantia as she did by her temperance pulla semper veste c they should insult and domineer over lust folly vainglory all such inordinate furious and unruly passions But I am over tedious I confess and whilst I stand gaping after fine clothes there is another great allurement in the world s eye at least which had like to have stolen out of sight and that

Kissing Familiarity Tokens Presents Bribes Promises Protestations Tears c All these allurements hitherto are afar off and at a distance I will come nearer to those other degrees of love which are conference kissing dalliance discourse singing dancing amorous tales objects presents c which as so many sirens steal away the hearts of men and women For as Tacitus observes l two five thousand fifty four It is no sufficient trial of a maid s affection by her eyes alone but you must say something that shall be more available and use such other forcible engines therefore take her by the hand wring her fingers hard and sigh withal if she accept this in good part and seem not to be much averse then call her mistress take her about the neck and kiss her c But this cannot be done except they first get opportunity of living or coming together ingress egress and regress letters and commendations may do much outward gestures and actions but when they come to live near one another in the same street village or together in a house love is kindled on a sudden Many a serving man by reason of this opportunity and importunity inveigles his master s daughter many a gallant loves a dowdy many a gentleman runs upon his wife s maids many ladies dote upon their men as the queen in Ariosto did upon the dwarf many matches are so made in haste and they are compelled as it were by five thousand fifty five necessity so to love which had they been free come in company of others seen that variety which many places afford or compared them to a third would never have looked one upon another Or had not that opportunity of discourse and familiarity been offered they would have loathed and contemned those whom for want of better choice and other objects they are fatally driven on and by reason of their hot blood idle life full diet c are forced to dote upon them that come next And many times those which at the first sight cannot fancy or affect each other but are harsh and ready to disagree offended with each other s carriage like Benedict and Beatrice in the five thousand fifty six comedy and in whom they find many faults by this living together in a house conference kissing colling and such like allurements begin at last to dote insensibly one upon another It was the greatest motive that Potiphar s wife had to dote upon Joseph and five thousand fifty seven Clitiphon upon Leucippe his uncle s daughter because the plague being at Bizance it was his fortune for a time to sojourn with her to sit next her at the table as he tells the tale himself in Tatius lib two which though it

him and withal trod upon his toes and would come and go and when she could not speak for the company she would wring his hand and blush when she met him and by this means first she overcame him bibens amorem hauriebam simul she would kiss the cup and drink to him and smile and drink where he drank on that side of the cup by which mutual compressions kissings wringing of hands treading of feet c Ipsam mihi videbar sorbillare virginem I sipped and sipped so long till at length I was drunk in love upon a sudden Philocharinus in five thousand sixty two Aristaenetus met a fair maid by chance a

persons how should it be otherwise Living at five thousand sixty six Rome saith Aretine s Lucretia in the flower of my fortunes rich fair young and so well brought up my conversation age beauty fortune made all the world admire and love me Night alone that one occasion is enough to set all on fire and they are so cunning in great houses that they make their best advantage of it Many a gentlewoman that is guilty to herself of her imperfections paintings impostures will not willingly be seen by day but as five thousand sixty seven Castilio noteth in the night Diem ut glis odit taedarum lucem super omnia mavult she hateth the day like a dormouse and above all things loves torches and candlelight and if she must come abroad in the day she covets as five thousand sixty eight

twenty two gives instance in a Florentine gentleman that was so deceived with a wife she was so radiantly set out with rings and jewels lawns scarves laces gold spangles and gaudy devices that the young man took her to be a goddess for he never saw her but by torchlight but after the wedding solemnities when as he viewed her the next morning without her tires and in a clear day she was so deformed a lean yellow shrivelled c such a beastly creature in his eyes that he could not endure to look upon her Such matches are frequently made in Italy where they have no other opportunity to woo but when they go to church or as five thousand sixty nine in Turkey see them at a distance they must interchange few or no words till such time they come to be married and then as Sardus lib one cap three de morb gent and five thousand seventy Bohemus relate of those old Lacedaemonians the bride is brought into the chamber with her hair girt about her the bridegroom comes in and unties the knot and must not see her at all by daylight till such time as he is made a father by her In those hotter countries these are ordinary practices at this day but in our northern parts amongst Germans Danes French and Britons the continent of Scandia and the rest we assume more liberty in such cases we allow them as Bohemus saith to kiss coming and going et modo absit lascivia in cauponem ducere to talk merrily sport play sing and dance so that it be modestly done go to the alehouse and tavern together And tis not amiss though five thousand seventy one Chrysostom Cyprian Hierome and some other of the fathers speak bitterly against it but that is the abuse which is commonly seen at some drunken matches dissolute meetings or great unruly feasts five thousand seventy two A young pickedevanted trim bearded fellow saith Hierome will come with a company of compliments and hold you up by the arm as you go and wringing your fingers will so be enticed or entice one drinks to you another embraceth a third kisseth and all this while the fiddler plays or sings a lascivious song a fourth singles you out to dance five thousand seventy three one speaks by beck and signs and that which he dares not say signifies by passions amongst so many and so great provocations of pleasure lust conquers the most hard and crabbed minds and scarce can a man live honest amongst feastings and sports or at such great meetings For as he goes on five thousand seventy four she walks along and with the ruffling of her clothes makes men look at her her shoes creak her paps tied up her waist pulled in to make her look small she is straight girded her hairs hang loose about her ears her upper garment sometimes falls and sometimes tarries to show her naked shoulders and as if she would not be seen she covers that in all haste which voluntarily she showed And not at feasts plays pageants and such assemblies five thousand seventy five but as Chrysostom objects these tricks are put in practice at service time in churches and at the communion itself If such dumb shows signs and more obscure significations of love can so move what shall they do that have full liberty to sing dance kiss coll to use all manner of discourse and dalliance What shall he do that is beleaguered of all sides five thousand seventy six Quem tot tam roseae petunt puellae Quem cultae cupiunt nurus amorque Omnis undique et undecunque et

himself and that ravished his heart It was Jason s discourse as much as his beauty or any other of his good parts which delighted Medea so much five thousand eighty six Delectabatur enim Animus simul

auditors were stupefied enchanted fastened all to their places like so many stocks and stones Many silly gentlewomen are fetched over in like sort by a company of gulls and swaggering companions that

this means are quite mad At Abdera in Thrace Andromeda one of Euripides tragedies being played the spectators were so much moved with the object and those pathetical love speeches of Perseus amongst the rest O Cupid Prince of Gods and men c that every man almost a good while after spake pure iambics and raved still on Perseus speech O Cupid Prince of Gods and men As carmen boys and apprentices when a new song is published with us go singing that new tune still in the streets they continually acted that tragical part of Perseus and in every man s mouth was O Cupid in every street O Cupid in every house almost O Cupid Prince of Gods and men pronouncing still like stage players O Cupid they were so possessed all with that rapture and thought of that pathetical love speech they could not a

often abuse their own wives But what have I to do with this That which I aim at is to show you the progress of this burning lust to epitomise therefore all this which I have hitherto said with a familiar example out of that elegant Musaeus observe but with me those amorous proceedings of Leander and Hero they began first to look one on another with a lascivious look Oblique intuens inde nutibus Nutibus mutuis inducens in errorem mentem puellae Et illa e contra nutibus mutuis juvenis Leandri quod amorem non renuit c Inde Adibat in tenebris tacite quidem stringens Roseos puellae digitos ex imo suspirabat Vehementer Inde Virginis autem bene olens collum osculatus Tale verbum ait amoris ictus stimulo Preces audi et amoris miserere mei c Sic fatus recusantis persuasit mentem puellae With becks and nods he first began To try the wench s mind With becks and nods and smiles again An answer he did find And in the dark he took her by the hand And wrung it hard and sighed grievously And kiss d her too and woo d her as he might With pity me sweetheart or else I die And with such words and gestures as there past He won his mistress favour at the last The same proceeding is elegantly described by Apollonius in his Argonautics between Jason and Medea by Eustathius in the ten books of the loves of Ismenias and Ismene Achilles Tatius between his Clitophon and Leucippe Chaucer s neat poem of Troilus and Cresseide and in that notable tale in Petronius of a soldier and a gentlewoman of Ephesus that was so famous all over Asia for her chastity and that mourned for her husband the soldier wooed her with such rhetoric as lovers use to do placitone etiam pugnabis amori c at last frangi pertinaciam passa est he got her good will not only to satisfy his lust five thousand one hundred twenty two but to hang her dead husband s body on the cross which he watched instead of the thief s that was newly stolen away whilst he wooed her in her cabin These are tales you will say but they have most significant morals and do well express those ordinary proceedings of doting lovers Many such allurements there are nods jests winks smiles wrestlings tokens favours symbols letters valentines c For which cause belike Godfridus lib two de amor would not have women learn to write Many such provocations are used when they come in presence five thousand one hundred twenty

she find To linger by the way but if he chance to overtake her she is most averse nice and coy Denegat et pugnat sed vult super omnia vinci She seems not won but won she is at length In such wars women use but half their strength Sometimes they lie open and are most tractable and coming apt yielding and willing to embrace to take a green gown with that shepherdess in Theocritus Edyl twenty seven to let their coats c to play and dally at such seasons and to some as they spy their advantage and then coy close again so nice so surly so demure you had much better tame a colt catch or ride a wild horse than get her favour or win her love not a look not a smile not a kiss for a kingdom five thousand one hundred twenty five Aretine s Lucretia was an excellent artisan in this kind as she tells her own tale Though I was by nature and art most beautiful and fair yet by these tricks I seemed to be far more amiable than I was for that which men earnestly seek and cannot attain draws on their affection with a most furious desire I had a suitor loved me dearly said she and the five thousand one hundred twenty six more he gave me the more eagerly he wooed me the more I seemed to neglect to scorn him and which I commonly gave others I would not let him see me converse with me no not have a kiss To gull him the more and fetch him over for him only I aimed at I personated mine

her when there was no such matter but only to circumvent him five thousand one hundred twenty eight By these means as she concludes I made the poor gentleman so mad that he was ready to spend himself and venture his dearest blood for my sake Philinna in five thousand one hundred twenty nine Lucian practised all this long before as it shall appear unto you by her discourse for when Diphilus her sweetheart came to see her as his daily custom was she frowned upon him would not vouchsafe him her company but kissed Lamprius his company rival at the same time five thousand one hundred thirty before his face but why was it To make him as she telleth her mother that chid her for it more jealous to whet his love to come with a greater appetite and to know that her favour was not so easy to be had Many other tricks she used besides this as she there confesseth for she would fall out with and anger him of set purpose pick quarrels upon no occasion because she would be reconciled to him again Amantium irae amoris redintegratio as the old saying is the falling out of lovers is the renewing of love and according to that of Aristenaetis jucundiores amorum post injurias deliciae love is increased by injuries as the sunbeams are more gracious after a cloud And surely this aphorism is most true for as Ampelis informs Crisis in the said Lucian five thousand one hundred thirty one If a lover be not jealous angry waspish apt to fall out sigh and swear he is no true lover To kiss and coll hang about her neck protest swear and wish are but ordinary symptoms incipientis adhuc et crescentis amoris signa but if he be jealous angry apt to mistake c bene speres licet sweet sister he is thine own yet if you let him alone humour him please him c and that he perceive once he hath you sure without any company rival his love will languish and he will not care so much for you Hitherto saith she can I speak out of experience Demophantus a rich fellow was a suitor of mine I seemed to neglect him and gave better entertainment to Calliades the painter before his face principio abiit verbis me insectatus at first he went away all in a chafe cursing and swearing but at last he came submitting himself vowing and protesting he loved me most dearly I should have all he had and that he would kill himself for my sake Therefore I advise thee dear sister Crisis and all maids not to use your suitors over kindly insolentes enim sunt hoc cum sentiunt twill make them proud and insolent but now and then reject them estrange thyself et si me audies semel atque iterum exclude shut him out of doors once or twice let him dance attendance follow my counsel and by this means five thousand one hundred thirty two you shall make him mad come off roundly stand to any conditions and do whatsoever you will have him These are the ordinary practices yet in the said Lucian Melissa methinks had a trick beyond all this for when her suitor came coldly on to stir him up she writ one of his company rival s names and her own in a paper Melissa amat Hermotimum Hermotimus Mellissam causing it to be stuck upon a post for all gazers to behold and lost it in the way where he used to walk which

saw him first Felicianus overtook Caelia by the highway side offered his service thence came further acquaintance and thence came love But who can repeat half their devices What Aretine experienced what conceited Lucian or wanton Aristenaetus They will deny and take stiffly refuse and yet earnestly seek the same repel to make them come with more eagerness fly from if you follow but if averse as a shadow they will follow you again fugientem sequitur sequentem fugit with a regaining retreat a gentle reluctancy a smiling threat a pretty pleasant peevishness they will put you off and have a thousand such several enticements For as he saith five thousand one hundred thirty four Non est forma satis nec quae vult bella videri Debet vulgari more placere suis Dicta sales lusus sermones gratia risus Vincunt naturae candidioris opus Tis not enough though she be fair of hue For her to use this vulgar compliment But pretty toys and jests and saws and smiles As far beyond what beauty can attempt five thousand one hundred thirty five For this cause belike Philostratus in his images makes diverse loves some young some of one age some of another some winged some of one sex some of another some with torches some with golden apples some with darts gins snares and other engines in their hands as Propertius hath prettily painted them out lib two et twenty nine and which some interpret diverse enticements or diverse affections of lovers which if not alone yet jointly may batter and overcome the strongest constitutions It is reported of Decius and Valerianus those two notorious persecutors of the church that when they could enforce a young Christian by no means as five thousand one hundred thirty six Hierome records to sacrifice to their idols by no torments or promises they took another course to tempt him they put him into a fair garden and set a young courtesan to dally with him five thousand one hundred thirty seven took him about the neck and kissed him and that which is not to be named manibusque attrectare c and all those enticements which might be used that whom torments could not love might batter and beleaguer But such was his constancy she could not overcome and when this last engine would take no place they left him to his own ways At five thousand one hundred thirty eight Berkley in Gloucestershire there was in times past a nunnery saith Gualterus Mapes an old historiographer that lived four hundred years since of which there was a noble and a fair lady abbess Godwin that subtile Earl of Kent travelling that way seeking not her but hers leaves a nephew of his a proper young gallant as if he had been sick with her till he came back again and gives the young man charge so long to counterfeit till he had deflowered the abbess and as many besides of the nuns as he could and leaves him withal rings jewels girdles and such toys to give them still when they came to visit him The young man willing to undergo such a business played his part so well that in short space he got up most of their bellies and when he had done told his lord how he had sped five thousand one hundred thirty nine his lord made instantly to the court tells the king how such a nunnery was become a bawdy house procures a visitation gets them to be turned out and begs the lands to his own use This story I do therefore repeat that you may see of what force these enticements are if they be opportunely used and how hard it is even for the most averse and sanctified souls to resist such allurements John Major in the life of John the monk that lived in the days of Theodosius commends the hermit to have been a man of singular continency and of a most austere life but one night by chance the devil came to his cell in the habit of a young market wench that had lost her way and desired for God s sake some lodging with him five thousand one hundred forty The old man let her in and after some common conference of her mishap she began to inveigle him with lascivious talk and jests to play with his beard to kiss him and do worse till at last she overcame him As he went to address himself to that business she vanished on a sudden and the devils in the air laughed him to scorn Whether this be a true story or a tale I will not much contend it serves to illustrate this which I have said Yet were it so that these of which I have hitherto spoken and such like enticing baits be not sufficient there be many others which will of themselves intend this passion of burning lust amongst which dancing is none of the least and it is an engine of such force I may not omit it Incitamentum libidinis Petrarch calls it the spur of lust A five thousand one hundred forty one circle of which the devil himself is the centre five thousand one hundred forty two Many women that use it have come dishonest home most indifferent none better five thousand one hundred forty three Another terms it the companion of all filthy delights and enticements and tis not easily told what inconveniences come by it what scurrile talk obscene actions and many times such monstrous gestures such lascivious motions such wanton tunes meretricious kisses homely embracings five thousand one hundred forty four ut Gaditana canoro Incipiat prurire choro plausuque probatae Ad terram tremula descendant clune puellae Irritamentum Veneris languentis that it will make the spectators mad When that epitomiser of five thousand one hundred forty five Trogus had to the full described and set out King Ptolemy s riot as a chief engine and instrument of his overthrow he adds tympanum et tripudium fiddling and dancing the king was not a spectator only but a principal actor himself A thing nevertheless frequently used and part of a gentlewoman s bringing up to sing dance and play on the lute or some such instrument before she can say her paternoster or ten commandments Tis the next way their parents think to get them husbands they are compelled to learn and by that means five thousand one hundred forty six Incoestos amores de tenero meditantur ungue tis a great allurement as it is often used and many are undone by it Thais in Lucian inveigled Lamprias in a dance Herodias so far pleased Herod that she made him swear to give her what she would ask John Baptist s head in a platter five thousand one hundred forty seven Robert Duke of Normandy riding by Falais spied Arlette a fair maid as she danced on a green and was so much enamoured with the object that five thousand one hundred forty eight she must needs lie with her that night Owen Tudor won Queen Catherine s affection in a dance falling by chance with his head in her lap Who cannot parallel these stories out of his experience Speusippas a noble gallant in five thousand one hundred forty nine that Greek Aristenaetus seeing Panareta a fair young gentlewoman dancing by accident was so far in love with her that for a long time after he could think of nothing but Panareta he came raving home full of Panareta Who would not admire her who would not love her that should but see her dance as I did O admirable O divine Panareta I have seen old and new Rome many fair cities many proper women but never any like to Panareta they are dross dowdies all to Panareta O how she danced how she tripped how she turned with what a grace happy is that man that shall enjoy her O most incomparable only Panareta When Xenophon in Symposio or Banquet had discoursed of love and used all the engines that might be devised to move Socrates amongst the rest to stir him the more he shuts up all with a pleasant interlude or dance of Dionysius and Ariadne five thousand one hundred fifty First Ariadne dressed like a bride came in and took her place by and by Dionysius entered dancing to the music The spectators did all admire the young man s carriage and Ariadne herself was so much affected with the sight that she could scarce sit After a while Dionysius beholding Ariadne and incensed with love bowing to her knees embraced her first and kissed her with a grace she embraced him again and kissed him with like affection c as the dance required but they that stood by and saw this did much applaud and commend them both for it And when Dionysius rose up he raised her up with him and many pretty gestures embraces kisses and love compliments passed between them which when they saw fair Bacchus and beautiful Ariadne so sweetly and so unfeignedly kissing each other so really embracing they swore they loved indeed and were so inflamed with the object that they began to rouse up themselves as if they would have flown At the last when they saw them still so willingly embracing and now ready to go to the bride chamber they were so ravished with it that they that were unmarried swore they would forthwith marry and those that were married called instantly for their horses and galloped home to their wives What greater motive can there be than this burning lust what so violent an oppugner Not without good cause therefore so many general councils condemn it so many fathers abhor it so many grave men speak against it Use not the company of a woman saith Siracides eight four that is a singer or a dancer neither hear lest thou be taken in her craftiness In circo non tam cernitur quam discitur libido five thousand one hundred fifty one Haedus holds lust in theatres is not seen but learned Gregory Nazianzen that eloquent divine five thousand one hundred fifty two as he relates the story himself when a noble friend of his solemnly invited him with other bishops to his daughter Olympia s wedding refused to come five thousand one hundred fifty three For it is absurd to see an old gouty bishop sit amongst dancers he held it unfit to be a spectator much less an actor Nemo saltat sobrius Tully writes he is not a sober man that danceth for some such reason belike Domitian forbade the Roman senators to dance and for that fact removed many of them from the senate But these you will say are lascivious and Pagan dances tis the abuse that causeth such inconvenience and I do not well therefore to condemn speak against or innocently to accuse the best and pleasantest thing so five thousand one hundred fifty four Lucian calls it that belongs to mortal men You misinterpret I condemn it not I hold it notwithstanding an honest disport a lawful recreation if it be opportune moderately and soberly used I am of Plutarch s mind five thousand one hundred fifty five that which respects pleasure alone honest recreation or bodily exercise ought not to be rejected and contemned I subscribe to five thousand one hundred fifty six Lucian tis an elegant thing which cheereth up the mind exerciseth the body delights the spectators which teacheth many comely gestures equally affecting the ears eyes and soul itself Sallust discommends singing and dancing in Sempronia not that she did sing or dance but that she did it in excess tis the abuse of it and Gregory s refusal doth not simply condemn it but in some folks Many will not allow men and women to dance together because it is a provocation to lust they may as well with Lycurgus and Mahomet cut down all vines forbid the drinking of wine for that it makes some men drunk five thousand one hundred fifty seven Nihil prodest quod non laedere posset idem Igne quid utilius I say of this as of all other honest recreations they are like fire good and bad and I see no such inconvenience but that they may so dance if it be done at due times and by fit persons and conclude with Wolfungus five thousand one hundred fifty eight Hider and most of our modern divines Si decorae graves verecundae plena luce bonorum virorum et matronarum honestarum tempestive fiant probari possunt et debent There is a time to mourn a time to dance Eccles iii four Let them take their pleasures then and as five thousand one hundred fifty nine he said of old young men and maids flourishing in their age fair and lovely to behold well attired and of comely carriage dancing a Greek galliard and as their dance required kept their time now turning now tracing now apart now altogether now a courtesy then a caper c

or Bourbonian planet circa Solem saltantes Cytharedum saith Fromundus Four Medicean stars dance about Jupiter two Austrian about Saturn c and all belike to the music of the spheres Our greatest counsellors and staid senators at some times dance as David before the ark two Sam vi fourteen Miriam Exod xv twenty Judith xv thirteen though the devil hence perhaps hath brought in those bawdy bacchanals and well may they do it The greatest soldiers as five thousand one hundred sixty Quintilianus five thousand one hundred sixty one Aemilius Probus five thousand one hundred sixty two Coelius Rhodiginus have proved at large still use it in Greece Rome and the most worthy senators cantare saltare Lucian Macrobius Libanus Plutarch Julius Pollux Athenaeus have written just tracts in commendation of it In this our age it is in much request in those countries as in all civil commonwealths as Alexander ab Alexandro lib four cap ten et lib two cap twenty five hath proved at large five thousand one hundred sixty three amongst the barbarians themselves none so precious all the world allows it five thousand one hundred sixty four Divitias contemno tuas rex Craese tuamque Vendo Asiam unguentis flore mero choreis five thousand one hundred sixty five Plato in his Commonwealth will have dancing schools to be maintained that young folks might meet be acquainted see one another and be seen nay more he would have them dance naked and scoffs at them that laugh at it But Eusebius praepar Evangel lib one cap eleven and Theodoret lib nine curat graec affect worthily lash him for it and well they might for as one saith five thousand one hundred sixty six the very sight of naked parts causeth enormous exceeding concupiscences and stirs up both men and women to burning lust There is a mean in all things this is my censure in brief dancing is a pleasant recreation of body and mind if sober and modest such as our Christian dances are if tempestively used a furious motive to burning lust if as by Pagans heretofore unchastely abused But I proceed If these allurements do not take place for five thousand one hundred sixty seven Simierus that great master of dalliance shall not behave himself better the more effectually to move others and satisfy their lust they will swear and lie promise protest forge counterfeit brag bribe flatter and dissemble of all sides Twas Lucretia s counsel in Aretine Si vis amica frui promitte finge jura perjura jacta simula mentire and they put it well in practice as Apollo to Daphne five thousand one hundred sixty eight mihi Delphica tellus Et Claros et Tenedos patareaque regia servit Jupiter est genitor Delphos Claros and Tenedos serve me And Jupiter is known my sire to be five thousand one hundred sixty nine The poorest swains will do as much five thousand one hundred seventy Mille pecus nivei sunt et mihi vallibus agni I have a thousand sheep good store of cattle and they are all at her command five thousand one hundred seventy one Tibi nos tibi nostra supellex Ruraque servierint house land goods are at her service as he is himself Dinomachus a senator s son in five thousand one hundred seventy two Lucian in love with a wench inferior to him in birth and fortunes the sooner to accomplish his desire wept unto her and swore he loved her with all his heart and her alone and that as soon as ever his father died a very rich man and almost decrepit he would make her his wife The maid by chance made her mother acquainted with the business who being an old fox well experienced in such matters told her daughter now ready to yield to his desire that he meant nothing less for dost thou think he will ever care for thee being a poor wench five thousand one hundred seventy three that may have his choice of all the beauties in the city one noble by birth with so many talents as young better qualified and fairer than thyself daughter believe him not the maid was abashed and so the matter broke off When Jupiter wooed Juno first Lilius Giraldus relates it out of an old comment on Theocritus the better to effect his suit he turned himself into a cuckoo and spying her one day walking alone separated from the other goddesses caused a tempest suddenly to arise for fear of which she fled to shelter Jupiter to avoid the storm likewise flew into her lap in virginis Junonis gremium devolavit whom Juno for pity covered in her five thousand one hundred seventy four apron But he turned himself forthwith into his own shape began to embrace and offer violence unto her sed illa matris metu abnuebat but she by no means would yield donec pollicitus connubium obtinuit till he vowed and swore to marry her and then she gave consent This fact was done at Thornax hill which ever after was called Cuckoo hill and in perpetual remembrance there was a temple erected to Telia Juno in the same place So powerful are fair promises vows oaths and protestations It is an ordinary thing too in this case to belie their age which widows usually do that mean to marry again and bachelors too sometimes five thousand one hundred seventy five Cujus octavum trepidavit aetas cernere lustrum to say they are younger than they are Carmides in the said Lucian loved Philematium an old maid of forty five years five thousand one hundred seventy six she swore to him she was but thirty two next December But to dissemble in this kind is familiar of all sides and often it takes five thousand one hundred seventy seven Fallere credentem res est operosa puellam tis soon done no such great mastery Egregiam vero laudem et spolia ampla and nothing so frequent as to belie their estates to prefer their suits and to advance themselves Many men to fetch over a young woman widows or whom they love will not stick to crack forge and feign any thing comes next bid his boy fetch his cloak rapier gloves jewels c in such a chest scarlet golden tissue breeches c when there is no such matter or make any scruple to give out as he did in Petronius that he was master of a ship kept so many servants and to personate their part the better take upon them to be gentlemen of good houses well descended and allied hire apparel at brokers some scavenger or prick louse tailors to attend upon them for the time swear they have great possessions five thousand one hundred seventy eight bribe lie cog and foist how dearly they love how bravely they will maintain her like any lady countess duchess or queen they shall have gowns tiers jewels coaches and caroches choice diet The heads of parrots tongues of nightingales The brains of peacocks and of ostriches Their bath shall be the juice of gilliflowers Spirit of roses and of violets The milk of unicorns c as old Volpone courted Celia in the five thousand one hundred seventy nine comedy when as they are no such men not worth a groat but mere sharkers to make a fortune to get their desire or else pretend love to spend their idle hours to be more welcome and for better entertainment The conclusion is they mean nothing less five thousand one hundred eighty Nil metuunt jurare nihil promittere curant Sed simul accupidae mentis satiata libido est Dicta nihil metuere nihil perjuria curant Oaths vows promises are much protested But when their mind and lust is satisfied Oaths vows promises are quite neglected though he solemnly swear by the genius of Caesar by Venus shrine Hymen s deity by Jupiter and all the other gods give no credit to his words For when lovers swear Venus laughs Venus haec perjuria ridet five thousand one hundred eighty one Jupiter himself smiles and pardons it withal as grave five thousand one hundred eighty two Plato gives out of all perjury that alone for love matters is forgiven by the gods If promises lies oaths and protestations will not avail they fall to bribes tokens gifts and such like feats five thousand one hundred eighty three Plurimus auro conciliatur amor as Jupiter corrupted Danae with a golden shower and Liber Ariadne with a lovely crown which was afterwards translated into the heavens and there for ever shines they will rain chickens florins crowns angels all manner of coins and stamps in her lap And so must he certainly do that will speed make many feasts banquets invitations send her some present or other every foot Summo studio parentur epulae saith five thousand one hundred eighty four Haedus et crebrae fiant largitiones he must be very bountiful and liberal seek and sue not to her only but to all her followers friends familiars fiddlers panders parasites and household servants he must insinuate himself and surely will to all of all sorts messengers porters carriers no man must be unrewarded or unrespected I had a suitor saith five thousand one hundred eighty five Aretine s Lucretia that when he came to my house flung gold and silver about as if it had been chaff Another suitor I had was a very choleric fellow but I so handled him that for all his fuming I brought him upon his knees If there had been an excellent bit in the market any novelty fish fruit or fowl muscatel or malmsey or a cup of neat wine in all the city it was presented presently to me though never so dear hard to come by yet I had it the poor fellow was so fond at last that I think if I would I might have had one of his eyes out of his head A third suitor was a merchant of Rome and his manner of wooing was with five thousand one hundred eighty six exquisite music costly banquets poems c I held him off till at length he protested promised and swore pro virginitate regno me donaturum I should have all he had house goods and lauds pro concubitu solo five thousand one hundred eighty seven neither was there ever any conjuror I think to charm his spirits that used such attention or mighty words as he did exquisite phrases or general of any army so many stratagems to win a city as he did tricks and devices to get the love of me Thus men are active and passive and women not far behind them in this kind Audax ad omnia foemina quae vel amat vel odit five thousand one hundred eighty eight For half so boldly there can non Swear and lye as women can five thousand one hundred eighty nine They will crack counterfeit and collogue as well as the best with handkerchiefs and wrought nightcaps purses posies and such toys as he justly complained five thousand one hundred ninety Cur mittis violas nempe ut violentius uret Quid violas violis me violenta tuis c Why dost thou send me violets my dear To make me burn more violent I fear With violets too violent thou art To violate and wound my gentle heart When nothing else will serve the last refuge is their tears Haec scripsi testor amorem mixta lachrymis et suspiriis twixt tears and sighs I write this I take love to witness saith five thousand one hundred ninety one Chelidonia to Philonius Lumina quae modo fulmina jam flumina lachrymarum those burning torches are now turned to floods of tears Aretine s Lucretia when her sweetheart came to town five thousand one hundred ninety two wept in his bosom that he might be persuaded those tears were shed for joy of his return Quartilla in Petronius when nought would move fell a weeping and as Balthazar Castilio paints them out five thousand one hundred ninety three To these crocodile s tears they will add sobs fiery sighs and sorrowful countenance pale colour leanness and if you do but stir abroad these fiends are ready to meet you at every turn with such a sluttish neglected habit dejected look as if they were now ready to die for your sake and how saith he shall a young novice thus beset escape But believe them not five thousand one hundred ninety four animam ne crede puellis Namque est foeminea tutior unda fide Thou thinkest peradventure because of her vows tears smiles and protestations she is solely thine thou hast her heart hand and affection when as indeed there is no such matter as the five thousand one hundred ninety five Spanish bawd said gaudet illa habere unum in lecto alterum in porta tertium qui domi suspiret she will have one sweetheart in bed another in the gate a third sighing at home a fourth c Every young man she sees and likes hath as much interest and shall as soon enjoy her as thyself On the other side which I have said men are as false let them swear protest and lie five thousand one hundred ninety six Quod vobis dicunt dixerunt mille puellis They love some of them those eleven thousand virgins at once and make them believe each particular he is besotted on her or love one till they see another and then her alone like Milo s wife in Apuleius lib two Si quem conspexerit speciosae formae invenem venustate ejus sumitur et in eum animum intorquet Tis their common compliment in that case they care not what they swear say or do One while they slight them care not for them rail downright and scoff at them and then again they will run mad hang themselves stab and kill if they may not enjoy them Henceforth therefore nulla viro juranti foemina credat let not maids believe them These tricks and counterfeit passions are more familiar with women five thousand one hundred ninety seven finem hic dolori faciet aut vitae dies miserere amantis quoth Phaedra to Hippolitus Joessa in five thousand one hundred ninety eight Lucian told Pythias a young man to move him the more that if he would not have her she was resolved to make away herself There is a Nemesis and it cannot choose but grieve and trouble thee to hear that I have either strangled or drowned myself for thy sake Nothing so common to this sex as oaths vows and protestations and as I have already said tears which they have at command for they can so weep that one would think their very hearts were dissolved within them and would come out in tears their eyes are like rocks which still drop water diariae lachrymae et sudoris in modum lurgeri promptae saith five thousand one hundred ninety nine Aristaenetus they wipe away their tears like sweat weep with one eye laugh with the other or as children five thousand two hundred weep and cry they can both together five thousand two hundred one Neve puellarum lachrymis moveare memento Ut flerent oculos erudiere suos Care not for women s tears I counsel thee They teach their eyes as much to weep as see And as much pity is to be taken of a woman weeping as of a goose going barefoot When Venus lost her son Cupid she sent a crier about to bid every one that met him take heed five thousand two hundred two Si fleatam aspicias ne mox fallare caveto Sin arridebit magis effuge et oscula si fors Ferre volet fugito sunt oscula noxia in ipsis Suntque venena labris c Take heed of Cupid s tears if cautious And of his smiles and kisses I thee tell If that he offer t for they be noxious And very poison in his lips doth dwell five thousand two hundred three A thousand years as Castilio conceives will scarce serve to reckon up those allurements and guiles that men and women use to deceive one another with SUBSECT V Bawds Philters Causes When all other engines fail that they can proceed no farther of themselves their last refuge is to fly to bawds panders magical philters and receipts rather than fail to the devil himself Flectere si nequeunt superos Acheronta movebunt And by those indirect means many a man is overcome and precipitated into this malady if he take not good heed For these bawds first they are everywhere so common and so many that as he said of old five thousand two hundred four Croton omnes hic aut captantur aut captant either inveigle or be inveigled we may say of most of our cities there be so many professed cunning bawds in them Besides bawdry is become an art or a liberal science as Lucian calls it and there be such tricks and subtleties so many nurses old women panders letter carriers beggars physicians friars confessors employed about it that nullus tradere stilus sufficiat one saith five thousand two hundred five trecentis versibus Suas impuritias traloqui nemo potest Such occult notes stenography polygraphy Nuntius animatus or magnetical telling of their minds which five thousand two hundred six Cabeus the Jesuit by the way counts fabulous and false cunning conveyances in this kind that neither Juno s jealousy nor Danae s custody nor Argo s vigilancy can keep them safe Tis the last and common refuge to use an assistant such as that Catanean Philippa was to Joan Queen of Naples a five thousand two hundred seven bawd s help an old woman in the business as five thousand two hundred eight Myrrha did when she doted on Cyniras and could not compass her desire the old jade her nurse was ready at a pinch dic inquit opemque me sine ferre tibi et in hac mea pone timorem Sedulitas erit apta libi fear it not if it be possible to be done I will effect it non est mulieri mulier insuperabilis five thousand two hundred nine Caelestina said let him or her be never so honest watched and reserved tis hard but one of these old women will get access and scarce shall you find as five thousand two hundred ten Austin observes in a nunnery a maid alone if she cannot have egress before her window you shall have an old woman or some prating gossip tell her some tales of this clerk and that monk describing or commending some young gentleman or other unto her As I was walking in the street saith a good fellow in Petronius to see the town served one evening five thousand two hundred eleven I spied an old woman in a corner selling of cabbages and roots as our hucksters do plums apples and such like fruits mother quoth he can you tell where I can dwell she being well pleased with my foolish urbanity replied and why sir should I not tell With that she rose up and went before me I took her for a wise woman and by and by she led me into a by lane and told me there I should dwell I replied again I knew not the house but I perceived on a sudden by the naked queans that I was now come into a bawdy house and then too late I began to curse the treachery of this old jade Such tricks you shall have in many places and amongst the rest it is ordinary in Venice and in the island of Zante for a man to be bawd to his own wife No sooner shall you land or come on shore but as the Comical Poet hath it five thousand two hundred twelve Morem hunc meretrices habent Ad portum mittunt servulos ancillulas Si qua peregrina navis in portum aderit Rogant cujatis sit quod ei nomen siet Post illae extemplo sese adplicent These white devils have their panders bawds and factors in every place to seek about and bring in customers to tempt and waylay novices and silly travellers And when they have them once within their clutches as Aegidius Mascrius in his comment upon Valerius Flaccus describes them five thousand two hundred thirteen with promises and pleasant discourse with gifts tokens and taking their opportunities they lay nets which Lucretia cannot avoid and baits that Hippolitus himself would swallow they make such strong assaults and batteries that the goddess of virginity cannot withstand them give gifts and bribes to move Penelope and with threats able to terrify Susanna How many Proserpinas with those catchpoles doth Pluto take These are the sleepy rods with which their souls touched descend to hell this the glue or lime with which the wings of the mind once taken cannot fly away the devil s ministers to allure entice c Many young men and maids without all question are inveigled by these Eumenides and their associates But these are trivial and well known The most sly dangerous and cunning bawds are your knavish physicians empirics mass priests monks five thousand two hundred fourteen Jesuits and friars Though it be against Hippocrates oath some of them will give a dram promise to restore maidenheads and do it without danger make an abortion if need be keep down their paps hinder conception procure lust make them able with Satyrions and now and then step in themselves No monastery so close house so private or prison so well kept but these honest men are admitted to censure and ask questions to feel their pulse beat at their bedside and all under pretence of giving physic Now as for monks confessors and friars as he said five thousand two hundred fifteen Non audet Stygius Pluto tentare quod audet Effrenis monachus plenaque fraudis anus That Stygian Pluto dares not tempt or do What an old hag or monk will undergo either for himself to satisfy his own lust for another if he be hired thereto or both at once having such excellent means For under colour of visitation auricular confession comfort and penance they have free egress and regress and corrupt God knows how many They can such trades some of them practise physic use exorcisms c five thousand two hundred sixteen That whereas was wont to walk and Elf There now walks the Limiter himself In every bush and under every tree There needs no other Incubus but he five thousand two hundred seventeen In the mountains between Dauphine and Savoy the friars persuaded the good wives to counterfeit themselves possessed that their husbands might give them free access and were so familiar in those days with some of them that as one five thousand two hundred eighteen observes wenches could not sleep in their beds for necromantic friars and the good abbess in Boccaccio may in some sort witness that rising betimes mistook and put on the friar s breeches instead of her veil or hat You have heard the story I presume of five thousand two hundred nineteen Paulina a chaste matron in Aegesippus whom one of Isis s priests did prostitute to Mundus a young knight and made her believe it was their god Anubis Many such pranks are played by our Jesuits sometimes in their own habits sometimes in others like soldiers courtiers citizens scholars gallants and women themselves Proteus like in all forms and disguises that go abroad in the night to inescate and beguile young women or to have their pleasure of other men s wives and if we may believe five thousand two hundred twenty some relations they have wardrobes of several suits in the colleges for that purpose Howsoever in public they pretend much zeal seem to be very holy men and bitterly preach against adultery fornication there are no verier bawds or whoremasters in a country five thousand two hundred twenty one whose soul they should gain to God they sacrifice to the devil But I spare these men for the present The last battering engines are philters amulets spells charms images and such unlawful means if they cannot prevail of themselves by the help of bawds panders and their adherents they will fly for succour to the devil himself I know there be those that deny the devil can do any such thing Crato epist two lib med and many divines there is no other fascination than that which comes by the eyes of which I have formerly spoken and if you desire to be better informed read Camerarius oper subcis cent two c five It was given out of old that a Thessalian wench had bewitched King Philip to dote upon her and by philters enforced his love but when Olympia the Queen saw the maid of an excellent beauty well brought up and qualified these quoth she were the philters which inveigled King Philip those the true charms as Henry to Rosamond five thousand two hundred twenty two One accent from thy lips the blood more warms Than all their philters exorcisms and charms With this alone Lucretia brags five thousand two hundred twenty three in Aretine she could do more than all philosophers astrologers alchemists necromancers witches and the rest of the crew As for herbs and philters I could never skill of them The sole philter that ever I used was kissing and embracing by which alone I made men rave like beasts stupefied and compelled them to worship me like an idol In our times it is a common thing saith Erastus in his book de Lamiis for witches to take upon them the making of these philters five thousand two hundred twenty four to force men and women to love and hate whom they will to cause tempests diseases c by charms spells characters knots five thousand two hundred twenty five hic Thessala vendit Philtra saint Hierome proves that they can do it as in Hilarius life epist lib three he hath a story of a young man that with a philter made a maid mad for the love of him which maid was after cured by Hilarion Such instances I find in John Nider Formicar lib five cap five Plutarch records of Lucullus that he died of a philter and that Cleopatra used philters to inveigle Antony amongst other allurements Eusebius reports as much of Lucretia the poet Panormitan lib four de gest Aphonsi hath a story of one Stephan a Neapolitan knight that by a philter was forced to run mad for love But of all others that which five thousand two hundred twenty six Petrarch epist famil lib one ep five relates of Charles the Great Charlemagne is most memorable He foolishly doted upon a woman of mean

thinks upon the man That was so fine so fair so blithe so debonair Clitophon in the first book of Achilles Tatius complaineth how that his mistress Leucippe tormented him much more in the night than in the day five thousand three hundred thirty three For all day long he had some object or other to distract his senses but in the night all ran upon her All night long he lay five thousand three

my sight In the meantime he raves on her her sweet face eyes actions gestures hands feet speech length breadth height depth and the rest of her dimensions are so surveyed measured and taken by that Astrolabe of phantasy and that so violently sometimes with such earnestness and eagerness such continuance so strong an imagination that at length he thinks he sees her indeed he talks with her he embraceth her Ixion like pro Junone nubem a cloud for Juno as he said Nihil praeter Leucippen cerno Leucippe mihi perpetuo in oculis et animo versatur I see and meditate of nought but Leucippe Be she present or absent all is one five thousand three hundred forty Et quamvis aberat placidae praesentia formae Quem dederat praesens forma manebat amor That impression of her beauty is still fixed in his

in his eyes ears heart in all his senses Valleriola had a merchant his patient in the same predicament and five thousand three hundred forty two Ulricus Molitor out of Austin hath a story of one that through vehemency of his love passion still thought he saw his mistress present with him she talked with him Et commisceri cum ea vigilans videbatur still embracing him Now if this passion of love can produce such effects if it be pleasantly intended what bitter torments shall it breed when it is with fear and continual sorrow suspicion care agony as commonly it is still accompanied what an intolerable five thousand three hundred forty three pain must it be Non tam grandes Gargara culmos quot demerso Pectore curas longa nexas Usque catena vel quae penitus Crudelis amor vulnera miscet Mount Gargarus hath not so many stems As lover s breast hath grievous wounds And linked cares which love compounds When the King of Babylon would have punished a courtier of his for loving of a young lady of the royal blood and far above his fortunes five thousand three hundred forty four Apollonius in presence by all means persuaded to let him alone For to love and not enjoy was a most unspeakable torment no tyrant could invent the like punishment as a gnat at a candle in a short space he would consume himself For love is a perpetual five thousand three hundred forty five flux angor animi a warfare militat omni amans a grievous wound is love still and a lover s heart is Cupid s quiver a consuming five thousand three hundred forty six fire five thousand three hundred forty seven accede ad hunc ignem c an inextinguishable fire five thousand three hundred forty eight alitur et crescit malum Et ardet intus qualis Aetnaeo vapor Exundat antro As Aetna rageth so doth love and more than Aetna or any material fire five thousand three hundred forty nine Nam amor saepe Lypareo Vulcano ardentiorem flammam incendere solet Vulcan s flames are but smoke to this For fire saith five thousand three hundred fifty Xenophon burns them alone that stand near it or touch it but this fire of love burneth and scorcheth afar off and is more hot and vehement than any material fire five thousand three hundred fifty one Ignis in igne furit tis a fire in a fire the quintessence of fire For when Nero burnt Rome as Calisto urgeth he fired houses consumed men s bodies and goods but this fire devours the soul itself and five thousand three hundred fifty two one soul is worth a hundred thousand bodies No water can quench this wild fire five thousand three hundred fifty three In pectus coecos absorbuit ignes Ignes qui nec aqua perimi potuere nec imbre Diminui neque graminibus magicisque susurris A fire he took into his breast Which water could not quench Nor herb nor art nor magic spells Could quell nor any drench Except it be tears and sighs for so they may chance find a little ease five thousand three hundred fifty four Sic candentia colla sic patens frons Sic me blanda tui

it not for my dropping tears that hinder I should be quite burnt up forthwith to cinder This fire strikes like lightning which made those old Grecians paint Cupid in many of their five thousand three hundred fifty five temples with Jupiter s thunderbolts in his hands for it wounds and cannot be perceived how whence it came where it pierced five thousand three hundred fifty six Urimur et coecum pectora vulnus habent and can hardly be discerned at first five thousand three hundred fifty seven Est mollis flamma medullas Et tacitum insano vivit sub pectore vulnus A gentle wound an easy fire it

atque per venas meat Visceribus ignis mersus et venis latens Ut agilis altas flamma percurrit trabes This fiery vapour rageth in the veins And scorcheth entrails as when fire burns A house it nimbly runs along the beams And at the last the whole it overturns Abraham Hoffemannus lib one amor conjugal cap two p twenty two relates out of Plato how that Empedocles the philosopher was present at the cutting up of one that died for love five thousand three hundred fifty nine his heart was combust his liver smoky his lungs dried up insomuch that he verily believed his soul was either sodden or roasted through the vehemency of love s fire Which belike made a modern writer of amorous emblems express love s fury by a pot hanging over the fire and Cupid blowing the coals As the heat consumes the water five thousand three hundred sixty Sic sua consumit viscera coecus amor so doth love dry up his radical moisture Another compares love to a melting torch which stood too near the fire five thousand three hundred sixty one Sic quo quis proprior suae puellae est Hoc stultus proprior suae runinae est The nearer he unto his mistress is The nearer he unto his ruin is So that to say truth as five thousand three hundred sixty two Castilio describes it The beginning middle end of love is nought else but sorrow vexation agony torment irksomeness wearisomeness so that to be squalid ugly miserable solitary discontent dejected to wish for death to complain rave and to be peevish are the certain signs and ordinary actions of a lovesick person This continual pain and torture makes them forget themselves if they be far gone with it in doubt despair of obtaining or eagerly bent to neglect all ordinary business five thousand three hundred sixty three pendent opera interrupta minaeque

nor whence I come nor whether I will what I do P five thousand three hundred seventy How so Ch I am in love Prudens sciens five thousand three hundred seventy one vivus vidensque pereo nec quid agam scio five thousand three hundred seventy two He that erst had his thoughts free as Philostratus Lemnius in an epistle of his describes this fiery passion and spent his time like a hard student in those delightsome philosophical precepts he that with the sun and moon wandered all over the world with stars themselves ranged about and left no secret or small mystery in nature unsearched since he was enamoured can do nothing now but think and meditate of love matters day and night composeth himself how to please his mistress all his study endeavour is to approve himself to his mistress to win his mistress favour to compass his desire to be counted her servant When Peter Abelard that great scholar of his age Cui soli patuit scibile quicquid erat five thousand three hundred seventy three whose faculties were equal to any difficulty in learning was now in love with Heloise he had no mind to visit or frequent schools and scholars any more Taediosum mihi valde fuit as he five thousand three hundred seventy four confesseth ad scholas procedere vel in iis morari all his mind was on his new mistress Now to this end and purpose if there be any hope of obtaining his suit to prosecute his cause he will spend himself goods fortunes for her and though he lose and alienate all his friends be threatened be cast off and disinherited for as the poet saith Amori quis legem det five thousand three hundred seventy five though he be utterly undone by it disgraced go a begging yet for her sweet sake to enjoy her he will willingly beg hazard all he hath goods lands shame scandal fame and life itself Non recedam neque quiescam noctu et interdiu profecto quam aut ipsam aut mortem investigavero I ll never rest or cease my suit Till she or death do make me mute Parthenis in Aristaenetus five thousand three hundred seventy six was fully resolved to do as much I may have better matches I confess but farewell shame farewell honour farewell honesty farewell friends and fortunes c O Harpedona keep my counsel I will leave all for his sweet sake I will have him say no more contra gentes I am resolved I will have him Gobrias five thousand three hundred seventy seven the captain when he had espied Rhodanthe the fair captive maid fell upon his knees before Mystilus the general with tears vows and all the rhetoric he could by the scars he had formerly received the good service he had done or whatsoever else was dear unto him besought his governor he might have the captive virgin to be his wife virtutis suae spolium as a reward of his worth and service and moreover he would forgive him the money which was owing and all reckonings besides due unto him I ask no more no part of booty no portion but Rhodanthe to be my wife And when as he could not compass her by fair means he fell to treachery force and villainy and set his life at stake at last to accomplish his desire Tis a common humour this a general passion of all lovers to be so affected and which Aemilia told Aratine a courtier in Castilio s discourse surely Aratine if thou werst not so indeed thou didst not love ingenuously confess for if thou hadst been thoroughly enamoured thou wouldst have desired nothing more than to please thy mistress For that is the law of love to will and nill the same five thousand three hundred seventy eight Tantum velle et nolle velit nolit quod amica five thousand three hundred seventy nine Undoubtedly this may be pronounced of them all they are very slaves drudges for the time madmen fools dizzards atrabilarii five thousand three hundred eighty beside themselves and as blind as beetles Their dotage five thousand three hundred eighty one is most eminent Amore simul et sapere ipsi Jovi non datur as Seneca holds Jupiter himself cannot love and be wise both together the very best of them if once they be overtaken with this passion the most staid discreet grave generous and wise otherwise able to govern themselves in this commit many absurdities many indecorums unbefitting their gravity and persons five thousand three hundred eighty two Quisquis amat servit sequitur captivus amantem Fert domita cervice jugum Samson David Solomon Hercules Socrates c are justly taxed of indiscretion in this point the middle sort are between hawk and buzzard and although they do perceive and acknowledge their own dotage weakness fury yet they cannot withstand it

fortunes shame disgrace danger and an ocean of cares that will certainly follow yet this furious lust precipitates counterpoiseth weighs down on the other though it be their utter undoing perpetual infamy loss yet they will do it and become at last insensati void of sense degenerate into dogs hogs asses brutes as Jupiter into a bull Apuleius an ass Lycaon a wolf Tereus a lapwing five thousand

Immundam e tanto culmine fecit avem five thousand three hundred eighty nine I was a king my crown my witness is But by my filthiness am come to this Their blindness is all out as great as manifest as their weakness and dotage or rather an inseparable companion an ordinary sign of it five thousand three hundred ninety love is blind as the saying is Cupid s blind and so are all his followers

Mopsus Be thou the marigold and I will be the sun Be thou the friar and I will be the nun I could repeat centuries of such Now tell me what greater dotage or blindness can there be than this in both sexes and yet their slavery is more eminent a greater sign of their folly than the rest They are commonly slaves captives voluntary servants Amator amicae mancipium as five thousand four hundred

cares actions all his thoughts are subordinate to her will and commandment her most devote obsequious affectionate servant and vassal For love as five thousand four hundred twenty one Cyrus in Xenophon well observed is a mere tyranny worse than any disease and they that are troubled with it desire to be free and cannot but are harder bound than if they were in iron chains What greater captivity or slavery can there be as five thousand four hundred twenty two Tully expostulates than to be in love Is he a free man over whom a woman domineers to whom she prescribes laws commands forbids what she will herself that dares deny nothing she demands she asks he gives she calls he comes she threatens he fears Nequissimum hunc servum puto I account this man a very drudge And as he follows it five thousand four hundred twenty three Is this no small servitude for an enamourite to be every hour combing his head stiffening his beard perfuming his hair washing his face with sweet water painting curling and not to come abroad but sprucely crowned decked and apparelled Yet these are but toys in respect to go to the barber baths theatres c he must attend upon her wherever she goes run along the streets by her doors and windows to see her take all opportunities sleeveless errands disguise counterfeit shapes and as many forms as Jupiter himself ever took and come every day to her house as he will surely do if he be truly enamoured and offer her service and follow her up and down from room to room as Lucretia s suitors did he cannot contain himself but he will do it he must and will be where she is sit next her still talking with her five thousand four hundred twenty four If I did but let my glove fall by chance as the said Aretine s Lucretia brags I had one of my suitors nay two or three at once ready to stoop and take it up and kiss it and with a low conge deliver it unto me if I would walk another was ready to sustain me by the arm A third to provide fruits pears plums cherries or whatsoever I would eat or drink All this and much more he doth in her presence and when he comes home as Troilus to his Cressida tis all his meditation to recount with himself his actions words gestures what entertainment he had how kindly she used him in such a place how she smiled how she graced him and that infinitely pleased him and then he breaks out O sweet Areusa O my dearest Antiphila O most divine looks O lovely graces and thereupon instantly he makes an epigram or a sonnet to five or seven tunes in her commendation or else he ruminates how she rejected his service denied him a kiss disgraced him c and that as effectually torments him And these are his exercises between comb and glass madrigals elegies c these his cogitations till he see her again But all this is easy and gentle and the least part of his labour and bondage no hunter will take such pains for his game fowler for his sport or soldier to sack a city as he will for his mistress favour five thousand four hundred twenty five Ipsa comes veniam neque me salebrosa movebunt Saxa nec obliquo dente timendus aper As Phaedra to Hippolitus No danger shall affright for if that be true the poets feign Love is the son of Mars and Venus as he hath delights pleasures elegances from his mother so hath he hardness valour and boldness from his father And tis true that Bernard hath Amore nihil mollius nihil volentius nothing so boisterous nothing so tender as love If once therefore enamoured he will go run ride many a mile to meet her day and night in a very dark night endure scorching heat

she to try him belike what he would do for her sake bade him in jest leap into the river Po if he loved her he forthwith did leap headlong off the bridge and was drowned Another at Ficinum in like

acceptable and welcome guest yet I had rather give it my dear Clinia than take it of others I had rather serve him than command others I had rather be his drudge than take my ease undergo any danger for his sake than live in security For I had rather see Clinia than all the world besides and had rather want the sight of all other things than him alone I am angry with the night and sleep that I may not see him and thank the light and sun because they show me my Clinia I will run into the fire for his sake and if you did but see him I know that you likewise would run with me So Philostratus to his mistress five thousand four hundred thirty four Command me what you will I will do it bid me go to sea I am gone in an instant take so many stripes I am ready run through the fire and lay down my life and soul at thy feet tis done So did Aeolus to Juno Tuus o regina quod optas Explorare labor mihi jussa capescere fas est O queen it is thy pains to enjoin me still And I am bound to execute

to hear her sweet voice to go in and out with her to have every other business common with her I would labour when she labours sail when she sails he that hates her should hate me and if a tyrant kill her he should kill me if she should die I would not live and one grave should hold us both five thousand four hundred thirty eight Finiet illa meos moriens morientis amores Abrocomus in five thousand

his love and kill him coming back five thousand four hundred forty one Parcite dum propero mergite dum redeo Spare me whilst I go drown me as I return Tis the common humour of them all to contemn death to wish for death to confront death in this case Quippe queis nec fera nec ignis neque praecipitium nec fretum nec ensis neque laqueus gravia videntur Tis their desire saith Tyrius to die Haud timet mortem cupit ire in ipsos obvius enses He does not fear death he desireth such upon the very swords Though a thousand dragons or devils keep the gates Cerberus himself Scyron and Procrastes lay in wait and the way as dangerous as inaccessible as hell through fiery flames and over burning coulters he will adventure for all this And as five thousand four hundred forty two Peter Abelard lost his testicles for his Heloise he will I say not venture an incision but life itself For how many gallants offered to lose their lives for a night s lodging with Cleopatra in those days and in the hour or moment of death tis their sole comfort to remember their dear mistress as five thousand four hundred forty three Zerbino slain in France and Brandimart in Barbary as Arcite did his Emily five thousand four hundred forty four when he felt death Dusked been his eyes and faded is his breath But on his lady yet casteth he his eye His last word was mercy Emely His spirit chang d and out went

account of it but courageously for love died till Pelops at last won her by a sleight five thousand four hundred forty six As many gallants desperately adventured their dearest blood for Atalanta the daughter of Schenius in hope of marriage all vanquished and overcame till Hippomenes by a few golden apples happily obtained his suit Perseus of old fought with a sea monster for Andromeda s sake and our saint George freed the king s daughter of Sabea the golden legend is mine author that was exposed to a dragon by a terrible combat Our knights errant and the Sir Lancelots of these days I hope will adventure as much for ladies favours as the Squire of Dames Knight of the Sun Sir Bevis of Southampton or that renowned peer five thousand four hundred forty seven Orlando who long time had loved dear Angelica the fair and for her sake About the world in nations far and near Did high attempts perform and undertake he is a very dastard a coward a block and a beast that will not do as much but they will sure they will for it is an ordinary thing for these inamoratos of our time to say and do more to stab their arms carouse in blood five thousand four hundred forty eight or as that Thessalian Thero that bit off his own thumb provocans rivalem ad hoc aemulandum to make his company rival do as much Tis frequent with them to challenge the field for their lady and mistress sake to run a tilt five thousand four hundred forty nine That either bears so furiously they meet The other down under the horses feet and then up and to it again And with their axes both so sorely pour That neither plate nor mail sustain d the stour But riveld wreak like rotten wood asunder And fire did flash like lightning after thunder and in her quarrel to fight so long five thousand four hundred fifty till their headpiece bucklers be all broken and swords hacked like so many saws for they must not see her abused in any sort tis blasphemy to speak against her a dishonour without all good respect to name her Tis common with these creatures to drink five thousand four hundred fifty one healths upon their bare knees though it were a mile to the bottom no matter of what mixture off it comes If she bid them they will go barefoot to Jerusalem to the great Cham s court five thousand four hundred fifty two to the East Indies to fetch her a bird to wear in her hat and with Drake and Candish sail round about the world for her sweet sake adversis ventis serve twice seven years as Jacob did for Rachel do as much as five thousand four hundred fifty three Gesmunda the daughter of Tancredus prince of Salerna did for Guisardus her true love eat his heart when he died or as Artemisia drank her husband s bones beaten to powder and so bury him in herself and endure more torments than Theseus or Paris Et his colitur Venus magis quam thure et victimis with such sacrifices as these as five thousand four hundred fifty four Aristaenetus holds Venus is well pleased Generally they undertake any pain any labour any toil for their mistress sake love and admire a servant not to her alone but to all her friends and followers they hug and embrace them for her sake her dog picture and everything she wears they adore it as a relic If any man come from her they feast him reward him will not be out of his company do him all offices still remembering still talking of her five thousand four hundred fifty five Nam si abest quod ames praesto simulacra tamen sunt Illius et nomen dulce observatur ad aures The very carrier that comes from him to her is a most welcome guest and if he bring a letter she will read it twenty times over and as five thousand four hundred fifty six Lucretia did by Euryalus kiss the letter a thousand times together and then read it And five thousand four hundred fifty seven Chelidonia by Philonius after many sweet kisses put the letter in her bosom And kiss again and often look thereon And stay the messenger that would be gone And asked many pretty questions over and over again as how he looked what he did and what he said In a word five thousand four hundred fifty eight Vult placere sese amicae vult mihi vult pedissequae Vult

shoe tie a lace a ring a bracelet of hair five thousand four hundred fifty nine Pignusque direptum lacertis Aut digito male pertinaci he wears it for a favour on his arm in his hat finger or next his heart Her picture he adores twice a day and for two hours together will not look off it as Laodamia did by Protesilaus when he went to war five thousand four hundred sixty sit at home with his picture before her a garter or a bracelet of hers is more precious than any saint s relic he lays it up in his casket O blessed relic and every day will kiss it if in her presence his eye is never off her and

way to walk by that river s side which though far away runs by the house where she dwells he loves the wind blows to that coast five thousand four hundred sixty two O quoties dixi Zephyris properantibus illuc Felices pulchram visuri Amaryllada venti O happy western winds that blow that way For you shall see my love s fair face to day He will send a message to her by the wind five

is still with her five thousand four hundred sixty five to talk of her admiring and commending her lamenting moaning wishing himself anything for her sake to have opportunity to see her O that he might but enjoy her presence So did Philostratus to his mistress five thousand four hundred sixty six O happy ground on which she treads and happy were I if she would tread upon me I think her countenance would make the rivers stand and when she comes abroad birds will sing and come about her Ridebunt valles ridebunt obvia Tempe In florem viridis protinus ibi humus The fields will laugh the pleasant valleys burn And all the grass will into flowers turn Omnis Ambrosiam spirabit aura five thousand four hundred sixty seven When she is in the meadow she is fairer than any flower for that lasts but for a day the river is pleasing but it vanisheth on a sudden but thy flower doth not fade thy stream is greater than the sea If I look upon the heaven methinks I see the sun fallen down to shine below and thee to shine in his place whom I desire If I look upon the night methinks I see two more glorious stars Hesperus and thyself A little after he thus courts his mistress five thousand four hundred sixty eight If thou goest forth of the city the protecting gods that keep the town will run after to gaze upon thee if thou sail upon the seas as so many small boats they will follow thee what river would not run into the sea Another he sighs and sobs swears he hath Cor scissum a heart bruised to powder dissolved and melted within him or quite gone from him to his mistress bosom belike he is in an oven a salamander in the fire so scorched with love s heat he wisheth himself a saddle for her to sit on a posy for her to smell to and it would not grieve him to be hanged if he might be strangled in her garters he would willingly die tomorrow so that she might kill him with her own hands five thousand four hundred sixty nine Ovid would be a flea a gnat a ring Catullus a sparrow five

five thousand four hundred eighty O God thou hast made this man whiter than the sun but me mine husband and all my children black I would to God he were my husband or that I had such a son she fell a weeping and so impatient for love at last that as Potiphar s wife did by Joseph she would have had him gone in with her she sent away Gazella Tegeia Galzerana her waiting maids loaded him with fair promises and gifts and wooed him with all the rhetoric she could extremum hoc miserae da munus amanti grant this last request to a wretched lover But when he gave not consent she would have gone with him and left all to be his page his servant or his lackey Certa sequi charum corpus ut umbra solet so that she might enjoy him threatening moreover to kill herself c Men will do as much and more for

peradventure so dost thou They will adventure their lives with alacrity five thousand four hundred eighty two pro qua non metuam mori nay more pro qua non metuam bis mori I will die twice nay twenty times for her If she die there s no remedy they must die with her they cannot help it A lover in Calcagninus wrote this on his darling s tomb Quincia obiit sed non Quincia sola obiit Quincia obiit sed cum Quincia et ipse obii Risus obit obit gratia lusus obit Nec mea nunc anima in pectore at in tumulo est Quincia my dear is dead but not alone For I am dead and with her I am gone Sweet smiles mirth graces all with her do rest And my soul too for tis not in my breast How many doting lovers upon the like occasion might say the same But these are toys in respect they will hazard their very souls for their mistress sake Atque aliquis interjuvenes miratus est et verbum dixit Non ego in caelo cuperem Deus esse Nostram uxorem habens domi Hero One said to heaven would I not desire at all to go If that at mine own house I had such a fine wife as Hero Venus forsook heaven for Adonis sake five thousand four hundred eighty three caelo praefertur Adonis Old Janivere in Chaucer thought when he had his fair May he should never go to heaven he should live so merrily here on earth had I such a mistress he protests five thousand four hundred eighty four Caelum diis ego non suum inviderem Sed sortem mihi dii meam inviderent I would not envy their prosperity The gods should envy my felicity Another as earnestly desires to behold his sweetheart he will adventure and leave all this and more than this to see her alone five thousand four hundred eighty five Omnia quae patior mala si pensare velit fors Una aliqua nobis prosperitate dii Hoc precor ut faciant faciant me cernere coram Cor mihi captivum quae tenet hocce deam If all my mischiefs were recompensed And God would give we what I requested I would my mistress presence only seek Which doth mine heart in prison captive keep But who can reckon upon the dotage madness servitude and blindness the foolish phantasms and vanities of lovers their torments wishes idle attempts Yet for all this amongst so many irksome absurd troublesome symptoms inconveniences fantastical fits and passions which are usually incident to such persons there be some good and graceful qualities in lovers which this affection causeth As it makes wise men fools so many times it makes fools become wise five thousand four hundred eighty six it makes base fellows become generous cowards courageous as Cardan notes out of Plutarch covetous liberal and magnificent clowns civil cruel gentle wicked profane persons to become religious slovens neat churls merciful and dumb dogs eloquent your lazy drones quick and nimble Feras mentes domat cupido that fierce cruel and rude Cyclops Polyphemus sighed and shed many a salt tear for Galatea s sake No passion causeth greater alterations or more vehement of joy or discontent Plutarch Sympos lib five quaest one five thousand four hundred eighty seven saith that the soul of a man in love is full of perfumes and sweet odours and all manner of pleasing tones and tunes insomuch that it is hard to say as he adds whether love do mortal men more harm than good It adds spirits and makes them otherwise soft and silly generous and courageous five thousand four hundred eighty eight Audacem faciebat amor Ariadne s love made Theseus so adventurous and Medea s beauty Jason so victorious expectorat amor timorem five thousand four hundred eighty nine Plato is of opinion that the love of Venus made Mars so valorous A young man will be much abashed to commit any foul offence that shall come to the hearing or sight of his mistress As five thousand four hundred ninety he that desired of his enemy now dying to lay him with his face upward ne amasius videret eum a tergo vulneratum lest his sweetheart should say he was a coward And if it were five thousand four hundred ninety one possible to have an army consist of lovers such as love or are beloved they would be extraordinary valiant and wise in their government modesty would detain them from doing amiss emulation incite them to do that which is good and honest and a few of them would overcome a great company of others There is no man so pusillanimous so very a dastard whom love would not incense make of a divine temper and an heroical spirit As he said in like case five thousand four hundred ninety two Tota ruat caeli moles non terreor c Nothing can terrify nothing can dismay them But as Sir Blandimor and Paridel those two brave fairy knights fought for the love of fair Florimel in presence five thousand four hundred ninety three And drawing both their swords with rage anew Like two mad mastives each other slew And shields did share and males did rash and helms did hew So furiously each other did assail As if their souls at once they would have rent Out of their breasts that streams of blood did trail Adown as if their springs of life were spent That all the ground with purple blood was sprent And all their armour stain d with bloody gore Yet scarcely once to breath would they relent So mortal was their malice and so sore That both resolved than yield to die before Every base swain in love will dare to do as much for his dear mistress sake He will fight and fetch five thousand four hundred ninety four Argivum Clypeum that famous buckler of Argos to do her service adventure at all undertake any enterprise And as Serranus the Spaniard then Governor of Sluys made answer to Marquess Spinola if the enemy brought fifty thousand devils against him he would keep it The nine worthies Oliver and Rowland and forty dozen of peers are all in him he is all mettle armour of proof more than a man and in this case improved beyond himself For as five thousand four hundred ninety five Agatho contends a true lover is wise just temperate and valiant five thousand four hundred ninety six I doubt not therefore but if a man had such an army of lovers as Castilio supposeth he might soon conquer all the world except by chance he met with such another army of inamoratos to oppose it five thousand four hundred ninety seven For so perhaps they might fight as that fatal dog and fatal hare in the heavens course one another round and never make an end Castilio thinks Ferdinand King of Spain would never have conquered Granada had not Queen Isabel and her ladies been present at the siege five thousand four hundred ninety eight It cannot be expressed what courage the Spanish knights took when the ladies were present a few Spaniards overcame a multitude of Moors They will undergo any danger whatsoever as Sir Walter Manny in Edward the Third s time stuck full of ladies favours fought like a dragon For soli amantes as five thousand four hundred ninety nine Plato holds pro amicis mori appetunt only lovers will die for their friends and in their mistress quarrel And for that cause he would have women follow the camp to be spectators and encouragers of noble actions upon such an occasion the five thousand five hundred Squire of Dames himself Sir Lancelot or Sir Tristram Caesar or Alexander shall not be more resolute or go beyond them Not courage only doth love add but as I said subtlety wit and many pretty devices five thousand five hundred one Namque dolos inspirat amor fraudesque ministrat five thousand five hundred two Jupiter in love with Leda and not knowing how to compass his desire turned himself into a swan and got Venus to pursue him in the likeness of an eagle which she doing for shelter he fled to Leda s lap et in ejus gremio se collocavit Leda embraced him and so fell fast asleep sed dormientem Jupiter compressit by which means Jupiter had his will Infinite such tricks love can devise such fine feats in abundance with wisdom and wariness five thousand five hundred three quis fallere possit amantem All manner of civility decency compliment and good behaviour plus solis et leporis polite graces and merry conceits Boccaccio hath a pleasant tale to this purpose which he borrowed from the Greeks and which Beroaldus hath turned into Latin Bebelius in verse of Cymon and Iphigenia This Cymon was a fool a proper man of person and the governor of Cyprus son but a very ass insomuch that his father being ashamed of him sent him to a farmhouse he had in the country to be brought up Where by chance as his manner was walking alone he espied a gallant young gentlewoman named Iphigenia a burgomaster s daughter of Cyprus with her maid by a brook side in a little thicket fast asleep in her smock where she had newly bathed herself When five thousand five hundred four Cymon saw her he stood leaning on his staff gaping on her immovable and in amaze at last he fell so far in love with the glorious object that he began to rouse himself up to bethink what he was would needs follow her to the city and for her sake began to be civil to learn to sing and dance to play on instruments and got all those gentlemanlike qualities and compliments in a short space which his friends were most glad of In brief he became from an idiot and a clown to be one of the most complete gentlemen in Cyprus did many valorous exploits and all for the love of mistress Iphigenia In a word I may say thus much of them all let them be never so clownish rude and horrid Grobians and sluts if once they be in love they will be most neat and spruce for five thousand five hundred five Omnibus rebus et nitidis nitoribus antevenit amor they will follow the fashion begin to trick up and to have a good opinion of themselves venustatem enim mater Venus a ship is not so long a rigging as a young gentlewoman a trimming up herself against her sweetheart comes A painter s shop a flowery meadow no so gracious aspect in nature s storehouse as a young maid nubilis puella a Novitsa or Venetian bride that looks for a husband or a young man that is her suitor composed looks composed gait clothes gestures actions all composed all the graces elegances in the world are in her face Their best robes ribands chains jewels lawns linens laces spangles must come on five thousand five hundred six praeter quam res patitur student elegantiae they are beyond all measure coy nice and too curious on a sudden tis all their study all their business how to wear their clothes neat to be polite and terse and to set out themselves No sooner doth a young man see his sweetheart coming but he smugs up himself pulls up his cloak now fallen about his shoulders ties his garters points sets his band cuffs slicks his hair twires his beard c When Mercury was to come before his mistress five thousand five hundred seven Chlamydemque ut pendeat apte Collocat ut limbus totumque appareat aurum He put his cloak in order that the lace And hem and gold work all might have his grace Salmacis would not be seen of Hermaphroditus till she had spruced up herself first five thousand five hundred eight Nec tamen ante adiit etsi properabat adire Quam se composuit quam circumspexit amictus Et finxit vultum et meruit formosa videri Nor did she come although twas her desire Till she compos d herself and trimm d her tire And set her looks to make him to admire Venus had so ordered the matter that when her son five thousand five hundred nine Aeneas was to appear before Queen Dido he was Os humerosque deo similis namque ipsa decoram Caesariem nato genetrix lumenque juventae Purpureum et laetos oculis afflarat honores like a god for she was the tire woman herself to set him out with all natural and artificial impostures As mother Mammea did her son Heliogabalus new chosen emperor when he was to be seen of the people first When the hirsute cyclopical Polyphemus courted Galatea five thousand five hundred ten Jamque tibi formae jamque est tibi cura placendi Jam rigidos pectis rastris Polypheme capillos Jam libet hirsutam tibi falce recidere barbam Et spectare feros in aqua et componere vultus And then he did begin to prank himself To plait and comb his head and beard to shave And look his face i th water as a glass And to compose himself for to be brave He was upon a sudden now spruce and keen as a new ground hatchet He now began to have a good opinion of his own features and good parts now to be a gallant Jam Galatea veni nec munera despice nostra Certe ego me novi liquidaque in imagine vidi Nuper aquae placuitque mihi mea forma videnti Come now my Galatea scorn me not Nor my poor presents for but yesterday I saw myself i th water and methought Full fair I was then scorn me not I say five thousand five hundred eleven Non sum adeo informis nuper me in littore vidi Cum placidum ventis staret mare Tis the common humour of all suitors to trick up themselves to be prodigal in apparel pure lotus neat combed and curled with powdered hair comptus et calimistratus with a long love lock a flower in his ear perfumed gloves rings scarves feathers points c as if he were a prince s Ganymede with everyday new suits as the fashion varies going as if he trod upon eggs as Heinsius writ to Primierus five thousand five hundred twelve if once he be besotten on a wench he must like awake at nights renounce his book sigh and lament now and then weep for his hard hap and mark above all things what hats bands doublets breeches are in fashion how to cut his beard and wear his locks to turn up his mustachios and curl his head prune his pickedevant or if he wear it abroad that the east side be correspondent to the west he may be scoffed at otherwise as Julian that apostate emperor was for wearing a long hirsute goatish beard fit to make ropes with as in his Mysopogone or that apologetical oration he made at Antioch to excuse himself he doth ironically confess it hindered his kissing nam non licuit inde pura puris eoque suavioribus labra labris adjungere but he did not much esteem it as it seems by the sequel de accipiendis dandisve osculis non laboro yet to follow mine author it may much concern a young lover he must be more respectful in this behalf he must be in league with an excellent tailor barber five thousand five hundred thirteen Tonsorem pucrum sed arte talem Qualis nec Thalamis fuit Neronis have neat shoe ties points garters speak in print walk in print eat and drink in print and that which is all in all he must be mad in print Amongst other good qualities an amorous fellow is endowed with he must learn to sing and dance play upon some instrument or other as without all doubt he will if he be truly touched with this loadstone of love For as five thousand five hundred fourteen Erasmus hath it Musicam docet amor et Poesia love will make them musicians and to compose ditties madrigals elegies love sonnets and sing them to several pretty tunes to get all good qualities may be had five thousand five hundred fifteen Jupiter perceived Mercury to be in love with Philologia because he learned languages polite speech for Suadela herself was Venus daughter as some write arts and sciences quo virgini placeret all to ingratiate himself and please his mistress Tis their chiefest study to sing dance and without question so many gentlemen and gentlewomen would not be so well qualified in this kind if love did not incite them five thousand five hundred sixteen Who saith Castilio would learn to play or give his mind to music learn to dance or make so many rhymes love songs as most do but for women s sake because they hope by that means to purchase their good wills and win their favour We see this daily verified in our young women and wives they that being maids took so much pains to sing play and dance with such cost and charge to their parents to get those graceful qualities now being married will scarce touch an instrument they care not for it Constantine agricult lib eleven cap eighteen makes Cupid himself to be a great dancer by the same token as he was capering amongst the gods five thousand five hundred seventeen he flung down a bowl of nectar which distilling upon the white rose ever since made it red and Calistratus by the help of Dedalus about Cupid s statue five thousand five hundred eighteen made a many of young wenches still a dancing to signify belike that Cupid was much affected with it as without all doubt he was For at his and Psyche s wedding the gods being present to grace the feast Ganymede filled nectar in abundance as five thousand five hundred nineteen Apuleius describes it Vulcan was the cook the Hours made all fine with roses and flowers Apollo played on the harp the Muses sang to it sed suavi Musicae super ingressa Venus saltavit but his mother Venus danced to his and their sweet content Witty five thousand five hundred twenty Lucian in that pathetical love passage or pleasant description of Jupiter s stealing of Europa and swimming from Phoenicia to Crete makes the sea calm the winds hush Neptune and Amphitrite riding in their chariot to break the waves before them the tritons dancing round about with every one a torch the sea nymphs half naked keeping time on dolphins backs and singing Hymeneus Cupid nimbly tripping on the top of the waters and Venus herself coming after in a shell strewing roses and flowers on their heads Praxiteles in all his pictures of love feigns Cupid ever smiling and looking upon dancers and in saint Mark s in Rome whose work I know not one of the most delicious pieces is a many of five thousand five hundred twenty one satyrs dancing about a wench asleep So that dancing still is as it were a necessary appendix to love matters Young lasses are never better pleased than when as upon a holiday after evensong they may meet their sweethearts and dance about a maypole or in a town green under a shady elm Nothing so familiar in five thousand five hundred twenty two France as for citizens wives and maids to dance a round in the streets and often too for want of better instruments to make good music of their own voices and dance after it Yea many times this love will make old men and women that have more toes than teeth dance John come kiss me now mask and mum for Comus and Hymen love masks and all such merriments above measure will allow men to put on women s apparel in some cases and promiscuously to dance young and old rich and poor generous and base of all sorts Paulus Jovius taxeth Augustine Niphus the philosopher five thousand five hundred twenty three for that being an old man and a public professor a father of many children he was so mad for the love of a young maid that which many of his friends were ashamed to see an old gouty fellow yet would dance after fiddlers Many laughed him to scorn for it but this omnipotent love would have it so five thousand five hundred twenty four Hyacinthino bacillo Properans amor me adegit Violenter ad sequendum Love hasty with his purple staff did make Me follow and the dance to undertake And tis no news this no indecorum for why a good reason may be given of it Cupid and death met both in an inn and being merrily disposed they did exchange some arrows from either quiver ever since young men die and oftentimes old men dote five thousand five hundred twenty five Sic moritur Juvenis sic moribundus amat And who can then withstand it If once we be in love young or old though our teeth shake in our heads like virginal jacks or stand parallel asunder like the arches of a bridge there is no remedy we must dance trenchmore for a need over tables chairs and stools c And princum prancum is a fine dance Plutarch Sympos one quaest five doth in some sort excuse it and telleth us moreover in what sense Musicam docet amor licet prius fuerit rudis how love makes them that had no skill before learn to sing and dance he concludes tis only that power and prerogative love hath over us five thousand five hundred twenty six Love as he holds will make a silent man speak a modest man most officious dull quick slow nimble and that which is most to

it may be helped and by many good remedies amended Avicenna lib three Fen cap twenty three et twenty four sets down seven compendious ways how this malady may be eased altered and expelled Savanarola nine principal observations Jason Pratensis prescribes eight rules besides physic how this passion may be tamed Laurentius two main precepts Arnoldus Valleriola Montaltus Hildesheim Langius and others inform us otherwise and yet all tending to the same purpose The sum of which I will briefly epitomise for I light my candle from their torches and enlarge again upon occasion as shall seem best to me and that after mine own method The first rule to be observed in this stubborn and unbridled passion is exercise and diet It is an old and well known sentence Sine Cerere et Saccho friget Venus love grows cool without bread and wine As an five thousand six hundred two idle sedentary life liberal feeding are great causes of it so the opposite labour slender and sparing diet with continual business are the best and most ordinary means to prevent it Otio si tollas periere Cupidinis artes Contemptaeque jacent et sine luce faces Take idleness away and put to flight Are Cupid s arts his torches give no light Minerva Diana Vesta and the nine Muses were not enamoured at all because they never were idle five thousand six hundred three Frustra blanditae appulistis ad has Frustra nequitiae venistis ad has Frustra delitiae obsidebitis has Frustra has illecebrae et procacitates Et suspiria et oscula et susurri Et quisquis male sana corda amantum Blandis ebria fascinat venenis In vain are all your flatteries In vain are all your knaveries Delights deceits procacities Sighs kisses and conspiracies And whate er is done by art To bewitch a lover s heart Tis in vain to set upon those that are busy Tis Savanarola s third rule Occupari in multis et magnis negotiis and Avicenna s precept cap twenty four five thousand six hundred four Cedit amor rebus res age tutus eris To be busy still and as five thousand six hundred five Guianerius enjoins about matters of great moment if it may be five thousand six hundred six Magninus adds Never to be idle but at the hours of sleep five thousand six hundred seven et si Poscas ante diem librum cum lumine si non Intendas animum studiis et rebus honestis Invidia vel amore miser torquebere For if thou dost not ply thy book By candlelight to study bent Employ d about some honest thing Envy or love shall thee torment No better physic than to be always occupied seriously intent five thousand six hundred eight Cur in penates rarius tenues subit Haec delicatas

and bare five thousand six hundred nine Non habet unde suum paupertas pascat amorem five thousand six hundred ten Guianerius therefore prescribes his patient to go with hair cloth next his skin to go barefooted and barelegged in cold weather to whip himself now and then as monks do but above all to fast Not with sweet wine mutton and pottage as many of those tender bellies do howsoever they put on Lenten faces and whatsoever they pretend but from all manner of meat Fasting is an all sufficient remedy of itself for as Jason Pratensis holds the bodies of such persons that feed liberally and live at ease five thousand six hundred eleven are full of bad spirits and devils devilish thoughts no better physic for such parties than to fast Hildesheim spicel two to this of hunger adds five thousand six hundred twelve often baths much exercise and sweat but hunger and fasting he prescribes before the rest And tis indeed our Saviour s oracle This kind of devil is not cast out but by fasting and prayer which makes the fathers so immoderate in commendation of fasting As hunger saith five thousand six hundred thirteen Ambrose is a friend of virginity so is it an enemy to lasciviousness but fullness overthrows chastity and fostereth all manner of provocations If thine horse be too lusty Hierome adviseth thee to take away some of his provender by this means those Pauls Hilaries Anthonies and famous anchorites subdued the lusts of the flesh by this means Hilarion made his ass as he called his own body leave kicking so five thousand six hundred fourteen Hierome relates of him in his life when the devil tempted him to any such foul offence By this means those five thousand six hundred fifteen Indian Brahmins kept themselves continent they lay upon the ground covered with skins as the red shanks do on heather and dieted themselves sparingly on one dish which Guianerius would have all young men put in practice and if that will not serve five thousand six hundred sixteen Gordonius would have them soundly whipped or to cool their courage kept in prison and there fed with bread and water till they acknowledge their error and become of another mind If imprisonment and hunger will not take them down according to the directions of that five thousand six hundred seventeen Theban Crates time must wear it out if time will not the last refuge is a halter But this you will say is comically spoken Howsoever fasting by all means must be still used and as they must refrain from such meats formerly mentioned which cause venery or provoke lust so they must use an opposite diet five thousand six hundred eighteen Wine must be altogether avoided of the younger sort So five thousand six hundred nineteen Plato prescribes and would have the magistrates themselves abstain from it for example s sake highly commending the Carthaginians for their temperance in this kind And twas a good edict a commendable thing so that it were not done for some sinister respect as those old Egyptians abstained from wine because some fabulous poets had given out wine sprang first from the blood of the giants or out of superstition as our modern Turks but for temperance it being animae virus et vitiorum fomes a plague itself if immoderately taken Women of old for that cause five thousand six hundred twenty in hot countries were forbid the use of it as severely punished for drinking of wine as for adultery and young folks as Leonicus hath recorded Var hist l three cap eighty seven eighty eight out of Athenaeus and others and is still practised in Italy and some other countries of Europe and Asia as Claudius Minoes hath well illustrated in his Comment on the twenty three Emblem of Alciat So choice is to be made of other diet Nec minus erucas aptum est vitare salaces Et quicquid veneri corpora nostra parat Eringos are not good for to be taken And all lascivious meats must be forsaken Those opposite meats which ought to be used are cucumbers melons purslane water lilies rue woodbine ammi lettuce which Lemnius so much commends lib two cap forty two and Mizaldus hort med to this purpose vitex or agnus castus before the rest which saith five thousand six hundred twenty one Magninus hath a wonderful virtue in it Those Athenian women in their solemn feasts called Thesmopheries were to abstain nine days from the company of men during which time saith Aelian they laid a certain herb named hanea in their beds which assuaged those ardent flames of love and freed them from the torments of that violent passion See more in Porta Matthiolus Crescentius lib five c and what every herbalist almost and physician hath written cap de Satyriasi et Priapismo Rhasis amongst the rest In some cases again if they be much dejected and brought low in body and now ready to despair through anguish grief and too sensible a feeling of their misery a cup of wine and full diet is not amiss and as Valescus adviseth cum alia honesta venerem saepe exercendo which

allowed as that which Vives speaks of lib three de anima five thousand six hundred twenty six A lover that hath as it were lost himself through impotency impatience must be called home as a traveller by music feasting good wine if need be to drunkenness itself which many so much commend for the easing of the mind all kinds of sports and merriments to see fair pictures hangings buildings pleasant fields orchards gardens groves ponds pools rivers fishing fowling hawking hunting to hear merry tales and pleasant discourse reading to use exercise till he sweat that new spirits may succeed or by some vehement affection or contrary passion to be diverted till he be fully weaned from anger suspicion cares fears c and habituated into another course Semper tecum sit as five thousand six hundred

pleasant companion to sing and tell merry tales songs and facete histories sweet discourse c And as the melody of music merriment singing dancing doth augment the passion of some lovers as five thousand six hundred twenty eight Avicenna notes so it expelleth it in others and doth very much good These things must be warily applied as the parties symptoms vary and as they shall stand variously affected If there be any need of physic that the humours be altered or any new matter aggregated they must be cured as melancholy men Carolus a Lorme amongst other questions discussed for his degree at Montpelier in France hath this An amantes et amantes iisdem remediis curentur Whether lovers and madmen be cured by the same remedies he affirms it for love extended is mere madness Such physic

Pepulitque amorem tutus ac victor fuit he that will but resist at first may easily be a conqueror at the last Balthazar Castilio l four urgeth this prescript above the rest five thousand six hundred thirty five when he shall chance saith he to light upon a woman that hath good behaviour joined with her excellent person and shall perceive his eyes with a kind of greediness to pull unto them this image of beauty and carry it to the heart shall observe himself to be somewhat incensed with this influence which moveth within when he shall discern those subtle spirits sparkling in her eyes to administer more fuel to the fire he must wisely withstand the beginnings rouse up reason stupefied almost fortify his heart by all means and shut up all those passages by which it may have entrance Tis a precept which all concur upon five thousand six hundred thirty six Opprime dum nova sunt subiti mala semina morbi Dum licet in primo lumine siste pedem Thy quick disease whilst it is fresh today By all means crush thy feet at first step stay Which cannot speedier be done than if he confess his grief and passion to some judicious friend five thousand six hundred thirty seven qui tacitus ardet magis uritur the more he conceals the greater is his pain that by his good advice may happily ease him on a sudden and withal to avoid occasions or any circumstance that may aggravate his disease to remove the object by all means for who can stand by a fire and not burn five thousand six hundred thirty eight Sussilite obsecro et mittite istanc foras quae misero mihi amanti ebibit sanguinem Tis good therefore to keep quite out of her company which Hierom so much labours to Paula to Nepotian Chrysost so much inculcates in ser in contubern Cyprian and many other fathers of the church Siracides

Et fugitare decet simulacra et pabula amoris Abstinere sibi atque alio convertere mentem Gaze not on a maid saith Siracides turn away thine eyes from a beautiful woman c nine v five seven eight averte oculos saith David or if thou dost see them as Ficinus adviseth let not thine eye be intentus ad libidinem do not intend her more than the rest for as five thousand six hundred forty five Propertius holds Ipse alimenta sibi maxima praebet amor love as a snow ball enlargeth itself by sight but as Hierome to Nepotian aut aequaliter ama aut aequaliter ignora either see all alike or let all alone make a league with thine eyes as five thousand six hundred forty six Job did and that is the safest course let all alone see none of them Nothing sooner revives five thousand six hundred forty seven or waxeth sore again as Petrarch holds than love doth by sight As pomp renews ambition the sight of gold covetousness a beauteous object sets on fire this burning lust Et multum saliens incitat unda sitim The sight of drink makes one dry and the sight of meat increaseth appetite Tis dangerous therefore to see A five thousand six hundred forty eight young gentleman in merriment would needs put on his mistress s clothes and walk abroad alone which some of her suitors espying stole him away for her that he represented So much can sight enforce Especially if he have been formerly enamoured the sight of his mistress strikes him into a new fit and makes him rave many days after five thousand six hundred forty nine Infirmis causa pusilla nocet Ut pene extinctum cinerem si sulphure tangas Vivet et ex minimo maximus ignis erit Sic nisi vitabis quicquid renovabit amorem Flamma recrudescet quae modo nulla fuit A sickly man a little thing offends As brimstone doth a fire decayed renew And makes it burn afresh doth love s dead flames If that the former object it review Or as the poet compares it to embers in ashes which the wind blows five thousand six hundred fifty ut solet a ventis c a scald head as the saying is is soon broken dry wood quickly kindles and when they have been formerly wounded with sight how can they by seeing but be inflamed Ismenias acknowledged as much of himself when he had been long absent and almost forgotten his mistress five thousand six hundred fifty one at the first sight of her as straw in a fire I burned afresh and more than ever I did before five thousand six hundred fifty two Chariclia was as much moved at the sight of her dear Theagines after he had been a great stranger five thousand six hundred fifty three Mertila in Aristaenetus swore she would never love Pamphilus again and did moderate her passion so long as he was absent but the next time he came in presence she could not contain effuse amplexa attrectari se sinit c she broke her vow and did profusely embrace him Hermotinus a young man in the said five thousand six hundred fifty four author is all out as unstaid he had forgot his mistress quite and by his friends was well weaned from her love but seeing her by chance agnovit veteris vestigia flammae he raved amain Illa tamen emergens veluti lucida stella cepit elucere c she did appear as a blazing star or an angel to his sight And it is the common passion of all lovers to be overcome in this sort For that cause belike Alexander discerning this inconvenience and danger that comes by seeing five thousand six hundred fifty five when he heard Darius s wife so much commended for her beauty would scarce admit her to come in his sight foreknowing belike that of Plutarch formosam videre periculosissimum how full of danger it is to see a proper woman and though he was intemperate in other things yet in this superbe se gessit he carried himself bravely And so when as Araspus in Xenophon had so much magnified that divine face of Panthea to Cyrus five thousand six hundred fifty six by how much she was fairer than ordinary by so much he was the more unwilling to see her Scipio a young man of twenty three years of age and the most beautiful of the Romans equal in person to that Grecian Charinus or Homer s Nireus at the siege of a city in Spain when as a noble and most fair young gentlewoman was brought unto him five thousand six hundred fifty seven and he had heard she was betrothed to a lord rewarded her and sent her back to her sweetheart saint Austin as five thousand six hundred fifty eight Gregory reports of him ne cum sorore quidem sua putavit habitandum would not live in the house with his own sister Xenocrates lay with Lais of Corinth all night and would not touch her Socrates though all the city of Athens supposed him to dote upon fair Alcibiades yet when he had an opportunity five thousand six hundred fifty nine solus cum solo to lie in the chamber with and was wooed by him besides as the said Alcibiades publicly five thousand six hundred sixty confessed formam sprevit et superbe contempsit he scornfully rejected him Petrarch that had so magnified his Laura in several poems when by the pope s means she was offered unto him would not accept of her five thousand six hundred sixty one It is a good happiness to be free from this passion of love and great discretion it argues in such a man that he can so contain himself but when thou art once in love to moderate thyself as he saith is a singular point of wisdom five thousand six hundred sixty two Nam vitare plagas in amoris ne jaciamur Non ita difficile est quam captum retibus ipsis Exire et validos Veneris perrumpere nodos To avoid such nets is no such mastery But ta en escape is all the victory But forasmuch as few men are free so discreet lovers or that can contain themselves and moderate their passions to curb their senses as not to see them not to look lasciviously not to confer with them such is the fury of this headstrong passion of raging lust and their weakness ferox ille ardor a natura insitus five thousand six hundred sixty three as he terms it such a furious desire nature hath inscribed such unspeakable delight Sic Divae Veneris furor Insanis adeo mentibus incubat which neither reason counsel poverty pain misery drudgery partus dolor c can deter them from we must use some speedy means to correct and prevent that and all other inconveniences which come by conference and the like The best readiest surest way and which all approve is Loci mutatio to send them several ways that they may neither hear

Athens time and patience wear away pain and grief as fire goes out for want of fuel Quantum oculis animo tam procul ibit amor But so as they tarry out long enough a whole year five thousand six

inculcates in an epistle to his friend Primierus first fast then tarry thirdly change thy place fourthly think of a halter If change of place continuance of time absence will not wear it out with those precedent remedies it will hardly be removed but these commonly are of force Felix Plater observ lib one had a baker to his patient almost mad for the love of his maid and desperate by removing her from him he was in a short space cured Isaeus a philosopher of Assyria was a most dissolute liver in his youth palam lasciviens in love with all he met but after he betook himself by his friends advice to his study and left women s company he was so changed that he cared no more for plays nor feasts nor masks nor songs nor verses fine clothes nor no such love toys he became a new man upon a sudden tanquam si priores oculos amisisset saith mine five thousand six hundred seventy one author as if he had lost his former eyes Peter Godefridus in the last chapter of his third book hath a story out of saint Ambrose of a young man that meeting his old love after long absence on whom he had extremely doted would scarce take notice of her she wondered at it that he should so lightly esteem her called him again lenibat dictis animum and told him who she was Ego sum inquit At ego non sum ego but he replied he was not the same man proripuit sese tandem as five thousand six hundred seventy two Aeneas fled from Dido not vouchsafing her any farther parley loathing his folly and ashamed of that which formerly he had done five thousand six hundred seventy three Non sum stultus ut ante jam Neaera O Neaera put your tricks and practise hereafter upon somebody else you shall befool me no longer Petrarch hath such another tale of a young gallant that loved a wench with one eye and for that cause by his parents was sent to travel into far countries after some years he returned and meeting the maid for whose sake he was sent abroad asked her how and by what chance she lost her eye no said she I have lost none but you have found yours signifying thereby that all lovers were blind as Fabius saith Amantes de forma judicare non possunt lovers cannot judge of beauty nor scarce of anything else as they will easily confess after they return unto themselves by some discontinuance or better advice wonder at their own folly madness stupidity blindness be much abashed and laugh at love and call it an idle thing condemn themselves that ever they should be so besotted or misled and be heartily glad they have so happily escaped If so be which is seldom that change of place will not effect this alteration then other remedies are to be annexed fair and foul means as to persuade promise threaten terrify or to divert by some contrary passion rumour tales news or some witty invention to alter his affection five thousand six hundred seventy four by some greater sorrow to drive out the less saith Gordonius as that his house is on fire his best friends dead his money stolen five thousand six hundred seventy five That he is made some great governor or hath some honour office some inheritance is befallen him He shall be a knight a baron or by some false accusation as they do to such as have the hiccup to make them forget it saint Hierome lib two epist sixteen to Rusticus the monk hath an instance of a young man of Greece that lived in a monastery in Egypt five thousand six hundred seventy six that by no labour no continence no persuasion could be diverted but at last by this trick he was delivered The abbot sets one of his convent to quarrel with him and with some scandalous reproach or other to defame him before company and then to come and complain first the witnesses were likewise suborned for the plaintiff The young man wept and when all were against him the abbot cunningly took his part lest he should be overcome with immoderate grief but what need many words by this invention he was cured and alienated from his pristine love thoughts Injuries slanders contempts disgraces spretaeque injuria formae the insult of her slighted beauty are very forcible means to withdraw men s affections contumelia affecti amatores amare desinunt as five thousand six hundred seventy seven Lucian saith lovers reviled or neglected contemned or misused turn love to hate five thousand six hundred seventy eight redeam Non si me obsecret I ll never love thee more Egone illam quae illum quae me quae non So Zephyrus hated Hyacinthus because he scorned him and preferred his company rival Apollo Palephaetus fab Nar he will not come again though he be

Successore novo truditur omnis amor or as Valesius adviseth by five thousand six hundred eighty two subdividing to diminish it as a great river cut into many channels runs low at last five thousand six hundred eighty three Hortor et ut pariter binas habeatis amicas c If you suspect to be taken be sure saith the poet to have two mistresses at once or go from one to another as he that goes from a good fire in cold weather is both to depart from it though in the next room there be a better which will refresh him as much there s as much difference of haec as hac ignis or bring him to some public shows plays meetings where he may see variety and he shall likely loathe his first choice carry him but to the next town yea peradventure to the next house and as Paris lost Oenone s love by seeing Helen and Cressida forsook Troilus by conversing with Diomede he will dislike his former mistress and leave her quite behind him as five thousand six hundred eighty four Theseus left Ariadne fast asleep in the island of Dia to seek her fortune that was erst his loving mistress five thousand six hundred eighty five Nunc primum Dorida vetus amator contempsi as he said Doris is but a dowdy to this As he that looks himself in a glass forgets his physiognomy forthwith this flattering glass of love will be diminished by remove after a little absence it will be remitted the next fair object will likely alter it A young man in five thousand six hundred eighty six Lucian was pitifully in love he came to the theatre by chance and by seeing other fair objects there mentis sanitatem recepit was fully recovered five thousand six hundred eighty seven and went merrily home as if he had taken a dram of oblivion five thousand six hundred eighty eight A mouse saith an apologer was brought up in a chest there fed with fragments of bread and cheese though there could be no better meat till coming forth at last and feeding liberally of other variety of viands loathed his former life moralise this fable by thyself Plato in his seventh book De Legibus hath a pretty fiction of a city under ground five thousand six hundred eighty nine to which by little holes some small store of light came the inhabitants thought there could not be a better place and at their first coming abroad they might not endure the light aegerrime solem intueri but after they were accustomed a little to it five thousand six hundred ninety they deplored their fellows misery that lived under ground A silly lover is in like state none so fair as his mistress at first he cares for none but her yet after a while when he hath compared her with others he abhors her name sight and memory Tis generally true for as he observes five thousand six hundred ninety one Priorem flammam novus ignis extrudit et ea multorum natura ut praesentes maxime ament one fire drives out another and such is women s weakness that they love commonly him that is present And so do many men as he confessed he loved Amye till he saw Florial and when he saw Cynthia forgat them both but fair Phillis was incomparably beyond them all Cloris surpassed her and yet when he espied Amaryllis she was his sole mistress O divine Amaryllis quam procera cupressi ad instar quam elegans quam decens c How lovely how tall how comely she was saith Polemius till he saw another and then she was the sole subject of his thoughts In conclusion her he loves best he saw last five thousand six hundred ninety two Triton the sea god first loved Leucothoe till he came in presence of Milaene she was the commandress of his heart till he saw Galatea but as five thousand six hundred ninety three she complains he loved another eftsoons another and another Tis a thing which by Hierom s report hath been usually practised five thousand six hundred ninety four Heathen philosophers drive out one love with another as they do a peg or pin with a pin Which those seven Persian princes did to Ahasuerus that they might requite the desire of Queen Vashti with the love of others Pausanias in Eliacis saith that therefore one Cupid was painted to contend with another and to take the garland from him because one love drives out another five thousand six hundred ninety five Alterius vires subtrahit alter amor and Tully three Nat Deor disputing with C Cotta makes mention of three several Cupids all differing in office Felix Plater in the first book of his observations boasts how he cured a widower in Basil a patient of his by this stratagem alone that doted upon a poor servant his maid when friends children no persuasion could serve to alienate his mind they motioned him to another honest man s daughter in the town whom he loved and lived with long after abhorring the very name and sight of the first After the death of Lucretia five thousand six hundred ninety six Euryalus would admit of no comfort till the Emperor Sigismund married him to a noble lady of his court and so in short space he was freed SUBSECT III By counsel and persuasion foulness of the fact men s women s faults miseries of marriage events of lust c As there be divers causes of this burning lust or heroical love so there be many good remedies to ease and help amongst which good counsel and persuasion which I should have handled in the first place are of great moment and not to be omitted Many are of opinion that in this blind headstrong passion counsel can do no good five thousand six hundred ninety seven Quae enim res in se neque consilium neque modum Habet ullo eam consilio regere non potes Which thing hath neither judgment or an end How should advice or counsel it amend five thousand six hundred ninety eight Quis enim modus adsit amori But without question good counsel and advice must needs be of great force especially if it shall proceed from a wise fatherly reverent discreet person a man of authority whom the parties do respect stand in awe of or from a judicious friend of itself alone it is able to divert and suffice Gordonius the physician attributes so much to it that he would have it by all means used in the first place Amoveatur ab illa consilio viri quem timet ostendendo pericula saeculi judicium inferni gaudia Paradisi He would have some discreet men to dissuade them after the fury of passion is a little spent or by absence allayed for it is as intempestive at first to give counsel as to comfort parents when their children are in that instant departed to no purpose to prescribe narcotics cordials nectarines potions Homer s nepenthes or Helen s bowl c Non cessabit pectus tundere she will lament and howl for a season let passion have his course awhile and then he may proceed by foreshowing the miserable events and dangers which will surely happen the pains of hell joys of Paradise and the like which by their preposterous courses they shall forfeit or incur and tis a fit method a very good means for what five thousand six hundred ninety nine Seneca said of vice I say of love Sine magistro discitur vix sine magistro deseritur tis learned of itself but five thousand seven hundred hardly left without a tutor Tis not amiss therefore to have some such overseer to expostulate and show them such absurdities inconveniences imperfections discontents as usually follow which their blindness fury madness cannot apply unto themselves or will not apprehend through weakness and good for them to disclose themselves to give ear to friendly admonitions Tell me sweetheart saith Tryphena to a lovesick Charmides in five thousand seven hundred one Lucian what is it that troubles thee peradventure I can ease thy mind and further thee in thy suit and so without question she might and so mayst thou if the patient be capable of good counsel and will hear at least what may be said If he love at all she is either an honest woman or a whore If dishonest let him read or inculcate to him that five of Solomon s Proverbs Ecclus twenty six Ambros lib one cap four in his book of Abel and Cain Philo Judeus de mercede mer Platina s dial in Amores Espencaeus and those three books of Pet Haedus de contem amoribus Aeneas Sylvius tart Epistle which he wrote to his friend Nicholas of Warthurge which he calls

what I am without but within God knows a puddle of iniquity a sink of sin a pocky quean Let him now that so dotes meditate on this let him see the event and success of others Samson Hercules Holofernes c Those infinite mischiefs attend it if she be another man s wife he loves tis abominable in the sight of God and men adultery is expressly forbidden in God s commandment a mortal sin able to endanger his soul if he be such a one that fears God or have any religion he will eschew it and abhor the loathsomeness of his own fact If he love an honest maid tis to abuse or marry her if to abuse tis fornication a foul fact though some make light of it and almost equal to adultery itself If to marry let him seriously consider what he takes in hand look before ye leap as the proverb is or settle his affections and examine first the party and condition of his estate and hers whether it be a fit match for fortunes years parentage and such other circumstances an sit sitae Veneris Whether it be likely to proceed if not let him wisely stave himself off at the first curb in his inordinate passion and moderate his desire by thinking of some other subject divert his cogitations Or if it be not for his good as Aeneas forewarned by Mercury in a dream left Dido s love and in all haste got him to sea five thousand seven hundred seven Mnestea Surgestumque vocat fortemque Cloanthem Classem aptent taciti jubet and although she did oppose with vows tears prayers and imprecation five thousand seven hundred eight nullis ille movetur Fletibus aut illas voces tractabilis audit Let thy Mercury reason rule thee against all allurements seeming delights pleasing inward or outward provocations Thou mayst do this if thou wilt pater non deperit filiam nec frater sororem a father dotes not on his own daughter a brother on a sister and why because it is unnatural unlawful unfit If he be sickly soft deformed let him think of his deformities vices infirmities if in debt let him ruminate how to pay his debts if he be in any danger let him seek to avoid it if he have any lawsuit or other business he may do well to let his love matters alone and follow it labour in his vocation whatever it is But if he cannot so ease himself yet let him wisely premeditate of both their estates if they be unequal in years she young and he old what an unfit match must it needs be an uneven yoke how absurd and indecent a thing is it as Lycinus in five thousand seven hundred nine Lucian told Timolaus for an old bald crook nosed knave to marry a young wench how odious a thing it is to see an old lecher What should a bald fellow do with a comb a dumb doter with a pipe a blind man with a looking glass and thou with such a wife How absurd it is for a young man to marry an old wife for a piece of good But put case she be equal in years birth fortunes and other qualities correspondent he doth desire to be coupled in marriage which is an honourable estate but for what respects Her beauty belike and comeliness of person that is commonly the main object she is a most absolute form in his eye at least Cui formam Paphia et Charites tribuere decoram but do other men affirm as much or is it an error in his judgment five thousand seven hundred ten Fallunt nos oculi vagique sensus Oppressa ratione mentiuntur our eyes and other senses will commonly deceive us it may be to thee thyself upon a more serious examination or after a little absence she is not so fair as she seems Quaedam videntur et non sunt compare her to another standing by tis a touchstone to try confer hand to hand body to body face to face eye to eye nose to nose neck to neck c examine every part by itself then altogether in all postures several sites and tell me how thou likest her It may be not she that is so fair but her

crooked carcass under a fine coat It may be for all her costly tires she is bald and though she seem so fair by dark by candlelight or afar off at such a distance as Callicratides observed in five thousand seven hundred fourteen Lucian If thou should see her near or in a morning she would appear more ugly than a beast five thousand seven hundred fifteen si diligenter consideres quid per os et

worse than any dirt or dunghill Her embraces were not so acceptable as now her looks be terrible thou hadst better behold a Gorgon s head than Helen s carcass Some are of opinion that to see a woman naked is able of itself to alter his affection and it is worthy of consideration saith five thousand seven hundred eighteen Montaigne the Frenchman in his Essays that the skilfulest masters of amorous dalliance appoint for a remedy of venerous passions a full survey of the body which the poet insinuates five thousand seven hundred nineteen Ille quod obscaenas in aperto corpore partes Viderat in cursu qui fuit haesit amor The love stood still that run in full career When once it saw those parts should not appear It is reported of Seleucus king of Syria that seeing his wife Stratonice s bald

abhorred the looks of her Philip the French king as Neubrigensis lib four cap twenty four relates it married the king of Denmark s daughter five thousand seven hundred twenty and after he had used her

Agasicles married a Spartan lass the fairest lady in all Greece next to Helen but for her conditions the most abominable and beastly creature of the world So that I would wish thee to respect with five thousand seven hundred thirty three Seneca not her person but qualities Will you say that s a good blade which hath a gilded scabbard embroidered with gold and jewels No but that which hath a good edge and point well tempered metal able to resist This beauty is of the body alone and what is that but as five thousand seven hundred thirty four Gregory Nazianzen telleth us a mock of time and sickness or as Boethius five thousand seven hundred thirty five as mutable as a flower and tis not nature so makes us but most part the infirmity of the beholder For ask another he sees no such matter Dic mihi per gratias quails tibi videtur I pray thee tell me how thou likest my sweetheart as she asked her sister in Aristenaetus five thousand seven hundred thirty six whom I so much admire methinks he is the sweetest gentleman the properest man that ever I saw but I am in love I confess nec pudet fateri and cannot therefore well judge But be she fair indeed golden haired as Anacreon his

Euphranor of old painted Venus Aristaenetus describes Lais another Helena Chariclea Leucippe Lucretia Pandora let her have a box of beauty to repair herself still such a one as Venus gave Phaon when he carried her over the ford let her use all helps art and nature can yield be like her and her and whom thou wilt or all these in one a little sickness a fever small pox wound scar loss of an eye or limb a violent passion a distemperature of heat or cold mars all in an instant disfigures all child bearing old age that tyrant time will turn Venus to Erinnys raging time care rivels her upon a

Those fair sparkling eyes will look dull her soft coral lips will be pale dry cold rough and blue her skin rugged that soft and tender superficies will be hard and harsh her whole complexion change in a moment and as five thousand seven hundred forty one Matilda writ to King John I am not now as when thou saw saint me last That favour soon is vanished and past That rosy blush lapt in a lily vale Now is with morphew overgrown and pale Tis so in the rest their beauty fades as a tree in winter which Dejanira hath elegantly expressed in the poet five thousand seven hundred forty two Deforme solis aspicis truncis nemus Sic nostra longum forma percurrens iter Deperdit aliquid semper et fulget minus Malisque minus est quiquid in nobis fuit Olim petitum cecidit et partu labat Maturque multum rapuit ex illa mihi Aetas citato senior eripuit gradu And as a tree that in the green wood grows With fruit and leaves and in the summer blows In winter like a stock deformed shows Our beauty takes his race and journey goes And doth decrease and lose and come to nought Admir d of old to this by child birth brought And mother hath bereft me of my grace And crooked old age coining on apace To conclude with Chrysostom five thousand seven hundred forty three When thou seest a fair and beautiful person a brave Bonaroba a bella donna quae salivam moveat lepidam puellam et quam tu facile ames a comely woman having bright eyes a merry countenance a shining lustre in her look a pleasant grace wringing thy soul and increasing thy concupiscence bethink with thyself that it is but earth thou lovest a mere excrement which so vexeth thee which thou so admirest and thy raging soul will be at rest Take her skin from her face and thou shalt see all loathsomeness under it that beauty is a superficial skin and bones nerves sinews suppose her sick now rivelled hoary headed hollow cheeked old within she is full of filthy phlegm stinking putrid excremental stuff snot and snivel in her nostrils spittle in her mouth water in her eyes what filth in her brains c Or take her at best and look narrowly upon her in the light stand near her nearer yet thou shalt perceive almost as much and love less as five thousand seven hundred forty four Cardan well writes minus amant qui acute vident though Scaliger deride him for it if he see her near or look exactly at such a posture whosoever he is according to the true rules of symmetry and proportion those I mean of Albertus Durer Lomatius and Tasnier examine him of her If he be elegans formarum spectator he shall find many faults in physiognomy and ill colour if form one side of the face likely bigger than the other or crooked nose bad eyes prominent veins concavities about the eyes wrinkles pimples red streaks freckles hairs warts neves inequalities roughness scabredity paleness yellowness and as many colours as are in a turkeycock s neck many indecorums in their other parts est quod desideres est quod amputes one leers another frowns a third gapes squints c And tis true that he saith five thousand seven hundred forty five Diligenter consideranti raro facies absoluta et quae vitio caret seldom shall you find an absolute face without fault as I have often observed not in the face alone is this defect or disproportion to be found but in all the other parts of body and mind she is fair indeed but foolish pretty comely and decent of a majestical presence but peradventure imperious dishonest acerba iniqua self willed she is rich but deformed hath a sweet face but bad carriage no bringing up a rude and wanton flirt a neat body she hath but it is a nasty quean otherwise a very slut of a bad kind As flowers in a garden have colour some but no smell others have a fragrant smell but are unseemly to the eye one is unsavoury to the taste as rue as bitter as wormwood and yet a most medicinal cordial flower most acceptable to the stomach so are men and women one is well qualified but of ill proportion poor and base a good eye she hath but a bad hand and foot foeda pedes et foeda manus a fine leg bad teeth a vast body c Examine all parts of body and mind I advise thee to inquire of all See her angry merry laugh weep hot cold sick sullen dressed undressed in all attires sites gestures passions eat her meals c and in some of these you will surely dislike Yea not her only let him observe but her parents how they carry themselves for what deformities defects encumbrances of body or mind be in them at such an age they will likely be subject to be molested in like manner they will patrizare or matrizare And withal let him take notice of her companions in convictu as Quiverra prescribes et quibuscum conversetur whom she converseth with Noscitur ex comite qui non cognoscitur ex se five thousand seven hundred forty six According to Thucydides she is commonly the best de quo minimus foras habetur sermo that is least talked of abroad For if she be a noted reveller a gadder a singer a pranker or dancer than take heed of her For what saith Theocritus five thousand seven hundred forty seven At vos festivae ne ne saltate puellae En malus hireus adest in vos saltare paratus Young men will do it when they come to it Fauns and satyrs will certainly play reaks when they come in such wanton Baccho s or Elenora s presence Now when they shall perceive any such obliquity indecency disproportion deformity bad conditions c let them still ruminate on that and as five thousand seven hundred forty eight Haedus adviseth out of Ovid earum mendas notent note their faults vices errors and think of their imperfections tis the next way to divert and mitigate love s furious headstrong passions as a peacock s feet and filthy comb they say make him forget his fine feathers and pride of his tail she is lovely fair well favoured well qualified courteous and kind but if she be not so to me what care I how kind she be I say with five thousand seven hundred forty nine Philostratus formosa aliis mihi superba she is a tyrant to me and so let her go Besides these outward neves or open faults errors there be many inward infirmities secret some private which I will omit and some more common to the sex sullen fits evil qualities filthy diseases in this case fit to be considered consideratio foeditatis mulierum menstruae imprimis quam immundae sunt quam Savanarola proponit regula septima penitus

virtuous woman He makes a question of it Neque jus neque bonum neque aequum sciunt melius pejus prosit obsit nihil vident nisi quod libido suggerit They know neither good nor bad be it better or worse

all their faults five thousand seven hundred fifty three Every each of them hath some vices If one be full of villainy Another hath a liquorish eye If one be full of wantonness Another is a chideress When Leander was drowned the inhabitants of Sestos consecrated Hero s lantern to Anteros Anteroti sacrum five thousand seven hundred fifty four and he that had good success in his love should light the candle but never any man was found to light it which I can refer to nought but the inconstancy and lightness of women five thousand seven hundred fifty five For in a thousand good there is not one All be so proud unthankful and unkind With flinty hearts careless of other s moan In their own lusts carried most headlong blind But more herein to speak I am forbidden Sometimes for speaking truth one may be chidden I am not willing you see to prosecute the cause against them and therefore take heed you mistake me not five thousand seven hundred fifty six matronam nullam ego tango I honour the sex with all good men and as I ought to do rather than displease them I will voluntarily take the oath which Mercurius Britannicus took Viragin descript tib two fol ninety five Me nihil unquam mali

be urged out of them and others five thousand seven hundred fifty seven non possunt invectivae omnes et satirae in foeminas scriptae uno volumine comprehendi And that which I have said to speak truth no more concerns them than men though women be more frequently named in this tract to apologise once for all I am neither partial against them or therefore bitter what is said of the one mutato nomine may most part be understood of the other My words are like Passus picture in five thousand seven hundred fifty eight Lucian of whom when a good fellow had bespoke a horse to be painted with his heels upwards tumbling on his back he made him passant now when the fellow came for his piece he was very angry and said it was quite opposite to his mind but Passus instantly turned the picture upside down showed him the horse at that site which he requested and so gave him satisfaction If any man take exception at my words let him alter the name read him for her and tis all one in effect But to my purpose If women in general be so bad and men worse than they what a hazard is it to marry where shall a man find a good wife or a woman a good husband A woman a man may eschew but not a wife wedding is undoing some say marrying marring wooing woeing five thousand seven hundred fifty nine a wife is a fever hectic as Scaliger calls her and not be cured but by death as out of Menander Athenaeus adds In pelaprus te jacis negotiorum Non Libyum non Aegeum ubi ex triginta non pereunt Tria navigia duceus uxorem servatur prorsus nemo Thou wadest into a sea itself of woes In Libya and Aegean each man

freta Minus est timenda nulla non melior fera est Scylla and Charybdis are less dangerous There is no beast that is so noxious Which made the devil belike as most interpreters hold when he had taken away Job s goods corporis et fortunae bona health children friends to persecute him the more leave his wicked wife as Pineda proves out of Tertullian Cyprian Austin Chrysostom Prosper Gaudentius c ut novum calamitatis inde genus viro existeret to vex and gall him worse quam totus infernus than all the fiends in hell as knowing the conditions of a bad woman Jupiter non tribuit homini pestilentius

husband cries she a bad husband nay the worst that ever was is better than none O blissful marriage O most welcome marriage and happy are they that are so coupled we do earnestly seek it and are never well till we have effected it But with what fate like those birds in the five thousand seven hundred sixty five Emblem that fed about a cage so long as they could fly away at their pleasure liked well of it but when they were taken and might not get loose though they had the same meat pined away for sullenness and would not eat So we commend marriage donec miselli liberi Aspichmis dominam sed postquam heu janua clausa est Fel intus est quod mel fuit So long as we are wooers may kiss and coll at our pleasure nothing is so sweet we are in heaven as we think but when we are once tied and have lost our liberty marriage is an hell give me my yellow hose again a mouse in a trap lives as merrily we are in a purgatory some of us if not hell itself Dulce bellum inexpertis as the proverb is tis fine talking of war and marriage sweet in contemplation till it be tried and then as wars are most dangerous irksome every minute at death s door so is c When those wild Irish peers saith five thousand seven hundred sixty six Stanihurst were feasted by king Henry the Second at what time he kept his Christmas at Dublin and had tasted of his prince like cheer generous wines dainty fare had seen his five thousand seven hundred sixty seven massy plate of silver gold enamelled beset with jewels golden candlesticks goodly rich hangings brave furniture heard his trumpets sound fifes drums and his exquisite music in all kinds when they had observed his majestical presence as he sat in purple robes crowned with his sceptre c in his royal seat the poor men were so amazed enamoured and taken with the object that they were pertaesi domestici et pristini tyrotarchi as weary and ashamed of their own sordidity and manner of life They would all be English forthwith who but English but when they had now submitted themselves and lost their former liberty they began to rebel some of them others repent of what they had done when it was too late Tis so with us bachelors when we see and behold those sweet faces those gaudy shows that women make observe their pleasant gestures and graces give ear to their siren tunes see them dance c we think their conditions are as fine as their faces we are taken with dumb signs in amplexum ruimus we rave we burn and would fain be married But when we feel the miseries cares woes that accompany it we make our moan many of us cry out at length and cannot be released If this be true now as some out of experience will inform us farewell wiving for my part and as the comical poet merrily saith five thousand seven hundred sixty eight Perdatur ille pessime qui foeminam Duxit secundus nam nihil primo imprecor Ignarus ut puto mali primus fuit five thousand seven hundred sixty nine Foul fall him that brought the second match to pass The first I wish no harm poor man alas He knew not what he did nor what it was What shall I say to him that marries again and again five thousand seven hundred seventy Stulta maritali qui porrigit ora capistro I pity him not for the first time he must do as he may bear it out sometimes by the head and shoulders and let his next neighbour ride or else run away or as that Syracusian in a tempest when all ponderous things were to be exonerated out of the ship quia maximum pondus erat fling his wife into the sea But this I confess is comically spoken five thousand seven hundred seventy one and so I pray you take it In sober sadness five thousand seven hundred seventy two marriage is a bondage a thraldom a yoke a hindrance to all good enterprises he hath married a wife and cannot come a stop to all preferments a rock on which many are saved many impinge and are cast away not that the thing is evil in itself or troublesome but full of all contentment and happiness one of the three things which please God five thousand seven hundred seventy three when a man and his wife agree together an honourable and happy estate who knows it not If they be sober wise honest as the poet infers five thousand seven hundred seventy four Si commodos nanciscantur amores Nullum iis abest voluptatis genus If fitly match d be man and wife No pleasure s wanting to their life But to undiscreet sensual persons that as brutes are wholly led by sense it is a feral plague many times a hell itself and can give little or no content being that they are often so irregular and prodigious in their lusts so diverse in their affections Uxor nomen dignitatis non voluptatis as five thousand seven hundred seventy five he said a wife is a name of honour not of pleasure she is fit to bear the office govern a family to bring up children sit at a board s end and carve as some carnal men think and say they had rather go to the stews or have now and then a snatch as they can come by it borrow of their neighbours than have wives of their own except they may as some princes and great men do keep as many courtesans as they will themselves fly out impune five thousand seven hundred seventy six Permolere uxores alienas that polygamy of Turks Lex Julia with Caesar once enforced in Rome though Levinus Torrentius and others suspect it uti uxores quot et quas vellent liceret that every great man might marry and keep as many wives as he would or Irish divorcement were in use but as it is tis hard and gives not that satisfaction to these carnal men beastly men as too many are five thousand seven hundred seventy seven What still the same to be tied five thousand seven hundred seventy eight to one be she never so fair never so virtuous is a thing they may not endure to love one long Say thy pleasure and counterfeit as thou wilt as five thousand seven hundred seventy nine Parmeno told Thais Neque tu uno eris contenta one man will never please thee nor one woman many men But as five thousand seven hundred eighty Pan replied to his father Mercury when he asked whether he was married Nequaquam pater amator enim sum c No father no I am a lover still and cannot be contented with one woman Pythias Echo Menades and I know not how many besides were his mistresses he might not abide marriage Varietas delectat tis loathsome and tedious what one still which the satirist said of Iberina is verified in most five thousand seven hundred eighty one Unus Iberinae vir sufficit ocyus illud Extorquebis ut haec oculo contenta sit uno Tis not one man will serve her by her will As soon she ll have one eye as one man still As capable of any impression as materia prima itself that still desires new forms like the sea their affections ebb and flow Husband is a cloak for some to hide their villainy once married she may fly out at her pleasure the name of husband is a sanctuary to make all good Eo ventum saith Seneca ut nulla virum habeat nisi ut irritet adulterum They are right and straight as true Trojans as mine host s daughter that Spanish wench in five thousand seven hundred eighty two Ariosto as good wives as Messalina Many men are as constant in their choice and as good husbands as Nero himself they must have their pleasure of all they see and are in a word far more fickle than any woman For either they be full of jealousy Or masterfull or loven novelty Good men have often ill wives as bad as Xanthippe was to Socrates Elevora to saint Lewis Isabella to our Edward the Second and good wives are as often matched to ill husbands as Mariamne to Herod Serena to Diocletian Theodora to Theophilus and Thyra to Gurmunde But I will say nothing of dissolute and bad husbands of bachelors and their vices their good qualities are a fitter subject for a just volume too well known already in every village town and city they need no blazon and lest I should mar any matches or dishearten loving maids for this present I will let them pass Being that men and women are so irreligious depraved by nature so wandering in their affections so brutish so subject to disagreement so unobservant of marriage rites what shall I say If thou beest such a one or thou light on such a wife what concord can there be what hope of agreement tis not conjugium but conjurgium as the Reed and Fern in the five thousand seven hundred eighty three Emblem averse and opposite in nature tis twenty to one thou wilt not marry to thy contentment but as in a lottery forty blanks were drawn commonly for one prize out of a multitude you shall hardly choose a good one a small ease hence then little comfort five thousand seven hundred eighty four Nec integrum unquam transiges laetus diem If he or she be such a one Thou hadst much better be alone If she be barren she is not c If she have five thousand seven hundred eighty five children and thy state be not good though thou be wary and circumspect thy charge will undo thee foecunda domum tibi prole gravabit five thousand seven hundred eighty six thou wilt not be able to bring them up five thousand seven hundred eighty seven and what greater misery can there be than to beget children to whom thou canst leave no other inheritance but hunger and thirst five thousand seven hundred eighty eight cum fames dominatur strident voces rogantium panem penetrantes patris cor what so grievous as to turn them up to the wide world to shift for themselves No plague like to want and when thou hast good means and art very careful of their education they will not be ruled Think but of that old proverb Greek haeiroon tekna paemata heroum filii noxae great men s sons seldom do well O utinam aut coelebs mansissem aut prole carerem would that I had either remained single or not had children five thousand seven hundred eighty nine Augustus exclaims in Suetonius Jacob had his Reuben Simeon and Levi David an Amnon an Absalom Adoniah wise men s sons are commonly fools insomuch that Spartian concludes Neminem prope

gamester a spendthrift thy daughter a fool a whore thy servants lazy drones and thieves thy neighbours devils they will make thee weary of thy life five thousand seven hundred ninety one If thy wife be froward when she may not have her will thou hadst better be buried alive she will be so impatient raving still and roaring like Juno in the tragedy there s nothing but tempests all is in an uproar If she be soft and foolish thou wert better have a block she will shame thee and reveal thy secrets if wise and learned well qualified there is as much danger on the other side mulierem doctam ducere periculosissimum saith Nevisanus she will be too insolent and peevish five thousand seven hundred ninety two Malo Venusinam quam te Cornelia mater Take heed if she be a slut thou wilt loathe her if proud she ll beggar thee so five thousand seven hundred ninety three she ll spend thy patrimony in baubles all Arabia will not serve to perfume her hair saith Lucian if fair and wanton she ll make

do not paint she will look so filthy thou canst not love her and that peradventure will make thee dishonest Cromerus lib twelve hist relates of Casimirus five thousand seven hundred ninety five that he was unchaste because his wife Aleida the daughter of Henry Landgrave of Hesse was so deformed If she be poor she brings beggary with her saith Nevisanus misery and discontent If you marry a maid it is uncertain how she proves Haec forsan veniet non satis apta tibi five thousand seven hundred ninety six If young she is likely wanton and untaught if lusty too lascivious and if she be not satisfied you know where and when nil nisi jurgia all is in an uproar and there is little quietness to be had If an old maid tis a hazard she dies in childbed if a five thousand seven hundred ninety seven rich widow induces te in laqueum thou dost halter thyself she will make all away beforehand to her other children c five thousand seven hundred ninety eight dominam quis possit ferre tonantem she will hit

answer to thy friends that importune thee to marry adhuc intempestivum tis yet unseasonable and ever will be Consider withal how free how happy how secure how heavenly in respect a single man is five thousand eight hundred three as he said in the comedy Et isti quod fortunatum esse autumant uxorem nunquam habui and that which all my neighbours admire and applaud me for account so great a happiness I never had a wife consider how contentedly quietly neatly plentifully sweetly and how merrily he lives he hath no man to care for but himself none to please no charge none to control him is tied to no residence no cure to serve may go and come when whither live where he will his own master and do what he list himself Consider the excellency of virgins five thousand eight hundred four Virgo coelum meruit marriage replenisheth the earth but virginity Paradise Elias Eliseus John Baptist were bachelors virginity is a precious jewel a fair garland a never fading flower five thousand eight

comforts quae aegro assideat et curet aegrotum fomentum paret roget medieum c embracing dalliance kissing colling c those furious motives and wanton pleasures a new married wife most part enjoys yet they are but toys in respect easily to be endured if conferred to those frequent encumbrances of marriage Solitariness may be otherwise avoided with mirth music good company business employment in a word five thousand eight hundred eight Gaudebit minus et minus dolebit for their good nights he shall have good days And methinks some time or other amongst so many rich bachelors a benefactor should be found to build a monastical college for old decayed deformed or discontented maids to live together in that have lost their first loves or otherwise miscarried or else are willing howsoever to lead a single life The rest I say are toys in respect and sufficiently recompensed by those innumerable contents and incomparable privileges of virginity Think of these things confer both lives and consider last of all these commodious prerogatives a bachelor hath how well he is esteemed how heartily welcome to all his friends quam mentitis obsequiis as Tertullian observes with what counterfeit courtesies they will adore him follow him present him with gifts humatis donis it cannot be believed saith five thousand eight hundred nine Ammianus with what humble service he shall be worshipped how loved and respected If he want children and have means he shall be often invited attended on by princes and have advocates to plead his cause for nothing as five thousand eight hundred ten Plutarch

for thy favour to be thine heir or executor Aruntius and Aterius those famous parasites in this kind as Tacitus and five thousand eight hundred twelve Seneca have recorded shall not go beyond them Periplectomines that good personate old man delicium senis well understood this in Plautus for when Pleusides exhorted him to marry that he might have children of his own he readily replied in this sort Quando habeo multos cognatos quid opus mihi sit liberis Nunc bene vivo et fortunate atque animo ut lubet Mea bona mea morte cognatis dicam interpartiant Illi apud me edunt me curant visunt quid agam ecquid velim Qui mihi mittunt munera ad prandium ad coenam vocant Whilst I have kin what need I brats to have Now I live well and as I will most brave And when I die my goods I ll give away To them that do invite me every day That visit me and send me pretty toys And strive who shall do me most courtesies This respect thou shalt have in like manner living as he did a single man But if thou marry once five thousand eight hundred thirteen cogitato in omni vita te servum fore bethink thyself what a slavery it is what a heavy burden thou shalt undertake how hard a task thou art tied to for as Hierome hath it qui uxorem habet debitor est et uxoris servus alligatus and how continuate what squalor attends it what irksomeness what charges for wife and children are a perpetual bill of charges besides a myriad of cares miseries and troubles for as that comical Plautus merrily and truly said he that wants trouble must get to be master of a ship or marry a wife and as another seconds

fueras procerum publica cura prius Both young and old do hate thee scorned now That once was all their joy and comfort too As Narcissus was himself Who despising many Died ere he could enjoy the love of any They begin to be contemned themselves of others as he was of his shadow and take up with a poor curate or an old serving man at last that might have had their choice of right good matches in their youth like that generous mare in five thousand eight hundred fifty four Plutarch which would admit of none but great horses but when her tail was cut off and mane shorn close and she now saw

hope enough yet Mopso Nisa datur quid non speremus amantes Put thyself forward once more as unlikely matches have been and are daily made see what will be the event Many leave roses and gather thistles loathe honey and love verjuice our likings are as various as our palates But commonly they omit opportunities oscula qui sumpsit c they neglect the usual means and times He that will not when he may When he will he shall have nay They look to be wooed sought after and sued to Most part they will and cannot either for the above named reasons or for that there is a multitude of suitors equally enamoured doting all alike and where one alone must speed what shall become of the rest Hero was beloved of many but one did enjoy her Penelope had a company of suitors yet all missed of their aim In such cases he or they must wisely and warily unwind themselves unsettle his affections by those rules above prescribed five thousand eight hundred fifty six quin stultos excutit ignes divert

inconveniences lets and hindrances there are which cross their projects and crucify poor lovers which sometimes may sometimes again cannot be so easily removed But put case they be reconciled all agreed hitherto suppose this love or good liking be between two alone both parties well pleased there is mutuus amor mutual love and great affection yet their parents guardians tutors cannot agree thence all is dashed the match is unequal one rich another poor durus pater a hard hearted unnatural a covetous father will not marry his son except he have so much money ita in aurum omnes insaniunt as five thousand eight hundred fifty seven Chrysostom notes nor join his daughter in marriage to save her dowry or for that he cannot spare her for the service she doth him and is resolved to part with nothing whilst he lives not a penny though he may peradventure well give it he will not till he dies and then as a pot of money broke it is divided amongst them that gaped after it so earnestly Or else he wants means to set her out he hath no money and though it be to the manifest prejudice of her body and soul s health he cares not he will take no notice of it she must and shall tarry Many slack and careless parents iniqui patres measure their children s affections by their own they are now cold and decrepit themselves past all such youthful conceits and they will therefore starve their children s genus have them a pueris five thousand eight hundred fifty eight illico nasci senes they must not marry nec earum affines esse rerum quas secum fert adolescentia ex sua libidine moderatur quae est nunc non quae olim fuit as he said in the comedy they will stifle nature their young bloods must not participate of youthful pleasures but be as they are themselves old on a sudden And tis a general fault amongst most parents in bestowing of their children the father wholly respects wealth when through his folly riot indiscretion he hath embezzled his estate to recover himself he confines and prostitutes his eldest son s love and affection to some fool or ancient or deformed piece for money five thousand eight hundred fifty nine Phanaretae ducet filiam rufam illam virginem Caesiam sparso ore adunco naso and though his son utterly dislike with Clitipho in the comedy Non possum pater If she be rich Eia he replies ut elegans est credas animum ibi esse he must and shall have her she is fair enough young enough if he look or hope to inherit his lands he shall marry not when or whom he loves Arconidis hujus filiam but whom his father commands when and where he likes his affection must dance attendance upon him His daughter is in the same predicament forsooth as an empty boat she must carry what where when and whom her father will So that in these businesses the father is still for the best advantage now the mother respects good kindred must part the son a proper woman All which five thousand eight hundred sixty Livy exemplifies dec one lib four a gentleman

in heaven It lies not in our power to love or hate For will in us is overrul d by fate A servant maid in five thousand eight hundred sixty seven Aristaenetus loved her mistress s minion which when her dame perceived furiosa aemulatione in a jealous humour she dragged her about the house by the hair of the head and vexed her sore The wench cried out five thousand eight hundred sixty eight O mistress fortune hath made my body your servant but not my soul Affections are free not to be commanded Moreover it may be to restrain their ambition pride and covetousness to correct those hereditary diseases of a family God in his just judgment assigns and permits such matches to be made For I am of Plato and five thousand eight hundred sixty nine Bodine s mind that families have their bounds and periods as well as kingdoms beyond which for extent or continuance they shall not exceed six or seven hundred years as they there illustrate by a multitude of examples and which Peucer and five thousand eight hundred seventy Melancthon approve but in a perpetual tenor as we see by many pedigrees of knights gentlemen yeomen continue as they began for many descents with little alteration Howsoever let them I say give something to youth to love they must not think they can fancy whom they appoint five thousand eight hundred seventy one Amor enim non imperatur affectus liber si quis alius et vices exigens this is a free passion as Pliny said in a panegyric of his and may not be forced Love craves liking as the saying is it requires mutual affections a correspondency invito non datur nec aufertur it may not be learned Ovid himself cannot teach us how to love Solomon describe Apelles paint or Helen express it They must not therefore compel or intrude five thousand eight hundred seventy two quis enim as Fabius urgeth amare alieno animo potest but consider withal the miseries of enforced marriages take pity upon youth and such above the rest as have daughters to bestow should be very careful and provident to marry them in due time Siracides cap seven vers twenty five calls it a weighty matter to perform so to marry a daughter to a man of understanding in due time Virgines enim tempestive

avoid these feral maladies tis good to get them husbands betimes as to prevent some other gross inconveniences and for a thing that I know besides ubi nuptiarum tempus et aetas advenerit as Chrysostom adviseth let them not defer it they perchance will marry themselves else or do worse If Nevisanus the lawyer do not impose they may do it by right for as he proves out of Curtius and some other civilians Sylvae nup lib two numer thirty five thousand eight hundred seventy five A maid past twenty five years of age against her parents consent may marry such a one as is unworthy of and inferior to her and her father by law must be compelled to give her a competent dowry Mistake me not in the mean time or think that I do apologise here for any headstrong unruly wanton flirts I do approve that of saint Ambrose Comment in Genesis xxiv fifty one which he hath written touching Rebecca s spousals A woman should give unto her parents the choice of her husband five thousand eight hundred seventy six lest she be reputed to be malapert and wanton if she take upon her to make her own choice five thousand eight hundred seventy seven for she should rather seem to be desired by a man than to desire a man herself To those hard parents alone I retort that of Curtius in the behalf of modester maids that are too remiss and careless of their due time and riper years For if they tarry longer to say truth they are past date and nobody will respect them A woman with us in Italy saith five thousand eight hundred seventy eight Aretine s Lucretia twenty four years of age is old already past the best of no account An old fellow as Lycistrata confesseth in five thousand eight hundred seventy nine Aristophanes etsi sit canus cito puellam virginem ducat uxorem and tis no news for an old fellow to

time past cannot be recalled But we need no such exhortation we are all commonly too forward yet if there be any escape and all be not as it should as Diogenes struck the father when the son swore because he taught him no better if a maid or young man miscarry I think their parents oftentimes guardians overseers governors neque vos saith five thousand eight hundred eighty four Chrysostom a supplicio immunes evadetis si non statim ad nuptias c are in as much fault and as severely to be punished as their children in providing for them no sooner Now for such as have free liberty to bestow

fiet civitas concordior Et invidia nos minore utemur quam utimur That rich men would marry poor maidens some And that without dowry and so bring them home So would much concord be in our city Less envy should we have much more pity If they would care less for wealth we should have much more content and quietness in a commonwealth Beauty good bringing up methinks is a sufficient portion of itself five thousand eight hundred eighty six Dos est sua forma puellis her beauty is a maiden s dower and he doth well that will accept of such a wife Eubulides in five thousand eight hundred eighty seven Aristaenetus married a poor man s child facie non illaetabili of a merry countenance and heavenly visage in pity of her estate and that quickly Acontius coming to Delos to sacrifice to Diana fell in love with Cydippe a noble lass and wanting means to get her love flung a golden apple into her lap with this inscription upon it Juro tibi sane per mystica sacra Dianae Me tibi venturum comitem sponsumque futurum I swear by all the rites of Diana I ll come and be thy husband if I may She considered of it and upon some small inquiry of his person and estate was married unto him Blessed is the wooing That is not long a doing As the saying is when the parties are sufficiently known to each other what needs such scrupulosity so many circumstances dost thou know her conditions

did so in the reign of five thousand eight hundred eighty nine Ogyges belike before staggering Ninus began to domineer if all be true that is reported and some few nowadays will do as much here and there one tis well done methinks and all happiness befall them for so doing five thousand eight hundred ninety Leontius a philosopher of Athens had a fair daughter called Athenais multo corporis lepore ac Venere saith mine author of a comely carriage he gave her no portion but her bringing up occulto formae praesagio out of some secret foreknowledge of her fortune bestowing that little which he had amongst his other children But she thus qualified was preferred by some friends to Constantinople to serve Pulcheria the emperor s sister of whom she was baptised and called Eudocia Theodosius the emperor in short space took notice of her excellent beauty and good parts and a little after upon his sister s sole commendation made her his wife twas nobly done of Theodosius five thousand eight hundred ninety one Rudophe was the fairest lady in her days in all Egypt she went to wash her and by chance her maids meanwhile looking but carelessly to her clothes an eagle stole away one of her shoes and laid it in Psammeticus the King of Egypt s lap at Memphis he wondered at the excellency of the shoe and pretty foot but more Aquilae factum at the manner of the bringing of it and caused forthwith proclamation to be made that she that owned that shoe should come presently to his court the virgin came and was forthwith married to the king I say this was heroically done and like a prince I commend him for it and all such as have means that will either do as he did themselves or so for love c marry their children If he be rich let him take such a one as wants if she be virtuously given for as Siracides cap seven ver nineteen adviseth Forego not a wife and good woman for her grace is above gold If she have fortunes of her own let her make a man Danaus of Lacedaemon had a many daughters to bestow and means enough for them all he never stood inquiring after great matches as others used to do but five thousand eight hundred ninety two sent for a company of brave young gallants to his house and bid his daughters choose every one one whom she liked best and take him for her husband without any more ado This act of his was much approved in those times But in this iron age of ours we respect riches alone for a maid must buy her husband now with a great dowry if she will have him covetousness and filthy lucre mars all good matches or some such by respects Crales a Servian prince as Nicephorus Gregoras Rom hist lib six relates it was an earnest suitor to Eudocia the emperor s sister though her brother much desired it yet she could not five thousand eight hundred ninety three abide him for he had three former wives all basely abused but the emperor still Cralis amicitiam magni faciens because he was a great prince and a troublesome neighbour much desired his affinity and to that end betrothed his own daughter Simonida to him a little girl five years of age he being forty five and five five thousand eight hundred ninety four years older than the emperor himself such disproportionable and unlikely matches can wealth and a fair fortune make And yet not that alone it is not only money but sometimes vainglory pride ambition do as much harm as wretched covetousness itself in another extreme If a yeoman have one sole daughter he must overmatch her above her birth and calling to a gentleman forsooth because of her great portion too good for one of her own rank as he supposeth a gentleman s daughter and heir must be married to a knight baronet s eldest son at least and a knight s only daughter to a baron himself or an earl and so upwards

Bononian doctor once writ impediri enim studia literarum c but he recanted at last and in a solemn sort with true conceived words he did ask the world and all women forgiveness But you shall have the story as he relates himself in his Commentaries on the sixth of Apuleius For a long time I lived a single life et ab uxore ducenda semper abhorrui nec quicquam libero lecto censui jucundius I could not abide marriage but as a rambler erraticus ac volaticus amator to use his own words per multiplices amores discurrebam I took a snatch where I could get it nay more I railed at marriage downright

he lay upon his death bed was told by Apollo s Oracle that if he could get anybody to die for him he should live longer yet but when all refused his parents etsi decrepiti friends and followers forsook him Alcestus his wife though young most willingly undertook it what more can be desired or expected And although on the other side there be an infinite number of bad husbands I should rail downright against some of them able to discourage any women yet there be some good ones again and those most observant of marriage rites An honest country fellow as Fulgosus relates it in the kingdom of Naples five thousand nine hundred forty three at plough by the seaside saw his wife carried away by Mauritanian pirates he ran after in all haste up to the chin first and when he could wade no longer swam calling to the governor of the ship to deliver his wife or if he must not have her restored to let him follow as a prisoner for he was resolved to be a galley slave his drudge willing to endure any misery so that he might but enjoy his dear wife The Moors seeing the man s constancy and relating the whole matter to their governors at Tunis set them both free and gave them an honest pension to maintain themselves during their lives I could tell many stories to this effect but put case it often prove otherwise because marriage is troublesome wholly therefore to avoid it is no argument five thousand nine hundred forty four He that will avoid trouble must avoid the world Eusebius praepar Evangel five cap fifty Some trouble there is in marriage I deny not Etsi grave sit

die religiously and as he ought without a wife persuasus neminem posse neque pie vivere neque bene mori citra uxorem he is false an enemy to the commonwealth injurious to himself destructive to the world an apostate to nature a rebel against heaven and earth Let our wilful obstinate and stale bachelors ruminate of this If we could live without wives as Marcellus Numidicus said in five thousand nine hundred fifty four Agellius we would all want them but because we cannot let all marry and consult rather to the public good than their own private pleasure or estate It were an happy thing as

help to get it three Art in prosperity thine happiness is doubled four Art in adversity she ll comfort assist bear a part of thy burden to make it more tolerable five Art at home she ll drive away melancholy six Art abroad she looks after thee going from home wishes for thee in thine absence and joyfully welcomes thy return seven There s nothing delightsome without society no society so sweet as matrimony eight The band of conjugal love is adamantine nine The sweet company of kinsmen increaseth the number of parents is doubled of brothers sisters nephews ten Thou art made a father by a fair and happy issue eleven Moses curseth the barrenness of matrimony how much more a single life twelve If nature escape not punishment surely thy will shall not avoid it All this is true say you and who knows it not but how easy a matter is it to answer these motives and to make an Antiparodia quite opposite unto it To exercise myself I will essay one Hast thou means thou hast one to spend it two Hast none thy beggary is increased three Art in prosperity thy happiness is ended four Art in adversity like Job s wife she ll aggravate thy misery vex thy soul make thy burden intolerable five Art at home she ll scold thee out of doors six Art abroad If thou be wise keep thee so she ll perhaps graft horns in thine absence scowl on thee coming home seven Nothing gives more content than solitariness no solitariness like this of a single life eight The band of marriage is adamantine no hope of losing it thou art undone nine Thy number increaseth thou shalt be devoured by thy wife s friends ten Thou art made a cornuto by an unchaste wife and shalt bring up other folks children instead of thine own eleven Paul commends marriage yet he prefers a single life twelve Is marriage honourable What an immortal crown belongs to virginity So Siracides himself speaks as much as may be for and against women so doth almost every philosopher plead pro and con every poet thus argues the case though what cares vulgus nominum what they say so can I conceive peradventure and so canst thou when all is said yet since some be good some bad let s put it to the venture I conclude therefore with Seneca cur Toro viduo jaces Tristem juventam solve mine luxus rape Effunde habenas optimos vitae dies Effluere prohibe Why dost thou lie alone let thy youth and best days to pass away Marry whilst thou mayst

family of Stoics who shall refuse to submit his grave beard and supercilious looks to the clipping of a wife or disagree from his fellows in this point For what more willingly as five thousand nine hundred sixty four Varro holds can a proper man see than a fair wife a sweet wife a loving wife can the world afford a better sight sweeter content a fairer object a more gracious aspect Since then this of marriage is the last and best refuge and cure of heroical love all doubts are cleared and impediments removed I say again what remains but that according to both their desires they be happily joined since it cannot otherwise be helped God send us all good wives every man his wish in this kind and me mine five thousand nine hundred sixty five And God that all this world hath ywrought Send

rivals or after as in this place Valescus de Taranta cap de Melanchol Aelian Montaltus Felix Platerus Guianerius put jealousy for a cause of melancholy others for a symptom because melancholy persons amongst these passions and perturbations of the mind are most obnoxious to it But methinks for the latitude it hath and that prerogative above other ordinary symptoms it ought to be treated of as a species apart being of so great and eminent note so furious a passion and almost of as great extent as love itself as five thousand nine hundred eighty two Benedetto Varchi holds no love without a mixture of jealousy qui non zelat non amat For these causes I will dilate and treat of it by itself as a bastard branch or kind of love melancholy which as heroical love goeth commonly before marriage doth usually follow torture and crucify in like sort deserves therefore to be rectified alike requires as much care and industry in setting out the several causes of it prognostics and cures Which I have more willingly done that he that is or hath been jealous may see his error as in a glass he that is not may learn to detest avoid it himself and dispossess others that are anywise affected with it Jealousy is described and defined to be five thousand nine hundred eighty three a certain suspicion which the lover hath of the party he chiefly loveth lest he or she should be enamoured of another or any eager desire to enjoy some beauty alone to have it proper to himself only a fear or doubt lest any foreigner should participate or share with him in his love Or as five thousand nine hundred eighty four Scaliger adds a fear of losing her favour whom he so earnestly affects Cardan calls it a five thousand nine hundred eighty five zeal for love and a kind of envy lest any man should beguile us five thousand nine hundred eighty six Ludovicus Vives defines it in the very same words or little differing in sense There be many other jealousies but improperly so called all as that of parents tutors guardians over their children friends whom they love or such as are left to their wardship or protection five thousand nine hundred eighty seven Storax non rediit hac nocte a coena Aeschinus Neque servulorum quispiam qui adversum ierant As the old man in the comedy cried out in a passion and from a solicitous fear and care he had of his adopted son five thousand nine hundred eighty eight not of beauty but lest they should miscarry do amiss or any way discredit disgrace as Vives notes or endanger themselves and us five thousand nine hundred eighty nine Aegeus was so solicitous for his son Theseus when he went to fight with the Minotaur of his success lest he should be foiled five thousand nine hundred ninety Prona est timori semper in pejus fides We are still apt to suspect the worst in such doubtful cases as many wives in their husband s absence fond mothers in their children s lest if absent they should be misled or sick and are continually expecting news from them how they do fare and what is become of them they cannot endure to have them long out of their sight oh my sweet son O my dear child c Paul was jealous over the Church of Corinth as he confesseth two Cor xi twelve With a godly jealousy to present them a pure virgin to Christ and he was afraid still lest as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety so their minds should be corrupt from the simplicity that is in Christ God himself in some sense is said to be jealous five thousand nine hundred ninety one I am a jealous God and will visit so Psalm lxxix five Shall thy jealousy burn like fire for ever But these are improperly called jealousies and by a metaphor to show the care and solicitude they have of them Although some jealousies express all the symptoms of this which we treat of fear sorrow anguish anxiety suspicion hatred c the object only varied That of some fathers is very eminent to their sons and heirs for though they love them dearly being children yet now coming towards man s estate they may not well abide them the son and heir is commonly sick of the father and the father again may not well brook his eldest son inde simultates plerumque contentiones et inimicitiae but that of princes is most notorious as when they fear company rivals if I may so call them successors emulators subjects or such as they have offended five thousand nine hundred ninety two Omnisque potestas impatiens consortis erit they are still suspicious lest their authority should be diminished five thousand nine hundred ninety three as one observes and as Comineus hath it five thousand nine hundred ninety four it cannot be expressed what slender causes they have of their grief and suspicion a secret disease that commonly lurks and breeds in princes families Sometimes it is for their honour only as that of Adrian the emperor five thousand nine hundred ninety five that killed all his emulators Saul envied David Domitian Agricola because he did excel him obscure his honour as he thought eclipse his fame Juno turned Praetus daughters into kine for that they contended with her for beauty five thousand nine hundred ninety six Cyparissae king Eteocles children were envied of the goddesses for their excellent good parts and dancing amongst the rest saith five thousand nine hundred ninety seven Constantine and for that cause flung headlong from heaven and buried in a pit but the earth took pity of them and brought out cypress trees to preserve their memories five thousand nine hundred ninety eight Niobe Arachne and Marsyas can testify as much But it is most grievous when it is for a kingdom itself or matters of commodity it produceth lamentable effects especially amongst tyrants in despotico Imperio and such as are more feared than beloved of their subjects that get and keep their sovereignty by force and fear five thousand nine hundred ninety nine Quod civibus tenere te invitis scias c as Phalaris Dionysius Periander held theirs For though fear cowardice and jealousy in Plutarch s opinion be the common causes of tyranny as in Nero Caligula Tiberius yet most take them to be symptoms For six thousand what slave what hangman as Bodine well expresseth this passion l two c five de rep can so cruelly torture a condemned person as this fear and suspicion Fear of death infamy torments are those furies and vultures that vex and disquiet tyrants and torture them day and night with perpetual terrors and affrights envy suspicion fear desire of revenge and a thousand such disagreeing perturbations turn and affright the soul out of the hinges of health and more grievously wound and pierce than those cruel masters can exasperate and vex their apprentices or servants with clubs whips chains and tortures Many terrible examples we have in this kind amongst the Turks especially many jealous outrages six thousand one Selimus killed Kornutus his youngest brother five of his nephews Mustapha Bassa and divers others six thousand two Bajazet the second Turk jealous of the valour and greatness of Achmet Bassa caused him to be slain six thousand three Suleiman the Magnificent murdered his own son Mustapha and tis an ordinary thing amongst them to make away their brothers or any competitors at the first coming to the crown tis all the solemnity they use at their fathers funerals What mad pranks in his jealous fury did Herod of old commit in Jewry when he massacred all the children of a year old six thousand four Valens the emperor in Constantinople when as he left no man alive of quality in his kingdom that had his name begun with Theo Theodoti Theognosti Theodosii Theoduli c They went all to their long home because a wizard told him that name should succeed in his empire And what furious designs hath six thousand five Jo Basilius that Muscovian tyrant practised of late It is a wonder to read that strange suspicion which Suetonius reports of Claudius Caesar and of Domitian they were afraid of every man they saw and which Herodian of Antoninus and Geta those two jealous brothers the one could not endure so much as the other s servants but made away him his chiefest followers and all that belonged to him or were his well wishers six thousand six Maximinus perceiving himself to be odious to most men because he was come to that height of honour out of base beginnings and suspecting his mean parentage would be objected to him caused all the senators that were nobly descended to be slain in a jealous humour turned all the servants of Alexander his predecessor out of doors and slew many of them because they lamented their master s death suspecting them to be traitors for the love they bare to him When Alexander in his fury had made Clitus his dear friend to be put to death and saw now saith six thousand seven Curtius an alienation in his subjects hearts none durst talk with him he began to be jealous of himself lest they should attempt as much on him and said they lived like so many wild beasts in a wilderness one afraid of another Our modern stories afford us many notable examples six thousand eight Henry the Third of France jealous of Henry of Lorraine Duke of Guise anno fifteen eighty eight caused him to be murdered in his own chamber six thousand nine Louis the Eleventh was so suspicious he durst not trust his children every man about him he suspected for a traitor many strange tricks Comineus telleth of him How jealous was our Henry the six thousand ten Fourth of King Richard the Second so long as he lived after he was deposed and of his own son Henry in his latter days which the prince well perceiving came to visit his father in his sickness in a watchet velvet gown full of eyelet holes and with needles sticking in them as an emblem of jealousy and so pacified his suspicious father after some speeches and protestations which he had used to that purpose Perpetual imprisonment as that of Robert six thousand eleven Duke of Normandy in the days of Henry the First forbidding of marriage to some persons with such like edicts and prohibitions are ordinary in all states In a word six thousand twelve as he said three things cause jealousy a mighty state a rich treasure a fair wife or where there is a cracked title much tyranny and exactions In our state as being freed from all these fears and miseries we may be most secure and happy under the reign of our fortunate prince six thousand thirteen His fortune hath indebted him to none But to all his people universally And not to them but for their love alone Which they account as placed worthily He is so set he hath no cause to be Jealous or dreadful of disloyalty The pedestal whereon his greatness stands Is held of all our hearts and all our hands But I rove I confess These equivocations jealousies and many such which crucify the souls of men are not here properly meant or in this distinction of ours included but that alone which is for beauty tending to love and wherein they can brook no company rival or endure any participation and this jealousy belongs as well to brute beasts as men Some creatures saith six thousand fourteen Vives swans doves cocks bulls c are jealous as well as men and as much moved for fear of communion six thousand fifteen Grege pro toto bella juvenci Si con jugio timuere suo Poscunt timidi praelia cervi Et mugitus dant concepti signa furoris In Venus cause what mighty battles make Your raving bulls and stirs for their herd s sake And harts and bucks that are so timorous Will fight and roar if once they be but jealous In bulls horses goats this is most apparently discerned Bulls especially alium in pascuis non admittit he will not admit another bull to feed in the same pasture saith six thousand sixteen Oppin which Stephanus Bathorius late king of Poland used as an impress with that motto Regnum non capit duos R T in his Blazon of Jealousy telleth a story of a swan about Windsor that finding a strange cock with his mate did swim I know not how many miles after to kill him and when he had so done came back and killed his hen a certain truth he saith done upon Thames as many watermen and neighbour gentlemen can tell Fidem suam liberet for my part I do believe it may be true for swans have ever been branded with that epithet of jealousy six thousand seventeen The jealous swanne against his death that singeth And eke the owle that of death bode bringeth six thousand eighteen Some say as much of elephants that they are more jealous than any other creatures whatsoever and those old Egyptians as six thousand nineteen Pierius informeth us express in their hieroglyphics the passion of jealousy by a camel six thousand twenty because that fearing the worst still about matters of venery he loves solitudes that he may enjoy his pleasure alone et in quoscunque obvios insurgit Zelolypiae stimulis agitatus he will quarrel and fight with whatsoever comes next man or beast in his jealous fits I have read as much of six thousand twenty one crocodiles and if Peter Martyr s authority be authentic legat Babylonicae lib three you shall have a strange tale to that purpose confidently related Another story of the jealousy of dogs see in Hieron Fabricius Tract three cap five de loquela animalium But this furious passion is most eminent in men and is as well amongst bachelors as married men If it appear amongst bachelors we commonly call them rivals or company rivals a metaphor derived from a river rivales a six thousand twenty two rivo for as a river saith Acron in Hor Art Poet and Donat in Ter Eunuch divides a common ground between two men and both participate of it so is a woman indifferent between two suitors both likely to enjoy her and thence comes this emulation which breaks out many times into tempestuous storms and produceth lamentable effects murder itself with much cruelty many single combats They cannot endure the least injury done unto them before their mistress and in her defence will bite off one another s noses they are most impatient of any flout disgrace lest emulation or participation in that kind six thousand twenty three Lacerat lacerium Largi mordax Memnius Memnius the Roman as Tully tells the story de oratore lib two being company rival with Largus Terracina bit him by the arm which fact of his was so famous that it afterwards grew to a proverb in those parts six thousand twenty four Phaedria could not abide his company rival Thraso for when Parmeno demanded numquid aliud imperas whether he would command him any more service No more saith he but to speak in his behalf and to drive away his company rival if he could Constantine in the eleventh book of his husbandry cap eleven hath a pleasant tale of the pine tree six thousand twenty five she was once a fair maid whom Pineus and Boreas two company rivals dearly sought but jealous Boreas broke her neck c And in his eighteenth chapter he telleth another tale of six thousand twenty six Mars that in his jealousy slew Adonis Petronius calleth this passion amantium furiosum aemulationem a furious emulation and their symptoms are well expressed by Sir Geoffrey Chaucer in his first Canterbury Tale It will make the nearest and dearest friends fall out they will endure all other things to be common goods lands moneys participate of each pleasure and take in good part any disgraces injuries in another kind but as Propertius well describes it in an elegy of his in this they will suffer nothing have no company rivals six thousand twenty seven Tu mihi vel ferro pectus vel perde veneno A domina tantum te modo tolle mea Te socium vitae te corporis esse licebit Te dominum admitto rebus amice meis Lecto te solum lecto te deprecor uno Rivalem possum non ego ferre Jovem Stab me with sword or poison strong Give me to work my bane So thou court not my lass so thou From mistress mine refrain Command myself my body purse As thine own goods take all And as my ever dearest friend I ever use thee shall O spare my love to have alone Her to myself I crave Nay Jove himself I ll not endure My rival for to have This jealousy which I am to treat of is that which belongs to married men in respect of their own wives to whose estate as no sweetness pleasure happiness can be compared in the world if they live quietly and lovingly together so if they disagree or be jealous those bitter pills of sorrow and grief disastrous mischiefs mischances tortures gripings discontents are not to be separated from them A most violent passion it is where it taketh place an unspeakable torment a hellish torture an infernal plague as Ariosto calls it a fury a continual fever full of suspicion fear and sorrow a martyrdom a mirth marring monster The sorrow and grief of heart of one woman jealous of another is heavier than death Ecclus xxviii six as six thousand twenty eight Peninnah did Hannah vex her and upbraid her sore Tis a main vexation a most intolerable burden a corrosive to all content a frenzy a madness itself as six thousand twenty nine Beneditto Varchi proves out of that select sonnet of Giovanni de la Casa that reverend lord as he styles him SUBSECT II Causes of Jealousy Who are most apt Idleness melancholy impotency long absence beauty wantonness naught themselves Allurements from time place persons bad usage causes Astrologers make the stars a cause or sign of this bitter passion and out of every man s horoscope will give a probable conjecture whether he will be jealous or no and at what time by direction of the significators to their several promissors their aphorisms are to be read in Albubater Pontanus Schoner Junctine c Bodine cap five meth hist ascribes a great cause to the country or clime and discourseth largely there of this subject saying that southern men are more hot lascivious and jealous than such as live in the north they can hardly contain themselves in those hotter climes but are most subject to prodigious lust Leo Afer telleth incredible things almost of the lust and jealousy of his countrymen of Africa and especially such as live about Carthage and so doth every geographer of them in six thousand thirty Asia Turkey Spaniards Italians Germany hath not so many drunkards England tobacconists France dancers Holland mariners as Italy alone hath jealous husbands And in six thousand thirty one Italy some account them of Piacenza more jealous than the rest In six thousand thirty two Germany France Britain Scandia Poland Muscovy they are not so troubled with this feral malady although Damianus a Goes which I do much wonder at in his topography of Lapland and Herbastein of Russia against the stream of all other geographers would fasten it upon those northern inhabitants Altomarius Poggius and Munster in his description of Baden reports that men and women of all sorts go commonly into the baths together without all suspicion the name of jealousy saith Munster is not so much as once heard of among them In Friesland the women kiss him they drink to and are kissed again of those they pledge The virgins in Holland go hand in hand with young men from home glide on the ice such is their harmless liberty and lodge together abroad without suspicion which rash Sansovinus an Italian makes a great sign of unchastity In France upon small acquaintance it is usual to court other men s wives to come to their houses and accompany them arm in arm in the streets without imputation In the most northern countries young men and maids familiarly dance together men and their wives six thousand thirty three which Siena only excepted Italians may not abide The six thousand thirty four Greeks on the other side have their private baths for men and women where they must not come near nor so much as see one another and as six thousand thirty five Bodine observes lib five de repub the Italians could never endure this or a Spaniard the very conceit of it would make him mad and for that cause they lock up their women and will not suffer them to be near men so much as in the six thousand thirty six church but with a partition between He telleth moreover how that when he was ambassador in England he heard Mendoza the Spanish legate finding fault with it as a filthy custom for men and women to sit promiscuously in churches together but doctor Dale the master of the requests told him again that it was indeed a filthy custom in Spain where they could not contain themselves from lascivious thoughts in their holy places but not with us Baronius in his Annals out of Eusebius taxeth Licinius the emperor for a decree of his made to this effect Jubens ne viri simul cum mulieribus in ecclesia interessent for being prodigiously naught himself aliorum naturam ex sua vitiosa mente spectavit he so esteemed others But we are far from any such strange conceits and will permit our wives and daughters to go to the tavern with a friend as Aubanus saith modo absit lascivia and suspect nothing to kiss coming and going which as Erasmus writes in one of his epistles they cannot endure England is a paradise for women and hell for horses Italy a paradise for horses hell for women as the diverb goes Some make a question whether this headstrong passion rage more in women than men as Montaigne l three But sure it is more outrageous in women as all other melancholy is by reason of the weakness of their sex Scaliger Poet lib cap thirteen concludes against women six thousand thirty seven Besides their inconstancy treachery suspicion dissimulation superstition pride for all women are by nature proud desire of sovereignty if they be great women he gives instance in Juno bitterness and jealousy are the most remarkable affections Sed neque fulvus aper media tam fulvus in ira est Fulmineo rapidos dum rotat ore canes Nec leo c Tiger boar bear viper lioness A woman s fury cannot express six thousand thirty eight Some say redheaded women pale coloured black eyed and of a shrill voice are most subject to jealousy six thousand thirty nine High colour in a woman choler shows Naught are they peevish proud malicious But worst of all red shrill and jealous Comparisons are odious I neither parallel them with others nor debase them any more men and women are both bad and too subject to this pernicious infirmity It is most part a symptom and cause of melancholy as Plater and Valescus teach us melancholy men are apt to be jealous and jealous apt to be melancholy Pale jealousy child of insatiate love Of heart sick thoughts which melancholy bred A hell tormenting fear no faith can move By discontent with deadly poison fed With heedless youth and error vainly led A mortal plague a virtue drowning flood A hellish fire not quenched but with blood If idleness concur with melancholy such persons are most apt to be jealous tis six thousand forty Nevisanus note an idle woman is presumed to be lascivious and often jealous Mulier cum sola cogitat male cogitat and tis not unlikely for they have no other business to trouble their heads with More particular causes be these which follow Impotency first when a man is not able of himself to perform those dues which he ought unto his wife for though he be an honest liver hurt no man yet Trebius the lawyer may make a question an suum cuique tribuat whether he give every one their own and therefore when he takes notice of his wants and perceives her to be more craving clamorous insatiable and prone to lust than is fit he begins presently to suspect that wherein he is defective she will satisfy herself she will be pleased by some other means Cornelius Gallus hath elegantly expressed this humour in an epigram to his Lychoris six thousand forty one Jamque alios juvenes aliosque requirit amores Me vocat imbellem decrepitumque senem c For this cause is most evident in old men that are cold and dry by nature and married succi plenis to young wanton wives with old doting Janivere in Chaucer they begin to mistrust all is not well She was young and he was old And therefore he feared to be a cuckold And how should it otherwise be old age is a disease of itself loathsome full of suspicion and fear when it is at best unable unfit for such matters six thousand forty two Tam apta nuptiis quam bruma messibus as welcome to a young woman as snow in harvest saith Nevisanus Et si capis juvenculam faciet tibi cornua marry a lusty maid and she will surely graft horns on thy head six thousand forty three All women are slippery often unfaithful to their husbands as Aeneas Sylvius epist thirty eight seconds him but to old men most treacherous they had rather mortem amplexarier lie with a corse than such a one six thousand forty four Oderunt illum pueri contemnunt mulieres On the other side many men saith Hieronymus are suspicious of their wives six thousand forty five if they be lightly given but old folks above the rest Insomuch that she did not complain without a cause in six thousand forty six Apuleius of an old bald bedridden knave she had to her good man Poor woman as I am what shall I do I have an old grim sire to my husband as bald as a coot as little and as unable as a child a bedful of bones he keeps all the doors barred and locked upon me woe is me what shall I do He was jealous and she made him a cuckold for keeping her up suspicion without a cause hard usage is able of itself to make a woman fly out that was otherwise honest six thousand forty seven plerasque bonas tractatio pravas Esse facit bad usage aggravates the matter Nam quando mulieres cognoscunt maritum hoc advertere licentius peccant six thousand forty eight as Nevisanus holds when a woman thinks her husband watcheth her she will sooner offend six thousand forty nine Liberius peccant et pudor omnis abest rough handling makes them worse as the goodwife of Bath in Chaucer brags In his own grease I made him frie For anger and for every jealousie Of two extremes this of hard usage is the worst Tis a great fault for some men are uxorii to be too fond of their wives to dote on them as six thousand fifty Senior Deliro on his Fallace to be too effeminate or as some do to be sick for their wives breed children for them and like the six thousand fifty one Tiberini lie in for them as some birds hatch eggs by turns they do all women s offices Caelius Rhodiginus ant lect Lib six cap twenty four makes mention of a fellow out of Seneca six thousand fifty two that was so besotted on his wife he could not endure a moment out of her company he wore her scarf when he went abroad next his heart and would never drink but in that cup she began first We have many such fondlings that are their wives packhorses and slaves nam grave malum uxor superans virum suum as the comical poet hath it there s no greater misery to a man than to let his wife domineer to carry her muff dog and fan let her wear the breeches lay out spend and do what she will go and come whither when she will they give consent Here take my muff and do you hear good man Now give me pearl and carry you my fan c six thousand fifty three poscit pallam redimicula inaures Curre quid hic cessas vulgo vult illa videri Tu pete lecticas many brave and worthy men have trespassed in this kind multos foras claros domestica haec destruxit infamia and many noble senators and soldiers as six thousand fifty four Pliny notes have lost their honour in being uxorii so sottishly overruled by their wives and therefore Cato in Plutarch made a bitter jest on his fellow citizens the Romans we govern all the world abroad and our wives at home rule us These offend in one extreme but too hard and too severe are far more offensive on the other As just a cause may be long absence of either party when they must of necessity be much from home as lawyers physicians mariners by their professions or otherwise make frivolous impertinent journeys tarry long abroad to no purpose lie out and are gadding still upon small occasions it must needs yield matter of suspicion when they use their wives unkindly in the meantime and never tarry at home it cannot use but engender some such conceit six thousand fifty five Uxor si cessas amare te cogitat Aut tote amari aut potare aut animo obsequi Ex tibi bene esse soli quum sibi sit male If thou be absent long thy wife then thinks Th art drunk at ease or with some pretty minx Tis well with thee or else beloved of some Whilst she poor soul doth fare full ill at home Hippocrates the physician had a smack of this disease for when he was to go home as far as Abdera and some other remote cities of Greece he writ to his friend Dionysius if at least those six thousand fifty six Epistles be his six thousand fifty seven to oversee his wife in his absence as Apollo set a raven to watch his Coronis although she lived in his house with her father and mother who be knew would have a care of her yet that would not satisfy his jealousy he would have his special friend Dionysius to dwell in his house with her all the time of his peregrination and to observe her behaviour how she carried herself in her husband s absence and that she did not lust after other men six thousand fifty eight For a woman had need to have an overseer to keep her honest they are bad by nature and lightly given all and if they be not curbed in time as an unpruned tree they will be full of wild branches and degenerate of a sudden Especially in their husband s absence though one Lucretia were trusty and one Penelope yet Clytemnestra made Agamemnon cuckold and no question there be too many of her conditions If their husbands tarry too long abroad upon unnecessary business well they may suspect or if they run one way their wives at home will fly out another quid pro quo Or if present and give them not that content which they ought six thousand fifty nine Primum ingratae mox invisae noctes quae per somnum transiguntur they cannot endure to lie alone or to fast long six thousand sixty Peter Godefridus in his second book of Love and sixth chapter hath a story out of saint Anthony s life of a gentleman who by that good man s advice would not meddle with his wife in the passion week but for his pains she set a pair of horns on his head Such another he hath out of Abstemius one persuaded a new married man six thousand sixty one to forbear the three first nights and he should all his lifetime after be fortunate in cattle but his impatient wife would not tarry so long well he might speed in cattle but not in children Such a tale hath Heinsius of an impotent and slack scholar a mere student and a friend of his that seeing by chance a fine damsel sing and dance would needs marry her the match was soon made for he was young and rich genis gratus corpore glabellus arte multiscius et fortuna opulentus like that Apollo in six thousand sixty two Apuleius The first night having liberally taken his liquor as in that country they do my fine scholar was so fuzzled that he no sooner was laid in bed but he fell fast asleep never waked till morning and then much abashed purpureis formosa rosis cum Aurora ruberet when the fair morn with purple hue gan shine he made an excuse I know not what out of Hippocrates Cous c and for that time it went current but when as afterward he did not play the man as he should do she fell in league with a good fellow and whilst he sat up late at his study about those criticisms mending some hard places in Festus or Pollux came cold to bed and would tell her still what he had done she did not much regard what he said c six thousand sixty three She would have another matter mended much rather which he did not conceive was corrupt thus he continued at his study late she at her sport alibi enim festivas noctes agitabat hating all scholars for his sake till at length he began to suspect and turned a little yellow as well he might for it was his own fault and if men be jealous in such cases six thousand sixty four as oft it falls out the mends is in their own hands they must thank themselves Who will pity them saith Neander or be much offended with such wives si deceptae prius viros decipiant et cornutos reddant if they deceive those that cozened them first A lawyer s wife in six thousand sixty five Aristaenetus because her husband was negligent in his business quando lecto danda opera threatened to cornute him and did not stick to tell Philinna one of her gossips as much and that aloud for him to hear If he follow other men s matters and leave his own I ll have an orator shall plead my cause I care not if he know it A fourth eminent cause of jealousy may be this when he that is deformed and as Pindarus of Vulcan sine gratiis natus hirsute ragged yet virtuously given will marry some fair nice piece or light housewife begins to misdoubt as well he may she doth not affect him six thousand sixty six Lis est cum forma magna pudicitiae beauty and honesty have ever been at odds Abraham was jealous of his wife because she was fair so was Vulcan of his Venus when he made her creaking shoes saith six thousand sixty seven Philostratus ne maecharetur sandalio scilicet deferente that he might hear by them when she stirred which Mars indigne ferre six thousand sixty eight was not well pleased with Good cause had Vulcan to do as he did for she was no honester than she should be Your fine faces have commonly this fault and it is hard to find saith Francis Philelphus in an epistle to Saxola his friend a rich man honest a proper woman not proud or unchaste Can she be fair and honest too six thousand sixty nine Saepe etenim oculuit picta sese hydra sub herba Sub specie formae incauto se saepe marito Nequam animus vendit He that marries a wife that is snowy fair alone let him look saith six thousand seventy Barbarus for no better success than Vulcan had with Venus or Claudius with Messalina And tis impossible almost in such cases the wife should contain or the good man not be jealous for when he is so defective weak ill proportioned unpleasing in those parts which women most affect and she most absolutely fair and able on the other side if she be not very virtuously given how can she love him and although she be not fair yet if he admire her and think her so in his conceit she is absolute he holds it impossible for any man living not to dote as he doth to look on her and not lust not to covet and if he be in company with her not to lay siege to her honesty or else out of a deep apprehension of his infirmities deformities and other men s good parts out of his own little worth and desert he distrusts himself for what is jealousy but distrust he suspects she cannot affect him or be not so kind and loving as she should she certainly loves some other man better than himself six thousand seventy one Nevisanus lib four num seventy two will have barrenness to be a main cause of jealousy If her husband cannot play the man some other shall they will leave no remedies unessayed and thereupon the good man grows jealous I could give an instance but be it as it is I find this reason given by some men because they have been formerly naught themselves they think they may be so served by others they turned up trump before the cards were shuffled they shall have therefore legem talionis like for like six thousand seventy two Ipse miser docui quo posset ludere pacto Custodes eheu nunc premor arte mea Wretch as I was I taught her bad to be And now mine own sly tricks are put upon me Mala mens malus animus as the saying is ill dispositions cause ill suspicions six thousand seventy three There is none jealous I durst pawn my life But he that hath defiled another s wife And for that he himself hath gone astray He straightway thinks his wife will tread that way To these two above named causes or incendiaries of this rage I may very well annex those circumstances of time place persons by which it ebbs and flows the fuel of this fury as six thousand seventy four Vives truly observes and such like accidents or occasions proceeding from the parties themselves or others which much aggravate and intend this suspicious humour For many men are so lasciviously given either out of a depraved nature or too much liberty which they do assume unto themselves by reason of their greatness in that they are noble men for licentiae peccandi et multitudo peccantium are great motives though their own wives be never so fair noble virtuous honest wise able and well given they must have change six thousand seventy five Qui cum legitimi junguntur foedere lecti Virtute egregiis facieque domoque puellis Scorta tamen foedasque lupas in fornice quaerunt Et per adulterium nova carpere gaudia tentant Who being match d to wives most virtuous Noble and fair fly out lascivious Quod licet ingratum est that which is ordinary is unpleasant Nero saith Tacitus abhorred Octavia his own wife a noble virtuous lady and loved Acte a base quean in respect six thousand seventy six Cerinthus rejected Sulpitia a nobleman s daughter and courted a poor servant maid tanta est aliena in messe voluptas for that six thousand seventy seven stolen waters be more pleasant or as Vitellius the emperor was wont to say Jucundiores amores qui cum periculo habentur like stolen venison still the sweetest is that love which is most difficultly attained they like better to hunt by stealth in another man s walk than to have the fairest course that may be at game of their own six thousand seventy eight Aspice ut in coelo modo sol modo luna ministret Sic etiam nobis una pella parum est As sun and moon in heaven change their course So they change loves though often to the worse Or that some fair object so forcibly moves them they cannot contain themselves be it heard or seen they will be at it six thousand seventy nine Nessus the centaur was by agreement to carry Hercules and his wife over the river Evenus no sooner had he set Dejanira on the other side but he would have offered violence unto her leaving Hercules to swim over as he could and though her husband was a spectator yet would he not desist till Hercules with a poisoned arrow shot him to death six thousand eighty Neptune saw by chance that Thessalian Tyro Eunippius wife he forthwith in the fury of his lust counterfeited her husband s habit and made him cuckold Tarquin heard Collatine commend his wife and was so far enraged that in the midst of the night to her he went six thousand eighty one Theseus stole Ariadne vi rapuit that Trazenian Anaxa Antiope and now being old Helen a girl not yet ready for a husband Great men are most part thus affected all as a horse they neigh saith six thousand eighty two Jeremiah after their neighbours wives ut visa pullus adhinnit equa and if they be in company with other women though in their own wives presence they must be courting and dallying with them Juno in Lucian complains of Jupiter that he was still kissing Ganymede before her face which did not a little offend her and besides he was a counterfeit Amphitryo a bull a swan a golden shower and played many such bad pranks too long too shameful to relate Or that they care little for their own ladies and fear no laws they dare freely keep whores at their wives noses Tis too frequent with noblemen to be dishonest Pielas probitas fides privata bona sunt as six thousand eighty three he said long since piety chastity and such like virtues are for private men not to be much looked after in great courts and which Suetonius of the good princes of his time they might be all engraven in one ring we may truly hold of chaste potentates of our age For great personages will familiarly

And weeps as fast and comforts her his best c All this might not assuage the woman s pain Needs must I die before you come again Nor how to keep my life I can devise The doleful days and nights I

attain to tell By force of eloquence or help of art Of women s treacheries the hundredth part Both to say truth are often faulty men and women give just occasions in this humour of discontent aggravate and yield matter of suspicion but most part of the chief causes proceed from other adventitious accidents and circumstances though the parties be free and both well given themselves The indiscreet carriage of some lascivious gallant et e contra of some light woman by his often frequenting of a house bold unseemly gestures may make a breach and by his over familiarity if he be inclined to yellowness colour him quite out If he be poor basely born saith Beneditto Varchi and otherwise unhandsome he suspects him the less but if a proper man such as was Alcibiades in Greece and Castruccius Castrucanus in Italy well descended commendable for his good parts he taketh on the more and watcheth his doings six thousand one hundred thirteen Theodosius the emperor gave his wife Eudoxia a golden apple when he was a suitor to her which she long after bestowed upon a young gallant in the court of her especial acquaintance The emperor espying this apple in his hand suspected forthwith more than was his wife s dishonesty banished him the court and from that day following forbare to accompany her any more six thousand one hundred fourteen A rich merchant had a fair wife according to his custom he went to travel in his absence a good fellow tempted his wife she denied him yet he dying a little after gave her a legacy for the love he bore her At his return her jealous husband because she had got more by land than he had done at sea turned her away upon suspicion Now when those other circumstances of time and place opportunity and importunity shall concur what will they not effect Fair opportunity can win the coyest she that is So wisely he takes time as he ll be sure he will not miss Then lie that loves her gamesome vein and tempers toys with art Brings love that swimmeth in her eyes to dive into her heart As at plays masks great feasts and banquets one singles out his wife to dance another courts her in his presence a third tempts her a fourth insinuates

common to all melancholy anxiety of mind suspicion aggravation restless thoughts paleness meagreness neglect of business and the like these men are farther yet misaffected and in a higher strain Tis a more vehement passion a more furious perturbation a bitter pain a fire a pernicious curiosity a gall corrupting the honey of our life madness vertigo plague hell they are more than ordinarily

loves her dearly she is his sweet most kind and loving wife he will not change nor leave her for a kingdom so he continues off and on as the toy takes him the object moves him but most part brawling fretting unquiet he is accusing and suspecting not strangers only but brothers and sisters father and mother nearest and dearest friends He thinks with those Italians Chi non tocca parentado Tocca mai e rado And through fear conceives unto himself things almost incredible and impossible to be effected As a heron when she fishes still prying on all sides or as a cat doth a mouse his eye is never off hers he gloats on him on her accurately observing on whom she looks who looks at her what she saith doth at dinner at supper sitting walking at home abroad he is the same still inquiring maundering gazing listening affrighted with every small object why did she smile why did she pity him commend him why did she drink twice to such a man why did she offer to kiss to dance c a whore a whore an

in of hell as he keeps his wife If a dear friend or near kinsman come as guest to his house to visit him he will never let him be out of his own sight and company lest peradventure c If the necessity of his business be such that he must go from home he doth either lock her up or commit her with a deal of injunctions and protestations to some trusty friends him and her he sets and bribes to oversee one servant is set in his absence to watch another and all to observe his wife and yet all this will not serve though his business be very urgent he will when he is halfway come back in all post haste rise from supper or at midnight and be gone and sometimes leave his business undone and as a stranger court his own wife in some disguised habit Though there be no danger at all no cause of suspicion she live in such a place where Messalina herself could not be dishonest if she would yet he suspects her as much as if she were in a bawdy house some prince s court or in a common inn where all comers might have free access He calls her on a sudden all to nought she is a strumpet a light housewife a bitch an arrant whore No persuasion no protestation can divert this passion nothing can ease him secure or give him satisfaction It is most strange to report what outrageous acts by men and women have been committed in this kind by women especially that will run after their husbands into all places and companies six thousand one hundred thirty as Jovianus Pontanus s wife did by him follow him whithersoever he went it matters not or upon what business raving like Juno in the tragedy miscalling cursing swearing and mistrusting every one she sees Gomesius in his third book of the Life and Deeds of Francis Ximenius sometime archbishop of Toledo hath a strange story of that incredible jealousy of Joan queen of Spain wife to King Philip mother of Ferdinand and Charles the Fifth emperors when her husband Philip either for that he was tired with his wife s jealousy or had some great business went into the Low Countries she was so impatient and melancholy upon his departure that she would scarce eat her meat or converse with any man and though she were with child the season of the year very bad the wind against her in all haste she would to sea after him Neither Isabella her queen mother the archbishop or any other friend could persuade her to the contrary but she would after him When she was now come into the Low Countries and kindly entertained by her husband she could not contain herself six thousand one hundred thirty one but in a rage ran upon a yellow haired wench with whom she suspected her husband to be naught cut off her hair did beat her black and blue and so dragged her about It is an ordinary thing for women in such cases to scratch the faces slit the noses of such as they suspect as Henry the Second s importune Juno did by Rosamond at Woodstock for she complains in a six thousand one hundred thirty two modern poet she scarce spake But flies with eager fury to my face Offering me most unwomanly disgrace Look how a tigress c So fell she on me in outrageous wise As could disdain and jealousy devise Or if it be so they dare not or cannot execute any such tyrannical injustice they will miscall rail and revile bear them deadly hate and malice as six thousand one hundred thirty three Tacitus observes The hatred of a jealous woman is inseparable against such as she suspects six thousand one hundred thirty four Nulla vis flammae tumidique venti Tanta nec teli metuanda torti Quanta cum conjux viduata taedis Ardet et odit Winds weapons flames make not such hurly burly As raving women turn all topsy turvy So did Agrippina by Lollia and Calphurnia in the days of Claudius But women are sufficiently curbed in such cases the rage

suffer nobody to come at them or their wives to be seen abroad nec campos liceat lustrare patentes They must not so much as look out And if they be great persons they have eunuchs to keep them as the Grand Signior among the Turks the Sophies of Persia those Tartarian Mogors and Kings of China Infantes masculos castrant innumeros ut regi serviant saith six thousand one hundred thirty seven Riccius they geld innumerable infants to this purpose the King of six thousand one hundred thirty eight China maintains ten thousand eunuchs in his family to keep his wives The Xeriffes of Barbary keep their courtesans in such a strict manner that if any man come but in sight of them he dies for it and if they chance to see a man and do not instantly cry out though from their windows they must be put to death The Turks have I know not how many black deformed eunuchs for the white serve for other ministeries to this purpose sent commonly from Egypt deprived in their childhood of all their privities and brought up in the seraglio at Constantinople to keep their wives which are so penned up they may not confer with any living man or converse with younger women have a cucumber or carrot sent into them for their diet but sliced for fear c and so live and are left alone to their unchaste thoughts all the days of their lives The vulgar sort of women if at any time they come abroad which is very seldom to visit one another or to go to their baths are so covered that no man can see them as the matrons were in old Rome lectica aut sella tecta vectae so six thousand one hundred thirty nine Dion

hundred fifty seven Vives they make away themselves and others Which induceth Cyprian to call it Foecundam et multiplicem perniciem fontem cladium et seminarium delictorum a fruitful mischief the seminary of offences and fountain of murders Tragical examples are too common in this kind both new and old in all ages as of six thousand one hundred fifty eight Cephalus and Procris six thousand one hundred fifty nine Phaereus of Egypt Tereus Atreus and Thyestes six thousand one hundred sixty Alexander Phaereus was murdered of his wife ob pellicatus suspitionem Tully saith Antoninus Verus was so made away by Lucilla Demetrius the son of Antigonus and Nicanor by their wives Hercules poisoned by Dejanira six thousand one hundred sixty one Caecinna murdered by Vespasian Justina a Roman lady by her husband six thousand one hundred sixty two Amestris Xerxes wife because she found her husband s cloak in Masista s house cut off Masista his wife s paps and gave them to the dogs flayed her besides and cut off her ears lips tongue and slit the nose of Artaynta her daughter Our late writers are full of such outrages six thousand one hundred sixty three Paulus Aemilius in his history of France hath a tragical story of Chilpericus the First his death made away by Ferdegunde his queen In a jealous humour he came from hunting and stole behind his wife as she was dressing and combing her head in the sun gave her a familiar touch with his wand which she mistaking for her lover said Ah Landre a good knight should strike before and not behind but when she saw herself betrayed by his presence she instantly took order to make him away Hierome Osorius in his eleventh book of the deeds of Emanuel King of Portugal to this effect hath a tragical narration of one Ferdinandus Chalderia that wounded Gotherinus a noble countryman of his at Goa in the East Indies six thousand one hundred sixty four and cut off one of his legs for that he looked as he thought too familiarly upon his wife which was afterwards a cause of many quarrels and much bloodshed Guianerius cap thirty six de aegritud matr speaks of a silly jealous fellow that seeing his child new born included in a caul thought sure a six thousand one hundred sixty five Franciscan that used to come to his house was the father of it it was so like the friar s cowl and thereupon threatened the friar to kill him Fulgosus of a woman in Narbonne that cut off her husband s privities in the night because she thought he played false with her The story of Jonuses Bassa and fair Manto his wife is well known to such as have read the Turkish history and that of Joan of Spain of which I treated in my former section Her jealousy saith Gomesius was the cause of both their deaths King Philip died for grief a little after as six thousand one hundred sixty six Martian his physician gave it out and she for her part after a melancholy discontented life misspent in lurking holes and corners made an end of her miseries Felix Plater in the first book of his observations hath many such instances of a physician of his acquaintance six thousand one hundred sixty seven that was first mad through jealousy and afterwards desperate of a merchant six thousand one hundred sixty eight that killed his wife in the same humour and after precipitated himself of a doctor of law that cut off his man s nose of a painter s wife in Basil anno sixteen hundred that was mother of nine children and had been twenty seven years married yet afterwards jealous and so impatient that she became desperate and would neither eat nor drink in her own house for fear her husband should poison her Tis a common sign this for when once the humours are stirred and the imagination misaffected it will vary itself in divers forms and many such absurd symptoms will accompany even madness itself Skenkius observat lib four cap de Uter hath an example of a jealous woman that by this means had many fits of the mother and in his first book of some that through jealousy ran mad of a baker that gelded himself to try his wife s honesty c Such examples are too common MEMB IV SUBSECT I Cure of Jealousy by avoiding occasions not to be idle of good counsel to contemn it not to watch or lock them up to dissemble it c As of all other melancholy some doubt whether this malady may be cured or no they think tis like the six thousand one hundred sixty nine gout or Switzers whom we commonly call Walloons those hired soldiers if once they take possession of a castle they can never be got out Qui timet ut sua sit ne quis sibi subtrahat illam Ille Machaonia vix ope salvus est six thousand one hundred seventy This is the cruel wound against whose smart No liquor s force prevails or any plaister No skill of stars no depth of magic art Devised by that great clerk Zoroaster A wound that so infects the soul and heart As all our sense and reason it doth master A wound whose pang and torment is so durable As it may rightly called be incurable Yet what I have formerly said of other melancholy I will say again it may be cured or mitigated at least by some contrary passion good counsel and persuasion if it be withstood in the beginning maturely resisted and as those ancients hold six thousand one hundred seventy one the nails of it be pared before they grow too long No better means to resist or repel it than by avoiding idleness to be still seriously busied about some matters of importance to drive out those vain fears foolish fantasies and irksome suspicions out of his head and then to be persuaded by his judicious friends to give ear to their good counsel and advice and wisely to consider how much he discredits himself his friends dishonours his children disgraceth his family publisheth his

Be not jealous over the wife of thy bosom read that comfortable and pithy speech to this purpose of Ximenius in the author himself as it is recorded by Gomesius consult with Chaloner lib nine de repub Anglor or Caelia in her epistles c Only this I will add that if it be considered aright which causeth this jealous passion be it just or unjust whether with or without cause true or false it ought not so heinously to be taken tis no such real or capital matter that it should make so deep a wound Tis a blow that hurts not an insensible smart grounded many times upon false suspicion alone and so fostered by a sinister conceit If she be not dishonest he troubles and macerates himself without a cause or put case which is the worst he be a cuckold it cannot be helped the more he stirs in it the more he aggravates his own misery How much better were it in such a case to dissemble or contemn it why should that be feared which cannot be redressed multae tandem deposuerunt saith six thousand one

to have companions Solamen miseris socios habuisse doloris Who can say he is free Who can assure himself he is not one de praeterito or secure himself de futuro If it were his case alone it were hard but being as it is almost a common calamity tis not so grievously to be taken If a man have a lock which every man s key will open as well as his own why should he think to keep it private to himself In some countries they make nothing of it ne nobiles quidem saith six thousand one hundred seventy six Leo Afer in many parts of Africa if she be past fourteen there s not a nobleman that marries a

all that we have many knights of this order so dubbed by their wives many good women abused by dissolute husbands In some places and such persons you may as soon enjoin them to carry water in a sieve as to keep themselves honest What shall a man do now in such a case What remedy is to be had how shall he be eased By suing a divorce this is hard to be effected si non caste tamen caute they carry

at deadly feud with Perseus of Macedonia insomuch that Perseus hearing of a journey he was to take to Delphos six thousand two hundred nine set a company of soldiers to intercept him in his passage they did it accordingly and as they supposed left him stoned to death The news of this fact was brought instantly to Pergamus Attalus Eumenes brother proclaimed himself king forthwith took possession of the crown and married Stratonice the queen But by and by when contrary news was brought that King Eumenes was alive and now coming to the city he laid by his crown left his wife as a private man went to meet him and congratulate his return Eumenes though he knew all particulars passed yet dissembling the matter kindly embraced his brother and took his wife into his favour again as if on such matter had been heard of or done Jocundo in Ariosto found his wife in bed with a knave both asleep went his ways and would not so much as wake them much less reprove them for it six thousand two hundred ten An honest fellow finding in like sort his wife had played false at tables and borne a man too many drew his dagger and swore if he had not been his very friend he would have killed him Another hearing one had done that for him which no man desires to be done by a deputy followed in a rage with his sword drawn and having overtaken him laid adultery to his charge the offender hotly pursued confessed it was true with which confession he was satisfied and so left him swearing that if he had denied it he would not have put it up How much better is it to do thus than to macerate himself impatiently to rave and rage to enter an action as Arnoldus Tilius did in the court of Toulouse against Martin Guerre his fellow soldier for that he counterfeited his habit and was too familiar with his wife so to divulge his own shame and to remain for ever a cuckold on record how much better be Cornelius Tacitus than Publius Cornutus to condemn in such cases or take no notice of it Melius sic errare quam Zelotypiae curis saith Erasmus se conficere better be a wittol and put it up than to trouble himself to no purpose And though he will not omnibus dormire be an ass as he is

education good place to use them well c Of such medicines as conduce to the cure of this malady I have sufficiently treated there be some good remedies remaining by way of prevention precautions or admonitions which if rightly practised may do much good Plato in his Commonwealth to prevent this mischief belike would have all things wives and children all as one and which Caesar in his Commentaries observed of those old Britons that first inhabited this land they had ten or twelve wives allotted to such a family or promiscuously to be used by so many men not one to one as with us or four five or six to one as in Turkey The six thousand two hundred seventeen Nicholaites a set that sprang saith Austin from Nicholas the deacon would have women indifferent and the cause of this filthy sect was Nicholas the deacon s jealousy for which when he was condemned to purge himself of his offence he broached his heresy that it was lawful to lie with one another s wives and for any man to lie with his like to those six thousand two hundred eighteen Anabaptists in Munster that would consort with other men s wives as the spirit moved them or as six thousand two hundred nineteen Mahomet the seducing prophet would needs use women as he list himself to beget prophets two hundred and five their Alcoran saith were in love with him and six thousand two hundred twenty he as able as forty men Amongst the old Carthaginians as six thousand two hundred twenty one Bohemus relates out of Sabellicus the king of the country lay with the bride the first night and once in a year they went promiscuously all together Munster Cosmog lib three cap four hundred ninety seven ascribes the beginning of this brutish custom unjustly to one Picardus a Frenchman that invented a new sect of Adamites to go naked as Adam did and to use promiscuous venery at set times When the priest repeated that of Genesis Increase and multiply out six thousand two hundred twenty two went the candles in the place where they met and without all respect of age persons conditions catch that catch may every man took her that came next c some fasten this on those ancient Bohemians and Russians six thousand two hundred twenty three others on the inhabitants of Mambrium in the Lucerne valley in Piedmont and as I read it was practised in Scotland amongst Christians themselves until King Malcolm s time the king or the lord of the town had their maidenheads In some parts of six thousand two hundred twenty four India in our age and those six thousand two hundred twenty five islanders six thousand two hundred twenty six as amongst the Babylonians of old they will prostitute their wives and daughters which Chalcocondila a Greek modern writer for want of better intelligence puts upon us Britons to such travellers or seafaring men as come amongst them by chance to show how far they were from this feral vice of jealousy and how little they esteemed it The kings of Calecut as six thousand two hundred twenty seven Lod Vertomannus relates will not touch their wives till one of their Biarmi or high priests have lain first with them to sanctify their wombs But those Esai and Montanists two strange sects of old were in another extreme they would not marry at all or have any society with women six thousand two hundred twenty eight because of their intemperance they held them all to be naught Nevisanus the lawyer lib four num thirty three sylv nupt would have him that is inclined to this malady to prevent the worst marry a quean Capiens meretricem hoc habet saltem boni quod non decipitur quia scit eam sic esse quod non contingit aliis A fornicator in Seneca constuprated two wenches in a night for satisfaction the one desired to hang him the other to marry him six thousand two hundred twenty nine Hierome king of Syracuse in Sicily espoused himself to Pitho keeper of the stews and Ptolemy took Thais a common whore to be his wife had two sons Leontiscus and Lagus by her and one daughter Irene tis therefore no such unlikely thing six thousand two hundred thirty A citizen of Engubine gelded himself to try his wife s honesty and to be freed from jealousy so did a baker in six thousand two hundred thirty one Basil to the same intent But of all other precedents in this kind that of six thousand two hundred thirty two Combalus is most memorable who to prevent his master s suspicion for he was a beautiful young man and sent by Seleucus his lord and king with Stratonice the queen to conduct her into Syria fearing the worst gelded himself before he went and left his genitals behind him in a box sealed up His mistress by the way fell in love with him but he not yielding to her was accused to Seleucus of incontinency as that Bellerophon was in like case falsely traduced by Sthenobia to King Praetus her husband cum non posset ad coitum inducere and that by her and was therefore at his corning home cast into prison the day of hearing appointed he was sufficiently cleared and acquitted by showing his privities which to the admiration of the beholders he had formerly cut off The Lydians used to geld women whom they suspected saith Leonicus var hist Tib three cap forty nine as well as men To this purpose six thousand two hundred thirty three Saint Francis because he used to confess women in private to prevent suspicion and prove himself a maid stripped himself before the Bishop of Assise and others and Friar Leonard for the same cause went through Viterbium in Italy without any garments Our pseudo Catholics to help these inconveniences which proceed from jealousy to keep themselves and their wives honest make severe laws against adultery present death and withal fornication a venal sin as a sink to convey that furious and swift stream of concupiscence they appoint and permit stews those punks and pleasant sinners the more to secure their wives in all populous cities for they hold them as necessary as churches and howsoever unlawful yet to avoid a greater mischief to be tolerated in policy as usury for the hardness of men s hearts and for this end they have whole colleges of courtesans in their towns and cities Of six thousand two hundred thirty four Cato s mind belike that would have his servants cum ancillis congredi coitus causa definito aere ut graviora facinora evitarent caeteris interim interdicens familiar with some such feminine creatures to avoid worse mischiefs in his house and made allowance for it They hold it impossible for idle persons young rich and lusty so many servants monks friars to live honest too tyrannical a burden to compel them to be chaste and most unfit to suffer poor men younger brothers and soldiers at all to marry as those diseased persons votaries priests servants Therefore as well to keep and ease the one as the other they tolerate and wink at these kind of brothel houses and stews Many probable arguments they have to prove the lawfulness the necessity and a toleration of them as of usury and without question in policy they are not to be contradicted but altogether in religion Others prescribe filters spells charms to keep men and women honest six thousand two

which generally disturb the peace of marriage the first is when they marry intempestive or unseasonably as many mortal men marry precipitately and inconsiderately when they are effete and old the second when they marry unequally for fortunes and birth the third when a sick impotent person weds one that is sound novae nuptae spes frustratur many dislikes instantly follow Many doting dizzards it

not a wedding but a jumbling or coupling together In a word except they wed for mutual society help and comfort one of another in which respects though six thousand two hundred fifty three Tiberius deny it without question old folks may well marry for sometimes a man hath most need of a wife according to Puccius when he hath no need of a wife otherwise it is most odious when an old Acherontic

equal in years birth fortunes and other conditions yet they do not omit virtue and good education which Musonius and Antipater so much inculcate in Stobeus six thousand two hundred sixty two Dos est magna parentum Virtus et metuens alterius viri Certo foedere castitas If as Plutarch adviseth one must eat modium salis a bushel of salt with him before he choose his friend what care should be had in choosing a wife his second self how solicitous should he be to know her qualities and behaviour and when he is assured of them not to prefer birth fortune beauty before bringing up and good conditions six thousand two hundred sixty three Coquage god of cuckolds as one merrily said accompanies the goddess Jealousy both follow the fairest by Jupiter s appointment and they sacrifice to them together beauty and honesty seldom agree straight personages have often crooked manners fair faces foul vices good complexions ill conditions Suspicionis plena res est et insidiarum beauty saith six thousand two hundred sixty four Chrysostom is full of treachery and suspicion he that hath a fair wife cannot have a worse mischief and yet most covet it as if nothing else in marriage but that and wealth were to be respected six thousand two hundred sixty five Francis Sforza Duke of Milan was so curious in this behalf that he would not marry the Duke of Mantua s daughter except he might see her naked first which Lycurgus appointed in his laws and Morus in his Utopian Commonwealth approves six thousand two hundred sixty six In Italy as a traveller observes if a man have three or four daughters or more and they prove fair they are married eftsoons if deformed they change their lovely names of Lucia Cynthia Camaena call them Dorothy Ursula Bridget and so put them into monasteries as if none were fit for marriage but such as are eminently fair but these are erroneous tenets a modest virgin well conditioned to such a fair snout piece is much to be preferred If thou wilt avoid them take away all causes of suspicion and jealousy marry a coarse piece fetch her from Cassandra s six thousand two hundred sixty seven temple which was wont in Italy to be a sanctuary of all deformed maids and so shalt thou be sure that no man will make thee cuckold but for spite A citizen of Bizance in France had a filthy dowdy deformed slut to his wife and finding her in bed with another man cried out as one amazed O miser quae te necessitas huc adegit O thou wretch what necessity brought thee hither as well he might for who can affect such a one But this is warily to be understood most offend in another extreme they prefer wealth before beauty and so she be rich they care not how she look but these are all out as faulty as the rest Attendenda uxoris forma as six thousand two hundred sixty eight Salisburiensis adviseth ne si alteram aspexeris mox eam sordere putes as the Knight in Chaucer that was married to an old woman And all day after hid him as an owl So woe was his wife looked so foul

the bragging soldier vaunted in the comedy nimia est miseria pulchrum esse hominem nimis Scipio did never so hardly besiege Carthage as these young gallants will beset thine house one with wit or person another with wealth c If she he fair saith Guazzo she will be suspected howsoever Both extremes are naught Pulchra cito adamatur foeda facile concupiscit the one is soon beloved the other loves

pudicitiam one of a middle size neither too fair nor too foul six thousand two hundred seventy Nec formosa magis quam mihi casta placet with old Cato though fit let her beauty be neque lectissima neque illiberalis between both This I approve but of the other two I resolve with Salisburiensis caeteris paribus both rich alike endowed alike majori miseria deformis habetur quam formosa servatur I had rather marry a fair one and put it to the hazard than be troubled with a blowze but do as thou wilt I speak only of myself Howsoever quod iterum maneo I would advise thee thus much be she fair or

admonitions than to use their wives well and which a friend of mine told me that was a married man I will tell you as good cheap saith Nicostratus in six thousand two hundred seventy six Stobeus to avoid future strife and for quietness sake when you are in bed take heed of your wife s flattering speeches over night and curtain sermons in the morning Let them do their endeavour likewise to maintain them to their means which six thousand two hundred seventy seven Patricius ingeminates and let them have liberty with discretion as time and place requires many women turn queans by compulsion as six thousand two hundred seventy eight Nevisanus observes because their husbands are so hard and keep them so short in diet and apparel paupertas cogit eas meretricari poverty and hunger want of means makes them dishonest or bad usage their churlish behaviour forceth them to fly out or bad examples they do it to cry quittance In the other extreme some are too liberal as the proverb is Turdus malum sibi cacat they make a rod for their own tails as Candaules did to Gyges in six thousand two hundred seventy nine Herodotus commend his wife s beauty himself and besides would needs have him see her naked Whilst they give their wives too much liberty to gad abroad and bountiful allowance they are accessory to their own miseries animae uxorum pessime olent as Plautus jibes they have

satisfied or that they could use them gently and entreat them well not to revile them scoff at hate them as in such cases commonly they do tis a human infirmity a miserable vexation and they should not add grief to grief nor aggravate their misery but seek to please and by all means give them content by good counsel removing such offensive objects or by mediation of some discreet friends In old

shall have as many fair wives as they will themselves with clear eyes and such as look on none but their own husbands no fear no danger of being cuckolds or else I would have them observe that strict rule of six thousand two hundred ninety eight Alphonsus to marry a deaf and dumb man to a blind woman If this will not help let them to prevent the worst consult with an six thousand two hundred

obedientibus otherwise as they hold there will be intolerable enmities between them or else get them sigillum veneris a characteristical seal stamped in the day and hour of Venus when she is fortunate

as he wears it If this course be not approved and other remedies may not be had they must in the last place sue for a divorce but that is somewhat difficult to effect and not all out so fit For as Felisacus in his tract de justa uxore urgeth if that law of Constantine the Great or that of Theodosius and Valentinian concerning divorce were in use in our times innumeras propemodum viduas haberemus et coelibes viros we should have almost no married couples left Try therefore those former remedies or as Tertullian reports of Democritus that put out his eyes six thousand three hundred because he could not look upon a woman without lust and was much troubled to see that which he might not enjoy let him make himself blind and so he shall avoid that care and molestation of watching his wife One other sovereign remedy I could repeat an especial antidote against jealousy an excellent cure but I am not now disposed to tell it not that like a covetous empiric I conceal it for any gain but some other reasons I am not willing to publish it if you be very desirous to know it when I meet you next I will peradventure tell you what it is in your ear This is the best counsel I can

Rhasis Avicenna and most of our late writers as Gordonius Fuchsius Plater Bruel Montaltus c repeat it as a symptom six thousand three hundred five Some seem to be inspired of the Holy Ghost some take upon them to be prophets some are addicted to new opinions some foretell strange things de statu mundi et Antichristi saith Gordonius Some will prophesy of the end of the world to a day almost and the fall of the Antichrist as they have been addicted or brought up for so melancholy works with them as six thousand three hundred six Laurentius holds If they have been precisely given all their meditations tend that way and in conclusion produce strange effects the humour imprints symptoms according to their several inclinations and conditions which makes six thousand three hundred seven Guianerius and six thousand three hundred eight Felix Plater put too much devotion blind zeal fear of eternal punishment and that last judgment for a cause of those enthusiastics and desperate persons but some do not obscurely make a distinct species of it dividing love melancholy into that whose object is women and into the other whose object is God Plato in Convivio makes mention of two distinct furies and amongst our neoterics Hercules de Saxonia lib one pract med cap sixteen cap de Melanch doth expressly treat of it in a distinct species six thousand three hundred nine Love melancholy saith he is twofold the first is that to which peradventure some will not vouchsafe this name or species of melancholy affection of those which put God for their object and are altogether about prayer fasting c the other about women Peter Forestus in his observations delivereth as much in the same words and Felix Platerus de mentis alienat cap three frequentissima est ejus species in qua curanda saepissime multum fui impeditus tis a frequent disease and they have a ground of what they say forth of Areteus and Plato six thousand three hundred ten Areteus an old author in his third book cap six doth so divide love melancholy and derives this second from the first which comes by inspiration or otherwise six thousand three hundred eleven Plato in his Phaedrus hath these words Apollo s priests in Delphos and at Dodona in their fury do many pretty feats and benefit the Greeks but never in their right wits He makes them all mad as well he might and he that shall but consider that superstition of old those prodigious effects of it as in its place I will shew the several furies of our fatidici dii pythonissas sibyls enthusiasts pseudoprophets heretics and schismatics in these our latter ages shall instantly confess that all the world again cannot afford so much matter of madness so many stupendous symptoms as superstition heresy schism have brought out that this species alone may be paralleled to all the former has a greater latitude and more miraculous effects that it more besots and infatuates men than any other above named whatsoever does more harm works more disquietness to mankind and has more crucified the souls of mortal men such hath been the devil s craft than wars plagues sicknesses dearth famine and all the rest Give me but a little leave and I will set before your eyes in brief a stupendous vast infinite ocean of incredible madness and folly a sea full of shelves and rocks sands gulfs euripes and contrary tides full of fearful monsters uncouth shapes roaring waves tempests and siren calms halcyonian seas unspeakable misery such comedies and tragedies such absurd and ridiculous feral and lamentable fits that I know not whether they are more to be pitied or derided or may be believed but that we daily see the same still practised in our days fresh examples nova novitia fresh objects of misery and madness in this kind that are still represented unto us abroad at home in the midst of us in our bosoms But before I can come to treat of these several errors and obliquities their causes symptoms affections c I must say something necessarily of the object of this love God himself what this love is how it allureth whence it proceeds and which is the cause of all our miseries how we mistake wander and swerve from it Amongst all those divine attributes that God doth vindicate to himself eternity omnipotency immutability wisdom majesty justice mercy c his six thousand three hundred twelve beauty is not the least one thing saith David have I desired of the Lord and that I will still desire to behold the beauty of the Lord Psal xxvii four And out of Sion which is the perfection of beauty hath God shined Psal one two All other creatures are fair I confess and many other objects do much enamour us a fair house a fair horse a comely person six thousand three hundred thirteen I am amazed saith Austin when one look up to heaven and behold the beauty of the stars the beauty of angels principalities powers who can express it who can sufficiently commend or set out this beauty which appears in us so fair a body so fair a face eyes nose cheeks chin brows all fair and lovely to behold besides the beauty of the soul which cannot be discerned If we so labour and be so much affected with the comeliness of creatures how should we be ravished with that admirable lustre of God himself If ordinary beauty have such a prerogative and power and what is amiable and fair to draw the eyes and ears hearts and affections of all spectators unto it to move win entice allure how shall this divine form ravish our souls which is the fountain and quintessence of all beauty Coelum pulchrum sed pulchrior coeli fabricator if heaven be so fair the sun so fair how much fairer shall he be that made them fair For by the greatness and beauty of the creatures proportionally the maker of them is seen Wisd xiii five If there be such pleasure in beholding a beautiful person alone and as a plausible sermon he so much affect us what shall this beauty of God himself that is infinitely fairer than all creatures men angels c six thousand three hundred fourteen Omnis pulchritudo florem hominum angelorum et rerum omnium pulcherrimarum ad Dei pulchritudinem collata nox est et tenebrae all other beauties are night itself mere darkness to this our inexplicable incomprehensible unspeakable eternal infinite admirable and divine beauty This lustre pulchritudo omnium pulcherrima This beauty and six thousand three hundred fifteen splendour of the divine Majesty is it that draws all creatures to it to seek it love admire and adore it and those heathens pagans philosophers out of those relics they have yet left of God s image are so far forth incensed as not only to acknowledge a God but though after their own inventions to stand in admiration of his bounty goodness to adore and seek him the magnificence and structure of the world itself and beauty of all his creatures his goodness providence protection enforceth them to love him seek him fear him though a wrong way to adore him but for us that are Christians regenerate that are his adopted sons illuminated by his word having the eyes of our hearts and understandings opened how fairly doth he offer and expose himself Ambit nos Deus Austin saith donis et forma sua he woos us by his beauty gifts promises to come unto him six thousand three hundred sixteen the whole Scripture is a message an exhortation a love letter to this purpose to incite us and invite us six thousand three hundred seventeen God s epistle as Gregory calls it to his creatures He sets out his son and his church in that epithalamium or mystical song of Solomon to enamour us the more comparing his head to fine gold his locks curled and black as a raven Cant iv five his eyes like doves on rivers of waters washed with milk his lips as lilies drooping down pure juice his hands as rings of gold set with chrysolite and his church to a vineyard a garden enclosed a fountain of living waters an orchard of pomegranates with sweet scents of saffron spike calamus and cinnamon and all the trees of incense as the chief spices the fairest amongst women no spot in her six thousand three hundred eighteen his sister his spouse undefiled the only daughter of her mother dear unto her fair as the moon pure as the sun looking out as the morning that by these figures that glass these spiritual eyes of contemplation we might perceive some resemblance of his beauty the love between his church and him And so in the xlv Psalm this beauty of his church is compared to a queen in a vesture of gold of Ophir embroidered raiment of needlework that the king might take pleasure in her beauty To incense us further yet six thousand three hundred nineteen John in his apocalypse makes a description of that heavenly Jerusalem the beauty of it and in it the maker of it Likening it to a city of pure gold like unto clear glass shining and garnished with all manner of precious stones having no need of sun or moon for the lamb is the light of it the glory of God doth illuminate it to give us to understand the infinite glory beauty and happiness of it Not that it is no fairer than these creatures to which it is compared but that this vision of his this lustre of his divine majesty cannot otherwise be expressed to our apprehensions no tongue can tell no heart can conceive it as Paul saith Moses himself Exod xxxiii eighteen when he desired to see God in his glory was answered that he might not endure it no man could see his face and live Sensibile forte destruit sensum a strong object overcometh the sight according to that axiom in philosophy fulgorem solis ferre non potes multo magis creatoris if thou canst not endure the sunbeams how canst thou endure that fulgor and brightness of him that made the sun The sun itself and all that we can imagine are but shadows of it tis visio praecellens as six thousand three hundred twenty Austin calls it the quintessence of beauty this which far exceeds the beauty of heavens sun and moon stars angels gold and silver woods fair fields and whatsoever is pleasant to behold All those other beauties fail vary are subject to corruption to loathing six thousand three hundred twenty one But this is an immortal vision a divine beauty an immortal love an indefatigable love and beauty with sight of which we shall never be tired nor wearied but still the more we see the more we shall covet him six thousand three hundred twenty two For as one saith where this vision is there is absolute beauty and where is that beauty from the same fountain comes all pleasure and happiness neither can beauty pleasure happiness be separated from his vision or sight or his vision from beauty pleasure happiness In this life we have but a glimpse of this beauty and happiness we shall hereafter as John saith see him as he is thine eyes as Isaiah promiseth xxxiii seventeen shall behold the king in his glory then shall we be perfectly enamoured have a full fruition of it desire six thousand three hundred twenty three behold and love him alone as the most amiable and fairest object or summum bonum or chiefest good This likewise should we now have done had not our will been corrupted and as we are enjoined to love God with all our heart and all our soul for to that end were we born to love this object as six thousand three hundred twenty four Melancthon discourseth and to enjoy it And him our will would have loved and sought alone as our summum bonum or principal good and all other good things for God s sake and nature as she proceeded from it would have sought this fountain but in this infirmity of human nature this order is disturbed our love is corrupt and a man is like that monster in six thousand three hundred twenty five Plato composed of a Scylla a lion and a man we are carried away headlong with the torrent of our affections the world and that infinite variety of pleasing objects in it do so allure and enamour us that we cannot so much as look towards God seek him or think on him as we should we cannot saith Austin Rempub coelestem cogitare we cannot contain ourselves from them their sweetness is so pleasing to us Marriage saith six thousand three hundred twenty six Gualter detains many a thing in itself laudable good and necessary but many deceived and carried away with the blind love of it have quite laid aside the love of God and desire of his glory Meat and drink hath overcome as many whilst they rather strive to please satisfy their guts and belly than to serve God and nature Some are so busied about merchandise to get money they lose their own souls whilst covetously carried and with an insatiable desire of gain they forget God as much we may say of honour leagues friendships health wealth and all other profits or pleasures in this life whatsoever six thousand three hundred twenty seven In this world there be so many beautiful objects splendours and brightness of gold majesty of glory assistance of friends fair promises smooth words victories triumphs and such an infinite company of pleasing beauties to allure us and draw us from God that we cannot look after him And this is it which Christ himself those prophets and apostles so much thundered against one John xvii fifteen dehort us from love not the world nor the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the Father is not in him sixteen For all that is in the world as lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and pride of life is not of the Father but of the world and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that fulfilleth the will of God abideth for ever No man saith our Saviour can serve two masters but he must love the one and hate the other c bonos vel malos mores boni vel mali faciunt amores Austin well infers and this is that which all the fathers inculcate He cannot six thousand three hundred twenty eight Austin admonisheth be God s friend that is delighted with the pleasures of the world make clean thine heart purify thine heart if thou wilt see this beauty prepare thyself for it It is the eye of contemplation by which we must behold it the wing of meditation which lifts us up and rears our souls with the motion of our hearts and sweetness of contemplation so saith Gregory cited by six thousand three hundred twenty nine Bonaventure And as six thousand three hundred thirty Philo Judeus seconds him he that loves God will soar aloft and take him wings and leaving the earth fly up to heaven wander with sun and moon stars and that heavenly troop God himself being his guide If we desire to see him we must lay aside all vain objects which detain us and dazzle our eyes and as six thousand three hundred thirty one Ficinus adviseth us get us solar eyes spectacles as they that look on the sun to see this divine beauty lay aside all material objects all sense and then thou shalt see him as he is Thou covetous wretch as six thousand three hundred thirty two Austin expostulates why dost thou stand gaping on this dross muck hills filthy excrements behold a far fairer object God himself woos thee behold him enjoy him he is sick for love Cant v he invites thee to his sight to come into his fair garden to eat and drink with him to be merry with him to enjoy his presence for ever six thousand three hundred thirty three Wisdom cries out in the streets besides the gates in the top of high places before the city at the entry of the door and bids them give ear to her instruction which is better than gold or precious stones no pleasures can be compared to it leave all then and follow her vos exhortor o amici et obsecro In six thousand three hundred thirty four Ficinus s words I exhort and beseech you that you would embrace and follow this divine love with all your hearts and abilities by all offices and endeavours make this so loving God propitious unto you For whom alone saith six thousand three hundred thirty five Plotinus we must forsake the kingdoms and empires of the whole earth sea land and air if we desire to be engrafted into him leave all and follow him Now forasmuch as this love of God is a habit infused of God as six thousand three hundred thirty six Thomas holds l two quaest twenty three by which a man is inclined to love God above all and his neighbour as himself we must pray to God that he will open our eyes make clear our hearts that we may be capable of his glorious rays and perform those duties that he requires of us Deut vi and Josh xxiii to love God above all and our neighbour as ourself to keep his commandments In this we know saith John c v two we love the children of God when we love God and keep his commandments This is the love of God that we keep his commandments he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love cap iv eight and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him for love pre supposeth knowledge faith hope and unites us to God himself as six thousand three hundred thirty seven Leon Hebreus delivereth unto us and is accompanied with the fear of God humility meekness patience all those virtues and charity itself For if we love God we shall love our neighbour and perform the duties which are required at our hands to which we are exhorted one Cor xv four five Ephes iv Colos iii Rom xii We shall not be envious or puffed up or boast disdain think evil or be provoked to anger but suffer all things endeavour to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace Forbear one another forgive one another clothe the naked visit the sick and perform all those works of mercy which six thousand three hundred thirty eight Clemens Alexandrinus calls amoris et amicitiae impletionem et extentionem the extent and complement of love and that not for fear or worldly respects but ordine ad Deum for the love of God himself This we shall do if we be truly enamoured but we come short in both we neither love God nor our neighbour as we should Our love in spiritual things is too six thousand three hundred thirty nine defective in worldly things too excessive there is a jar in both We love the world too much God too little our neighbour not at all or for our own ends Vulgus amicitias utilitate probat The chief thing we respect is our commodity and what we do is for fear of worldly punishment for vainglory praise of men fashion and such by respects not for God s sake We neither know God aright nor seek love or worship him as we should And for these defects we involve ourselves into a multitude of errors we swerve from this true love and worship of God which is a cause unto us of unspeakable miseries running into both extremes we become fools madmen without sense as now in the next place one will show you The parties affected are innumerable almost and scattered over the face of the earth far and near and so have been in all precedent ages from the beginning of the world to these times of all sorts and conditions For method s sake I will reduce them to a twofold division according to those two extremes of excess and defect impiety and superstition idolatry and atheism Not that there is any excess of divine worship or love of God that cannot be we cannot love God too much or do our duty as we ought as Papists hold or have any perfection in this life much less supererogate when we have all done we are unprofitable servants But because we do aliud agere zealous without knowledge and too solicitous about that which is not necessary busying ourselves about impertinent needless idle and vain ceremonies populo ut placerent as the Jews did about sacrifices oblations offerings incense new moons feasts c but Isaiah taxeth them i twelve who required this at your hands We have too great opinion of our own worth that we can satisfy the law and do more than is required at our hands by performing those evangelical counsels and such works of supererogation merit for others which Bellarmine Gregory de Valentia all their Jesuits and champions defend that if God should deal in rigour with them some of their Franciscans and Dominicans are so pure that nothing could be objected to them Some of us again are too dear as we think more divine and sanctified than others of a better mettle greater gifts and with that proud Pharisee contemn others in respect of ourselves we are better Christians better learned choice spirits inspired know more have special revelation perceive God s secrets and thereupon presume say and do that many times which is not befitting to be said or done Of this number are all superstitious idolaters ethnics Mahometans Jews heretics six thousand three hundred forty enthusiasts divinators prophets sectaries and schismatics Zanchius reduceth such infidels to four chief sects but I will insist and follow mine own intended method all which with many other curious persons monks hermits c may be ranged in this extreme and fight under this superstitious banner with those rude idiots and infinite swarms of people that are seduced by them In the other extreme or in defect march those impious epicures libertines atheists hypocrites infidels worldly secure impenitent unthankful and carnal minded men that attribute all to natural causes that will acknowledge no supreme power that have cauterised consciences or live in a reprobate sense or such desperate persons as are too distrustful of his mercies Of these there be many subdivisions diverse degrees of madness and folly some more than other as shall be shown in the symptoms and yet all miserably out perplexed doting and beside themselves for religion s sake For as six thousand three hundred forty one Zanchy well distinguished and all the world knows religion is twofold true or false false is that vain superstition of idolaters such as were of old Greeks Romans present Mahometans c Timorem deorum inanem six thousand three hundred forty two Tully could term it or as Zanchy defines it Ubi falsi dii aut falso cullu colitur Deus when false gods or that God is falsely worshipped And tis a miserable plague a torture of the soul a mere madness Religiosa insania six thousand three hundred forty three Meteran calls it or insanus error as six thousand three hundred forty four Seneca a frantic error or as Austin Insanus animi morbus a furious disease of the soul insania omnium insanissima a quintessence of madness six thousand three hundred forty five for he that is superstitious can never be quiet Tis proper to man alone uni superbia avaritia superstitio saith Plin lib seven cap one atque etiam post saevit de futuro which wrings his soul for the present and to come the greatest misery belongs to mankind a perpetual servitude a slavery six thousand three hundred forty six Ex timore timor a heavy yoke the seal of damnation an intolerable burden They that are superstitious are still fearing suspecting vexing themselves with auguries prodigies false tales dreams idle vain works unprofitable labours as six thousand three hundred forty seven Boterus observes cura mentis ancipite versantur enemies to God and to themselves In a word as Seneca concludes Religio Deum colit superstitio destruit superstition destroys but true religion honours God True religion ubi verus Deus vere colitur where the true God is truly worshipped is the way to heaven the mother of virtues love fear devotion obedience knowledge c It rears the dejected soul of man and amidst so many cares miseries persecutions which this world affords it is a sole ease an unspeakable comfort a sweet reposal Jugum suave et leve a light yoke an anchor and a haven It adds courage boldness and begets generous spirits although tyrants rage persecute and that bloody Lictor or sergeant be ready to martyr them aut lita aut morere as in those persecutions of the primitive Church it was put in practice as you may read in Eusebius and others though enemies be now ready to invade and all in an uproar six thousand three hundred forty eight Si fractus illabatur orbis impavidos ferient ruinae though heaven should fall on his head he would not be dismayed But as a good Christian prince once made answer to a menacing Turk facile scelerata hominum arma contemnit qui del praesidio tutus est or as six thousand three hundred forty nine Phalaris writ to Alexander in a wrong cause he nor any other enemy could terrify him for that he trusted in God Si Deus nobiscum quis contra nos In all calamities persecutions whatsoever as David did two Sam ii twenty two he will sing with him the Lord is my rock my fortress my strength my refuge the tower and horn of my salvation c In all troubles and adversities Psal xlvi one God is my hope and help still ready to be found I will not therefore fear c tis a fear expelling fear he hath peace of conscience and is full of hope which is saith six thousand three hundred fifty Austin vita vitae mortalis the life of this our mortal life hope of immortality the sole comfort of our misery otherwise as Paul saith we of all others were most wretched but this makes us happy counterpoising our hearts in all miseries superstition torments and is from the devil the author of lies but this is from God himself as Lucian that Antiochian priest made his divine confession in six thousand three hundred fifty one Eusebius Auctor nobis de Deo Deus est God is the author of our religion himself his word is our rule a lantern to us dictated by the Holy Ghost he plays upon our hearts as many harpstrings and we are his temples he dwelleth in us and we in him The part affected of superstition is the brain heart will understanding soul itself and all the faculties of it totum compositum all is mad and dotes now for the extent as I say the world itself is the subject of it to omit that grand sin of atheism all times have been misaffected past present there is not one that doth good no not one from the prophet to the priest c A lamentable thing it is to consider how many myriads of men this idolatry and superstition for that comprehends all hath infatuated in all ages besotted by this blind zeal which is religion s ape religion s bastard religion s shadow false glass For where God hath a temple the devil will have a chapel where God hath sacrifices the devil will have his oblations where God hath ceremonies the devil will have his traditions where there is any religion the devil will plant superstition and tis a pitiful sight to behold and read what tortures miseries it hath procured what slaughter of souls it hath made how it rageth amongst those old Persians Syrians Egyptians Greeks Romans Tuscans Gauls Germans Britons c Britannia jam hodie celebrat tam attonite saith six thousand three hundred fifty two Pliny tantis ceremoniis speaking of superstition ut dedisse Persis videri possit The Britons are so stupendly superstitious in their ceremonies that they go beyond those Persians He that shall but read in Pausanias alone those gods temples altars idols statues so curiously made with such infinite cost and charge amongst those old Greeks such multitudes of them and frequent varieties as six thousand three hundred fifty three Gerbelius truly observes may stand amazed and never enough wonder at it and thank God withal that by the light of the Gospel we are so happily freed from that slavish idolatry in these our days But heretofore almost in all countries in all places superstition hath blinded the hearts of men in all ages what a small portion hath the true church ever been Divisum imperium cum Jove Daemon habet six thousand three hundred fifty four The patriarchs and their families the Israelites a handful in respect Christ and his apostles and not all of them neither Into what straits hath it been compinged a little flock how hath superstition on the other side dilated herself error ignorance barbarism folly madness deceived triumphed and insulted over the most wise discreet and understanding man philosophers dynasts monarchs all were involved and overshadowed in this mist in more than Cimmerian darkness six thousand three hundred fifty five Adeo ignara superstitio mentes hominum depravat et nonnunquam sapientum animos transversos agit At this present quota pars How small a part is truly religious How little in respect Divide the world into six parts and one or not so much as Christians idolaters and Mahometans possess almost Asia Africa America Magellanica The

but so inlarded and interlaced with several superstitions that there is scarce a sound part to be found or any agreement amongst them Presbyter John in Africa lord of those Abyssinians or Ethiopians is by his profession a Christian but so different from us with such new absurdities and ceremonies such liberty such a mixture of idolatry and paganism six thousand three hundred fifty nine that they keep little more than a bare title of Christianity They suffer polygamy circumcision stupend fastings divorce as they will themselves c and as the papists call on the Virgin Mary so do they on Thomas Didymus before Christ six thousand three hundred sixty The Greek or Eastern Church is rent from this of the West and as they have four chief patriarchs so have they four subdivisions besides those Nestorians Jacobins Syrians Armenians Georgians c scattered over Asia Minor Syria Egypt c Greece Walachia Circassia Bulgaria Bosnia Albania Illyricum Sclavonia Croatia Thrace Servia Rascia and a sprinkling amongst the Tartars the Russians Muscovites and most of that great duke s czar s subjects are part of the Greek Church and still Christians but as six thousand three hundred sixty one one saith temporis successu multas illi addiderunt superstitiones In process of time they have added so many superstitions they be rather semi Christians than otherwise That which remains is the Western Church with us in Europe but so eclipsed with several schisms heresies and superstitions that one knows not where to find it The papists have Italy Spain Savoy part of Germany France Poland and a sprinkling in the rest of Europe In America they hold all that which Spaniards inhabit Hispania Nova Castella Aurea Peru c In the East Indies the Philippines some small holds about Goa Malacca Zelan Ormus c which the Portuguese got not long since and those land leaping Jesuits have essayed in China Japan as appears by their yearly letters in Africa they have Melinda Quiloa Mombaze c and some few towns they drive out one superstition with another Poland is a receptacle of all religions where Samosetans Socinians Photinians now protected in Transylvania and Poland Arians Anabaptists are to be found as well as in some German cities Scandia is Christian but six thousand three hundred sixty two Damianus A Goes the Portugal knight complains so mixed with magic pagan rites and ceremonies they may be as well counted idolaters what Tacitus formerly said of a like nation is verified in them six thousand three hundred sixty three A people subject to superstition contrary to religion And some of them as about Lapland and the Pilapians the devil s possession to this day Misera haec gens saith mine six thousand three hundred sixty four author Satanae hactenus possessio et quod maxime mirandum et dolendum and which is to be admired and pitied if any of them be baptised which the kings of Sweden much labour they die within seven or nine days after and for that cause they will hardly be brought to Christianity but worship still the devil who daily appears to them In their idolatrous courses Gandentibus diis patriis quos religiose colunt c Yet are they very superstitious like our wild Irish though they of the better note the kings of Denmark and Sweden themselves that govern them be Lutherans the remnant are Calvinists Lutherans in Germany equally mixed And yet the emperor himself dukes of Lorraine Bavaria and the princes electors are most part professed papists And though some part of France and Ireland Great Britain half the cantons in Switzerland and the Low Countries be Calvinists more defecate than the rest yet at odds amongst themselves not free from superstition And which six thousand three hundred sixty five Brochard the monk in his description of the Holy Land after he had censured the Greek church and showed their errors concluded at last Faxit Deus ne Latinis multa irrepserint stultifies I say God grant there be no fopperies in our church As a dam of water stopped in one place breaks out into another so doth superstition I say nothing of Anabaptists Socinians Brownists Familists c There is superstition in our prayers often in our hearing of sermons bitter contentions invectives persecutions strange conceits besides diversity of opinions schisms factions c But as the Lord Job xlii cap seven v said to Eliphaz the Temanite and his two friends his wrath was kindled against them for they had not spoken of him things that were right we may justly of these schismatics and heretics how wise soever in their own conceits non recte loquuntur de Deo they speak not they think not they write not well of God and as they ought And therefore Quid quaeso mi Dorpi as Erasmus concludes to Dorpius hisce Theologis faciamus aut quid preceris nisi forte fidelem medicum qui cerebro medeatur What shall we wish them but sanam mentem and a good physician But more of their differences paradoxes opinions mad pranks in the symptoms I now hasten to the causes SUBSECT II Causes of Religious melancholy From the Devil by miracles apparitions oracles His instruments or factors politicians Priests Impostors Heretics blind guides In them simplicity fear blind zeal ignorance solitariness curiosity pride vainglory presumption c his engines fasting solitariness hope fear c We are taught in Holy Scripture that the Devil rangeth abroad like a roaring lion still seeking whom he may devour and as in several shapes so by several engines and devices he goeth about to seduce us sometimes he transforms himself into an angel of light and is so cunning that he is able if it were possible to deceive the very elect He will be worshipped as six thousand three hundred sixty six God himself and is so adored by the heathen and esteemed And in imitation of that divine power as six thousand three hundred sixty seven Eusebius observes six thousand three hundred sixty eight to abuse or emulate God s glory as Dandinus adds he will have all homage sacrifices oblations and whatsoever else belongs to the worship of God to be done likewise unto him similis erit altissimo and by this means infatuates the world deludes entraps and destroys many a thousand souls Sometimes by dreams visions as God to Moses by familiar conference the devil in several shapes talks with them in the six thousand three hundred sixty nine Indies it is common and in China nothing so familiar as apparitions inspirations oracles by terrifying them with false prodigies counterfeit miracles sending storms tempests diseases plagues as of old in Athens there was Apollo Alexicacus Apollo Greek loimios pestifer et malorum depulsor raising wars seditions by spectrums troubling their consciences driving them to despair terrors of mind intolerable pains by promises rewards benefits and fair means he raiseth such an opinion of his deity and greatness that they dare not do otherwise than adore him do as he will have them they dare not offend him And to compel them more to stand in awe of him six thousand three hundred seventy he sends and cures diseases disquiets their spirits as Cyprian saith torments and terrifies their souls to make them adore him and all his study all his endeavour is to divert them from true religion to superstition and because he is damned himself and in an error he would have all the world participate of his errors and be damned with him The primum mobile therefore and first mover of all superstition is the devil that great enemy of mankind the principal agent who in a thousand several shapes after diverse fashions with several engines illusions and by several names hath deceived the inhabitants of the earth in several places and countries still rejoicing at their falls All the world over before Christ s time he freely domineered and held the souls of men in most slavish subjection saith six thousand three hundred seventy one Eusebius in diverse forms ceremonies and sacrifices till Christ s coming as if those devils of the air had shared the earth amongst them which the Platonists held for gods six thousand three hundred seventy two Ludus deorum sumus and were our governors and keepers In several places they had several rites orders names of which read Wierus de praestigiis daemonum lib one cap five six thousand three hundred seventy three Strozzius Cicogna and others Adonided amongst the Syrians

Venus at Cyprus Juno at Carthage Aesculapius at Epidaurus Diana at Ephesus Pallas at Athens c And even in these our days both in the East and West Indies in Tartary China Japan c what strange idols in what prodigious forms with what absurd ceremonies are they adored What strange sacraments like ours of Baptism and the Lord s Supper what goodly temples priests sacrifices they had in America when the Spaniards first landed there let Acosta the Jesuit relate lib five cap one two three four c and how the devil imitated the Ark and the children of Israel s coming out of Egypt with many such For as Lipsius well discourseth out of the doctrine of the Stoics maxime cupiunt adorationem hominum now and of old they still and most especially desire to be adored by men See but what Vertomannus l five c two Marcus Polus Lerius Benzo P Martyr in his Ocean Decades Acosta and Mat Riccius expedit Christ in Sinus lib one relate six thousand three hundred seventy four Eusebius wonders how that wise city of Athens and flourishing kingdoms of Greece should be so besotted and we in our times how those witty Chinese so perspicacious in all other things should be so gulled so tortured with superstition so blind as to worship stocks and stones But it is no marvel when we see all out as great effects amongst Christians themselves how are those Anabaptists Arians and Papists above the rest miserably infatuated Mars Jupiter Apollo and Aesculapius have resigned their interest names and offices to Saint George six thousand three hundred seventy five Maxime bellorum rector quem nostra juventus Pro Mavorte colit saint Christopher and a company of fictitious saints Venus to the Lady of Loretto And as those old Romans had several distinct gods for divers offices persons places so have they saints as six thousand three hundred seventy six Lavater well observes out of Lactantius mutato nomine tantum tis the same spirit or devil that deludes them still The manner how as I say is by rewards promises terrors affrights punishments In a word fair and foul means hope and fear How often hath Jupiter Apollo Bacchus and the rest sent plagues in six thousand three hundred seventy seven Greece and Italy because their sacrifices were neglected six thousand three hundred seventy eight Dii multa neglecti dederunt Hesperiae mala luctuosae to terrify them to arouse them up and the like see but Livy Dionysius Halicarnassaeus Thucydides Pausanius Philostratus six thousand three hundred seventy nine Polybius before the battle of Cannae prodigiis signis ostentis templa cuncta privates etiam aedes scatebant Oeneus reigned in Aetolia and because he did not sacrifice to Diana with his other gods see more in Labanius his Diana she sent a wild boar insolitae magnitudinis qui terras et homines misere depascebatur to spoil both men and country which was afterwards killed by Meleager So Plutarch in the Life of Lucullus relates how Mithridates king of Pontus at the siege of Cizicum with all his navy was overthrown by Proserpina for neglecting of her holy day She appeared in a vision to Aristagoras in the night Cras inquit tybicinem Lybicum cum tybicine pontico committam tomorrow I will cause a contest between a Libyan and a Pontic minstrel and the day following this enigma was understood for with a great south wind which came from Libya she quite overwhelmed Mithridates army What prodigies and miracles dreams visions predictions apparitions oracles have been of old at Delphos Dodona Trophonius den at Thebes and Lebaudia of Jupiter Ammon in Egypt Amphiaraus in Attica c what strange cures performed by Apollo and Aesculapius Juno s image and that of six thousand three hundred eighty Fortune spake six thousand three hundred eighty one Castor and Pollux fought in person for the Romans against Hannibal s army as Pallas Mars Juno Venus for Greeks and Trojans c Amongst our pseudo Catholics nothing so familiar as such miracles how many cures done by our lady of Loretto at Sichem of old at our saint Thomas s shrine c six thousand three hundred eighty two saint Sabine was seen to fight for Arnulphus duke of Spoleto six thousand three hundred eighty three saint George fought in person for John the Bastard of Portugal against the Castilians saint James for the Spaniards in America In the battle of Bannockburn where Edward the Second our English king was foiled by the Scots saint Philanus arm was seen to fight if six thousand three hundred eighty four Hector Boethius doth not impose that was before shut up in a silver cap case another time in the same author saint Magnus fought for them Now for visions revelations miracles not only out of the legend out of purgatory but everyday comes news from the Indies and at home read the Jesuits Letters Ribadineira Thurselinus Acosta Lippomanus Xaverius Ignatius Lives c and tell me what difference His ordinary instruments or factors which he useth as God himself did good kings lawful magistrates patriarchs prophets to the establishing of his church six thousand three hundred eighty five are politicians statesmen priests heretics blind guides impostors pseudoprophets to propagate his superstition And first to begin of politicians it hath ever been a principal axiom with them to maintain religion or superstition which they determine of alter and vary upon all occasions as to them seems best they make religion mere policy a cloak a human invention nihil aeque valet ad regendos vulgi animos ac superstitio as six thousand three hundred eighty six Tacitus and six thousand three hundred eighty seven Tully hold Austin l four de civitat Dei c nine censures Scaevola saying and acknowledging expedire civitates religione falli that it was a fit thing cities should be deceived by religion according to the diverb Si mundus vult decipi decipiatur if the world will be gulled let it be gulled tis good howsoever to keep it in subjection Tis that six thousand three hundred eighty eight Aristotle and six thousand three hundred eighty nine Plato inculcate in their politics Religion neglected brings plague to the city opens a gap to all naughtiness Tis that which all our late politicians ingeminate Cromerus l two pol hist Boterus l three de incrementis urbium Clapmarius l two c nine de Arcanis rerump cap four lib two polit Captain Machiavel will have a prince by all means to counterfeit religion to be superstitious in show at least to seem to be devout frequent holy exercises honour divines love the church affect priests as Numa Lycurgus and such lawmakers were and did non ut his fidem habeant sed ut subditos religionis metu facilius in officio contineant to keep people in obedience six thousand three hundred ninety Nam naturaliter as Cardan writes lex Christiana lex est pietatis justitiae fidei simplicitatis c But this error of his Innocentius Jentilettus a French lawyer theorem nine comment one de Relig and Thomas Bozius in his book de ruinis gentium et Regnorum have copiously confuted Many politicians I dare not deny maintain religion as a true means and sincerely speak of it without hypocrisy are truly zealous and religious themselves Justice and religion are the two chief props and supporters of a well governed commonwealth but most of them are but Machiavellians counterfeits only for political ends for solus rex which Campanella cap eighteen atheismi triumphali observes as amongst our modern Turks reipub Finis as knowing six thousand three hundred ninety one magnus ejus in animos imperium and that as six thousand three hundred ninety two Sabellicus delivers A man without religion is like a horse without a bridle No way better to curb than superstition to terrify men s consciences and to keep them in awe they make new laws statutes invent new religions ceremonies as so many stalking horses to their ends six thousand three hundred ninety three Haec enim religio si falsa sit dummodo vera credatur animorum ferociam domat libidines coercet subditos principi obsequentes efficit six thousand three hundred ninety four Therefore saith six thousand three hundred ninety five Polybius of Lycurgus did he maintain ceremonies not that he was superstitious himself but that he had perceived mortal men more apt to embrace paradoxes than aught else and durst attempt no evil things for fear of the gods This was Zamolcus s stratagem amongst the Thracians Numa s plot when he said he had conference with the nymph Aegeria and that of Sertorius with a hart to get more credit to their decrees by deriving them from the gods or else they did all by divine instinct which Nicholas Damascen well observes of Lycurgus Solon and Minos they had their laws dictated monte sacro by Jupiter himself So Mahomet referred his new laws to the six thousand three hundred ninety six angel Gabriel by whose direction he gave out they were made Caligula in Dion feigned himself to be familiar with Castor and Pollux and many such which kept those Romans under who as Machiavel proves lib one disput cap eleven et twelve were Religione maxime moti most superstitious and did curb the people more by this means than by force of arms or severity of human laws Sola plebecula eam agnoscebat saith Vaninus dial one lib four de admirandis naturae arcanis speaking of religion que facile decipitur magnates vero et philosophi nequaquam your grandees and philosophers had no such conceit sed ad imperii conformationem et amplificationem quam sine praetextu religionis tueri non poterant and many thousands in all ages have ever held as much Philosophers especially animadvertebant hi semper haec esse fabellas attamen ob metum publicae potestatis silere cogebantur they were still silent for fear of laws c To this end that Syrian Phyresides Pythagoras his master broached in the East amongst the heathens first the immortality of the soul as Trismegistus did in Egypt with a many of feigned gods Those French and Briton Druids in the West first taught saith six thousand three hundred ninety seven Caesar non interire animas that souls did not die but after death to go from one to another that so they might encourage them to virtue Twas for a politic end and to this purpose the old six thousand three hundred ninety eight poets feigned those elysian fields their Aeacus Minos and Rhadamanthus their infernal judges and those Stygian lakes fiery Phlegethons Pluto s kingdom and variety of torments after death Those that had done well went to the elysian fields but evil doers to Cocytus and to that burning lake of six thousand three hundred ninety nine hell with fire and brimstone for ever to be tormented Tis this which six thousand four hundred Plato labours for in his Phaedon et nine de rep The Turks in their Alcoran when they set down rewards and several punishments for every particular virtue and vice six thousand four hundred one when they persuade men that they that die in battle shall go directly to heaven but wicked livers to eternal torment and all of all sorts much like our papistical purgatory for a set time shall be tortured in their graves as appears by that tract which John Baptista Alfaqui that Mauritanian priest now turned Christian hath written in his confutation of the Alcoran After a man s death two black angels Nunquir and Nequir so they call them come to him to his grave and punish him for his precedent sins if he lived well they torture him the less if ill per indesinentes cruciatus ad diem fudicii they incessantly punish him to the day of judgment Nemo viventium qui ad horum mentionem non totus horret et contremiscit the thought of this crucifies them all their lives long and makes them spend their days in fasting and prayer ne mala haec contingant c A Tartar prince saith Marcus Polus lib one cap twenty three called Senex de Montibus the better to establish his government amongst his subjects and to keep them in awe found a convenient place in a pleasant valley environed with hills in six thousand four hundred two which he made a delicious park full of odoriferous flowers and fruits and a palace of all worldly contents that could possibly be devised music pictures variety of meats c and chose out a certain young man whom with a six thousand four hundred three soporiferous potion he so benumbed that he perceived nothing and so fast asleep as he was caused him to be conveyed into this fair garden where after he had lived awhile in all such pleasures a sensual man could desire six thousand four hundred four He cast him into a sleep again and brought him forth that when he awaked he might tell others he had been in Paradise The like he did for hell and by this means brought his people to subjection Because heaven and hell are mentioned in the scriptures and to be believed necessary by Christians so cunningly can the devil and his ministers in imitation of true religion counterfeit and forge the like to circumvent and delude his superstitious followers Many such tricks and impostures are acted by politicians in China especially but with what effect I will discourse in the symptoms Next to politicians if I may distinguish them are some of our priests who make religion policy if not far beyond them for they domineer over princes and statesmen themselves Carnificinam exercent one saith they tyrannise over men s consciences more than any other tormentors whatsoever partly for their commodity and gain Religionem enim omnium abusus as six thousand four hundred five Postellus holds quaestus scilicet sacrificum in causa est for sovereignty credit to maintain their state and reputation out of ambition and avarice which are their chief supporters what have they not made the common people believe Impossibilities in nature incredible things what devices traditions ceremonies have they not invented in all ages to keep men in obedience to enrich themselves Quibus quaestui sunt capti superstitione animi as six thousand four hundred six Livy saith Those Egyptian priests of old got all the sovereignty into their hands and knowing as six thousand four hundred seven Curtius insinuates nulla res efficacius multitudinem regit quam superstitio melius vatibus quam ducibus parent vana religione capti etiam impotentes faeminae the common people will sooner obey priests than captains and nothing so forcible as superstition or better than blind zeal to rule a multitude have so terrified and gulled them that it is incredible to relate All nations almost have been besotted in this kind amongst our Britons and old Gauls the Druids magi in Persia philosophers in Greece Chaldeans amongst the Oriental Brachmanni in India Gymnosophists in Ethiopia the Turditanes in Spain Augurs in Rome have insulted Apollo s priests in Greece Phaebades and Pythonissae by their oracles and phantasms Amphiaraus and his companions now Mahometan and pagan priests what can they not effect How do they not infatuate the world Adeo ubique as six thousand four hundred eight Scaliger writes of the Mahometan priests tum gentium tum locorum gens ista sacrorum ministra vulgi secat spes ad ea quae ipsi fingunt somnia so cunningly can they gull the commons in all places and countries But above all others that high priest of Rome the dam of that monstrous and superstitious brood the bull bellowing pope which now rageth in the West that three headed Cerberus hath played his part six thousand four hundred nine Whose religion at this day is mere policy a state wholly composed of superstition and wit and needs nothing but wit and superstition to maintain it that useth colleges and religious houses to as good purpose as forts and castles and doth more at this day by a company of scribbling parasites fiery spirited friars zealous anchorites hypocritical confessors and those praetorian soldiers his Janissary Jesuits and that dissociable society as six thousand four hundred ten Languis terms it postremus diaboli conatus et saeculi excrementum that now stand in the fore front of the battle will have a monopoly of and engross all other learning but domineer in divinity six thousand four hundred eleven Excipiunt soli totius vulnera belli and fight alone almost for the rest are but his dromedaries and asses than ever he could have done by garrisons and armies What power of prince or penal law be it never so strict could enforce men to do that which for conscience sake they will voluntarily undergo And as to fast from all flesh abstain from marriage rise to their prayers at midnight whip themselves with stupendous fasting and penance abandon the world wilful poverty perform canonical and blind obedience to prostrate their goods fortunes bodies lives and offer up themselves at their superior s feet at his command What so powerful an engine as superstition which they right well perceiving are of no religion at all themselves Primum enim as Calvin rightly suspects the tenor and practice of their life proves arcanae illius theologiae quod apud eos regnat caput est nullum esse deum they hold there is no God as Leo X did Hildebrand the magician Alexander VI Julius II mere atheists and which the common proverb amongst them approves six thousand four hundred twelve The worst Christians of Italy are the Romans of the Romans the priests are wildest the lewdest priests are preferred to be cardinals and the baddest men amongst the cardinals is chosen to be pope that is an epicure as most part the popes are infidels and Lucianists for so they think and believe and what is said of Christ to be fables and impostures of heaven and hell day of judgment paradise immortality of the soul are all six thousand four hundred thirteen Rumores vacui verbaque inania Et par sollicito fabula somnio Dreams toys and old wives tales Yet as so many six thousand four hundred fourteen whetstones to make other tools cut but cut not themselves though they be of no religion at all they will make others most devout and superstitious by promises and threats compel enforce from and lead them by the nose like so many bears in a line when as their end is not to propagate the church advance God s kingdom seek His glory or common good but to enrich themselves to enlarge their territories to domineer and compel them to stand in awe to live in subjection to the See of Rome For what otherwise care they Si mundus vult decipi decipiatur since the world wishes to be gulled let it be gulled tis fit it should be so And for which six thousand four hundred fifteen Austin cites Varro to maintain his Roman religion we may better apply to them multa vera quae vulgus scire non est utile pleraque falsa quae tamen uliter existimare populum expedit some things are true some false which for their own ends they will not have the gullish commonalty take notice of As well may witness their intolerable covetousness strange forgeries fopperies fooleries unrighteous subtleties impostures illusions new doctrines paradoxes traditions false miracles which they have still forged to enthral circumvent and subjugate them to maintain their own estates six thousand four hundred sixteen One while by bulls pardons indulgencies and their doctrines of good works that they be meritorious hope of heaven by that means they have so fleeced the commonalty and spurred on this free superstitious horse that he runs himself blind and is an ass to carry burdens They have so amplified Peter s patrimony that from a poor bishop he is become Rex Regum Dominus dominantium a demigod as his canonists make him Felinus and the rest above God himself And for his wealth and six thousand four hundred seventeen temporalities is not inferior to many kings six thousand four hundred eighteen his cardinals princes companions and in every kingdom almost abbots priors monks friars c and his clergy have engrossed a six thousand four hundred nineteen third part half in some places all into their hands Three princes electors in Germany bishops besides Magdeburg Spire Saltsburg Breme Bamberg c In France as Bodine lib de repub gives us to understand their revenues are twelve million three hundred thousand livres and of twelve parts of the revenues in France the church possesseth seven The Jesuits a new sect begun in this age have as six thousand four hundred twenty Middendorpius and six thousand four hundred twenty one Pelargus reckon up three or four hundred colleges in Europe and more revenues than many princes In France as Arnoldus proves in thirty years they have got bis centum librarum millia annua two hundred thousand l I say nothing of the rest of their orders We have had in England as Armachanus demonstrates above thirty thousand friars at once and as six thousand four hundred twenty two Speed collects out of Leland and others almost six hundred religious houses and near two hundred thousand l in revenues of the old rent belonging to them besides images of gold silver plate furniture goods and ornaments as six thousand four

relics images idolatry have their mass priests engrossed and what sums have they scraped by their other tricks Loretto in Italy Walsingham in England in those days Ubi omnia auro nitent where

Maximus Tyrius the Platonist ser one farther adds nec continentis nec insularum habitator let him dwell where he will in what coast soever there is no nation so barbarous that is not persuaded there

seven Lemnius observes and made them worship him as their God with stocks and stones and torture themselves to their own destruction as he thought fit himself inspired his priests and ministers with lies and fictions to prosecute the same which they for their own ends were as willing to undergo taking advantage of their simplicity fear and ignorance For the common people are as a flock of sheep a rude illiterate rout void many times of common sense a mere beast bellua multorum capitum will go whithersoever they are led as you lead a ram over a gap by the horns all the rest will follow six thousand four hundred thirty eight Non qua eundum sed qua itur they will do as they see others do and as their prince will have them let him be of what religion he will they are for him Now for those idolaters Maxentius and Licinius then for Constantine a Christian six thousand four hundred thirty nine Qui Christum negant male pereant acclamatum est Decies for two hours space qui Christum non colunt Augusti inimici sunt acclamatum est ter decies and by and by idolaters again under that Apostate Julianus all Arians under Constantius good Catholics again under Jovinianus And little difference there is between the discretion of men and children in this case especially of old folks and women as six thousand four hundred forty Cardan discourseth when as they are tossed with fear and superstition and with other men s folly and dishonesty So that I may say their ignorance is a cause of their superstition a symptom and madness itself Supplicii causa est sappliciumque sui Their own fear folly stupidity to be deplored lethargy is that which gives occasion to the other and pulls these miseries on their own heads For in all these religions and superstitions amongst our idolaters you shall find that the parties first affected are silly rude ignorant people old folks that are naturally prone to superstition weak women or some poor rude illiterate persons that are apt to be wrought upon and gulled in this kind prone without either examination or due consideration for they take up religion a trust as at mercers they do their wares to believe anything And the best means they have to broach first or to maintain it when they have done is to keep them still in ignorance for ignorance is the mother of devotion as all the world knows and these times can amply witness This hath been the devil s practice and his infernal ministers in all ages not as our Saviour by a few silly fishermen to confound the wisdom of the world to save publicans and sinners but to make advantage of their ignorance to convert them and their associates and that they may better effect what they intend they begin as I say with poor six thousand four hundred forty one stupid illiterate persons So Mahomet did when he published his Alcoran which is a piece of work saith six thousand four hundred forty two Bredenbachius full of nonsense barbarism confusion without rhyme reason or any good composition first published to a company of rude rustics hog rubbers that had no discretion judgment art or understanding and is so still maintained For it is a part of their policy to let no man comment dare to dispute or call in question to this day any part of it be it never so absurd incredible ridiculous fabulous as it is must be believed implicite upon pain of death no man must dare to contradict it God and the emperor c What else do our papists but by keeping the people in ignorance vent and broach all their new ceremonies and traditions when they conceal the scripture read it in Latin and to some few alone feeding the slavish people in the meantime with tales out of legends and such like fabulous narrations Whom do they begin with but collapsed ladies some few tradesmen superstitious old folks illiterate persons weak women discontent rude silly companions or sooner circumvent So do all our schismatics and heretics Marcus and Valentinian heretics in six thousand four hundred forty three Irenaeus seduced first I know not how many women and made them believe they were prophets six thousand four hundred forty four Friar Cornelius of Dort seduced a company of silly women What are all our Anabaptists Brownists Barrowists familists but a company of rude illiterate capricious base fellows What are most of our papists but stupid ignorant and blind bayards how should they otherwise be when as they are brought up and kept still in darkness six thousand four hundred forty five If their pastors saith Lavater have done their duties and instructed their flocks as they ought in the principles of Christian religion or had not forbidden them the reading of scriptures they had not been as they are But being so misled all their lives in superstition and carried hoodwinked like hawks how can they prove otherwise than blind idiots and superstitious asses what else shall we expect at their hands Neither is it sufficient to keep them blind and in Cimmerian darkness but withal as a schoolmaster doth by his boys to make them follow their books sometimes by good hope promises and encouragements but most of all by fear strict discipline severity threats and punishment do they collogue and soothe up their silly auditors and so bring them into a fools paradise Rex eris aiunt si recte facies do well thou shalt be crowned but for the most part by threats terrors and affrights they tyrannise and terrify their distressed souls knowing that fear alone is the sole and only means to keep men in obedience according to that hemistichium of Petronius primus in orbe deos fecit timor the fear of some divine and supreme powers keeps men in obedience makes the people do their duties they play upon their consciences six thousand four hundred forty six which was practised of old in Egypt by their priests when there was an eclipse they made the people believe God was angry great miseries were to come they take all opportunities of natural causes to delude the people s senses and with fearful tales out of purgatory feigned apparitions earthquakes in Japonia or China tragical examples of devils possessions obsessions false miracles counterfeit visions c They do so insult over and restrain them never hoby so dared a lark that they will not six thousand four hundred forty seven offend the least tradition tread or scarce look awry Deus bone six thousand four hundred forty eight Lavater exclaims quot hoc commentum de purgatorio misere afflixit good God how many men have been miserably afflicted by this fiction of purgatory To these advantages of hope and fear ignorance and simplicity he hath several engines traps devices to batter and enthral omitting no opportunities according to men s several inclinations abilities to circumvent and humour them to maintain his superstitions sometimes to stupefy besot them sometimes again by oppositions factions to set all at odds and in an uproar sometimes he infects one man and makes him a principal agent sometimes whole cities countries If of meaner sort by stupidity canonical obedience blind zeal c If of better note by pride ambition popularity vainglory If of the clergy and more eminent of better parts than the rest more learned eloquent he puffs them up with a vain conceit of their own worth scientia inflati they begin to swell and scorn all the world in respect of themselves and thereupon turn heretics schismatics broach new doctrines frame new crotchets and the like or else out of too much learning become mad or out of curiosity they will search into God s secrets and eat of the forbidden fruit or out of presumption of their holiness and good gifts inspirations become prophets enthusiasts and what not Or else if they be displeased discontent and have not as they suppose preferment to their worth have some disgrace repulse neglected or not esteemed as they fondly value themselves or out of emulation they begin presently to rage and rave coelum terrae miscent they become so impatient in an instant that a whole kingdom cannot contain them they will set all in a combustion all at variance to be revenged of their adversaries six thousand four hundred forty nine Donatus when he saw Cecilianus preferred before him in the bishopric of Carthage turned heretic and so did Arian because Alexander was advanced we have examples at home and too many experiments of such persons If they be laymen of better note the same engines of pride ambition emulation and jealousy take place they will be gods themselves six thousand four hundred fifty Alexander in India after his victories became so insolent he would be adored for a god and those Roman emperors came to that height of madness they must have temples built to them sacrifices to their deities Divus Augustus D Claudius D Adrianus six thousand four hundred fifty one Heliogabalus put out that vestal fire at Rome expelled the virgins and banished all other religions all over the world and would be the sole God himself Our Turks China kings great Chams and Mogors do little less assuming divine and bombast titles to themselves the meaner sort are too credulous and led with blind zeal blind obedience to prosecute and maintain whatsoever their sottish leaders shall propose what they in pride and singularity revenge vainglory ambition spleen for gain shall rashly maintain and broach their disciples make a matter of conscience of hell and damnation if they do it not and will rather forsake wives children house and home lands goods fortunes life itself than omit or abjure the least tittle of it and to advance the common cause undergo any miseries turn traitors assassins pseudomartyrs with full assurance and hope of reward in that other world that they shall certainly merit by it win heaven be canonised for saints Now when they are truly possessed with blind zeal and misled with superstition he hath many other baits to inveigle and infatuate them farther yet to make them quite mortified and mad and that under colour of perfection to merit by penance going woolward whipping alms fastings c An thirteen twenty there was a sect of six thousand four hundred fifty two whippers in Germany that to the astonishment of the beholders lashed and cruelly tortured themselves I could give many other instances of each particular But these works so done are meritorious ex opere operato ex condigno for themselves and others to make them macerate and consume their bodies specie virtutis et umbra those evangelical counsels are propounded as our pseudo Catholics call them canonical obedience wilful poverty six thousand four hundred fifty three vows of chastity monkery and a solitary life which extend almost to all religions and superstitions to Turks Chinese Gentiles Abyssinians Greeks Latins and all countries Amongst the rest fasting contemplation solitariness are as it were certain rams by which the devil doth batter and work upon the strongest constitutions Nonnulli saith Peter Forestus ob longas inedias studia et meditationes coelestes de rebus sacris et religione semper agitant by fasting overmuch and divine meditations are overcome Not that fasting is a thing of itself to be discommended for it is an excellent means to keep the body in subjection a preparative to devotion the physic of the soul by which chaste thoughts are engendered true zeal a divine spirit whence wholesome counsels do proceed concupiscence is restrained vicious and predominant lusts and humours are expelled The fathers are very much in commendation of it and as Calvin notes sometimes immoderate six thousand four hundred fifty four The mother of health key of heaven a spiritual wing to arear us the chariot of the Holy Ghost banner of faith c And tis true they say of it if it be moderately and seasonably used by such parties as Moses Elias Daniel Christ and his six thousand four hundred fifty five apostles made use of it but when by this means they will supererogate and as six thousand four hundred fifty six Erasmus well taxeth Coelum non sufficere putant suis meritis Heaven is too small a reward for it they make choice of times and meats buy and sell their merits attribute more to them than to the ten Commandments and count it a greater sin to eat meat in Lent than to kill a man and as one sayeth Plus respiciunt assum piscem quam Christum crucifixum plus salmonem quam Solomonem quibus in ore Christus Epicurus in corde pay more respect to a broiled fish than to Christ crucified more regard to salmon than to Solomon have Christ on their lips but Epicurus in their hearts when some counterfeit and some attribute more to such works of theirs than to Christ s death and passion the devil sets in a foot strangely deludes them and by that means makes them to overthrow the temperature of their bodies and hazard their souls Never any strange illusions of devils amongst hermits anchorites never any visions phantasms apparitions enthusiasms prophets any revelations but immoderate fasting bad diet sickness melancholy solitariness or some such things were the precedent causes the forerunners or concomitants of them The best opportunity and sole occasion the devil takes to delude them Marcilius Cognatus lib one cont cap seven hath many stories to this purpose of such as after long fasting have been seduced by devils and six thousand four hundred fifty seven tis a miraculous thing to relate as Cardan writes what strange accidents proceed from fasting dreams superstition contempt of torments desire of death prophecies paradoxes madness fasting naturally prepares men to these things Monks anchorites and the like after much emptiness become melancholy vertiginous they think they hear strange noises confer with hobgoblins devils rivel up their bodies et dum hostem insequimur saith Gregory civem quem diligimus trucidamus they become bare skeletons skin and bones Carnibus abstinentes proprias carnes devorant ut nil praeter cutem et ossa sit reliquum Hilarion as six thousand four hundred fifty eight Hierome reports in his life and Athanasius of Antonius was so bare with fasting that the skin did scarce stick to the bones for want of vapours he could not sleep and for want of sleep became idleheaded heard every night infants cry oxen low wolves howl lions roar as he thought clattering of chains strange voices and the like illusions of devils Such symptoms are common to those that fast long are solitary given to contemplation overmuch solitariness and meditation Not that these things as I said of fasting are to be discommended of themselves but very behoveful in some cases and good sobriety and contemplation join our souls to God as that heathen six thousand four hundred fifty nine Porphyry can tell us six thousand four hundred sixty Ecstasy is a taste of future happiness by which we are united unto God a divine melancholy a spiritual wing Bonaventure terms it to lift us up to heaven but as it is abused a mere dotage madness a cause and symptom of religious melancholy six thousand four hundred sixty one If you shall at any time see saith Guianerius a religious person over superstitious too solitary or much given to fasting that man will certainly be melancholy thou mayst boldly say it he will be so P Forestus hath almost the same words and six thousand four hundred sixty two Cardan subtil lib eighteen et cap forty lib eight de rerum varietate solitariness fasting and that melancholy humour are the causes of all hermits illusions Lavater de spect cap nineteen part one and part one cap ten puts solitariness a main cause of such spectrums and apparitions none saith he so melancholy as monks and hermits the devil s hath melancholy six thousand four hundred sixty three none so subject to visions and dotage in this kind as such as live solitary lives they hear and act strange things in their dotage six thousand four hundred sixty four Polydore Virgil lib two prodigiis holds that those prophecies and monks revelations nuns dreams which they suppose come from God to proceed wholly ab instinctu daemonum by the devil s means and so those enthusiasts Anabaptists pseudoprophets from the same cause six thousand four hundred sixty five Fracastorius lib two de intellect will have all your pythonesses sibyls and pseudoprophets to be mere melancholy so doth Wierus prove lib one cap eight et l three cap seven and Arculanus in nine Rhasis that melancholy is a sole cause and the devil together with fasting and solitariness of such sibylline prophecies if there were ever such which with six thousand four hundred sixty six Casaubon and others I justly except at for it is not likely that the Spirit of God should ever reveal such manifest revelations and predictions of Christ to those Pythonissae witches Apollo s priests the devil s ministers they were no better and conceal them from his own prophets for these sibyls set down all particular circumstances of Christ s coming and many other future accidents far more perspicuous and plain than ever any prophet did But howsoever there be no Phaebades or sibyls I am assured there be other enthusiasts prophets dii Fatidici Magi of which read Jo Boissardus who hath laboriously collected them into a great six thousand four hundred sixty seven volume of late with elegant pictures and epitomised their lives c ever have been in all ages and still proceeding from those causes six thousand four hundred sixty eight qui visiones suas enarrant somniant futura prophetisant et ejusmodi deliriis agitati Spiritum Sanctum sibi communicari putant That which is written of Saint Francis five wounds and other such monastical effects of him and others may justly be referred to this our melancholy and that which Matthew Paris relates of the six thousand four hundred sixty nine monk of Evesham who saw heaven and hell in a vision of six thousand four hundred seventy Sir Owen that went down into Saint Patrick s purgatory in King Stephen s days and saw as much Walsingham of him that showed as much by Saint Julian Beda lib five cap thirteen fourteen fifteen et twenty reports of King Sebba lib four cap eleven eccles hist that saw strange six thousand four hundred seventy one visions and Stumphius Helvet Cornic a cobbler of Basle that beheld rare apparitions at Augsburg six thousand four hundred seventy two in Germany Alexander ab Alexandro gen dier lib six cap twenty one of an enthusiastical prisoner all out as probable as that of Eris Armenius in Plato s tenth dialogue de Repub that revived again ten days after he was killed in a battle and told strange wonders like those tales Ulysses related to Alcinous in Homer or Lucian s vera historia itself was still after much solitariness fasting or long sickness when their brains were addled and their bellies as empty of meat as their heads of wit Florilegus hath many such examples fol one hundred ninety one one of Saint Gultlake of Crowald that fought with devils but still after long fasting overmuch solitariness six thousand four hundred seventy three the devil persuaded him therefore to fast as Moses and Elias did the better to delude him six thousand four hundred seventy four In the same author is recorded Carolus Magnus vision an one hundred eighty five or ecstasies wherein he saw heaven and hell after much fasting and meditation So did the devil of old with Apollo s priests Amphiaraus and his fellows those Egyptians still enjoin long fasting before he would give any oracles triduum a cibo et vino abstinerent six thousand four hundred seventy five before they gave any answers as Volateran lib thirteen cap four records and Strabo Geog lib fourteen describes Charon s den in the way between Tralles and Nissum whither the priests led sick and fanatic men but nothing performed without long fasting no good to be done That scoffing six thousand four hundred seventy six Lucian conducts his Menippus to hell by the directions of that Chaldean Mithrobarzanes but after long fasting and such like idle preparation Which the Jesuits right well perceiving of what force this fasting and solitary meditation is to alter men s minds when they would make a man mad ravish him improve him beyond himself to undertake some great business of moment to kill a king or the like six thousand four hundred seventy seven they bring him into a melancholy dark chamber where he shall see no light for many days together no company little meat ghastly pictures of devils all about him and leave him to lie as he will himself on the bare floor in this chamber of meditation as they call it on his back side belly till by this strange usage they make him quite mad and beside himself And then after some ten days as they find him animated and resolved they make use of him The devil hath many such factors many such engines which what effect they produce you shall hear in the following symptoms SUBSECT III Symptoms general love to their own sect hate of all other religions obstinacy peevishness ready to undergo any danger or cross for it Martyrs blind zeal blind obedience fastings vows belief of incredibilities impossibilities Particular of Gentiles Mahometans Jews Christians and in them heretics old and new schismatics schoolmen prophets enthusiasts c Fleat Heraclitus an rideat Democritus in attempting to speak of these symptoms shall I laugh with Democritus or weep with Heraclitus they are so ridiculous and absurd on the one side so lamentable and tragical on the other a mixed scene offers itself so full of errors and a promiscuous variety of objects that I know not in what strain to represent it When I think of the Turkish paradise those Jewish fables and pontifical rites those pagan superstitions their sacrifices and ceremonies as to make images of all matter and adore them when they have done to see them kiss the pyx creep to the cross c I cannot choose but laugh with Democritus but when I see them whip and torture themselves grind their souls for toys and trifles desperate and now ready to die I cannot but weep with Heraclitus When I see a priest say mass with all those apish gestures murmurings c read the customs of the Jews synagogue or Mahometa Meschites I must needs six thousand four hundred seventy eight laugh at their folly risum teneatis amici but when I see them make matters of conscience of such toys and trifles to adore the devil to endanger their souls to offer their children to their idols c I must needs condole their misery When I see two superstitious orders contend pro aris et focis with such have and hold de lana caprina some write such great volumes to no purpose take so much pains to so small effect their satires invectives apologies dull and gross fictions when I see grave learned men rail and scold like butter women methinks tis pretty sport and fit six thousand four hundred seventy nine for Calphurnius and Democritus to laugh at But when I see so much blood spilt so many murders and massacres so many cruel battles fought c tis a fitter subject for Heraclitus to lament six thousand four hundred eighty As Merlin when he sat by the lake side with Vortigern and had seen the white and red dragon fight before he began to interpret or to speak in fletum prorupit fell a weeping and then proceeded to declare to the king what it meant I should first pity and bewail this misery of human kind with some passionate preface wishing mine eyes a fountain of tears as Jeremiah did and then to my task For it is that great torture that infernal plague of mortal men omnium pestium pestilentissima superstitio and able of itself alone to stand in opposition to all other plagues miseries and calamities whatsoever far more cruel more pestiferous more grievous more general more violent of a greater extent Other fears and sorrows grievances of body and mind are troublesome for the time but this is for ever eternal damnation hell itself a plague a fire an inundation hurts one province alone and the loss may be recovered but this superstition involves all the world almost and can never be remedied Sickness and sorrows come and go but a superstitious soul hath no rest six thousand four hundred eighty one superstitione imbutus animus nunquam quietus esse potest no peace no quietness True religion and superstition are quite opposite longe diversa carnificina et pietas as Lactantius describes the one erects the other dejects illorum pietas mera impietus the one is an easy yoke the other an intolerable burden an absolute tyranny the one a sure anchor a haven the other a tempestuous ocean the one makes the other mars the one is wisdom the other is folly madness indiscretion the one unfeigned the other a counterfeit the one a diligent observer the other an ape one leads to heaven the other to hell But these differences will more evidently appear by their particular symptoms What religion is and of what parts it doth consist every catechism will tell you what symptoms it hath and what effects it produceth but for their superstitions no tongue can tell them no pen express they are so many so diverse so uncertain so inconstant and so different from themselves Tot mundi superstitiones quot coelo stellae one saith there be as many superstitions in the world as there be stars in heaven or devils themselves that are the first founders of them with such ridiculous absurd symptoms and signs so many several rites ceremonies torments and vexations accompanying as may well express and beseem the devil to be the author and maintainer of them I will only point at some of them ex ungue leonem guess at the rest and those of the chief kinds of superstition which beside us Christians now domineer and crucify the world Gentiles Mahometans Jews c Of these symptoms some be general some particular to each private sect general to all are an extraordinary love and affection they bear and show to such as are of their own sect and more than Vatinian hate to such as are opposite in religion as they call it or disagree from them in their superstitious rites blind zeal which is as much a symptom as a cause vain fears blind obedience needless works incredibilities impossibilities monstrous rites and ceremonies wilfulness blindness obstinacy c For the first which is love and hate as six thousand four hundred eighty two Montanus saith nulla firmior amicitia quam quae contrahitur hinc nulla discordia major quam quae a religione fit no greater concord no greater discord than that which proceeds from religion it is incredible to relate did not our daily experience evince it what factions quam teterrimae factiones as six thousand four hundred eighty three Rich Dinoth writes have been of late for matters of religion in France and what hurlyburlies all over Europe for these many years Nihil est quod tam impotentur rapiat homines quam suscepta de salute opinio siquidem pro ea omnes gentes corpora et animas devovere solent et arctissimo necessitudinis vinculo se invicem colligare We are all brethren in Christ servants of one Lord members of one body and therefore are or should be at least dearly beloved inseparably allied in the greatest bond of love and familiarity united partakers not only of the same cross but coadjutors comforters helpers at all times upon all occasions as they did in the primitive church Acts the five they sold their patrimonies and laid them at the apostles feet and many such memorable examples of mutual love we have had under the ten general persecutions many since Examples on the other side of discord none like as our Saviour saith he came therefore into the world to set father against son c In imitation of whom the devil belike six thousand four hundred eighty four nam superstitio irrepsit verae religionis imitatrix superstition is still religion s ape as in all other things so in this doth so combine and glue together his superstitious followers in love and affection that they will live and die together and what an innate hatred hath he still inspired to any other superstition opposite How those old Romans were affected those ten persecutions may be a witness and that cruel executioner in Eusebius aut lita aut morere sacrifice or die No greater hate more continuate bitter faction wars persecution in all ages than for matters of religion no such feral opposition father against son mother against daughter husband against wife city against city kingdom against kingdom as of old at Tentira and Combos six thousand four hundred eighty five Immortale odium et nunquam sanabile vulnus Inde furor vulgo quod numina vicinorum Odit uterque locus quum solos credit habendos Esse deos quos ipse colat Immortal hate it breeds a wound past cure And fury to the commons still to endure Because one city t other s gods as vain Deride and his alone as good maintain The Turks at this day count no better of us than of dogs so they commonly call us giaours infidels miscreants make that their main quarrel and cause of Christian persecution If he will turn Turk he shall be entertained as a brother and had in good esteem a Mussulman or a believer which is a greater tie to them than any affinity or consanguinity The Jews stick together like so many burrs but as for the rest whom they call Gentiles they do hate and abhor they cannot endure their Messiah should be a common saviour to us all and rather as six thousand four hundred eighty six Luther writes than they that now scoff at them curse them persecute and revile them shall be coheirs and brethren with them or have any part or fellowship with their Messiah they would crucify their Messiah ten times over and God himself his angels and all his creatures if it were possible though they endure a thousand hells for it Such is their malice towards us Now for Papists what in a common cause for the advancement of their religion they will endure our traitors and pseudo Catholics will declare unto us and how bitter on the other side to their adversaries how violently bent let those Marian times record as those miserable slaughters at Merindol and Cabriers the Spanish inquisition the Duke of Alva s tyranny in the Low Countries the French massacres and civil wars six thousand four hundred eighty seven Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum Such wickedness did religion persuade Not there only but all over Europe we read of bloody battles racks and wheels seditions factions oppositions six thousand four hundred eighty eight obvia signis Signa pares aquilas et pila minantia pilis Invectives and contentions They had rather shake hands with a Jew Turk or as the Spaniards do suffer Moors to live amongst them and Jews than Protestants my name saith six thousand four hundred eighty nine Luther is more odious to them than any thief or murderer So it is with all heretics and schismatics whatsoever and none so passionate violent in their tenets opinions obstinate wilful refractory peevish factious singular and stiff in defence of them they do not only persecute and hate but pity all other religions account them damned blind as if they alone were the true church they are the true heirs have the fee simple of heaven by a peculiar donation tis entailed on them and their posterities their doctrine sound per funem aureum de coelo delapsa doctrinci let down from heaven by a golden rope they alone are to be saved The Jews at this day are so incomprehensibly proud and churlish saith six thousand four hundred ninety Luther that soli salvari soli domini terrarum salutari volunt And as six thousand four hundred ninety one Buxtorfius adds so ignorant and self willed withal that amongst their most understanding Rabbins you shall find nought but gross dotage horrible hardness of heart and stupendous obstinacy in all their actions opinions conversations and yet so zealous with all that no man living can be more and vindicate themselves for the elect people of GOD Tis so with all other superstitious sects Mahometans Gentiles in China and Tartary our ignorant Papists Anabaptists Separatists and peculiar churches of Amsterdam they alone and none but they can be saved six thousand four hundred ninety two Zealous as Paul saith Rom x two without knowledge they will endure any misery any trouble suffer and do that which the sunbeams will not endure to see Religionis acti Furiis all extremities losses and dangers take any pains fast pray vow chastity wilful poverty forsake all and follow their idols die a thousand deaths as some Jews did to Pilate s soldiers in like case exertos praebentes jugulos et manifeste prae se ferentes as Josephus hath it cariorem esse rita sibi legis patriae observationem rather than abjure or deny the least particle of that religion which their fathers profess and they themselves have been brought up in be it never so absurd ridiculous they will embrace it and without farther inquiry or examination of the truth though it be prodigiously false they will believe it they will take much more pains to go to hell than we shall do to heaven Single out the most ignorant of them convince his understanding show him his errors grossness and absurdities of his sect Non persuadebis etiamsi persuaseris he will not be persuaded As those pagans told the Jesuits in Japona six thousand four hundred ninety three they would do as their forefathers have done and with Ratholde the Frisian Prince go to hell for company if most of their friends went thither they will not be moved no persuasion no torture can stir them So that papists cannot brag of their vows poverty obedience orders merits martyrdoms fastings alms good works pilgrimages much and more than all this I shall show you is and hath been done by these superstitious Gentiles Pagans Idolaters and Jews their blind zeal and idolatrous superstition in all kinds is much at one little or no difference and it is hard to say which is the greatest which is the grossest For if a man shall duly consider those superstitious rites amongst the Ethnics in Japan the Bannians in Gusart the Chinese idolaters six thousand four hundred ninety four Americans of old in Mexico especially Mahometan priests he shall find the same government almost the same orders and ceremonies or so like that they may seem all apparently to be derived from some heathen spirit and the Roman hierarchy no better than the rest In a word this is common to all superstition there is nothing so mad and absurd so ridiculous impossible incredible which they will not believe observe and diligently perform as much as in them lies nothing so monstrous to conceive or intolerable to put in practice so cruel to suffer which they will not willingly undertake So powerful a thing is superstition six thousand four hundred ninety five O Egypt as Trismegistus exclaims thy religion is fables and such as posterity will not believe I know that in true religion itself many mysteries are so apprehended alone by faith as that of the Trinity which Turks especially deride Christ s incarnation resurrection of the body at the last day quod ideo credendum saith Tertullian quod incredible c many miracles not to be controverted or disputed of Mirari non rimari sapientia vera est saith six thousand four hundred ninety six Gerhardus et in divinis as a good father informs us quaedam credenda quaedam admiranda c some things are to be believed embraced followed with all submission and obedience some again admired Though Julian the apostate scoff at Christians in this point quod captivemus intellectum in obsequium fidei saying that the Christian creed is like the Pythagorean Ipse dixit we make our will and understanding too slavishly subject to our faith without farther examination of the truth yet as Saint Gregory truly answers our creed is altioris praestantiae and much more divine and as Thomas will pie consideranti semper suppetunt rationes ostendentes credibilitatem in mysteriis supernaturalibus we do absolutely believe it and upon good reasons for as Gregory well informeth us Fides non habet meritum ubi humana ratio quaerit experimentum that faith hath no merit is not worth the name of faith that will not apprehend without a certain demonstration we must and will believe God s word and if we be mistaken or err in our general belief as six thousand four hundred ninety seven Richardus de Sancto Victore vows he will say to Christ himself at the day of judgment Lord if we be deceived thou alone hast deceived us thus we plead But for the rest I will not justify that pontificial consubstantiation that which six thousand four hundred ninety eight Mahometans and Jews justly except at as Campanella confesseth Atheismi triumphat cap twelve fol one hundred twenty

shall read the six thousand five hundred Turks Alcoran the Jews Talmud and papists golden legend in the mean time will swear that such gross fictions fables vain traditions prodigious paradoxes and ceremonies could never proceed from any other spirit than that of the devil himself which is the author of confusion and lies and wonder withal how such wise men as have been of the Jews such learned understanding men as Averroes Avicenna or those heathen philosophers could ever be persuaded to believe or to subscribe to the least part of them aut fraudem non detegere but that as six thousand five hundred one Vanninus answers ob publicae potestatis formidinem allatrare philosophi non audebant they durst not speak for fear of the law But I will descend to particulars read their several symptoms and then guess Of such symptoms as properly belong to superstition or that irreligious religion I may say as of the rest some are ridiculous some again feral to relate Of those ridiculous there can be no better testimony than the multitude of their gods those absurd names actions offices they put upon them their feasts holy days sacrifices adorations and the like The Egyptians that pretended so great antiquity three hundred kings before Amasis and as Mela writes thirteen thousand years from the beginning of their chronicles that bragged so much of their knowledge of old for they invented arithmetic astronomy geometry of their wealth and power that vaunted of twenty thousand cities yet at the same time their idolatry and superstition was most gross they worshipped as Diodorus Siculus records sun and moon under the name of Isis and Osiris and after such men as were beneficial to them or any creature that did them good In the city of Bubasti they adored a cat saith Herodotus Ibis and storks an ox saith Pliny six thousand five hundred two leeks and onions Macrobius six thousand five hundred three Porrum et caepe deos imponere nubibus ausi Hos tu Nile deos colis Scoffing six thousand five hundred four Lucian in his vera Historia which as he confesseth himself was not persuasively written as a truth but in comical fashion to glance at the monstrous fictions and gross absurdities of writers and nations to deride without doubt this prodigious Egyptian idolatry feigns this story of himself that when he had seen the Elysian fields and was now coming away Rhadamanthus gave him a mallow root and bade him pray to that when he was in any peril or extremity which he did accordingly for when he came to Hydamordia in the island of treacherous women he made his prayers to

Julius Proculus gave out that Romulus was taken up by Jupiter into heaven and therefore to be ever after adored for a god amongst the Romans Syrophanes of Egypt had one only son whom he dearly loved he erected his statue in his house which his servants did adorn with garlands to pacify their master s wrath when he was angry so by little and little he was adored for a god This did Semiramis for her husband Belus and Adrian the emperor by his minion Antinous Flora was a rich harlot in Rome and for that she made the commonwealth her heir her birthday was solemnised long after and to make it a more plausible holiday they made her goddess of flowers and sacrificed to her amongst the rest The matrons of Rome as Dionysius Halicarnassaeus relates because at their entreaty Coriolanus desisted from his wars consecrated a church Fortunes muliebri and six thousand five hundred thirteen Venus Barbata had a temple erected for that somewhat was amiss about hair and so the rest The citizens six thousand five hundred fourteen of Alabanda a small town in Asia Minor to curry favour with the Romans who then warred in Greece with Perseus of Macedon and were formidable to these parts consecrated a temple to the City of Rome and made her a goddess with annual games and sacrifices so a town of houses was deified with shameful flattery of the one side to give and intolerable arrogance on the other to accept upon so vile and absurd an occasion Tully writes to Atticus that his daughter Tulliola might be made a goddess and adored as Juno and Minerva and as well she deserved it Their holy days and adorations were all out as ridiculous those Lupercals of Pan Florales of Flora Bona dea Anna Perenna Saturnals c as how they were celebrated with what lascivious and wanton gestures bald ceremonies

gods but blocks and stupid statues in which mice swallows birds make their nests spiders their webs and in their very mouths laid their excrements Those images I say were all out as gross as the shapes in which they did represent them Jupiter with a ram s head Mercury a dog s Pan like a goat Heccate with three heads one with a beard another without see more in Carterius and six thousand five

so base as to reveal their counsels and give oracles e viscerum sterquiliniis out of the bowels and excremental parts of beasts sordidos deos Varro truly calls them therefore and well he might I say nothing of their magnificent and sumptuous temples those majestical structures to the roof of Apollo Didymeus temple ad branchidas as six thousand five hundred twenty eight Strabo writes a thousand oaks did not suffice Who can relate the glorious splendour and stupend magnificence the sumptuous building of Diana at Ephesus Jupiter Ammon s temple in Africa the Pantheon at Rome the Capitol the Sarapium at Alexandria Apollo s temple at Daphne in the suburbs of Antioch The great temple at Mexico so richly adorned and so capacious for ten thousand men might stand in it at once that fair Pantheon of Cusco described by Acosta in his Indian History which eclipses both Jews and Christians There were in old Jerusalem as some write four hundred eight synagogues but new Cairo reckons up if six thousand five hundred twenty nine Radzivilus may be believed six thousand eight hundred mosques Fez four hundred whereof fifty are most magnificent like saint Paul s in London Helena built three hundred fair churches in the Holy Land but one Bassa hath built four hundred mosques The Mahometans have one thousand monks in a monastery the like saith Acosta of Americans Riccius of the Chinese for men and women fairly built and more richly endowed some of them than Arras in Artois Fulda in Germany or saint Edmund s Bury in England with us who can describe those curious and costly statues idols images so frequently mentioned in Pausanias I conceal their donaries pendants other offerings presents to these their fictitious gods daily consecrated six thousand five hundred thirty Alexander the son of Amyntas king of Macedonia sent two statues of pure gold to Apollo at Delphos six thousand five hundred thirty one Croesus king of Lydia dedicated a hundred golden tiles in the same place with a golden altar no man came empty handed to their shrines But these are base offerings in respect they offered men themselves alive The Leucadians as Strabo writes sacrificed every year a man averruncandae deorum irae causa to pacify their gods de montis praecipitio dejecerent c and they did voluntarily undergo it The Decii did so sacrifice Diis manibus Curtius did leap into the gulf Were they not all strangely deluded to go so far to their oracles to be so gulled by them both in war and peace as Polybius relates which their argurs priests vestal virgins can witness to be so superstitious that they would rather lose goods and lives than omit any ceremonies or offend their heathen gods Nicias that generous and valiant captain of the Greeks overthrew the Athenian navy by reason of his too much superstition six thousand five hundred thirty two because the augurs told him it was ominous to set sail from the haven of Syracuse whilst the moon was eclipsed he tarried so long till his enemies besieged him he and all his army were overthrown The six thousand five hundred thirty three Parthians of old were so sottish in this kind they would rather lose a victory nay lose their own lives than fight in the night twas against their religion The Jews would make no resistance on the Sabbath when Pompeius besieged Jerusalem and some Jewish Christians in Africa set upon by the Goths suffered themselves upon the same occasion to be utterly vanquished The superstition of the Dibrenses a bordering town in Epirus besieged by the Turks is miraculous almost to report Because a dead dog was flung into the only fountain which the city had they would die of thirst all rather than drink of that six thousand five hundred thirty four unclean water and yield up the city upon any conditions Though the praetor and chief citizens began to drink first using all good persuasions their superstition was such no saying would serve they must all forthwith die or yield up the city Vix ausum ipse credere saith six thousand five hundred thirty five Barletius tantam superstitionem vel affirmare levissimam hanc causam tantae rei vel magis ridiculam quum non dubitem risum potius quum admirationem posteris excitaturam The story was too ridiculous he was ashamed to report it because he thought nobody would believe it It is stupend to relate what strange effects this idolatry and superstition hath brought forth of the latter years in the Indies and those bordering parts six thousand five hundred thirty six in what feral shapes the six thousand five hundred thirty seven devil is adored ne quid mali intentent as they say for in the mountains betwixt Scanderoon and Aleppo at this day there are dwelling a certain kind of people called Coords coming of the race of the ancient Parthians who worship the devil and allege this reason in so doing God is a good man and will do no harm but the devil is bad and must be pleased lest he hurt them It is wonderful to tell how the devil deludes them how he terrifies them how they offer men and women sacrifices unto him a hundred at once as they did infants in Crete to Saturn of old the finest children like Agamemnon s Iphigenia c At six thousand five hundred thirty eight Mexico when the Spaniards first overcame them they daily sacrificed viva hominum corda e viventium corporibus extracta the hearts of men yet living twenty thousand in a year Acosta lib five cap twenty to their idols made of flour and men s blood and every year six thousand infants of both sexes and as prodigious to relate six thousand five hundred thirty nine how they bury their wives with husbands deceased tis fearful to report and harder to believe six thousand five hundred forty Nam certamen habent laethi quae viva sequatur Conjugium pudor est non licuisse mori and burn them alive best goods servants horses when a grandee dies six thousand five hundred forty one twelve thousand at once amongst the Tartar s when a great Cham departs or an emperor in America how they plague themselves which abstain from all that hath life like those old Pythagoreans with immoderate fastings six thousand five hundred forty two as the Bannians about Surat they of China that for superstition s sake never eat flesh nor fish all their lives never marry but live in deserts and by places and some pray to their idols twenty four hours together without any intermission biting of their tongues when they have done for devotion s sake Some again are brought to that madness by their superstitious priests that tell them such vain stories of immortality and the joys of heaven in that other life six thousand five hundred forty three that many thousands voluntarily break their own necks as Cleombrotus Amborciatus auditors of old precipitate themselves that they may participate of that unspeakable happiness in the other world One poisons another strangles himself and the King of China had done as much deluded with the vain hope had he not been detained by his servant But who can sufficiently tell of their several superstitions vexations follies torments I may conclude with six thousand five hundred forty four Possevinus Religifacit asperos mites homines e feris superstitio ex hominibus feras religion makes wild beasts civil superstition makes wise men beasts and fools and the discreetest that are if they give way to it are no better than dizzards nay more if that of Plotinus be true is unus religionis scopus ut ei quem colimus similes fiamus that is the drift of religion to make us like him whom we worship what shall be the end of idolaters but to degenerate into stocks and stones of such as worship these heathen gods for dii gentium daemonia six thousand five hundred forty five but to become devils themselves Tis therefore exitiosus error et maxime periculosus a most perilous and dangerous error of all others as six thousand five hundred forty six Plutarch holds turbulenta passio hominem consternans a pestilent a troublesome passion that utterly undoeth men Unhappy superstition six thousand five hundred forty seven Pliny calls it morte non finitur death takes away life but not superstition Impious and ignorant are far more happy than they which are superstitious no torture like to it none so continuate so general so destructive so violent In this superstitious row Jews for antiquity may go next to Gentiles what of old they have done what idolatries they have committed in their groves and high places what their Pharisees Sadducees Scribes Essei and such sectaries have maintained I will not so much as mention for the present I presume no nation under heaven can be more sottish ignorant blind superstitious wilful obstinate and peevish tiring themselves with vain ceremonies to no purpose he that shall but read their Rabbins ridiculous comments their strange interpretation of scriptures their absurd ceremonies fables childish tales which they steadfastly believe will think they be scarce rational creatures their foolish six thousand five hundred forty eight customs when they rise in the morning and how they prepare themselves to prayer to meat with what superstitious washings how to their Sabbath to their other feasts weddings burials c Last of all the expectation of their Messiah and those figments miracles vain pomp that shall attend him as how he shall terrify the Gentiles and overcome them by new diseases how Michael the archangel shall sound his trumpet how he shall gather all the scattered Jews in the Holy Land and there make them a great banquet six thousand five hundred forty nine Wherein shall be all the birds beasts fishes that ever God made a cup of wine that grew in Paradise and that hath been kept in Adam s cellar ever since At the first course shall be served in that great ox in Job iv ten that every day feeds on a thousand hills Psal one ten that great Leviathan and a great bird that laid an egg so big six thousand five hundred fifty that by chance tumbling out of the nest it knocked down three hundred tall cedars and breaking as it fell drowned one hundred and sixty villages this bird stood up to the knees in the sea and the sea was so deep that a hatchet would not fall to the bottom in seven years of their Messiah s six thousand five hundred fifty one wives and children Adam and Eve c and that one stupend fiction amongst the rest when a Roman prince asked of rabbi Jehosua ben Hanania why the Jews God was compared to a lion he made answer he compared himself to no ordinary lion but to one in the wood Ela which when he desired to see the rabbin prayed to God he might and forthwith the lion set forward six thousand five hundred fifty two But when he was four hundred miles from Rome he so roared that all the great bellied women in Rome made abortions the city walls fell down and when he came a hundred miles nearer and roared the second time their teeth fell out of their heads the emperor himself fell down dead and so the lion went back With an infinite number of such lies and forgeries which they verily believe feed themselves with vain hope and in the mean time will by no persuasions be diverted but still crucify their souls with a company of idle ceremonies live like slaves and vagabonds will not be relieved or reconciled Mahometans are a compound of Gentiles Jews and Christians and so absurd in their ceremonies as if they had taken that which is most sottish out of every one of them full of idle fables in their superstitious law their Alcoran itself a gallimaufry of lies tales ceremonies traditions precepts stolen from other sects and confusedly heaped up to delude a company of rude and barbarous clowns As how birds beasts stones saluted Mahomet when he came from Mecca the moon came down from heaven to visit him six thousand five hundred fifty three how God sent for him spake to him c with a company of stupend figments of the angels sun moon and stars c Of the day of judgment and three sounds to prepare to it which must last fifty thousand years of Paradise which wholly consists in coeundi et comedendi voluptate and pecorinis hominibus scriptum bestialis beatitudo is so ridiculous that Virgil Dante Lucian nor any poet can be more fabulous Their rites and ceremonies are most vain and superstitious wine and swine s flesh are utterly forbidden by their law six thousand five hundred fifty four they must pray five times a day and still towards the south wash before and after all their bodies over with many such For fasting vows religious orders peregrinations they go far beyond any papists six thousand five hundred fifty five they fast a month together many times and must not eat a bit till sun be set Their kalendars dervises and torlachers c are more six thousand five hundred fifty six abstemious some of them than Carthusians Franciscans Anchorites forsake all live solitary fare hard go naked c six thousand five hundred fifty seven Their pilgrimages are as far as to the river six thousand five hundred fifty eight Ganges which the Gentiles of those tracts likewise do to wash themselves for that river as they hold hath a sovereign virtue to purge them of all sins and no man can be saved that hath not been washed in it For which reason they come far and near from the Indies Maximus gentium omnium confluxus est and infinite numbers yearly resort to it Others go as far as Mecca to Mahomet s tomb which journey is both miraculous and meritorious The ceremonies of flinging stones to stone the devil of eating a camel at Cairo by the way their fastings their running till they sweat their long prayers Mahomet s temple tomb and building of it would ask a whole volume to dilate and for their pains taken in this holy pilgrimage all their sins are forgiven and they reputed for so many saints And diverse of them with hot bricks when they return will put out their eyes six thousand five hundred fifty nine that they never after see any profane thing bite out their tongues c They look for their prophet Mahomet as Jews do for their Messiah Read more of their customs rites ceremonies in Lonicerus Turcic hist tom one

ceremonies you shall find in them and which is most to be lamented the people are generally so curious in observing of them that if the least circumstance be omitted they think they shall be damned tis an irremissible offence and can hardly be forgiven I kept in my house amongst my followers saith Busbequius sometime the Turk s orator in Constantinople a Turkey boy that by chance did eat shellfish a meat forbidden by their law but the next day when he knew what he had done he was not only sick to cast and vomit but very much troubled in mind would weep and six thousand five hundred sixty grieve many days after torment himself for his foul offence Another Turk being to drink a cup of wine in his cellar first made a huge noise and filthy faces six thousand five hundred sixty one to warn his soul as he said that it should not be guilty of that foul fact which he was to commit With such toys as these are men kept in awe and so cowed that they dare not resist or offend the least circumstance of their law for conscience sake misled by superstition which no human edict otherwise no force of arms could have enforced In the last place are pseudo Christians in describing of whose superstitious symptoms as a mixture of the rest I may say that which saint Benedict once saw in a vision one devil in the marketplace but ten in a monastery because there was more work in populous cities they would swear and forswear lie falsify deceive fast enough of themselves one devil could circumvent a thousand but in their religious houses a thousand devils could scarce tempt one silly monk All the principal devils I think busy themselves in subverting Christians Jews Gentiles and Mahometans are extra caulem out of the fold and need no such attendance they make no resistance six thousand five hundred sixty two eos enim pulsare negligit quos quieto jure possidere se sentit they are his own already but Christians have that shield of faith sword of the Spirit to resist and must have a great deal of battery before they can be overcome That the devil is most busy amongst us that are of the true church appears by those several oppositions heresies schisms which in all ages he hath raised to subvert it and in that of Rome especially wherein Antichrist himself now sits and plays his prize This mystery of iniquity began to work even in the Apostles time many Antichrists and heretics were abroad many sprung up since many now present and will be to the world s end to dementate men s minds to seduce and captivate their souls Their symptoms I know not how better to express than in that twofold division of such as lead and are led Such as lead are heretics schismatics false prophets impostors and their ministers they have some common symptoms some peculiar Common as madness folly pride insolency arrogancy singularity peevishness obstinacy impudence scorn and contempt of all other sects Nullius addicti jurare in verba magistri six thousand five hundred sixty three they will approve of nought but what they first invent themselves no interpretation good but what their infallible spirit dictates none shall be in secundis no not in tertiis they are only wise only learned in the truth all damned but they and their followers caedem scripturarum faciunt ad materiam suam saith Tertullian they make a slaughter of Scriptures and turn it as a nose of wax to their own ends So irrefragable in the mean time that what they have once said they must and will maintain in whole tomes duplications triplications never yield to death so self conceited say what you can As six thousand five hundred sixty four Bernard erroneously some say speaks of P Aliardus omnes patres sic atque ego sic Though all the Fathers Councils the whole world contradict it they care not they are all one and as six thousand five hundred sixty five Gregory well notes of such as are vertiginous they think all turns round and moves all err when as the error is wholly in their own brains Magallianus the Jesuit in his Comment on one Tim xvi twenty and Alphonsus de castro lib one adversus haereses gives two more eminent notes or probable conjectures to know such men by they might have taken themselves by the noses when they said it six thousand five hundred sixty six First they affect novelties and toys and prefer falsehood before truth six thousand five hundred sixty seven

and by these knaveries and stratagems they were able to involve multitudes to deceive the most sanctified souls and if it were possible the very elect In the mean time the true Church as wine and

they will go into infected houses expel devils and fast forty days as Christ himself did some call God and his attributes into question as Vorstius and Socinus some princes civil magistrates and their authorities as Anabaptists will do all their own private spirit dictates and nothing else Brownists Barrowists Familists and those Amsterdamian sects and sectaries are led all by so many private spirits It is a wonder to reveal what passages Sleidan relates in his Commentaries of Cretinck Knipperdoling and their associates those madmen of Munster in Germany what strange enthusiasms sottish revelations they had how absurdly they carried themselves deluded others and as profane Machiavel in his political disputations holds of Christian religion in general it doth enervate debilitate take away men s spirits and courage from them simpliciores reddit homines breeds nothing so courageous soldiers as that Roman we may say of these peculiar sects their religion takes away not spirits only but wit and judgment and deprives them of their understanding for some of them are so far gone with their private enthusiasms and revelations that they are quite mad out of their wits What greater madness can there be than for a man to take upon him to be a God as some do to be the Holy Ghost Elias and what not In six thousand five hundred eighty six Poland fifteen eighteen in the reign of King Sigismund one said he was Christ and got him twelve apostles came to judge the world and strangely deluded the commons six thousand five hundred eighty seven One David George an illiterate painter not many years since did as much in Holland took upon him to be the Messiah and had many followers Benedictus Victorinus Faventinus consil fifteen writes as much of one Honorius that thought he was not only inspired as a prophet but that he was a God himself and had six thousand five hundred eighty eight familiar conference with God and his angels Lavat de spect c two part eight hath a story of one John Sartorious that thought he was the prophet Elias and cap seven of diverse others that had conference with angels were saints prophets Wierus lib three de Lamiis c seven makes mention of a prophet of Groning that said he was God the Father of an Italian and Spanish prophet that held as much We need not rove so far abroad we have familiar examples at home Hackett that said he was Christ Coppinger and Arthington his disciples six thousand five hundred eighty nine Burchet and Hovatus burned at Norwich We are never likely seven years together without some such new prophets that have several inspirations some to convert the Jews some fast forty days go with Daniel to the lion s den some foretell strange things some for one thing some for another Great precisians of mean conditions and very illiterate most part by a preposterous zeal fasting meditation melancholy are brought into those gross errors and inconveniences Of those men I may conclude generally that howsoever they may seem to be discreet and men of understanding in other matters discourse well laesam habent imaginationem they are like comets round in all places but where they blaze caetera sani they have impregnable wits many of them and discreet otherwise but in this their madness and folly breaks out beyond measure in infinitum erumpit stultitia They are certainly far gone with melancholy if not quite mad and have more need of physic than many a man that keeps his bed more need of hellebore than those that are in Bedlam SUBSECT IV Prognostics of Religious Melancholy You may guess at the prognostics by the symptoms What can these signs fore tell otherwise than folly dotage madness gross ignorance despair obstinacy a reprobate sense six thousand five hundred ninety a bad end What else can superstition heresy produce but wars tumults uproars torture of souls and despair a desolate land as Jeremy teacheth cap vii thirty four when they commit idolatry and walk after their own ways how should it be otherwise with them what can they expect but blasting famine dearth and all the plagues of Egypt as Amos denounceth cap iv vers nine ten to be led into captivity If our hopes be frustrate we sow much and bring in little eat and have not enough drink and are not filled clothe and be not warm c Haggai i six we look for much and it comes to little whence is it His house was waste they came to their own houses vers nine therefore the heaven stayed his dew the earth his fruit Because we are superstitious irreligious we do not serve God as we ought all these plagues and miseries come upon us what can we look for else but mutual wars slaughters fearful ends in this life and in the life to come eternal damnation What is it that hath caused so many feral battles to be fought so much Christian blood shed but superstition That Spanish inquisition racks wheels tortures torments whence do they proceed from superstition Bodine the Frenchman in his six thousand five hundred ninety one method hist accounts Englishmen barbarians for their civil wars but let him read those Pharsalian fields six thousand five hundred ninety two fought of late in France for their religion their massacres wherein by their own relations in twenty four years I know not how many millions have been consumed whole families and cities and he shall find ours to be but velitations to theirs But it hath ever been the custom of heretics and idolaters when they are plagued for their sins and God s just judgments come upon them not to acknowledge any fault in themselves but still impute it unto others In Cyprian s time it was much controverted between him and Demetrius an idolater who should be the cause of those present calamities Demetrius laid all the fault on Christians and so they did ever in the primitive church as appears by the first book of six thousand five hundred ninety three Arnobius six thousand five hundred ninety four that there were not such ordinary showers in winter the ripening heat in summer so seasonable springs fruitful autumns no marble mines in the mountains less gold and silver than of old that husbandmen seamen soldiers all were scanted justice friendship skill in arts all was decayed and that through Christians default and all their other miseries from them quod dii nostri a vobis non colantur because they did not worship their gods But Cyprian retorts all upon him again as appears by his tract against him Tis true the world is miserably tormented and shaken with wars dearth famine fire inundations plagues and many feral diseases rage amongst us sed non ut tu quereris ista accidunt quod dii vestri a nobis non colantur sed quod a vobis non colatur Deus a quibus nec quaeritur nec timetur not as thou complainest that we do not worship your Gods but because you are idolaters and do not serve the true God neither seek him nor fear him as you ought Our papists object as much to us and account us heretics we them the Turks esteem of both as infidels and we them as a company of pagans Jews against all when indeed there is a general fault in us all and something in the very best which may justly deserve God s wrath and pull these miseries upon our heads I will say nothing here of those vain cares torments needless works penance pilgrimages pseudomartyrdom c We heap upon ourselves unnecessary troubles observations we punish our bodies as in Turkey saith six thousand five hundred ninety five Busbequius leg Turcic ep three one did that was much affected with music and to hear boys sing but very superstitious an old sibyl coming to his house or a holy woman as that place yields many took him down for it and told him that in that other world he should suffer for it thereupon he flung his rich and costly instruments which he had bedecked with jewels all at once into the fire He was served in silver plate and had goodly household stuff a little after another religious man reprehended him in like sort and from thenceforth he was served in earthen vessels last of all a decree came forth because Turks might not drink wine themselves that neither Jew nor Christian then living in Constantinople might drink any wine at all In like sort amongst papists fasting at first was generally proposed as a good thing after from such meats at set times and then last of all so rigorously proposed to bind the consciences upon pain of damnation First Friday saith Erasmus then Saturday et nunc periclitatur dies Mercurii and Wednesday now is in danger of a fast six thousand five hundred ninety six And for such like toys some so miserably afflict themselves to despair and death itself rather than offend and think themselves good Christians in it when as indeed they are superstitious Jews So saith Leonardus Fuchsius a great physician in his time six thousand five hundred ninety seven We are tortured in Germany with these popish edicts our bodies so taken down our goods so diminished that if God had not sent Luther a worthy man in time to redress these mischiefs we should have eaten hay with our horses before this six thousand five hundred ninety eight As in fasting so in all other superstitious edicts we crucify one another without a cause barring ourselves of many good and lawful things honest disports pleasures and recreations for wherefore did God create them but for our use Feasts mirth music hawking hunting singing dancing c non tam necessitatibus nostris Deus inservit sed in delicias amamur as Seneca notes God would have it so And as Plato two de legibus gives out Deos laboriosam hominum vitam miseratos the gods in commiseration of human estate sent Apollo Bacchus and the Muses qui cum voluptate tripudia et soltationes nobis ducant to be merry with mortals to sing and dance with us So that he that will not rejoice and enjoy himself making good use of such things as are lawfully permitted non est temperatus as he will sed superstitiosus There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour Eccles ii twenty four And as six thousand five hundred ninety nine one said of hawking and hunting tot solatia in hac aegri orbis calamitate mortalibus taediis deus objecit I say of all honest recreations God hath therefore indulged them to refresh ease solace and comfort us But we are some of us too stern too rigid too precise too grossly superstitious and whilst we make a conscience of every toy with touch not taste not c as those Pythagoreans of old and some Indians now that will eat no flesh or suffer any living creature to be killed the Bannians about Guzzerat we tyrannise over our brother s soul lose the right use of many good gifts honest six thousand six hundred sports games and pleasant recreations six thousand six hundred one punish ourselves without a cause lose our liberties and sometimes our lives Anno twelve seventy at six thousand six hundred two Magdeburg in Germany a Jew fell into a privy upon a Saturday and without help could not possibly get out he called to his fellows for succour but they denied it because it was their Sabbath non licebat opus manuum exercere the bishop hearing of it the next day forbade him to be pulled out because it was our Sunday In the mean time the wretch died before Monday We have myriads of examples in this kind amongst those rigid Sabbatarians and therefore not without good cause six thousand six hundred three Intolerabilem pertubationem Seneca calls it as well he might an intolerable perturbation that causeth such dire events folly madness sickness despair death of body and soul and hell itself SUBSECT V Cure of Religious Melancholy To purge the world of idolatry and superstition will require some monster taming Hercules a divine Aesculapius or Christ himself to come in his own person to reign a thousand years on earth before the end as the Millenaries will have him They are generally so refractory self conceited obstinate so firmly addicted to that religion in which they have been bred and brought up that no persuasion no terror no persecution can divert them The consideration of which hath induced many commonwealths to suffer them to enjoy their consciences as they will themselves a toleration of Jews is in most provinces of Europe In Asia they have their synagogues Spaniards permit Moors to live amongst them the Mogullians Gentiles the Turks all religions In Europe Poland and Amsterdam are the common sanctuaries Some are of opinion that no man ought to be compelled for conscience sake but let him be of what religion he will he may be saved as Cornelius was formerly accepted Jew Turks Anabaptists c If he be an honest man live soberly and civilly in his profession Volkelius Crellius and the rest of the Socinians that now nestle themselves about Krakow and Rakow in Poland have renewed this opinion serve his own God with that fear and reverence as he ought Sua cuique civitati Laeli religio sit nostra nobis Tully thought fit every city should be free in this behalf adore their own Custodes et Topicos Deos tutelar and local gods as Symmachus calls them Isocrates adviseth Demonicus when he came to a strange city to six thousand six hundred four worship by all means the gods of the place et unumquemque Topicum deum sic coli oportere quomodo ipse praeceperit which Cecilius in six thousand six hundred five Minutius labours and would have every nation sacrorum ritus gentiles habere et deos colere municipes keep their own ceremonies worship their peculiar gods which Pomponius Mela reports of the Africans Deos suos patrio more venerantur they worship their own gods according to their own ordination For why should any one nation as he there pleads challenge that universality of God Deum suum quem nec ostendunt nec vident discurrantem silicet et ubique praesentem in omnium mores actus et occultas cogitationes inquirentem c as Christians do let every province enjoy their liberty in this behalf worship one God or all as they will and are informed The Romans built altars Diis Asiae Europae Lybiae diis ignotis et peregrinis others otherwise c Plinius Secundus as appears by his Epistle to Trajan would not have the Christians so persecuted and in some time of the reign of Maximinus as we find it registered in Eusebius lib nine cap nine there was a decree made to this purpose Nullus cogatur invitus ad hunc vel illum deorum cultum let no one be compelled against his will to worship any particular deity and by Constantine in the nineteenth year of his reign as six thousand six hundred six Baronius informeth us Nemo alteri exhibeat molestiam quod cujusque animus vult hoc quisque transigat new gods new lawgivers new priests will have new ceremonies customs and religions to which every wise man as a good formalist should accommodate himself six thousand six hundred seven Saturnus periit perierunt et sua jura Sub Jove nunc mundus jussa sequare Jovis The said Constantine the emperor as Eusebius writes flung down and demolished all the heathen gods silver gold statues altars images and temples and turned them all to Christian churches infestus gentilium monumentis ludibrio exposuit the Turk now converts them again to Mahometan mosques The like edict came forth in the reign of Arcadius and Honorius six thousand six hundred eight Symmachus the orator in his days to procure a general toleration used this argument six thousand six hundred nine Because God is immense and infinite and his nature cannot perfectly be known it is convenient he should be as diversely worshipped as every man shall perceive or understand It was impossible he thought for one religion to be universal you see that one small province can hardly be ruled by one law civil or spiritual and how shall so many distinct and vast empires of the world be united into one It never was never will be Besides if there be infinite planetary and firmamental worlds as six thousand six hundred ten some will there be infinite genii or commanding spirits belonging to each of them and so per consequens for they will be all adored infinite religions And therefore let every territory keep their proper rites and ceremonies as their dii tutelares will so Tyrius calls them and according to the quarter they hold their own institutions revelations orders oracles which they dictate from time to time or teach their own priests or ministers This tenet was stiffly maintained in Turkey not long since as you may read in the third epistle of Busbequius six thousand six hundred eleven that all those should participate of eternal happiness that lived a holy and innocent life what religion soever they professed Rustan Bassa was a great patron of it though Mahomet himself was sent virtute gladdi to enforce all as he writes in his Alcoran to follow him Some again will approve of this for Jews Gentiles infidels that are out of the fold they can be content to give them all respect and favour but by no means to such as are within the precincts of our own church and called Christians to no heretics schismatics or the like let the Spanish inquisition that fourth fury speak of some of them the civil wars and massacres in France our Marian times six thousand six hundred twelve Magillianus the Jesuit will not admit of conference with a heretic but severity and rigour to be used non

is their ordinary practice Another company are as mild on the other side to avoid all heart burning and contentious wars and uproars they would have a general toleration in every kingdom no mulct at all no man for religion or conscience be put to death which six thousand six hundred fifteen Thuanus the French historian much favours our late Socinians defend Vaticanus against Calvin in a large Treatise in behalf of Servetus vindicates Castilio c Martin Ballius and his companions maintained this opinion not long since in France whose error is confuted by Beza in a just volume The medium is best and that which Paul prescribes Gal i If any man shall fall by occasion to restore such a one with the spirit of meekness by all fair means gentle admonitions but if that will not take place Post unam et alteram admonitionem haereticum devita he must be excommunicate as Paul did by Hymenaeus delivered over to Satan Immedicabile vulnus ense recidendum est As Hippocrates said in physic I may well say in divinity Quae ferro non curantur ignis curat For the vulgar restrain them by laws mulcts burn their books forbid their conventicles for when the cause is taken away the effect will soon cease Now for prophets dreamers and such rude silly fellows that through fasting too much meditation preciseness or by melancholy are distempered the best means to reduce them ad sanam mentem is to alter their course of life and with conference threats promises persuasions to intermix physic Hercules de Saxonia had such a prophet committed to his charge in Venice that thought he was Elias and would fast as he did he dressed a fellow in angel s attire that said he came from heaven to bring him divine food and by that means stayed his fast administered his physic so by the meditation of this forged angel he was cured six thousand six hundred sixteen Rhasis an Arabian cont lib one cap nine speaks of a fellow that in like case complained to him and desired his help I asked him saith he what the matter was he replied I am continually meditating of heaven and hell and methinks I see and talk with fiery spirits and smell brimstone c and am so carried away with these conceits that I can neither eat nor sleep nor go about my business I cured him saith Rhasis partly by persuasion partly by physic and so have I done by many others We have frequently such prophets and dreamers amongst us

Jovius relates of Mahomet the Second that sacked Constantinople he so behaved himself that he believed neither Christ nor Mahomet and thence it came to pass that he kept his word and promise no farther than for his advantage neither did he care to commit any offence to satisfy his lust I could say the like of many princes many private men our stories are full of them in times past this present age that love fear obey and perform all civil duties as they shall find them expedient or behoveful to their own ends Securi adversus Deos securi adversus homines votis non est opus which six thousand six hundred thirty three Tacitus reports of some Germans they need not pray fear hope for they are secure to their thinking both from Gods and men Bulco Opiliensis sometime Duke of six thousand six hundred thirty four Silesia was such a one to a hair he lived saith six thousand six hundred thirty five Aeneas Sylvius at six thousand six hundred thirty six Vratislavia and was so mad to satisfy his lust that he believed neither heaven nor hell or that the soul was immortal but married wives and turned them up as he thought fit did murder and mischief and what he list himself This duke hath too many followers in our days say what you can dehort exhort persuade to the contrary they are no more moved quam si dura silex aut stet Marpesia cautes than so many stocks and stones tell them of heaven and hell tis to no purpose laterem lavas they answer as Ataliba that Indian prince did friar Vincent six thousand six hundred thirty seven when he brought him a book and told him all the mysteries of salvation heaven and hell were contained in it he looked upon it and said he saw no such matter asking withal how he knew it they will but scoff at it or wholly reject it Petronius in Tacitus when he was now by Nero s command bleeding to death audiebat amicos nihil referentes de immortalitate animae aut sapientum placitis sed levia carmina et faciles versus instead of good counsel and divine meditations he made his friends sing him bawdy verses and scurrilous songs Let them take heaven paradise and that future happiness that will bonum est esse hic it is good being here there is no talking to such no hope of their conversion they are in a reprobate sense mere carnalists fleshly minded men which howsoever they may be applauded in this life by some few parasites and held for worldly wise men six thousand six hundred thirty eight They seem to me saith Melancthon to be as mad as Hercules was when he raved and killed his wife and children A milder sort of these atheistical spirits there are that profess religion but timide et haesitanter tempted thereunto out of that horrible consideration of diversity of religions which are and have been in the world which argument Campanella Atheismi Triumphati cap nine both urgeth and answers besides the covetousness imposture and knavery of priests quae faciunt as six thousand six hundred thirty nine Postellus observes ut rebus sacris minus faciant fidem and those religions some of them so fantastical exorbitant so violently maintained with equal constancy and assurance whence they infer that if there be so many religious sects and denied by the rest why may they not be all false or why should this or that be preferred before the rest The sceptics urge this and amongst others it is the conclusion of Sextus Empericus lib three advers Mathematicos after many philosophical arguments and reasons pro and con that there are gods and again that there are no gods he so concludes cum tot inter se pugnent c Una tantum potest esse vera as Tully likewise disputes Christians say they alone worship the true God pity all other sects lament their case and yet those old Greeks and Romans that worshipped the devil as the Chinese now do aut deos topicos their own gods as Julian the apostate six thousand six hundred forty Cecilius in Minutius Celsus and Porphyrius the philosopher object and as Machiavel contends were much more noble generous victorious had a more flourishing commonwealth better cities better soldiers better scholars better wits Their gods overcame our gods did as many miracles c Saint Cyril Arnobius Minutius with many other ancients of late Lessius Morneus Grotius de Verit Relig Christianae Savanarola de Verit Fidei Christianae well defend but Zanchius six thousand six hundred forty one Campanella Marinus Marcennus Bozius and Gentillettus answer all these atheistical arguments at large But this again troubles many as of old wicked men generally thrive professed atheists thrive six thousand six hundred forty two Nullos esse Deos inane coelum Affirmat Selius probatque quod se Factum dum negat haec videt beatum There are no gods heavens are toys Selius in public justifies Because that whilst he thus denies Their deities he better thrives This is a prime argument and most part your most sincere upright honest and six thousand six hundred forty three good men are depressed The race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong Eccles ix eleven nor yet bread to the wise favour nor riches to men of understanding but time and chance comes to all There was a great plague in Athens as Thucydides lib two relates in which at last every man with great licentiousness did what he list not caring at all for God s or men s laws Neither the fear of God nor laws of men saith he awed any man because the plague swept all away alike good and bad they thence concluded it was alike to worship or not worship the gods since they perished all alike Some cavil and make doubts of scripture itself it cannot stand with God s mercy that so many should be damned so many bad so few good such have and hold about religions all stiff on their side factious alike thrive alike and yet bitterly persecuting and damning each other It cannot stand with God s goodness protection and providence as six thousand six hundred forty four Saint Chrysostom in the Dialect of such discontented persons to see and suffer one man to be lame another mad a third poor and miserable all the days of his life a fourth grievously tormented with sickness and aches to his last hour Are these signs and works of God s providence to let one man be deaf another dumb A poor honest fellow lives in disgrace woe and want wretched he is when as a wicked caitiff abounds in superfluity of wealth keeps whores parasites and what he will himself Audis Jupiter haec Talia multa connectentes longum reprehensionis sermonem erga Dei providentiam contexunt six thousand six hundred forty five Thus they mutter and object see the rest of their arguments in Marcennus in Genesin and in Campanella amply confuted with many such vain cavils well known not worthy the recapitulation or answering whatsoever they pretend they are interim of little or no religion Cousin germans to these men are many of our great philosophers and deists who though they be more temperate in this life give many good moral precepts honest upright and sober in their conversation yet in effect they are the same accounting no man a good scholar that is not an atheist nimis altum sapiunt too much learning makes them mad Whilst they attribute all to natural causes six thousand six hundred forty six contingence of all things as Melancthon calls them Pertinax hominum genus a peevish generation of men that misled by philosophy and the devil s suggestion their own innate blindness deny God as much as the rest hold all religion a fiction opposite to reason and philosophy though for fear of magistrates saith six thousand six hundred forty seven Vaninus they durst not publicly profess it Ask one of them of what religion he is he scoffingly replies a philosopher a Galenist an six thousand six hundred forty eight Averroist and with Rabelais a physician a peripatetic an epicure In spiritual things God must demonstrate all to sense leave a pawn with them or else seek some other creditor They will acknowledge Nature and Fortune yet not God though in effect they grant both for as Scaliger defines Nature signifies God s ordinary power or as Calvin writes Nature is God s order and so things extraordinary may be called unnatural Fortune his unrevealed will and so we call things changeable that are beside reason and expectation To this purpose six thousand six hundred forty nine Minutius in Octavio and six thousand six hundred fifty Seneca well discourseth with them lib four de beneficiis cap five six seven They do not understand what they say what is Nature but God call him what thou wilt Nature Jupiter he hath as many names as offices it comes all to one pass God is the fountain of all the first Giver and Preserver from whom all things depend six thousand six hundred fifty one a quo et per quem omnia Nam quocunque vides Deus est quocunque moveris God is all in all God is everywhere in every place And yet this Seneca that could confute and blame them is all out as much to be blamed and confuted himself as mad himself for he holds fatum Stoicum that inevitable Necessity in the other extreme as those Chaldean astrologers of old did against whom the prophet Jeremiah so often thunders and those heathen mathematicians Nigidius Figulus magicians and Priscilianists whom saint Austin so eagerly confutes those Arabian questionaries Novem Judices Albumazer Dorotheus c and our countryman six thousand six hundred fifty two Estuidus that take upon them to define out of those great conjunction of stars with Ptolomeus the periods of kingdoms or religions of all future accidents wars plagues schisms heresies and what not all from stars and such things saith Maginus Quae sibi et intelligentiis suis reservavit Deus which God hath reserved to himself and his angels they will take upon them to foretell as if stars were immediate inevitable causes of all future accidents Caesar Vaninus in his book de admirandis naturae Arcanis dial fifty two de oraculis is more free copious and open in this explication of this astrological tenet of Ptolemy than any of our modern writers Cardan excepted a true disciple of his master Pomponatius according to the doctrine of Peripatetics he refers all apparitions prodigies miracles oracles accidents alterations of religions kingdoms c for which he is soundly lashed by Marinus Mercennus as well he deserves to natural causes for spirits he will not acknowledge to that light motion influences of heavens and stars and to the intelligences that move the orbs Intelligentia quae movet orbem mediante coelo c Intelligences do all and after a long discourse of miracles done of old si haec daemones possint cur non et intelligentiae coelorum motrices And as these great conjunctions aspects of planets begin or end vary are vertical and predominant so have religions rites ceremonies and kingdoms their beginning progress periods in urbibus regibus religionibus ac in particularibus hominibus haec vera ac manifesta sunt ut Aristoteles innuere videtur et quotidiana docet experientia ut historias perlegens videbit quid olim in Gentili lege Jove sanctius et illustrius quid nunc vile magis et execrandum Ita coelestia corpora pro mortalium beneficio religiones aedificant et cum cessat influxus cessat lex six thousand six hundred fifty three c And because according to their tenets the world is eternal intelligences eternal influences of stars eternal kingdoms religions alterations shall be likewise eternal and run round after many ages Atque iterum ad Troiam magnus mittetur Achilles renascentur religiones et ceremoniae res humanae in idem recident nihil nunc quod non olim fuit et post saeculorum revolutiones alias est erit six thousand six hundred fifty four c idem specie saith Vaninus non individuo quod Plato significavit These saith mine six thousand six hundred fifty five author these are the decrees of Peripatetics which though I recite in obsequium Christianae fidei detestor as I am a Christian I detest and hate Thus Peripatetics and astrologians held in former times and to this effect of old in Rome saith Dionysius Halicarnassus lib seven when those meteors and prodigies appeared in the air after the banishment of Coriolanus six thousand six hundred fifty six Men were diversely affected some said they were God s just judgments for the execution of that good man some referred all to natural causes some to stars some thought they came by chance some by necessity decreed ab initio and could not be altered The two last opinions of necessity and chance were it seems of greater note than the rest six thousand six hundred fifty seven Sunt qui in Fortunae jam casibus omnia ponunt Et mundum credunt nullo rectore moveri Natura volvente vices c For the first of chance as six thousand six hundred fifty eight Sallust likewise informeth us those old Romans generally received They supposed fortune alone gave kingdoms and empires wealth honours offices and that for two causes first because every wicked base unworthy wretch was preferred rich potent c secondly because of their uncertainty though never so good scarce any one enjoyed them long but after they began upon better advice to think otherwise that every man made his own fortune The last of Necessity was Seneca s tenet that God was alligatus causis secundis so tied to second causes to that inexorable Necessity that he could alter nothing of that which was once decreed sic erat in fatis it cannot be altered semel jussit semper paret Deus nulla vis rumpit nullae preces nec ipsum fulmen God hath once said it and it must for ever stand good no prayers no threats nor power nor thunder itself can alter it Zeno Chrysippus and those other Stoics as you may read in Tully two de divinatione Gellius lib six cap two c maintained as much In all ages there have been such that either deny God in all or in part some deride him they could have made a better world and ruled it more orderly themselves blaspheme him derogate at their pleasure from him Twas so in six thousand six hundred fifty nine Plato s time Some say there be no gods others that they care not for men a middle sort grant both Si non sit Deus unde mala si sit Deus unde mala So Cotta argues in Tully why made he not all good or at least tenders not the welfare of such as are good As the woman told Alexander if he be not at leisure to hear causes and redress them why doth he reign six thousand six hundred sixty Sextus Empericus hath many such arguments Thus perverse men cavil So it will ever be some of all sorts good bad indifferent true false zealous ambidexters neutralists lukewarm libertines atheists c They will see these religious sectaries agree amongst themselves be reconciled all before they will participate with or believe any they think in the meantime which six thousand six hundred sixty one Celsus objects and whom Origen confutes We Christians adore a person put to six thousand six hundred sixty two death with no more reason than the barbarous Getes worshipped Zamolxis the Cilicians Mopsus the Thebans Amphiaraus and the Lebadians Trophonius one religion is as true as another new fangled devices all for human respects great witted Aristotle s works are as much authentical to them as Scriptures subtle Seneca s Epistles as canonical as saint Paul s Pindarus Odes as good as the Prophet David s Psalms Epictetus Enchiridion equivalent to wise Solomon s Proverbs They do openly and boldly speak this and more some of them in all places and companies six thousand six hundred sixty three Claudius the emperor was angry with Heaven because it thundered and challenged Jupiter into the field with what madness saith Seneca he thought Jupiter could not hurt him but he could hurt Jupiter Diagoras Demonax Epicurus Pliny Lucian Lucretius Contemptorque Deum Mezentius professed atheists all in their times though not simple atheists neither as Cicogna proves lib one cap one they scoffed only at those Pagan gods their plurality base and fictitious offices Gilbertus Cognatus labours much and so doth Erasmus to vindicate Lucian from scandal and there be those that apologise for Epicurus but all in vain Lucian scoffs at all Epicurus he denies all and Lucretius his scholar defends him in it six thousand six hundred sixty four Humana ante oculua foede cum vita jaceret In terris oppressa gravi cum religione Quae caput a

Greg Nazianzen in disput adversus Eun Theodoret lib five de curat graec affec Origen lib de principiis Pomponatius justifies in his Tract so styled at least De immortalitate Animae Scaliger who would

infelix Brunus six thousand six hundred sixty seven Kepler calls him Machiavel Caesar Vaninus lately burned at Toulouse in France and Pet Aretine have publicly maintained such atheistical paradoxes six thousand six hundred sixty eight with that Italian Boccaccio with his fable of three rings c ex quo infert haud posse internosci quae sit verior religio Judaica Mahometana an Christiana quoniam eadem signa c from which he infers that it cannot be distinguished which is the true religion Judaism Mahommedanism or Christianity c six thousand six hundred sixty nine Marinus Mercennus suspects Cardan for his subtleties Campanella and Charron s Book of Wisdom with some other Tracts to savour of six thousand six hundred seventy atheism but amongst the rest that pestilent book de tribus mundi impostoribus quem sine horrore inquit non legas et mundi Cymbalum dialogis quatuor contentum anno fifteen thirty eight auctore Peresio Parisiis excusum six thousand six hundred seventy one c And as there have been in all ages such blasphemous spirits so there have not been wanting their patrons protectors disciples and adherents Never so many atheists in Italy and Germany saith six thousand six hundred seventy two Colerus as in this age the like complaint Mercennus makes in France fifty thousand in that one city of Paris Frederic the Emperor as six thousand six hundred seventy three Matthew Paris records licet non sit recitabile I use his own words is reported to have said Tres praestigiatores Moses Christus et Mahomet uti mundo dominarentur totum populum sibi contemporaneum se duxisse Henry the Landgrave of Hesse heard him speak it Si principes imperii institutioni meae adhaererent ego multo meliorem modum credendi et vivendi ordinarem To these professed atheists we may well add that impious and carnal crew of worldly minded men impenitent sinners that go to hell in a lethargy or in a dream who though they be professed Christians yet they will nulla pallescere culpa make a conscience of nothing they do they have cauterised consciences and are indeed in a reprobate sense past all feeling have given themselves over to wantonness to work all manner of uncleanness even with greediness Ephes iv nineteen They do know there is a God a day of judgment to come and yet for all that as Hugo saith ita comedunt ac dormiunt ac si diem judicii evasissent ita ludunt ac rident ac si in coelis cum Deo regnarent they are as merry for all the sorrow as if they had escaped all dangers and were in heaven already six thousand six hundred seventy four Metus omnes et inexorabile fatum Subjecit pedibus strepitumque Acherontis avari Those rude idiots and ignorant persons that neglect and contemn the means of their salvation may march on with these but above all others those Herodian temporizing statesmen political Machiavellians and hypocrites that make a show of religion but in their hearts laugh at it Simulata sanctitas duplex iniquitas they are in a double fault that fashion themselves to this world which six thousand six hundred seventy five Paul forbids and like Mercury the planet are good with good bad with bad When they are at Rome they do there as they see done puritans with puritans papists with papists omnium horarum homines formalists ambidexters lukewarm Laodiceans six thousand six hundred seventy six All their study is to please and their god is their commodity their labour to satisfy their lusts and their endeavours to their own ends Whatsoever they pretend or in public seem to do six thousand six hundred seventy seven With the fool in their hearts they say there is no God Heus tu de Jove quid sentis Hulloa what is your opinion about a Jupiter Their words are as soft as oil but bitterness is in their hearts like six thousand six hundred seventy eight Alexander VI so cunning dissemblers that what they think they never speak Many of them are so close you can hardly discern it or take any just exceptions at them they are not factious oppressors as most are no bribers no simoniacal contractors no such ambitious lascivious persons as some others are no drunkards sobrii solem vident orientem sobrii vident occidentem they rise sober and go sober to bed plain dealing upright honest men they do wrong to no man and are so reputed in the world s esteem at least very zealous in religion very charitable meek humble peace makers keep all duties very devout honest well spoken of beloved of all men but he that knows better how to judge he that examines the heart saith they are hypocrites Cor dolo plenum sonant vitium percussa maligne they are not sound within As it is with writers six thousand six hundred seventy nine oftentimes Plus sanctimoniae in libello quam libelli auctore more holiness is in the book than in the author of it so tis with them many come to church with great Bibles whom Cardan said he could not choose but laugh at and will now and then dare operam Augustino read Austin frequent sermons and yet professed usurers mere gripes tota vitae ratio epicurea est all their life is epicurism and atheism come to church all day and lie with a courtesan at night Qui curios simulant et Bacchanalia vivunt they have Esau s hands and Jacob s voice yea and many of those holy friars sanctified men Cappam saith Hierom et cilicium induunt sed intus latronem tegunt They are wolves in sheep s clothing Introrsum turpes speciosi pelle decora Fair without and most foul within six thousand six hundred eighty Latet plerumque sub tristi amictu lascivia et deformis horror vili veste tegitur ofttimes under a mourning weed lies lust itself and horrible vices under a poor coat But who can examine all those kinds of hypocrites or dive into their hearts f we may guess at the tree by the fruit never so many as in these days show me a plain dealing true honest man Et pudor et probitas et timor omnis abest He that shall but look into their lives and see such enormous vices men so immoderate in lust unspeakable in malice furious in their rage flattering and dissembling all for their own ends will surely think they are not truly religious but of an obdurate heart most part in a reprobate sense as in this age But let them carry it as they will for the present dissemble as they can a time will come when they shall be called to an account their melancholy is at hand they pull a plague and curse upon their own heads thesaurisant iram Dei Besides all such as are in deos contumeliosi blaspheme contemn neglect God or scoff at him as the poets feign of Salmoneus that would in derision imitate Jupiter s thunder he was precipitated for his pains Jupiter intonuit contra c so shall they certainly rue it in the end six thousand six hundred eighty one in se spuit qui in coelum spuit their doom s at hand and hell is ready to receive them Some are of opinion that it is in vain to dispute with such atheistical spirits in the meantime tis not the best way to reclaim them Atheism idolatry heresy hypocrisy though they have one common root that is indulgence to corrupt affection yet their growth is different they have divers symptoms occasions and must have several cures and remedies Tis true some deny there is any God some confess yet believe it not a third sort confess and believe but will not live after his laws worship and obey him others allow God and gods subordinate but not one God no such general God non talem deum but several topic gods for several places and those not to persecute one another for any difference as Socinus will but rather love and cherish To describe them in particular to produce their arguments and reasons would require a just volume I refer them therefore that expect a more ample satisfaction to those subtle and elaborate treatises devout and famous tracts of our learned divines schoolmen amongst the rest and casuists that have abundance of reasons to prove there is a God the immortality of the soul c out of the strength of wit and philosophy bring irrefragable arguments to such as are ingenuous and well disposed at the least answer all cavils and objections to confute their folly and madness and to reduce them si fieri posset ad sanam mentem to a better mind though to small purpose many times Amongst others consult with Julius Caesar Lagalla professor of philosophy in Rome who hath written a large volume of late to confute atheists of the immortality of the soul Hierom Montanus de immortalitate Animae Lelius Vincentius of the same subject Thomas Giaminus and Franciscus Collius de Paganorum animabus post mortem a famous doctor of the Ambrosian College in Milan Bishop Fotherby in his Atheomastix Doctor Dove Doctor Jackson Abernethy Corderoy have written well of this subject in our mother tongue in Latin Colerus Zanchius Palearius Illyricus six thousand six hundred eighty two Philippus Faber Faventinus c But instar omnium the most copious confuter of atheists is Marinus Mercennus in his Commentaries on Genesis six thousand six hundred eighty three with Campanella s Atheismus Triumphatus He sets down at large the causes of this brutish passion seventeen in number I take it answers all their arguments and sophisms which he reduceth to twenty six heads proving withal his own assertion There is a God such a God the true and sole God by thirty five reasons His Colophon is how to resist and repress atheism and to that purpose he adds four especial means or ways which who so will may profitably peruse SUBSECT II Despair Despairs Equivocations Definitions Parties and Parts affected There be many kinds of desperation whereof some be holy some unholy as six thousand six hundred eighty four one distinguisheth that unholy he defines out of Tully to be Aegritudinem animi sine ulla rerum expectatione meliore a sickness of the soul without any hope or expectation of amendment which commonly succeeds fear for whilst evil is expected we fear but when it is certain we despair According to Thomas two twoae distinct forty art four it is Recessus a re desiderata propter impossibilitatem existimatam a restraint from the thing desired for some impossibility supposed Because they cannot obtain what they would they become desperate and many times either yield to the passion by death itself or else attempt impossibilities not to be performed by men In some cases this desperate humour is not much to be discommended as in wars it is a cause many times of extraordinary valour as Joseph lib one de bello Jud cap fourteen L Danaeus in Aphoris polit pag two hundred twenty six and many politicians hold It makes them improve their worth beyond itself and of a forlorn impotent company become conquerors in a moment Una salus victis nullam sperare salutem the only hope for the conquered is despair In such courses when they see no remedy but that they must either kill or be killed they take courage and oftentimes praeter spem beyond all hope vindicate themselves Fifteen thousand Locrenses fought against a hundred thousand Crotonienses and seeing now no way but one they must all die six thousand six hundred eighty five thought they would not depart unrevenged and thereupon desperately giving an assault conquered their enemies Nec alia causa victoriae saith Justin mine author quam quod desperaverant William the Conqueror when he first landed in England sent back his ships that his soldiers might have no hope of retiring back six thousand six hundred eighty six Bodine excuseth his countrymen s overthrow at that famous battle at Agincourt in Henry the Fifth his time cui simile saith Froissard tota historia producere non possit which no history can parallel almost wherein one handful of Englishmen overthrew a royal army of Frenchmen with this refuge of despair pauci desperati a few desperate fellows being compassed in by their enemies past all hope of life fought like so many devils and gives a caution that no soldiers hereafter set upon desperate persons which six thousand six hundred eighty seven after Frontinus and Vigetius Guicciardini likewise admonisheth Hypomnes part two pag twenty five not to stop an enemy that is going his way Many such kinds there are of desperation when men are past hope of obtaining any suit or in despair of better fortune Desperatio facit monachum as the saying is and desperation causeth death itself how many thousands in such distress have made away themselves and many others For he that cares not for his own is master of another man s life A Tuscan soothsayer as six thousand six hundred eighty eight Paterculus tells the story perceiving himself and Fulvius Flaccus his dear friend now both carried to prison by Opimius and in despair of pardon seeing the young man weep quin tu potius hoc inquit facis do as I do and with that knocked out his brains against the door cheek as he was entering into prison protinusque illiso capite in capite in carceris januam effuso cerebro expiravit and so desperate died But these are equivocal improper When I speak of despair saith six thousand six hundred eighty nine Zanchie I speak not of every kind but of that alone which concerns God It is opposite to hope and a most pernicious sin wherewith the devil seeks to entrap men Musculus makes four kinds of desperation of God ourselves our neighbour or anything to be done but this division of his may be reduced easily to the former all kinds are opposite to hope that sweet moderator of passions as Simonides calls it I do not mean that vain hope which fantastical fellows feign to themselves which according to Aristotle is insomnium vigilantium a waking dream but this divine hope which proceeds from confidence and is an anchor to a floating soul spes alit agricolas even in our temporal affairs hope revives us but in spiritual it farther animateth and were it not for hope we of all others were the most miserable as Paul saith in this life were it not for hope the heart would break for though they be punished in the sight of men Wisdom iii four yet is their hope full of immortality yet doth it not so rear as despair doth deject this violent and sour passion of despair is of all perturbations most grievous as six thousand six hundred ninety Patritius holds Some divide it into final and temporal six thousand six hundred ninety one final is incurable which befalleth reprobates temporal is a rejection of hope and comfort for a time which may befall the best of God s children and it commonly proceeds six thousand six hundred ninety two from weakness of faith as in David when he was oppressed he cried out O Lord thou hast forsaken me but this for a time This ebbs and flows with hope and fear it is a grievous sin howsoever although some kind of despair be not amiss when saith Zanchius we despair of our own means and rely wholly upon God but that species is not here meant This pernicious kind of desperation is the subject of our discourse homicida animae the murderer of the soul as Austin terms it a fearful passion wherein the party oppressed thinks he can get no ease but by death and is fully resolved to offer violence unto himself so sensible of his burthen and impatient of his cross that he hopes by death alone to be freed of his calamity though it prove otherwise and chooseth with Job vi eight nine xvii five Rather to be strangled and die than to be in his bonds six thousand six hundred ninety three The part affected is the whole soul and all the faculties of it there is a privation of joy hope trust confidence of present and future good and in their place succeed fear sorrow c as in the symptoms shall be shown The heart is grieved the conscience wounded the mind eclipsed with black fumes arising from those perpetual terrors SUBSECT III Causes of Despair the Devil Melancholy Meditation Distrust Weakness of Faith Rigid Ministers Misunderstanding Scriptures Guilty Consciences c The principal agent and procurer of this mischief is the devil those whom God forsakes the devil by his permission lays hold on Sometimes he persecutes them with that worm of conscience as he did Judas six thousand six hundred ninety four Saul and others The poets call it Nemesis but it is indeed God s just judgment sero sed serio he strikes home at last and setteth upon them as a thief in the night one Thes ii six thousand six hundred ninety five This temporary passion made David cry out Lord rebuke me not in thine anger neither chasten me in thine heavy displeasure for thine arrows have light upon me c there is nothing sound in my flesh because of thine anger Again I roar for the very grief of my heart and Psalm xxii My God my God why hast thou forsaken me and art so far from my health and the words of my crying I am like to water poured out my bones are out of joint mine heart is like wax that is molten in the midst of my bowels So Psalm lxxxviii fifteen and sixteen vers and Psalm cii I am in misery at the point of death from my youth I suffer thy terrors doubting for my life thine indignations have gone over me and thy fear hath cut me off Job doth often complain in this kind and those God doth not assist the devil is ready to try and torment still seeking whom he may devour If he find them merry saith Gregory he tempts them forthwith to some dissolute act if pensive and sad to a desperate end Aut suadendo blanditur aut minando terret sometimes by fair means sometimes again by foul as he perceives men severally inclined His ordinary engine by which he produceth this effect is the melancholy humour itself which is balneum diaboli the devil s bath and as in Saul those evil spirits get in six thousand six hundred ninety six as it were and take possession of us Black choler is a shoeing horn a bait to allure them insomuch that many writers make melancholy an ordinary cause and a symptom of despair for that such men are most apt by reason of their ill disposed temper to distrust fear grief mistake and amplify whatsoever they preposterously conceive or falsely apprehend Conscientia scrupulosa nascitur ex vitio naturali complexione melancholica saith Navarrus cap twenty seven num two hundred eighty two tom two cas conscien The body works upon the mind by obfuscating the spirits and corrupted instruments which six thousand six hundred ninety seven Perkins illustrates by simile of an artificer that hath a bad tool his skill is good ability correspondent by reason of ill tools his work must needs be lame and imperfect But melancholy and despair though often do not always concur there is much difference melancholy fears without a cause this upon great occasion melancholy is caused by fear and grief but this torment procures them and all extremity of bitterness much melancholy is without affliction of conscience as six thousand six hundred ninety eight Bright and Perkins illustrate by four reasons and yet melancholy alone may be sometimes a sufficient cause of this terror of conscience six thousand six hundred ninety nine Felix Plater so found it in his observations e melancholicis alii damnatos se putant Deo curae non sunt nec praedestinati c They think they are not predestinate God hath forsaken them and yet otherwise very zealous and religious and tis common to be seen melancholy for fear of God s judgment and hell fire drives men to desperation fear and sorrow if they be immoderate end often with it Intolerable pain and anguish long sickness captivity misery loss of goods loss of friends and those lesser griefs do sometimes effect it or such dismal accidents Si non statim relevantur six thousand seven hundred Mercennus dubitant an sit Deus if they be not eased forthwith they doubt whether there be any God they rave curse and are desperately mad because good men are oppressed wicked men flourish they have not as they think to their desert and through impatience of calamities are so misaffected Democritus put out his eyes ne malorum civium prosperos videret successus because he could not abide to see wicked men prosper and was therefore ready to make away himself as six thousand seven hundred one Agellius writes of him Felix Plater hath a memorable example in this kind of a painter s wife in Basil that was melancholy for her son s death and for melancholy became desperate she thought God would not pardon her sins six thousand seven hundred two and for four months still raved that she was in hell fire already damned When the humour is stirred up every small object aggravates and incenseth it as the parties are addicted six thousand seven hundred three The same author hath an example of a merchant man that for the loss of a little wheat which he had over long kept was troubled in conscience for that he had not sold it sooner or given it to the poor yet a good scholar and a great divine no persuasion would serve to the contrary but that for this fact he was damned in other matters Very judicious and discreet Solitariness much fasting divine meditation and contemplations of God s judgments most part accompany this melancholy and are main causes as six thousand seven hundred four Navarrus holds to converse with such kinds of persons so troubled is sufficient occasion of trouble to some men Nonnulli ob longas inedias studia et meditationes coelestes de rebus sacris et religione semper agitant c Many saith P Forestus through long fasting serious meditations of heavenly things fall into such fits and as Lemnius adds lib four cap twenty one six thousand seven hundred five If they be solitary given superstitious precise or very devout seldom shall you find a merchant a soldier an innkeeper a bawd a host a usurer so troubled in mind they have cheverel consciences that will stretch they are seldom moved in this kind or molested young men and middle age are more wild and less apprehensive but old folks most part such as are timorous and religiously given Pet Forestus observat lib ten cap twelve de morbis cerebri hath a fearful example of a minister that through precise fasting in Lent and overmuch meditation contracted this mischief and in the end became desperate thought he saw devils in his chamber and that he could not be saved he smelled nothing as he said but fire and brimstone was already in hell and would ask them still if they did not six thousand seven hundred six smell as much I told him he was melancholy but he laughed me to scorn and replied that he saw devils talked with them in good earnest Would spit in my face and ask me if one did not smell brimstone but at last he was by him cured Such another story I find in Plater observat lib one A poor fellow had done some foul offence and for fourteen days would eat no meat in the end became desperate the divines about him could not ease him six thousand seven hundred seven but so he died Continual meditation of God s judgments troubles many Multi ob timorem futuri judicii saith Guatinerius cap five tract fifteen et suspicionem desperabundi sunt David himself complains that God s judgments terrified his soul Psalm cxix part sixteen vers eight My flesh trembleth for fear of thee and I am afraid of thy judgments Quoties diem illum cogito saith six thousand seven hundred eight Hierome toto corpore contremisco I tremble as often as I think of it The terrible meditation of hell fire and eternal punishment much torments a sinful silly soul What s a thousand years to eternity Ubi moeror ubi fletus ubi dolor sempiternus Mors sine morte finis sine fine a finger burnt by chance we may not endure the pain is so grievous we may not abide an hour a night is intolerable and what shall this unspeakable fire then be that burns for ever innumerable infinite millions of years in omne aevum in aeternum O eternity six thousand seven hundred nine Aeternitas est illa vox Vox illa fulminatrix Tonitruis minacior Fragoribusque coeli Aeternitas est illa vox meta carens et orta c Tormenta nulla territant Quae finiuntur annis Aeternitas aeternitas Versat coquilque pectus Auget haec poenas indies Centuplicatque flammas c This meditation terrifies these poor distressed souls especially if their bodies be predisposed by melancholy they religiously given and have tender consciences every small object affrights them the very inconsiderate reading of Scripture itself and misinterpretation of some places of it as Many are called few are chosen Not every one that saith Lord Fear not little flock He that stands let him take heed lest he fall Work out your salvation with fear and trembling That night two shall be in a bed one received the other left Strait is the way that leads to heaven and few there are that enter therein The parable of the seed and of the sower some fell on barren ground some was choked Whom he hath predestinated he hath chosen He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy Non est volentis nec currentis sed miserentis Dei These and the like places terrify the souls of many election predestination reprobation preposterously conceived offend divers with a deal of foolish presumption curiosity needless speculation contemplation solicitude wherein they trouble and puzzle themselves about those questions of grace free will perseverance God s secrets they will know more than is revealed of God in his word human capacity or ignorance can apprehend and too importunate inquiry after that which is revealed mysteries ceremonies observation of Sabbaths laws duties c with many such which the casuists discuss and schoolmen broach which divers mistake misconstrue misapply to themselves to their own undoing and so fall into this gulf They doubt of their election how they shall know it by what signs And so far forth saith Luther with such nice points torture and crucify themselves that they are almost mad and all they get by it is this they lay open a gap to the devil by desperation to carry them to hell but the greatest harm of all proceeds from those thundering ministers a most frequent cause they are of this malady six thousand seven hundred ten and do more harm in the church saith Erasmus than they that flatter great danger on both sides the one lulls them asleep in carnal security the other drives them to despair Whereas six thousand seven hundred eleven saint Bernard well adviseth We should not meddle with the one without the other nor speak of judgment without mercy the one alone brings desperation the other security But these men are wholly for judgment of a rigid disposition themselves there is no mercy with them no salvation no balsam for their diseased souls they can speak of nothing but reprobation hell fire and damnation as they did Luke xi forty six lade men with burdens grievous to be borne which they themselves touch not with a finger Tis familiar with our papists to terrify men s souls with purgatory tales visions apparitions to daunt even the most generous spirits to six thousand seven hundred twelve require charity as Brentius observes of others bounty meekness love patience when they themselves breathe nought but lust envy covetousness They teach others to fast give alms do penance and crucify their mind with superstitious observations bread and water hair clothes whips and the like when they themselves have all the dainties the world can afford lie on a down bed with a courtesan in their arms Heu quantum patimur pro Christo as six thousand seven hundred thirteen he said what a cruel tyranny is this so to insult over and terrify men s souls Our indiscreet pastors many of them come not far behind whilst in their ordinary sermons they speak so much of election predestination reprobation ab aeterno subtraction of grace preterition voluntary permission c by what signs and tokens they shall discern and try themselves whether they be God s true children elect an sint reprobi praedestinati c with such scrupulous points they still aggravate sin thunder out God s judgments without respect intempestively rail at and pronounce them damned in all auditories for giving so much to sports and honest recreations making every small fault and thing indifferent an irremissible offence they so rent tear and wound men s consciences that they are almost mad and at their wits end These bitter potions saith six thousand seven hundred fourteen Erasmus are still in their mouths nothing but gall and horror and a mad noise they make all their auditors desperate many are wounded by this means and they commonly that are most devout and precise have been formerly presumptuous and certain of their salvation they that have tender consciences that follow sermons frequent lectures that have indeed least cause they are most apt to mistake and fall into these miseries I have heard some complain of Parson s Resolution and other books of like nature good otherwise they are too tragical too much dejecting men aggravating offences great care and choice much discretion is required in this kind The last and greatest cause of this malady is our own conscience sense of our sins and God s anger justly deserved a guilty conscience for some foul offence formerly committed six thousand seven hundred fifteen O miser Oreste quid morbi te perdit Or Conscientia Sum enim mihi conscius de malis perpetratis six thousand seven hundred sixteen A good conscience is a continual feast but a galled conscience is as great a torment as can possibly happen a still baking oven so Pierius in his Hieroglyph compares it another hell Our conscience which is a great ledger book wherein are written all our offences a register to lay them up which those six thousand seven hundred seventeen Egyptians in their hieroglyphics expressed by a mill as well for the continuance as for the torture of it grinds our souls with the remembrance of some precedent sins makes us reflect upon accuse and condemn our own selves six thousand seven hundred eighteen Sin lies at door c I know there be many other causes assigned by Zanchius six thousand seven hundred nineteen Musculus and the rest as incredulity infidelity presumption ignorance blindness ingratitude discontent those five grand miseries in Aristotle ignominy need sickness enmity death c but this of conscience is the greatest six thousand seven hundred twenty Instar ulceris corpus jugiter percellens The scrupulous conscience as six thousand seven hundred twenty one Peter Forestus calls it which tortures so many that either out of a deep apprehension of their unworthiness and consideration of their own dissolute life accuse themselves and aggravate every small offence when there is no such cause misdoubting in the meantime God s mercies they fall into these inconveniences The poet calls them six thousand seven hundred twenty two furies dire but it is the conscience alone which is a thousand witnesses to accuse us six thousand seven hundred twenty three Nocte dieque suum gestant in pectore testem A continual tester to give in evidence to empanel a jury to examine us to cry guilty a persecutor with hue and cry to follow an apparitor to summon us a bailiff to carry us a serjeant to arrest an attorney to plead against us a gaoler to torment a judge to condemn still accusing denouncing torturing and molesting And as the statue of Juno in that holy city near Euphrates in six thousand seven hundred twenty four Assyria will look still towards you sit where you will in her temple she stares full upon you if you go by she follows with her eye in all sites places conventicles actions our conscience will be still ready to accuse us After many pleasant days and fortunate adventures merry tides this conscience at last doth arrest us Well he may escape temporal punishment six thousand seven hundred twenty five bribe a corrupt judge and avoid the censure of law and flourish for a time for six thousand seven hundred twenty six who ever saw saith Chrysostom a covetous man troubled in mind when he is telling of his money an adulterer mourn with his mistress in his arms we are then drunk with pleasure and perceive nothing yet as the prodigal son had dainty fare sweet music at first merry company jovial entertainment but a cruel reckoning in the end as bitter as wormwood a fearful visitation commonly follows And the devil that then told thee that it was a light sin or no sin at all now aggravates on the other side and telleth thee that it is a most irremissible offence as he did by Cain and Judas to bring them to despair every small circumstance before neglected and contemned will now amplify itself rise up in judgment and accuse the dust of their shoes dumb creatures as to Lucian s tyrant lectus et candela the bed and candle did bear witness to torment their souls for their sins past Tragical examples in this kind are too familiar and common Adrian Galba Nero Otho Vitellius Caracalla were in such horror of conscience for their offences committed murders rapes extortions injuries that they were weary of their lives and could get nobody to kill them six thousand seven hundred twenty seven Kennetus King of Scotland when he had murdered his nephew Malcom King Duffe s son Prince of Cumberland and with counterfeit tears and protestations dissembled the matter a long time six thousand seven hundred twenty eight at last his conscience accused him his unquiet soul could not rest day or night he was terrified with fearful dreams visions and so miserably tormented all his life It is strange to read what six thousand seven hundred twenty nine Cominaeus hath written of Louis XI that French King of Charles VIII of Alphonsus King of Naples in the fury of his passion how he came into Sicily and what pranks he played Guicciardini a man most unapt to believe lies relates how that Ferdinand his father s ghost who before had died for grief came and told him that he could not resist the French King he thought every man cried France France the reason of it saith Cominseus was because he was a vile tyrant a murderer an oppressor of his subjects he bought up all commodities and sold them at his own price sold abbeys to Jews and Falkoners both Ferdinand his father and he himself never made conscience of any committed sin and to conclude saith he it was impossible to do worse than they did Why was Pausanias the Spartan tyrant Nero Otho Galba so persecuted with spirits in every house they came but for their murders which they had committed six thousand seven hundred thirty Why doth the devil haunt many men s houses after their deaths appear to them living and take possession of their habitations as it were of their palaces but because of their several villainies Why had Richard the Third such fearful dreams saith Polydore but for his frequent murders Why was Herod so tortured in his mind because he had made away Mariamne his wife Why was Theodoric the King of the Goths so suspicious and so affrighted with a fish head alone but that he had murdered Symmachus and Boethius his son in law those worthy Romans Caelius lib twenty seven cap twenty two See more in Plutarch in his tract De his qui sero a Numine puniuntur and in his book De tranquillitate animi c Yea and sometimes GOD himself hath a hand in it to show his power humiliate exercise and to try their faith divine temptation Perkins calls it Cas cons lib one cap eight sect one to punish them for their sins God the avenger as six thousand seven hundred thirty one David terms him ultor a tergo Deus his wrath is apprehended of a guilty soul as by Saul and Judas which the poets expressed by Adrastia or Nemesis six thousand seven hundred thirty two Assequitur Nemesique virum vestigia servat Ne male quid facias And she is as six thousand seven hundred thirty three Ammianus lib fourteen describes her the queen of causes and moderator of things now she pulls down the proud now she rears and encourageth those that are good he gives instance in his Eusebius Nicephorus lib ten cap thirty five eccles hist in Maximinus and Julian Fearful examples of God s just judgment wrath and vengeance are to be found in all histories of some that have been eaten to death with rats and mice as six thousand seven hundred thirty four Popelius the second King of Poland ann eight hundred thirty his wife and children the like story is of Hatto Archbishop of Mentz ann nine hundred sixty nine so devoured by these vermin which howsoever Serrarius the Jesuit Mogunt rerum lib four cap five impugn by twenty two arguments Tritemius six thousand seven hundred thirty five Munster Magdeburgenses and many others relate for a truth Such another example I find in Geraldus Cambrensis Itin Cam lib two cap two and where not And yet for all these terrors of conscience affrighting punishments which are so frequent or whatsoever else may cause or aggravate this fearful malady in other religions I see no reason at all why a papist at any time should despair or be troubled for his sins for let him be never so dissolute a caitiff so notorious a villain so monstrous a sinner out of that treasure of indulgences and merits of which the pope is dispensator he may have free pardon and plenary remission of all his sins There be so many general pardons for ages to come forty thousand years to come so many jubilees so frequent gaol deliveries out of purgatory for all souls now living or after dissolution of the body so many particular masses daily said in several churches so many altars consecrated to this purpose that if a man have either money or friends or will take any pains to come to such an altar hear a mass say so many paternosters undergo such and such penance he cannot do amiss it is impossible his mind should be troubled or he have any scruple to molest him Besides that Taxa Camerae Apostolicae which was first published to get money in the days of Leo Decimus that sharking pope and since divulged to the same ends sets down such easy rates and dispensations for all offences for perjury murder incest adultery c for so many grosses or dollars able to invite any man to sin and provoke him to offend methinks that otherwise would not such comfortable remission so gentle and parable a pardon so ready at hand with so small cost and suit obtained that I cannot see how he that hath any friends amongst them as I say or money in his purse or will at least to ease himself can any way miscarry or be misaffected how he should be desperate in danger of damnation or troubled in mind Their ghostly fathers can so readily apply remedies so cunningly string and unstring wind and unwind their devotions play upon their consciences with plausible speeches and terrible threats for their best advantage settle and remove erect with such facility and deject let in and out that I cannot perceive how any man amongst them should much or often labour of this disease or finally miscarry The causes above named must more frequently therefore take hold in others SUBSECT IV Symptoms of Despair Fear Sorrow Suspicion Anxiety Horror of Conscience Fearful Dreams and Visions As shoemakers do when they bring home shoes still cry leather is dearer and dearer may I justly say of those melancholy symptoms these of despair are most violent tragical and grievous far beyond the rest not to be expressed but negatively as it is privation of all happiness not to be endured for a wounded spirit who can bear it Prov xviii nineteen What therefore six thousand seven hundred thirty six Timanthes did in his picture of Iphigenia now ready to be sacrificed when he had painted Chalcas mourning Ulysses sad but most sorrowful Menelaus and showed all his art in expressing a variety of affections he covered the maid s father Agamemnon s head with a veil and left it to every spectator to conceive what he would himself for that true passion and sorrow in summo gradu such as his was could not by any art be deciphered What he did in his picture I will do in describing the symptoms of despair imagine what thou canst fear sorrow furies grief pain terror anger dismal ghastly tedious irksome c it is not sufficient it comes far short no tongue can tell no heart conceive it Tis an epitome of hell an extract a quintessence a compound a mixture of all feral maladies tyrannical tortures plagues and perplexities There is no sickness almost but physic provideth a remedy for it to every sore chirurgery will provide a slave friendship helps poverty hope of liberty easeth imprisonment suit and favour revoke banishment authority and time wear away reproach but what physic what chirurgery what wealth favour authority can relieve bear out assuage or expel a troubled conscience A quiet mind cureth all them but all they cannot comfort a distressed soul who can put to silence the voice of desperation All that is single in other melancholy Horribile dirum pestilens atrox ferum concur in this it is more than melancholy in the highest degree a burning fever of the soul so mad saith six thousand seven hundred thirty seven Jacchinus by this misery fear sorrow and despair he puts for ordinary symptoms of melancholy They are in great pain and horror of mind distraction of soul restless full of continual fears cares torments anxieties they can neither eat drink nor sleep for them take no rest six thousand seven hundred thirty eight Perpetua impietas nec mensae tempore cessat Exagitat vesana quies somnique furentes Neither at bed nor yet at board Will any rest despair afford Fear takes away their content and dries the blood wasteth the marrow alters their countenance even in their greatest delights singing dancing dalliance they are still saith six thousand seven hundred thirty nine Lemnius tortured in their souls It consumes them to nought I am like a pelican in the wilderness saith David of himself temporally afflicted an owl because of thine indignation Psalm cii eight ten and Psalm lv four My heart trembleth within me and the terrors of death have come upon me fear and trembling are come upon me c at death s door Psalm cvii eighteen Their soul abhors all manner of meats Their six thousand seven hundred forty sleep is if it be any unquiet subject to fearful dreams and terrors Peter in his bonds slept secure for he knew God protected him and Tully makes it an argument of Roscius Amerinus innocency that he killed not his father because he so securely slept Those martyrs in the primitive church were most six thousand seven hundred forty one cheerful and merry in the midst of their persecutions but it is far otherwise with these men tossed in a sea and that continually without rest or intermission they can think of nought that is pleasant six thousand seven hundred forty two their conscience will not let them be quiet in perpetual fear anxiety if they be not yet apprehended they are in doubt still they shall be ready to betray themselves as Cain did he thinks every man will kill him and roar for the grief of heart Psalm xxxviii eight as David did as Job did xx three twenty one twenty two c Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery and life to them that have heavy hearts which long for death and if it come not search it more than treasures and rejoice when they can find the grave They are generally weary of their lives a trembling heart they have a sorrowful mind and little or no rest Terror ubique tremor timor undique et undique terror Fears terrors and affrights in all places at all times and seasons Cibum et potum pertinaciter aversantur multi nodum in scirpo quaeritantes et culpam imaginantes ubi nulla est as Wierus writes de Lamiis lib three c seven they refuse many of them meat and drink cannot rest aggravating still and supposing grievous offences where there are none God s heavy wrath is kindled in their souls and notwithstanding their continual prayers and supplications to Christ Jesus they have no release or ease at all but a most intolerable torment and insufferable anguish of conscience and that makes them through impatience to murmur against God many times to rave to blaspheme turn atheists and seek to offer violence to themselves Deut xxviii sixty five sixty eight In the morning they wish for evening and for morning in the evening for the sight of their eyes which they see and fear of hearts six thousand seven hundred forty three Marinus Mercennus in his comment on Genesis makes mention of a desperate friend of his whom amongst others he came to visit and exhort to patience that broke out into most blasphemous atheistical speeches too fearful to relate when they wished him to trust in God Quis est ille Deus inquit ut serviam illi quid proderit si oraverim si praesens est cur non succurrit cur non me carcere inertia squalore confectum liberat quid ego feci c absit a me hujusmodi Deus Another of his acquaintance broke out into like atheistical blasphemies upon his wife s death raved cursed said and did he cared not what And so for the most part it is with them all many of them in their extremity think they hear and see visions outcries confer with devils that they are tormented possessed and in hell fire already damned quite forsaken of God they have no sense or feeling of mercy or grace hope of salvation their sentence of condemnation is already past and not to be revoked the devil will certainly have them Never was any living creature in such torment before in such a miserable estate in such distress of mind no hope no faith past cure reprobate continually tempted to make away themselves Something talks with them they spit fire and brimstone they cannot but blaspheme they cannot repent believe or think a good thought so far carried ut cogantur ad impia cogitandum etiam contra voluntatem said six thousand seven hundred forty four Felix Plater ad blasphemiam erga deum ad multa horrenda perpetranda ad manus violentas sibi inferendas c and in their distracted fits and desperate humours to offer violence to others their familiar and dear friends sometimes or to mere strangers upon very small or no occasion for he that cares not for his own is master of another man s life They think evil against their wills that which they abhor themselves they must needs think do and speak He gives instance in a patient of his that when he would pray had such evil thoughts still suggested to him and wicked six thousand seven hundred forty five meditations Another instance he hath of a woman that was often tempted to curse God to blaspheme and kill herself Sometimes the devil as they say stands without and talks with them sometimes he is within them as they think and there speaks and talks as to such as are possessed so Apollodorus in Plutarch thought his heart spake within him There is a most memorable example of six thousand seven hundred forty six Francis Spira an advocate of Padua Ann fifteen forty five that being desperate by no counsel of learned men could be comforted he felt as he said the pains of hell in his soul in all other things he discoursed aright but in this most mad Frismelica Bullovat and some other excellent physicians could neither make him eat drink or sleep no persuasion could ease him Never pleaded any man so well for himself as this man did against himself and so he desperately died Springer a lawyer hath written his life Cardinal Crescence died so likewise desperate at Verona still he thought a black dog followed him to his death bed no man could drive the dog away Sleiden com twenty three cap lib three Whilst I was writing this Treatise saith Montaltus cap two de mel six thousand seven hundred forty seven A nun came to me for help well for all other matters but troubled in conscience for five years last past she is almost mad and not able to resist thinks she hath offended God and is certainly damned Felix Plater hath store of instances of such as thought themselves damned six thousand seven hundred forty eight forsaken of God c One amongst the rest that durst not go to church or come near the Rhine for fear to make away himself because then he was most especially tempted These and such like symptoms are intended and remitted as the malady itself is more or less some will hear good counsel some will not some desire help some reject all and will not be eased SUBSECT V Prognostics of Despair Atheism Blasphemy violent death c Most part these kind of persons make six thousand seven hundred forty nine away themselves some are mad blaspheme curse deny God but most offer violence to their own persons and sometimes to others A wounded spirit who can bear Prov xviii fourteen As Cain Saul Achitophel Judas blasphemed and died Bede saith Pilate died desperate eight years after Christ six thousand seven hundred fifty Felix Plater hath collected many examples six thousand seven hundred fifty one A merchant s wife that was long troubled with such temptations in the night rose from her bed and out of the window broke her neck into the street another drowned himself desperate as he was in the Rhine some cut their throats many hang themselves But this needs no illustration It is controverted by some whether a man so offering violence to himself dying desperate may be saved ay or no If they die so obstinately and suddenly that they cannot so much as wish for mercy the worst is to be suspected because they die impenitent six thousand seven hundred fifty two If their death had been a little more lingering wherein they might have some leisure in their hearts to cry for mercy charity may judge the best divers have been recovered out of the very act of hanging and drowning themselves and so brought ad sanam mentem they have been very penitent much abhorred their former act confessed that they have repented in an instant and cried for mercy in their hearts If a man put desperate hands upon himself by occasion of madness or melancholy if he have given testimony before of his regeneration in regard he doth this not so much out of his will as ex vi morbi we must make the best construction of it as six thousand seven hundred fifty three Turks do that think all fools and madmen go directly to heaven SUBSECT VI Cure of Despair by Physic Good Counsel Comforts c Experience teacheth us that though many die obstinate and wilful in this malady yet multitudes again are able to resist and overcome seek for help and find comfort are taken e faucibus Erebi from the chops of hell and out of the devil s paws though they have by six thousand seven hundred fifty four obligation given themselves to him Some out of their own strength and God s assistance Though He kill me saith Job yet will I trust in Him out of good counsel advice and physic six thousand seven hundred fifty five Bellovacus cured a monk by altering his habit and course of life Plater many by physic alone But for the most part they must concur and they take a wrong course that think to overcome this feral passion by sole physic and they are as much out that think to work this effect by good service alone though both be forcible in themselves yet vis unita fortior they must go hand in hand to this disease alterius sic altera poscit opem For physic the like course is to be taken with this as in other melancholy diet air exercise all those passions and perturbations of the mind c are to be rectified by the same means They must not be left solitary or to themselves never idle never out of company Counsel good comfort is to be applied as they shall see the parties inclined or to the causes whether it be loss fear be grief discontent or some such feral accident a guilty conscience or otherwise by frequent meditation too grievous an apprehension and consideration of his former life by hearing reading of Scriptures good divines good advice and conference applying God s word to their distressed souls it must be corrected and counterpoised Many excellent exhortations phraenetical discourses are extant to this purpose for such as are any way troubled in mind Perkins Greenham Hayward Bright Abernethy Bolton Culmannus Helmingius Caelius Secundus Nicholas Laurentius are copious on this subject Azorius Navarrus Sayrus c and such as have written cases of conscience amongst our pontifical writers But because these men s works are not to all parties at hand so parable at all times I will for the benefit and ease of such as are afflicted at the request of some six thousand seven hundred fifty six friends recollect out of their voluminous treatises some few such comfortable speeches exhortations arguments advice tending to this subject and out of God s word knowing as Culmannus saith upon the like occasion six thousand seven hundred fifty seven how unavailable and vain men s councils are to comfort an afflicted conscience except God s word concur and be annexed from which comes life ease repentance c Presupposing first that which Beza Greenham Perkins Bolton give in charge the parties to whom counsel is given be sufficiently prepared humbled for their sins fit for comfort confessed tried how they are more or less afflicted how they stand affected or capable of good advice before any remedies be applied to such therefore as are so thoroughly searched and examined I address this following discourse Two main antidotes six thousand seven hundred fifty eight Hemmingius observes opposite to despair good hope out of God s word to be embraced perverse security and presumption from the devil s treachery to be rejected Illa solus animae haec pestis one saves the other kills occidit animam saith Austin and doth as much harm as despair itself six thousand seven hundred fifty nine Navarrus the casuist reckons up ten special cures out of Anton one part Tit three cap ten one God two Physic three six thousand seven hundred sixty Avoiding such objects as have caused it four Submission of himself to other men s judgments five Answer of all objections c All which Cajetan Gerson lib de vit spirit Sayrus lib one cons cap fourteen repeat and approve out of Emanuel Roderiques cap fifty one et fifty two Greenham prescribes six special rules Culmannus seven First to acknowledge all help come from God two That the cause of their present misery is sin three To repent and be heartily sorry for their sins four To pray earnestly to God they may be eased five To expect and implore the prayers of the church and good men s advice six Physic seven To commend themselves to God and rely upon His mercy others otherwise but all to this effect But forasmuch as most men in this malady are spiritually sick void of reason almost overborne by their miseries and too deep an apprehension of their sins they cannot apply themselves to good counsel pray believe repent we must as much as in us lies occur and help their peculiar infirmities according to their several causes and symptoms as we shall find them distressed and complain The main matter which terrifies and torments most that are troubled in mind is the enormity of their offences the intolerable burthen of their sins God s heavy wrath and displeasure so deeply apprehended that they account themselves reprobates quite forsaken of God already damned past all hope of grace incapable of mercy diaboli mancipia slaves of sin and their offences so great they cannot be forgiven But these men must know there is no sin so heinous which is not pardonable in itself no crime so great but by God s mercy it may be forgiven Where sin aboundeth grace aboundeth much more Rom v twenty And what the Lord said unto Paul in his extremity two Cor xi nine My grace is sufficient for thee for my power is made perfect through weakness concerns every man in like case His promises are made indefinite to all believers generally spoken to all touching remission of sins that are truly penitent grieved for their offences and desire to be reconciled Matt ix twelve thirteen I came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance that is such as are truly touched in conscience for their sins Again Matt xi twenty eight Come unto me all ye that are heavy laden and I will ease you Ezek xviii twenty seven At what time soever a sinner shall repent him of his sins from the bottom of his heart I will blot out all his wickedness out of my remembrance saith the Lord Isaiah xliii twenty five I even I am He that put away thine iniquity for mine own sake and will not remember thy sins As a father saith David Psal ciii thirteen hath compassion on his children so hath the Lord compassion on them that fear him And will receive them again as the prodigal son was entertained Luke xv if they shall so come with tears in their eyes and a penitent heart Peccator agnoscat Deus ignoscit The Lord is full of compassion and mercy slow to anger of great kindness Psal ciii eight He will not always chide neither keep His anger for ever nine As high as the heaven is above the earth so great is His mercy towards them that fear Him eleven As far as the East is from the West so far hath He removed our sins from us twelve Though Cain cry out in the anguish of his soul my punishment is greater than I can bear tis not so thou liest Cain saith Austin God s mercy is greater than thy sins His mercy is above all His works Psal cxlv nine able to satisfy for all men s sins antilutron one Tim ii six His mercy is a panacea a balsam for an afflicted soul a sovereign medicine an alexipharmacum for all sins a charm for the devil his mercy was great to Solomon to Manasseh to Peter great to all offenders and whosoever thou art it may be so to thee For why should God bid us pray as Austin infers Deliver us from all evil nisi ipse misericors perseveraret if He did not intend to help us He therefore that six thousand seven hundred sixty one doubts of the remission of his sins denies God s mercy and doth Him injury saith Austin Yea but thou repliest I am a notorious sinner mine offences are not so great as infinite Hear Fulgentius six thousand seven hundred sixty two God s invincible goodness cannot be overcome by sin His infinite mercy cannot be terminated by any the multitude of His mercy is equivalent to His magnitude Hear six thousand seven hundred sixty three Chrysostom Thy malice may be measured but God s mercy cannot be defined thy malice is circumscribed His mercies infinite As a drop of water is to the sea so are thy misdeeds to His mercy nay there is no such proportion to be given for the sea though great yet may be measured but God s mercy cannot be circumscribed Whatsoever thy sins be then in quantity or quality multitude or magnitude fear them not distrust not I speak not this saith six thousand seven hundred sixty four Chrysostom to make thee secure and negligent but to cheer thee up Yea but thou urgest again I have little comfort of this which is said it concerns me not Inanis poenitentia quam sequens culpa coinquinat tis to no purpose for me to repent and to do worse than ever I did before to persevere in sin and to return to my lusts as a dog to his vomit or a swine to the mire six thousand seven hundred sixty five to what end is it to ask forgiveness of my sins and yet daily to sin again and again to do evil out of a habit I daily and hourly offend in thought word and deed in a relapse by mine own weakness and wilfulness my bonus genius my good protecting angel is gone I am fallen from that I was or would be worse and worse my latter end is worse than my beginning Si quotidiae peccas quotidie saith Chrysostom poenitentiam age if thou daily offend daily repent six thousand seven hundred sixty six if twice thrice a hundred a hundred thousand times twice thrice a hundred thousand times repent As they do by an old house that is out of repair still mend some part or other so do by thy soul still reform some vice repair it by repentance call to Him for grace and thou shalt have it For we are freely justified by His grace Rom iii twenty four If thine enemy repent as our Saviour enjoined Peter forgive him seventy seven times and why shouldst thou think God will not forgive thee Why should the enormity of thy sins trouble thee God can do it he will do it My conscience saith six thousand seven hundred sixty seven Anselm dictates to me that I deserve damnation my repentance will not suffice for satisfaction but thy mercy O Lord quite overcometh all my transgressions The gods once as the poets feign with a gold chain would pull Jupiter out of heaven but all they together could not stir him and yet he could draw and turn them as he would himself maugre all the force and fury of these infernal fiends and crying sins His grace is sufficient Confer the debt and the payment Christ and Adam sin and the cure of it the disease and the medicine confer the sick man to his physician and thou shalt soon perceive that his power is infinitely beyond it God is better able as six thousand seven hundred sixty eight Bernard informeth us to help than sin to do us hurt Christ is better able to save than the devil to destroy six thousand seven hundred sixty nine If he be a skilful Physician as Fulgentius adds he can cure all diseases if merciful he will Non est perfecta bonitas a qua non omnis malitia vincitur His goodness is not absolute and perfect if it be not able to overcome all malice Submit thyself unto Him as saint Austin adviseth six thousand seven hundred seventy He knoweth best what he doth and be not so much pleased when he sustains thee as patient when he corrects thee he is omnipotent and can cure all diseases when he sees his own time He looks down from heaven upon earth that he may hear the mourning of prisoners and deliver the children of death Psal cii nineteen twenty And though our sins be as red as scarlet He can make them as white as snow Isai i eighteen Doubt not of this or ask how it shall be done He is all sufficient that promiseth qui fecit mundum de immundo saith Chrysostom he that made a fair world of nought can do this and much more for his part do thou only believe trust in him rely on him be penitent and heartily sorry for thy sins Repentance is a sovereign remedy for all sins a spiritual wing to rear us a charm for our miseries a protecting amulet to expel sin s venom an attractive loadstone to draw God s mercy and graces unto us six thousand seven hundred seventy one Peccatum vulnus poenitentia medicinam sin made the breach repentance must help it howsoever thine offence came by error sloth obstinacy ignorance exitur per poenitentiam this is the sole means to be relieved six thousand seven hundred seventy two Hence comes our hope of safety by this alone sinners are saved God is provoked to mercy This unlooseth all that is bound enlighteneth darkness mends that is broken puts life to that which was desperately dying makes no respect of offences or of persons six thousand seven hundred seventy three This doth not repel a fornicator reject a drunkard resist a proud fellow turn away an idolater but entertains all communicates itself to all Who persecuted the church more than Paul offended more than Peter and yet by repentance saith Curysologus they got both Magisterium et ministerium sanctitatis the Magistery of holiness The prodigal son went far but by repentance he came home at last six thousand seven hundred seventy four This alone will turn a wolf into a sheep make a publican a preacher turn a thorn into an olive make a debauched fellow religious a blasphemer sing halleluja make Alexander the coppersmith truly devout make a devil a saint six thousand seven hundred seventy five And him that polluted his mouth with calumnies lying swearing and filthy tunes and tones to purge his throat with divine Psalms Repentance will effect prodigious cures make a stupend metamorphosis A hawk came into the ark and went out again a hawk a lion came in went out a lion a bear a bear a wolf a wolf but if a hawk came into this sacred temple of repentance he will go forth a dove saith six thousand seven hundred seventy six Chrysostom a wolf go out a sheep a lion a lamb six thousand seven hundred seventy seven This gives sight to the blind legs to the lame cures all diseases confers grace expels vice inserts virtue comforts and fortifies the soul Shall I say let thy sin be what it will do but repent it is sufficient six thousand seven hundred seventy eight Quem poenitet peccasse pene est innocens Tis true indeed and all sufficient this they do confess if they could repent but they are obdurate they have cauterised consciences they are in a reprobate sense they cannot think a good thought they cannot hope for grace pray believe repent or be sorry for their sins they find no grief for sin in themselves but rather a delight no groaning of spirit but are carried headlong to their own destruction heaping wrath to themselves against the day of wrath Rom ii five Tis a grievous case this I do yield and yet not to be despaired God of his bounty and mercy calls all to repentance Rom ii four thou mayst be called at length restored taken to His grace as the thief upon the cross at the last hour as Mary Magdalene and many other sinners have been that were buried in sin God saith six thousand seven hundred seventy nine Fulgentius is delighted in the conversion of a sinner he sets no time prolixitas temporis Deo non praejudicat aut gravitas peccati deferring of time or grievousness of sin do not prejudicate his grace things past and to come are all one to Him as present tis never too late to repent six thousand seven hundred eighty This heaven of repentance is still open for all distressed souls and howsoever as yet no signs appear thou mayst repent in good time Hear a comfortable speech of saint Austin six thousand seven hundred eighty one Whatsoever thou shall do how great a sinner soever thou art yet living if God would not help thee he would surely take thee away but in sparing thy life he gives thee leisure and invites thee to repentance Howsoever as yet I say thou perceivest no fruit no feeling findest no likelihood of it in thyself patiently abide the Lord s good leisure despair not or think thou art a reprobate He came to call sinners to repentance Luke v thirty two of which number thou art one He came to call thee and in his time will surely call thee And although as yet thou hast no inclination to pray to repent thy faith be cold and dead and thou wholly averse from all Divine functions yet it may revive as trees are dead in winter but flourish in the spring these virtues may lie hid in thee for the present yet hereafter show themselves and peradventure already bud howsoever thou dost not perceive Tis Satan s policy to plead against suppress and aggravate to conceal those sparks of faith in thee Thou dost not believe thou sayest yet thou wouldst believe if thou couldst tis thy desire to believe then pray six thousand seven hundred eighty two Lord help mine unbelief and hereafter thou shall certainly believe six thousand seven hundred eighty three Dabitur sitienti it shall be given to him that thirsteth Thou canst not yet repent hereafter thou shall a black cloud of sin as yet obnubilates thy soul terrifies thy conscience but this cloud may conceive a rainbow at the last and be quite dissipated by repentance Be of good cheer a child is rational in power not in act and so art thou penitent in affection though not yet in action Tis thy desire to please God to be heartily sorry comfort thyself no time is overpast tis never too late A desire to repent is repentance itself though not in nature yet in God s acceptance a willing mind is sufficient Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness Matt v six He that is destitute of God s grace and wisheth for it shall have it The Lord saith David Psal x seventeen will hear the desire of the poor that is such as are in distress of body and mind Tis true thou canst not as yet grieve for thy sin thou hast no feeling of faith I yield yet canst thou grieve thou dost not grieve It troubles thee I am sure thine heart should be so impenitent and hard thou wouldst have it otherwise tis thy desire to grieve to repent and to believe Thou lovest God s children and saints in the meantime hatest them not persecutest them not but rather wishest thyself a true professor to be as they are as thou thyself hast been heretofore which is an evident token thou art in no such desperate case Tis a good sign of thy conversion thy sins are pardonable thou art or shalt surely be reconciled The Lord is near them that are of a contrite heart Luke iv eighteen six thousand seven hundred eighty four A true desire of mercy in the want of mercy is mercy itself a desire of grace in the want of grace is grace itself a constant and earnest desire to believe repent and to be reconciled to God if it be in a touched heart is an acceptation of God a reconciliation faith and repentance itself For it is not thy faith and repentance as six thousand seven hundred eighty five Chrysostom truly teacheth that is available but God s mercy that is annexed to it He accepts the will for the deed so that I conclude to feel in ourselves the want of grace and to be grieved for it is grace itself I am troubled with fear my sins are not forgiven Careless objects but Bradford answers they are For God hath given thee a penitent and believing heart that is a heart which desireth to repent and believe for such an one is taken of him he accepting the will for the deed for a truly penitent and believing heart All this is true thou repliest but yet it concerns not thee tis verified in ordinary offenders in common sins but thine are of a higher strain even against the Holy Ghost himself irremissible sins sins of the first magnitude written with a pen of iron engraven with a point of a diamond Thou art worse than a pagan infidel Jew or Turk for thou art an apostate and more thou hast voluntarily blasphemed renounced God and all religion thou art worse than Judas himself or they that crucified Christ for they did offend out of ignorance but thou hast thought in thine heart there is no God Thou hast given thy soul to the devil as witches and conjurors do explicite and implicite by compact band and obligation a desperate a fearful case to satisfy thy lust or to be revenged of thine enemies thou didst never pray come to church hear read or do any divine duties with any devotion but for formality and fashion s sake with a kind of reluctance twas troublesome and painful to thee to perform any such thing praeter voluntatem against thy will Thou never mad saint any conscience of lying swearing bearing false witness murder adultery bribery oppression theft drunkenness idolatry but hast ever done all duties for fear of punishment as they were most advantageous and to thine own ends and committed all such notorious sins with an extraordinary delight hating that thou shouldst love and loving that thou shouldst hate Instead of faith fear and love of God repentance c blasphemous thoughts have been ever harboured in his mind even against God himself the blessed Trinity the six thousand seven hundred eighty six Scripture false rude harsh immethodical heaven hell resurrection mere toys and fables six thousand seven hundred eighty seven incredible impossible absurd vain ill contrived religion policy and human invention to keep men in obedience or for profit invented by priests and lawgivers to that purpose If there be any such supreme power he takes no notice of our doings hears not our prayers regardeth them not will not cannot help or else he is partial an excepter of persons author of sin a cruel a destructive God to create our souls and destinate them to eternal damnation to make us worse than our dogs and horses why doth he not govern things better protect good men root out wicked livers why do they prosper and flourish as she raved in the six thousand seven hundred eighty eight tragedy pellices caelum tenent there they shine Suasque Perseus aureas stellas habet where is his providence how appears it six thousand seven hundred eighty nine Marmoreo Licinus tumulo jacet at Cato parvo Pomponius nullo quis putet esse Deos Why doth he suffer Turks to overcome Christians the enemy to triumph over his church paganism to domineer in all places as it doth heresies to multiply such enormities to be committed and so many such bloody wars murders massacres plagues feral diseases why doth he not make us all good able sound why makes he six thousand seven hundred ninety venomous creatures rocks sands deserts this earth itself the muck hill of the world a prison a house of correction six thousand seven hundred ninety one Mentimur regnare Jovem c with many such horrible and execrable conceits not fit to be uttered Terribilia de fide horribilia de Divinitate They cannot some of them but think evil they are compelled volentes nolentes to blaspheme especially when they come to church and pray read c such foul and prodigious suggestions come into their hearts These are abominable unspeakable offences and most opposite to God tentationes foedae et impiae yet in this case he or they that shall be tempted and so affected must know that no man living is free from such thoughts in part or at some times the most divine spirits have been so tempted in some sort evil custom omission of holy exercises ill company idleness solitariness melancholy or depraved nature and the devil is still ready to corrupt trouble and divert our souls to suggest such blasphemous thoughts into our fantasies ungodly profane monstrous and wicked conceits If they come from Satan they are more speedy fearful and violent the parties cannot avoid them they are more frequent I say and monstrous when they come for the devil he is a spirit and hath means and opportunities to mingle himself with our spirits and sometimes more slyly sometimes more abruptly and openly to suggest such devilish thoughts into our hearts he insults and domineers in melancholy distempered fantasies and persons especially melancholy is balneum diaboli as Serapio holds the devil s bath and invites him to come to it As a sick man frets raves in his fits speaks and doth he knows not what the devil violently compels such crazed souls to think such damned thoughts against their wills they cannot but do it sometimes more continuate or by fits he takes his advantage as the subject is less able to resist he aggravates extenuates affirms denies damns confounds the spirits troubles heart brain humours organs senses and wholly domineers in their imaginations If they proceed from themselves such thoughts they are remiss and moderate not so violent and monstrous not so frequent The devil commonly suggests things opposite to nature opposite to God and his word impious absurd such as a man would never of himself or could not conceive they strike terror and horror into the parties own hearts For if he or they be asked whether they do approve of such like thoughts or no they answer and their own souls truly dictate as much they abhor them as much as hell and the devil himself they would fain think otherwise if they could he hath thought otherwise and with all his soul desires so to think again he doth resist and hath some good motions intermixed now and then so that such blasphemous impious unclean thoughts are not his own but the devil s they proceed not from him but from a crazed phantasy distempered humours black fumes which offend his brain six thousand seven hundred ninety two they are thy crosses the devil s sins and he shall answer for them he doth enforce thee to do that which thou dost abhor and didst never give consent to and although he hath sometimes so slyly set upon thee and so far prevailed as to make thee in some sort to assent to such wicked thoughts to delight in yet they have not proceeded from a confirmed will in thee but are of that nature which thou dost afterwards reject and abhor Therefore be not overmuch troubled and dismayed with such kind of suggestions at least if they please thee not because they are not thy personal sins for which thou shalt incur the wrath of God or his displeasure contemn neglect them let them go as they come strive not too violently or trouble thyself too much but as our Saviour said to Satan in like case say thou avoid Satan I detest thee and them Satanae est mala ingerere saith Austin nostrum non consentire as Satan labours to suggest so must we strive not to give consent and it will be sufficient the more anxious and solicitous thou art the more perplexed the more thou shalt otherwise be troubled and entangled Besides they must know this all so molested and distempered that although these be most execrable and grievous sins they are pardonable yet through God s mercy and goodness they may be forgiven if they be penitent and sorry for them Paul himself confesseth Rom xvii nineteen He did not the good he would do but the evil which he would not do tis not I but sin that dwelleth in me Tis not thou but Satan s suggestions his craft and subtlety his malice comfort thyself then if thou be penitent and grieved or desirous to be so these heinous sins shall not be laid to thy charge God s mercy is above all sins which if thou do not finally contemn without doubt thou shalt be saved six thousand seven hundred ninety three No man sins against the Holy Ghost but he that wilfully and finally renounceth Christ and contemneth him and his word to the last without which there is no salvation from which grievous sin God of his infinite mercy deliver us Take hold of this to be thy comfort and meditate withal on God s word labour to pray to repent to be renewed in mind keep thine heart with all diligence Prov iv thirteen resist the devil and he will fly from thee pour out thy soul unto the Lord with sorrowful Hannah pray continually as Paul enjoins and as David did Psalm i meditate on his law day and night Yea but this meditation is that mars all and mistaken makes many men far worse misconceiving all they read or hear to their own overthrow the more they search and read Scriptures or divine treatises the more they puzzle themselves as a bird in a net the more they are entangled and precipitated into this preposterous gulf Many are called but few are chosen Matt xx sixteen and xxii fourteen with such like places of Scripture misinterpreted strike them with horror they doubt presently whether they be of this number or no God s eternal decree of predestination absolute reprobation and such fatal tables they form to their own ruin and impinge upon this rock of despair How shall they be assured of their salvation by what signs If the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and sinners appear one Pet iv eighteen Who knows saith Solomon whether he be elect This grinds their souls how shall they discern they are not reprobates But I say again how shall they discern they are From the devil can be no certainty for he is a liar from the beginning if he suggests any such thing as too frequently he doth reject him as a deceiver an enemy of human kind dispute not with him give no credit to him obstinately refuse him as saint Anthony did in the wilderness whom the devil set upon in several shapes or as the collier did so do thou by him For when the devil tempted him with the weakness of his faith and told him he could not be saved as being ignorant in the principles of religion and urged him moreover to know what he believed what he thought of such and such points and mysteries the collier told him he believed as the church did but what said the devil again doth the church believe as I do said the collier and what s that thou believest as the church doth c when the devil could get no other answer he left him If Satan summon thee to answer send him to Christ he is thy liberty thy protector against cruel death raging sin that roaring lion he is thy righteousness thy Saviour and thy life Though he say thou art not of the number of the elect a reprobate forsaken of God hold thine own still hic murus aheneus esto let this be as a bulwark a brazen wall to defend thee stay thyself in that certainty of faith let that be thy comfort Christ will protect thee vindicate thee thou art one of his flock he will triumph over the law vanquish death overcome the devil and destroy hell If he say thou art none of the elect no believer reject him defy him thou hast thought otherwise and mayst so be resolved again comfort thyself this persuasion cannot come from the devil and much less can it be grounded from thyself men are liars and why shouldst thou distrust A denying Peter a persecuting Paul an adulterous cruel David have been received an apostate Solomon may be converted no sin at all but impenitency can give testimony of final reprobation Why shouldst thou then distrust misdoubt thyself upon what ground what suspicion This opinion alone of particularity Against that and for the certainty of election and salvation on the other side see God s good will toward men hear how generally his grace is proposed to him and him and them each man in particular and to all one Tim ii four God will that all men be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth Tis a universal promise God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that through him the world might be saved John iii seventeen He that acknowledged himself a man in the world must likewise acknowledge he is of that number that is to be saved Ezek xxxiii eleven I will not the death of a sinner but that he repent and live But thou art a sinner therefore he will not thy death This is the will of him that sent me that every man that believeth in the Son should have everlasting life John vi forty He would have no man perish but all come to repentance two Pet iii nine Besides remission of sins is to be preached not to a few but universally to all men Go therefore and tell all nations baptising them c Matt xxviii nineteen Go into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature Mark xvi fifteen Now there cannot be contradictory wills in God he will have all saved and not all how can this stand together be secure then believe trust in him hope well and be saved Yea that s the main matter how shall I believe or discern my security from carnal presumption my faith is weak and faint I want those signs and fruits of sanctification six thousand seven hundred ninety four sorrow for sin thirsting for grace groanings of the spirit love of Christians as Christians avoiding occasion of sin endeavour of new obedience charity love of God perseverance Though these signs be languishing in thee and not seated in thine heart thou must not therefore be dejected or terrified the effects of the faith and spirit are not yet so fully felt in thee conclude not therefore thou art a reprobate or doubt of thine election because the elect themselves are without them before their conversion Thou mayst in the Lord s good time be converted some are called at the eleventh hour Use I say the means of thy conversion expect the Lord s leisure if not yet called pray thou mayst be or at least wish and desire thou mayst be Notwithstanding all this which might be said to this effect to ease their afflicted minds what comfort our best divines can afford in this case Zanchius Beza c This furious curiosity needless speculation fruitless meditation about election reprobation free will grace such places of Scripture preposterously conceived torment still and crucify the souls of too many and set all the world together by the ears To avoid which inconveniences and to settle their distressed minds to mitigate those divine aphorisms though in another extreme some our late Arminians have revived that plausible doctrine of universal grace which many fathers our late Lutheran and modern papists do still maintain that we have free will of ourselves and that grace is common to all that will believe Some again though less orthodoxal will have a far greater part saved than shall be damned as six thousand seven hundred ninety five Caelius Secundus stiffly maintains in his book De amplitudine regni coelestis or some impostor under his name beatorum numerus multo major quam damnatorum six thousand seven hundred ninety six He calls that other tenet of special six thousand seven hundred ninety seven election and reprobation a prejudicate envious and malicious opinion apt to draw all men to desperation Many are called few chosen c He opposeth some opposite parts of Scripture to it Christ came into the world to save sinners c And four especial arguments he produceth one from God s power If more be damned than saved he erroneously concludes six thousand seven hundred ninety eight the devil hath the greater sovereignty for what is power but to protect and majesty consists in multitude If the devil have the greater part where is his mercy where is his power how is he Deus Optimus Maximus misericors c where is his greatness where his goodness He proceeds six thousand seven hundred ninety nine We account him a murderer that is accessory only or doth not help when he can which may not be supposed of God without great offence because he may do what he will and is otherwise accessory and the author of sin The nature of good is to be communicated God is good and will not then be contracted in his goodness for how is he the father of mercy and comfort if his good concern but a few O envious and unthankful men to think otherwise six thousand eight hundred Why should we pray to God that are Gentiles and thank him for his mercies and benefits that hath damned us all innocuous for Adam s offence one man s offence one small offence eating of an apple why should we acknowledge him for our governor that hath wholly neglected the salvation of our souls contemned us and sent no prophets or instructors to teach us as he hath done to the Hebrews So Julian the apostate objects Why should these Christians Caelius urgeth reject us and appropriate God unto themselves Deum illum suum unicum c But to return to our forged Caelius At last he comes to that he will have those saved that never heard of or believed in Christ ex puris naturalibus with the Pelagians and proves it out of Origen and others They saith six thousand eight hundred one Origen that never heard God s word are to be excused for their ignorance we may not think God will be so hard angry cruel or unjust as to condemn any man indicta causa They alone he holds are in the state of damnation that refuse Christ s mercy and grace when it is offered Many worthy Greeks and Romans good moral honest men that kept the law of nature did to others as they would be done to themselves as certainly saved he concludes as they were that lived uprightly before the law of Moses They were acceptable in God s sight as Job was the Magi the queen of Sheba Darius of Persia Socrates Aristides Cato Curius Tully Seneca and many other philosophers upright livers no matter of what religion as Cornelius out of any nation so that he live honestly call on God trust in him fear him he shall be saved This opinion was formerly maintained by the Valentinian and Basiledian heretics revived of late in six thousand eight hundred two Turkey of what sect Rustan Bassa was patron defended by six thousand eight hundred three Galeatius six thousand eight hundred four Erasmus by Zuinglius in exposit fidei ad Regem Galliae whose tenet Bullinger vindicates and Gualter approves in a just apology with many arguments There be many Jesuits that follow these Calvinists in this behalf Franciscus Buchsius Moguntinus Andradius Consil Trident many schoolmen that out of the one Rom v eighteen nineteen are verily persuaded that those good works of the Gentiles did so far please God that they might vitam aeternam promereri and be saved in the end Sesellius and Benedictus Justinianus in his comment on the first of the Romans Mathias Ditmarsh the politician with many others hold a mediocrity they may be salute non indigni but they will not absolutely decree it Hofmannus a Lutheran professor of Helmstad and many of his followers with most of our church and papists are stiff against it Franciscus Collius hath fully censured all opinions in his Five Books de Paganorum animabus post mortem and amply dilated this question which whoso will may peruse But to return to my author his conclusion is that not only wicked livers blasphemers reprobates and such as reject God s grace but that the devils themselves shall be saved at last as six thousand eight hundred five Origen himself long since delivered in his works and our late six thousand eight hundred six Socinians defend Ostorodius cap forty one institut Smaltius c Those terms of all and for ever in Scripture are not eternal but only denote a longer time which by many examples they prove The world shall end like a comedy and we shall meet at last in heaven and live in bliss altogether or else in conclusion in nihil evanescere For how can he be merciful that shall condemn any creature to eternal unspeakable punishment for one small temporary fault all posterity so many myriads for one and another man s offence quid meruistis oves But these absurd paradoxes are exploded by our church we teach otherwise That this vocation predestination election reprobation non ex corrupta massa praeviso fide as our Arminians or ex praevisis operibus as our papists non ex praeteritione but God s absolute decree ante mundum creatum as many of our church hold was from the beginning before the foundation of the world was laid or homo conditus or from Adam s fall as others will homo lapsus objectum est reprobationis with perseverantia sanctorum we must be certain of our salvation we may fall but not finally which our Arminians will not admit According to his immutable eternal just decree and counsel of saving men and angels God calls all and would have all to be saved according to the efficacy of vocation all are invited but only the elect apprehended the rest that are unbelieving impenitent whom God in his just judgment leaves to be punished for their sins are in a reprobate sense yet we must not determine who are such condemn ourselves or others because we have a universal invitation all are commanded to believe and we know not how soon or how late our end may be received I might have said more of this subject but forasmuch as it is a forbidden question and in the preface or declaration to the articles of the church printed sixteen thirty three to avoid factions and altercations we that are university divines especially are prohibited all curious search to print or preach or draw the article aside by our own sense and comments upon pain of ecclesiastical censure I will surcease and conclude with six thousand eight hundred seven Erasmus of such controversies Pugnet qui volet ego censeo leges majorum reverenter suscipiendas et religiose observandas velut a Deo profectas nec esse tutum nec esse pium de potestate publica sinistram concipere aut serere suspicionem Et siquid est tyrannidis quod tamen non cogat ad impietatem satius est ferre quam seditiose reluctari But to my former task The last main torture and trouble of a distressed mind is not so much this doubt of election and that the promises of grace are smothered and extinct in them nay quite blotted out as they suppose but withal God s heavy wrath a most intolerable pain and grief of heart seizeth on them to their thinking they are already damned they suffer the pains of hell and more than possibly can be expressed they smell brimstone talk familiarly with devils hear and see chimeras prodigious uncouth shapes bears owls antiques black dogs fiends hideous outcries fearful noises shrieks lamentable complaints they are possessed six thousand eight hundred eight and through impatience they roar and howl curse blaspheme deny God call his power in question abjure religion and are still ready to offer violence unto themselves by hanging drowning c Never any miserable wretch from the beginning of the world was in such a woeful case To such persons I oppose God s mercy and his justice Judicia Dei occulta non injusta his secret counsel and just judgment by which he spares some and sore afflicts others again in this life his judgment is to be adored trembled at not to be searched or inquired after by mortal men he hath reasons reserved to himself which our frailty cannot apprehend He may punish all if he will and that justly for sin in that he doth it in some is to make a way for his mercy that they repent and be saved to heal them to try them exercise their patience and make them call upon him to confess their sins and pray unto him as David did Psalm cxix one hundred thirty seven Righteous art thou O Lord and just are thy judgments As the poor publican Luke xviii thirteen Lord have mercy upon me a miserable sinner To put confidence and have an assured hope in him as Job had xiii fifteen Though he kill me I will trust In him Ure seca occide O Domine saith Austin modo serves animam kill cut in pieces burn my body O Lord to save my soul A small sickness one lash of affliction a little misery many times will more humiliate a man sooner convert bring him home to know himself than all those paraenetical discourses the whole theory of philosophy law physic and divinity or a world of instances and examples So that this which they take to be such an insupportable plague is an evident sign of God s mercy and justice of His love and goodness periissent nisi periissent had they not thus been undone they had finally been undone Many a carnal man is lulled asleep in perverse security foolish presumption is stupefied in his sins and hath no feeling at all of them I have sinned he saith and what evil shall come unto me Eccles v four and Tush how shall God know it and so in a reprobate sense goes down to hell But here Cynthius aurem vellit God pulls them by the ear by affliction he will bring them to heaven and happiness Blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted Matt v four a blessed and a happy state if considered aright it is to be so troubled It is good for me that I have been afflicted Psal cxix before I was afflicted I went astray but now I keep Thy word Tribulation works patience patience hope Rom v four and by such like crosses and calamities we are driven from the stake of security So that affliction is a school or academy wherein the best scholars are prepared to the commencements of the Deity And though it be most troublesome and grievous for the time yet know this it comes by God s permission and providence He is a spectator of thy groans and tears still present with thee the very hairs of thy head are numbered not one of them can fall to the ground without the express will of God he will not suffer thee to be tempted above measure he corrects us all six thousand eight hundred nine numero pondere et mensura the Lord will not quench the smoking flax or break the bruised reed Tentat saith Austin non ut obruat sed ut coronet he suffers thee to be tempted for thy good And as a mother doth handle her child sick and weak not reject it but with all tenderness observe and keep it so doth God by us not forsake us in our miseries or relinquish us for our imperfections but with all pity and compassion support and receive us whom he loves he loves to the end Rom viii Whom He hath elected those He hath called justified sanctified and glorified Think not then thou hast lost the Spirit that thou art forsaken of God be not overcome with heaviness of heart but as David said I will not fear though I walk in the shadows of death We must all go non a deliciis ad delicias six thousand eight hundred ten but from the cross to the crown by hell to heaven as the old Romans put Virtue s temple in the way to that of Honour we must endure sorrow and misery in this life Tis no new thing this God s best servants and dearest children have been so visited and tried Christ in the garden cried out My God my God why hast thou forsaken me His son by nature as thou art by adoption and grace Job in his anguish said The arrows of the Almighty God

had so seized on his soul David complains his eyes were eaten up sunk into his head Ps vi seven his moisture became as the drought in summer his flesh was consumed his bones vexed yet neither Job nor David did finally despair Job would not leave his hold but still trust in Him acknowledging Him to be his good God The Lord gives the Lord takes blessed be the name of the Lord Job i twenty one Behold I am vile I abhor myself repent in dust and ashes Job xxxix thirty seven David humbled himself Psal xxxi and upon his confession received mercy Faith hope repentance are the sovereign cures and remedies the sole comforts in this case confess humble thyself repent it is sufficient Quod purpura non potest saccus potest saith Chrysostom the king of Nineveh s sackcloth and ashes did that which his purple robes and crown could not effect Quod diadema non potuit cinis perfecit Turn to Him he will turn to thee the Lord is near those that are of a contrite heart and will save such as be afflicted in spirit Ps xxxiv eighteen He came to the lost sheep of Israel Matt xv fourteen Si cadentem intuetur clementiae manum protendit He is at all times ready to assist Nunquam spernit Deus Poenitentiam si sincere et simpliciter offeratur He never rejects a penitent sinner though he have come to the full height of iniquity wallowed and delighted in sin yet if he will forsake his former ways libenter amplexatur He will receive him Parcam huic homini saith six thousand eight hundred eleven Austin ex persona Dei quia sibi ipsi non pepercit ignoscam quia peccatum agnovit I will spare him because he hath not spared himself I will pardon him because he doth acknowledge his offence let it be never so enormous a sin His grace is sufficient two Cor xii nine Despair not then faint not at all be not dejected but rely on God call on him an thy trouble and he will hear thee he will assist help and deliver thee Draw near to Him he will draw near to thee James iv eight Lazarus was poor and full of boils and yet still he relied upon God Abraham did hope beyond hope Thou exceptest these were chief men divine spirits Deo cari beloved of God especially respected but I am a contemptible and forlorn wretch forsaken of God and left to the merciless fury of evil spirits I cannot hope pray repent c How often shall I say it thou mayst perform all those duties Christian offices and be restored in good time A sick man loseth his appetite strength and ability his disease prevaileth so far that all his faculties are spent hand and foot perform not their duties his eyes are dim hearing dull tongue distastes things of pleasant relish yet nature lies hid recovereth again and expelleth all those feculent matters by vomit sweat or some such like evacuations Thou art spiritually sick thine heart is heavy thy mind distressed thou mayst happily recover again expel those dismal passions of fear and grief God did not suffer thee to be tempted above measure whom he loves I say he loves

tumultuous heart in his greatest agony O my soul why art thou so disquieted within me c Thy soul is eclipsed for a time I yield as the sun is shadowed by a cloud no doubt but those gracious beams of God s mercy will shine upon thee again as they have formerly done those embers of faith hope and repentance now buried in ashes will flame out afresh and be fully revived Want of faith no feeling of grace for the present are not fit directions we must live by faith not by feeling tis the beginning of grace to wish for grace we must expect and tarry David a man after God s own heart was so troubled himself Awake why sleepest thou O Lord arise cast me not off wherefore hidest thou thy face and forgettest mine affliction and oppression My soul is bowed down to the dust Arise redeem us c Ps xliv twenty two He prayed long before he was heard expectans expectavit endured much before he was relieved Psal lxix three he complains I am weary of crying and my throat is dry mine eyes fail whilst I wait on the Lord and yet he perseveres Be not dismayed thou shalt be respected at last God often works by contrarieties he first kills and then makes alive he woundeth first and then healeth he makes man sow in tears that he may reap in joy tis God s method he that is so visited must with patience endure and rest satisfied for the present The paschal lamb was eaten with sour herbs we shall feel no sweetness of His blood till we first feel the smart of our sins Thy pains are great intolerable for the time thou art destitute of grace and comfort stay the Lord s leisure he will not I say suffer thee to be tempted above that thou art able to bear one Cor x thirteen but will give an issue to temptation He works all for the best to them that love God Rom viii twenty eight Doubt not of thine election it is an immutable decree a mark never to be defaced you have been otherwise you may and shall be And for your present affliction hope the best it will shortly end He is present with his servants in their affliction Ps xci fifteen Great are the troubles of the righteous but the Lord delivereth them out of all Ps xxxiv nineteen Our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh in us an eternal weight of glory two Cor iv eighteen Not answerable to that glory which is to come though now in heaviness saith one Pet i six you shall rejoice Now last of all to those external impediments terrible objects which they hear and see many times devils bugbears and mormeluches noisome smells c These may come as I have formerly declared in my precedent discourse of the Symptoms of Melancholy from inward causes as a concave glass reflects solid bodies a troubled brain for want of sleep nutriment and by reason of that agitation of spirits to which Hercules de Saxonia attributes all symptoms almost may reflect and show prodigious shapes as our vain fear and crazed phantasy shall suggest and feign as many silly weak women and children in the dark sick folks and frantic for want of repast and sleep suppose they see that they see not many times such terriculaments may proceed from natural causes and all other senses may be deluded Besides as I have said this humour is balneum diaboli the devil s bath by reason of the distemper of humours and infirm organs in us he may so possess us inwardly to molest us as he did Saul and others by God s permission he is prince of the air and can transform himself into several shapes delude all our senses for a time but his power is determined he may terrify us but not hurt God hath given His angels charge over us He is a wall round about his people Psal xci eleven twelve There be those that prescribe physic in such cases tis God s instrument and not unfit The devil works by mediation of humours and mixed diseases must have mixed remedies Levinus Lemnius cap fifty seven fifty eight exhort ad vit ep instit is very copious on this subject besides that chief remedy of confidence in God prayer hearty repentance c of which for your comfort and instruction read Lavater de spectris part three cap five and six Wierus de praestigiis daemonum lib five to Philip Melancthon and others and that Christian armour which Paul prescribes he sets down certain amulets herbs and precious stones which have marvellous virtues all profligandis daemonibus to drive away devils and their illusions Sapphires chrysolites carbuncles c

approves of betony to this purpose six thousand eight hundred twelve the ancients used therefore to plant it in churchyards because it was held to be an holy herb and good against fearful visions did secure such places as it grew in and sanctified those persons that carried it about them Idem fere Mathiolus in dioscoridem Others commend accurate music so Saul was helped by David s harp Fires to be made in such rooms where spirits haunt good store of lights to be set up odours perfumes and suffumigations as the angel taught Tobias of brimstone and bitumen thus myrrh briony root with many such simples which Wecker hath collected lib fifteen de secretis cap fifteen Symbol Jupiter sulphuris drachmam unam recoquatur in vitis albae aqua ut dilutius sit sulphur detur aegro nam daemones sunt morbi saith Rich Argentine lib de praestigiis daemonum cap ult Vigetus hath a far larger receipt to this purpose which the said Wecker cites out of Wierus Symbol Jupiter sulphuris vini bituminis opoponacis galbani castorei c Why sweet perfumes fires and so many lights should be used in such places Ernestus Burgravius Lucerna vitae et mortis and Fortunius Lycetus assigns this cause quod his boni genii provocentur mali arceaniur because good spirits are well pleased with but evil abhor them And therefore those old Gentiles present Mahometans and Papists have continual lamps burning in their churches all day and all night lights at funerals and in their graves lucernae ardentes ex auro liquefacto for many ages to endure saith Lazius ne daemones corpus laedant lights ever burning as those vestal virgins Pythonissae maintained heretofore with many such of which read Tostatus in two Reg cap six quaest forty three Thyreus cap fifty seven fifty eight sixty two c de locis infestis Pictorius Isagog de daemonibus c see more in them Cardan would have the party affected wink altogether in such a case if he see aught that offends him or cut the air with a sword in such places they walk and abide gladiis enim et lanceis terrentur shoot a pistol at them for being aerial bodies as Caelius Rhodiginus lib one cap twenty nine Tertullian Origen Psellas and many hold if stroken they feel pain Papists commonly enjoin and apply crosses holy water sanctified beads amulets music ringing of bells for to that end are they consecrated and by them baptised characters counterfeit relics so many masses peregrinations oblations adjurations and what not Alexander Albertinus a Rocha Petrus Thyreus and Hieronymus Mengus with many other pontificial writers prescribe and set down several forms of exorcisms as well to houses possessed with devils as to demoniacal persons but I am of six thousand eight hundred thirteen Lemnius s mind tis but damnosa adjuratio aut potius ludificatio a mere mockery a counterfeit charm to no purpose they are fopperies and fictions as that absurd six thousand eight hundred fourteen story is amongst the rest of a penitent woman seduced by a magician in France at saint Bawne exorcised by Domphius Michaelis and a company of circumventing friars If any man saith Lemnius will attempt such a thing without all those juggling circumstances astrological elections of time place prodigious habits fustian big sesquipedal words spells crosses characters which exorcists ordinarily use let him follow the example of Peter and John that without any ambitious swelling terms cured a lame man Acts iii In the name of Christ Jesus rise and walk His name alone is the best and only charm against all such diabolical illusions so doth Origen advise and so Chrysostom Haec erit tibi baculus haec turris inexpugnabilis haec armatura Nos quid ad haec dicemus plures fortasse expectabunt saith saint Austin Many men will desire my counsel and opinion what is to be done in this behalf I can say no more quam ut vera fide quae per dilectionem operatur ad Deum unum fugiamus let them fly to God alone for help Athanasius in his book De variis quaest prescribes as a present charm against devils the beginning of the lxvii Psalm Exurgat Deus dissipentur inimici c But the best remedy is to fly to God to call on him hope pray trust rely on him to commit ourselves wholly to him What the practice of the primitive church was in this behalf Et quis daemonia ejiciendi modus read Wierus at large lib five de Cura Lam meles cap thirty eight et deinceps Last of all if the party affected shall certainly know this malady to have proceeded from too much fasting meditation precise life contemplation of God s judgments for the devil deceives many by such means in that other extreme he circumvents melancholy itself reading some books treatises hearing rigid preachers c If he shall perceive that it hath begun first from some great loss grievous accident disaster seeing others in like case or any such terrible object let him speedily remove the cause which to the cure of this disease Navarras so much commends six thousand eight hundred fifteen avertat cogitationem a re scrupulosa by all opposite means art and industry let him laxare animum by all honest recreations refresh and recreate his distressed soul let him direct his thoughts by himself and other of his friends Let him read no more such tracts or subjects hear no more such fearful tones avoid such companies and by all means open himself submit himself to the advice of good physicians and divines which is contraventio scrupulorum as six thousand eight hundred sixteen he calls it hear them speak to whom the Lord hath given the tongue of the learned to be able to minister a word to him that is weary six thousand eight hundred seventeen whose words are as flagons of wine Let him not be obstinate headstrong peevish wilful self conceited as in this malady they are but give ear to good advice be ruled and persuaded and no doubt but such good counsel may prove as preposterous to his soul as the angel was to Peter that opened the iron gates loosed his bands brought him out of prison and delivered him from bodily thraldom they may ease his afflicted mind relieve his wounded soul and take him out of the jaws of hell itself I can say no more or give better advice to such as are any way distressed in this kind than what I have given and said Only take this for a corollary and conclusion as thou tenderest thine own welfare in this and all other melancholy thy good health of body

Lib de rep Gallorum twenty one oh two Campian twenty one oh three As for ourselves for neither are we free from this fault the same guilt the same crime may be objected against us for it is through our fault negligence and avarice that so many and such shameful corruptions occur in the church both the temple and the Deity are offered for sale that such sordidness is introduced such impiety committed such wickedness such a mad gulf of wretchedness and irregularity these I say arise from all our faults but more particularly from ours of the University We are the nursery in which those ills are bred with which the state is afflicted we voluntarily introduce them and are deserving of every opprobrium and suffering since we do not afterwards encounter them according to our strength For what better can we expect when so many poor beggarly fellows men of every order are readily and without election admitted to degrees Who if they can only commit to memory a few definitions and divisions and pass the customary period in the study of logics no matter with what effect whatever sort they prove to be idiots triflers idlers gamblers sots sensualists mere ciphers in the book of life Like those who boldly woo d Ulysses wife Born to consume the fruits of earth in truth As vain and idle as Pheacia s youth only let them have passed the stipulated period in the University and professed themselves collegians either for the sake of profit or through the influence of their friends they obtain a presentation nay sometimes even accompanied by brilliant eulogies upon their morals and acquirements and when they are about to take leave they are honoured with the most flattering literary testimonials in their favour by those who undoubtedly sustain a loss of reputation in granting them For doctors and professors as an author says are anxious about one thing only viz that out of their various callings they may promote their own advantage and convert the public loss into their private gains For our annual officers wish this only that those who commence whether they are taught or untaught is of no moment shall be sleek fat pigeons worth the plucking The Philosophastic are admitted to a degree in Arts because they have no acquaintance with them And they are desired to be wise men because they are endowed with no wisdom and bring no qualification for a degree except the wish to have it The Theologastic only let them pay thrice learned are promoted to every academic honour Hence it is that so many vile buffoons so many idiots everywhere placed in the twilight of letters the mere ghosts of scholars wanderers in the market place vagrants barbels mushrooms dolts asses a growling herd with unwashed feet break into the sacred precincts of theology bringing nothing along with them but an impudent front some vulgar trifles and foolish scholastic technicalities unworthy of respect even at the crossing of the highways This is the unworthy vagrant voluptuous race fitter for the hog sty haram than the altar aram that basely prostitute divine literature these are they who fill the pulpits creep into the palaces of our nobility after all other prospects of existence fail them owing to their imbecility of body and mind and their being incapable of sustaining any other parts in the commonwealth to this sacred refuge they fly undertaking the office of the ministry not from sincerity but as saint Paul says huckstering the word of God Let not any one suppose that it is here intended to detract from those many exemplary men of which the Church of England may boast learned eminent and of spotless fame for they are more numerous in that than in any other church of Europe nor from those most learned universities which constantly send forth men endued with every form of virtue And these seminaries would produce a still greater number of inestimable scholars hereafter if sordidness did not obscure the splendid light corruption interrupt and certain truckling harpies and beggars envy them their usefulness Nor can any one be so blind as not to perceive this any so stolid as not to understand it any so perverse as not to acknowledge how sacred Theology has been contaminated by those notorious idiots and the celestial Muse treated with profanity Vile and shameless souls says Luther for the sake of gain like flies to a milk pail crowd round the tables of the nobility in expectation of a church living any office or honour and flock into any public hall or city ready to accept of any employment that may offer A thing of wood and wires by others played Following the paste as the parrot they stutter out anything in hopes of reward obsequious parasites says Erasmus teach say write admire approve contrary to their conviction anything you please not to benefit the people but to improve their own fortunes They subscribe to any opinions and decisions contrary to the word of God that they may not offend their patron but retain the favour of the great the applause of the multitude and thereby acquire riches for themselves for they approach Theology not that they may perform a sacred duty but make a fortune nor to promote the interests of the church but to pillage it seeking as Paul says not the things which are of Jesus Christ but what may be their own not the treasure of their Lord but the enrichment of themselves and their followers Nor does this evil belong to those of humbler birth and fortunes only it possesses the middle and higher ranks bishops excepted O Pontiffs tell the efficacy of gold in sacred matters Avarice often leads the highest men astray and men admirable in all other respects these find a salvo for simony and striking against this rock of corruption they do not shear but flay the flock and wherever they teem plunder exhaust raze making shipwreck of their reputation if not of their souls also Hence it appears that this malady did not flow from the humblest to the highest classes but vice versa so that the maxim is true although spoken in jest he bought first therefore has the best right to sell For a Simoniac that I may use the phraseology of Leo has not received a favour since he has not received one he does not possess one and since he does not possess one he cannot confer one So far indeed are some of those who are placed at the helm from promoting others that they completely obstruct them from a consciousness of the means by which themselves obtained the honour For he who imagines that they emerged from their obscurity through their learning is deceived indeed whoever supposes promotion to be the reward of genius erudition experience probity piety and poetry which formerly was the case but nowadays is only promised is evidently deranged How or when this malady commenced I shall not further inquire but from these beginnings this accumulation of vices all her calamities and miseries have been brought upon the Church hence such frequent acts of simony complaints fraud impostures from this one fountain spring all its conspicuous iniquities I shall not press the question of ambition and courtly flattery lest they may be chagrined about luxury base examples of life which offend the honest wanton drinking parties c Yet hence is that academic squalor the muses now look sad since every low fellow ignorant of the arts by those very arts rises is promoted and grows rich distinguished by ambitious titles and puffed up by his numerous honours he just shows himself to the vulgar and by his stately carriage displays a species of majesty a remarkable solicitude letting down a flowing beard decked in a brilliant toga resplendent with purple and respected also on account of the splendour of his household and number of his servants There are certain statues placed in sacred edifices that seem to sink under their load and almost to perspire when in reality they are void of sensation and do not contribute to the stony stability so these men would wish to look like Atlases when they are no better than statues of stone insignificant scrubs funguses dolts little different from stone Meanwhile really learned men endowed with all that can adorn a holy life men who have endured the heat of mid day by some unjust lot obey these dizzards content probably with a miserable salary known by honest appellations humble obscure although eminently worthy needy leading a private life without honour buried alive in some poor benefice or incarcerated for ever in their college chambers lying hid ingloriously But I am unwilling to stir this sink any longer or any deeper hence those tears this melancholy habit of the muses hence that I may speak with Secellius is it that religion is brought into disrepute and contempt and the priesthood abject and since this is so I must speak out and use a filthy witticism of the filthy a foetid crowd poor sordid melancholy miserable despicable contemptible twenty one oh four Proem lib

electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support Project Gutenberg tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U S unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook s eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII compressed zipped HTML and others Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility http www gutenberg net This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg tm including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks EBooks posted prior to November two thousand three with eBook numbers BELOW ten thousand are filed in directories based on their release date If you want to download any of these eBooks directly rather than using the regular search system you may utilize the following addresses and just download by the etext year http www gutenberg net etextsix Or etext five four three two one zero ninety nine ninety eight ninety seven ninety six ninety five ninety four ninety three ninety two ninety two ninety one or ninety EBooks posted since November two thousand three with etext numbers OVER
