Rusk and David Widger THE BLACK ROBE by Wilkie Collins BEFORE THE STORY FIRST SCENE BOULOGNE SUR MER THE DUEL I THE doctors could do no more for the Dowager Lady Berrick When the medical advisers of a lady who has reached seventy years of age recommend the mild climate of the South of France they mean in plain language that they have arrived at the end of their resources Her ladyship gave the mild climate a fair trial and then decided as she herself expressed it to die at home Traveling slowly she had reached Paris at the date when I last heard of her It was then the beginning of November A week later I met with her nephew Lewis Romayne at the club What brings you to London at this time of year I asked The fatality that pursues me he answered grimly I am one of the unluckiest men living He was thirty years old he was not married he was the enviable possessor of the fine old country seat called Vange Abbey he had no poor relations and he was one of the handsomest men in England When I add that I am myself a retired army officer with a wretched income a disagreeable wife four ugly children and a burden of fifty years on my back no one will be surprised to hear that I answered Romayne with bitter sincerity in these words I wish to heaven I could change places with you I wish to heaven you could he burst out with equal sincerity on his side Read that He handed me a letter addressed to him by the traveling medical attendant of Lady Berrick After resting in Paris the patient had continued her homeward journey as far as Boulogne In her suffering condition she was liable to sudden fits of caprice An insurmountable horror of the Channel passage had got possession of her she positively refused to be taken on board the steamboat In this difficulty the lady who held the post of her companion had ventured on a suggestion Would Lady Berrick consent to make the Channel passage if her nephew came to Boulogne expressly to accompany her on the voyage The reply had been so immediately favorable that the doctor lost no time in communicating with mister Lewis Romayne This was the substance of the letter It was needless to ask any more questions Romayne was plainly on his way to Boulogne I gave him some useful information Try the oysters I said at the restaurant on the pier He never even thanked me He was thinking entirely of himself Just look at my position he said I detest Boulogne I cordially share my aunt s horror of the Channel passage I had looked forward to some months of happy retirement in the country among my books and what happens to me I am brought to London in this season of fogs to travel by the tidal train at seven to morrow morning and all for a woman with whom I have no sympathies in common If I am not an unlucky man who is He spoke in a tone of vehement irritation which seemed to me under the circumstances to be simply absurd But my nervous system is not the irritable system sorely tried by night study and strong tea of my friend Romayne It s only a matter of two days I remarked by way of reconciling him to his situation How do I know that he retorted In two days the weather may be stormy In two days she may be too ill to be moved Unfortunately I am her heir and I am told I must submit to any whim that seizes her I m rich enough already I don t want her money Besides I dislike all traveling and especially traveling alone You are an idle man If you were a good friend you would offer to go with me He added with the delicacy which was one of the redeeming points in his wayward character Of course as my guest I had known him long enough not to take offense at his reminding me in this considerate way that I was a poor man The proposed change of scene tempted me What did I care for the Channel passage Besides there was the irresistible attraction of getting away from home The end of it was that I accepted Romayne s invitation II SHORTLY after noon on the next day we were established at Boulogne near Lady Berrick but not at her hotel If we live in the same house Romayne reminded me we shall be bored by the companion and the doctor Meetings on the stairs you know and exchanging bows and small talk He hated those trivial conventionalities of society in which other people delight When somebody once asked him in what company he felt most at ease he made a shocking answer he said In the company of dogs I waited for him on the pier while he went to see her ladyship He joined me again with his bitterest smile What did I tell you She is not well enough to see me to day The doctor looks grave and the companion puts her handkerchief to her eyes We may be kept in this place for weeks to come The afternoon proved to be rainy Our early dinner was a bad one This last circumstance tried his temper sorely He was no gourmand the question of cookery was with him purely a matter of digestion Those late hours of study and that abuse of tea to which I have already alluded had sadly injured his stomach The doctors warned him of serious consequences to his nervous system unless he altered his habits He had little faith in medical science and he greatly overrated the restorative capacity of his constitution So far as I know he had always neglected the doctors advice The weather cleared toward evening and we went out for a walk We passed a church a Roman Catholic church of course the doors of which were still open Some poor women were kneeling at their prayers in the dim light Wait a minute said Romayne I am in a vile temper Let me try to put myself into a better frame of mind I followed him into the church He knelt down in a dark corner by himself I confess I was surprised He had been baptized in the Church of England but so far as outward practice was concerned he belonged to no religious community I had often heard him speak with sincere reverence and admiration of the spirit of Christianity but he never to my knowledge attended any place of public worship When we met again outside the church I asked if he had been converted to the Roman Catholic faith No he said I hate the inveterate striving of that priesthood after social influence and political power as cordially as the fiercest Protestant living But let us not forget that the Church of Rome has great merits to set against great faults Its system is administered with an admirable knowledge of the higher needs of human nature Take as one example what you have just seen The solemn tranquillity of that church the poor people praying near me the few words of prayer by which I silently united myself to my fellow creatures have calmed me and done me good In our country I should have found the church closed out of service hours He took my arm and abruptly changed the subject How will you occupy yourself he asked if my aunt receives me to morrow I assured him that I should easily find ways and means of getting through the time The next morning a message came from Lady Berrick to say that she would see her nephew after breakfast Left by myself I walked toward the pier and met with a man who asked me to hire his boat He had lines and bait at my service Most unfortunately as the event proved I decided on occupying an hour or two by sea fishing The wind shifted while we were out and before we could get back to the harbor the tide had turned against us It was six o clock when I arrived at the hotel A little open carriage was waiting at the door I found Romayne impatiently expecting me and no signs of dinner on the table He informed me that he had accepted an invitation in which I was included and promised to explain everything in the carriage Our driver took the road that led toward the High Town I subordinated my curiosity to my sense of politeness and asked for news of his aunt s health She is seriously ill poor soul he said I am sorry I spoke so petulantly and so unfairly when we met at the club The near prospect of death has developed qualities in her nature which I ought to have seen before this No matter how it may be delayed I will patiently wait her time for the crossing to England So long as he believed himself to be in the right he was as to his actions and opinions one of the most obstinate men I ever met with But once let him be convinced that he was wrong and he rushed into the other extreme became needlessly distrustful of himself and needlessly eager in seizing his opportunity of making atonement In this latter mood he was capable with the best intentions of committing acts of the most childish imprudence With some misgivings I asked how he had amused himself in my absence I waited for you he said till I lost all patience and went out for a walk First I thought of going to the beach but the smell of the harbor drove me back into the town and there oddly enough I met with a man a certain Captain Peterkin who had been a friend of mine at college A visitor to Boulogne I inquired Not exactly A resident Yes The fact is I lost sight of Peterkin when I left Oxford and since that time he seems to have drifted into difficulties We had a long talk He is living here he tells me until his affairs are settled I needed no further enlightenment Captain Peterkin stood as plainly revealed to me as if I had known him for years Isn t it a little imprudent I said to renew your acquaintance with a man of that sort Couldn t you have passed him with a bow Romayne smiled uneasily I daresay you re right he answered But remember I had left my aunt feeling ashamed of the unjust way in which I had thought and spoken of her How did I know that I mightn t be wronging an old friend next if I kept Peterkin at a distance His present position may be as much his misfortune poor fellow as his fault I was half inclined to pass him as you say but I distrusted my own judgment He held out his hand and he was so glad to see me It can t be helped now I shall be anxious to hear your opinion of him Are we going to dine with Captain Peterkin Yes I happened to mention that wretched dinner yesterday at our hotel He said Come to my boarding house Out of Paris there isn t such a table d hote in France I tried to get off it not caring as you know to go among strangers I said I had a friend with me He invited you most cordially to accompany me More excuses on my part only led to a painful result I hurt Peterkin s feelings I m down in the world he said and I m not fit company for you and your friends I beg your pardon for taking the liberty of inviting you He turned away with the tears in his eyes What could I do I thought to myself You could have lent him five pounds and got rid of his invitation without the slightest difficulty If I had returned in reasonable time to go out with Romayne we might not have met the captain or if we had met him my presence would have prevented the confidential talk and the invitation that followed I felt I was to blame and yet how could I help it It was useless to remonstrate the mischief was done We left the Old Town on our right hand and drove on past a little colony of suburban villas to a house standing by itself surrounded by a stone wall As we crossed the front garden on our way to the door I noticed against the side of the house two kennels inhabited by two large watch dogs Was the proprietor afraid of thieves III THE moment we were introduced to the drawing room my suspicions of the company we were likely to meet with were fully confirmed Cards billiards and betting there was the inscription legibly written on the manner and appearance of Captain Peterkin The bright eyed yellow old lady who kept the boarding house would have been worth five thousand pounds in jewelry alone if the ornaments which profusely covered her had been genuine precious stones The younger ladies present had their cheeks as highly rouged and their eyelids as elaborately penciled in black as if they were going on the stage instead of going to dinner We found these fair creatures drinking Madeira as a whet to their appetites Among the men there were two who struck me as the most finished and complete blackguards whom I had ever met with in all my experience at home and abroad One with a brown face and a broken nose was presented to us by the title of Commander and was described as a person of great wealth and distinction in Peru traveling for amusement The other wore a military uniform and decorations and was spoken of as the General A bold bullying manner a fat sodden face little leering eyes and greasy looking hands made this man so repellent to me that I privately longed to kick him Romayne had evidently been announced before our arrival as a landed gentleman with a large income Men and women vied in servile attentions to him When we went into the dining room the fascinating creature who sat next to him held her fan before her face and so made a private interview of it between the rich Englishman and herself With regard to the dinner I shall only report that it justified Captain Peterkin s boast in some degree at least The wine was good and the conversation became gay to the verge of indelicacy Usually the most temperate of men Romayne was tempted by his neighbors into drinking freely I was unfortunately seated at the opposite extremity of the table and I had no opportunity of warning him The dinner reached its conclusion and we all returned together on the foreign plan to coffee and cigars in the drawing room The women smoked and drank liqueurs as well as coffee with the men One of them went to the piano and a little impromptu ball followed the ladies dancing with their cigarettes in their mouths Keeping my eyes and ears on the alert I saw an innocent looking table with a surface of rosewood suddenly develop a substance of green cloth At the same time a neat little roulette table made its appearance from a hiding place in a sofa Passing near the venerable landlady I heard her ask the servant in a whisper if the dogs were loose After what I had observed I could only conclude that the dogs were used as a patrol to give the alarm in case of a descent of the police It was plainly high time to thank Captain Peterkin for his hospitality and to take our leave We have had enough of this I whispered to Romayne in English Let us go In these days it is a delusion to suppose that you can speak confidentially in the English language when French people are within hearing One of the ladies asked Romayne tenderly if he was tired of her already Another reminded him that it was raining heavily as we could all hear and suggested waiting until it cleared up The hideous General waved his greasy hand in the direction of the card table and said The game is waiting for us Romayne was excited but not stupefied by the wine he had drunk He answered discreetly enough I must beg you to excuse me I am a poor card player The General suddenly looked grave You are speaking sir under a strange misapprehension he said Our game is lansquenet essentially a game of chance With luck the poorest player is a match for the whole table Romayne persisted in his refusal As a matter of course I supported him with all needful care to avoid giving offense The General took offense nevertheless He crossed his arms on his breast and looked at us fiercely Does this mean gentlemen that you distrust the company he asked The broken nosed Commander hearing the question immediately joined us in the interests of peace bearing with him the elements of persuasion under the form of a lady on his arm The lady stepped briskly forward and tapped the General on the shoulder with her fan I am one of the company she said and I am sure mister Romayne doesn t distrust me She turned to Romayne with her most irresistible smile A gentleman always plays cards she resumed when he has a lady for a partner Let us join our interests at the table and dear mister Romayne don t risk too much She put her pretty little purse into his hand and looked as if she had been in love with him for half her lifetime The fatal influence of the sex assisted by wine produced the inevitable result Romayne allowed himself to be led to the card table For a moment the General delayed the beginning of the game After what had happened it was necessary that he should assert the strict sense of justice that was in him We are all honorable men he began And brave men the Commander added admiring the General And brave men the General admitted admiring the Commander Gentlemen if I have been led into expressing myself with unnecessary warmth of feeling I apologize and regret it Nobly spoken the Commander pronounced The General put his hand on his heart and bowed The game began As the poorest man of the two I had escaped the attentions lavished by the ladies on Romayne At the same time I was obliged to pay for my dinner by taking some part in the proceedings of the evening Small stakes were allowed I found at roulette and besides the heavy chances in favor of the table made it hardly worth while to run the risk of cheating in this case I placed myself next to the least rascally looking man in the company and played roulette For a wonder I was successful at the first attempt My neighbor handed me my winnings I have lost every farthing I possess he whispered to me piteously and I have a wife and children at home I lent the poor wretch five francs He smiled faintly as he looked at the money It reminds me he said of my last transaction when I borrowed of that gentleman there who is betting on the General s luck at the card table Beware of employing him as I did What do you think I got for my note of hand of four thousand francs A hundred bottles of champagne fifty bottles of ink fifty bottles of blacking three dozen handkerchiefs two pictures by unknown masters two shawls one hundred maps and five francs We went on playing My luck deserted me I lost and lost and lost again From time to time I looked round at the card table The deal had fallen early to the General and it seemed to be indefinitely prolonged A heap of notes and gold won mainly from Romayne as I afterward discovered lay before him As for my neighbor the unhappy possessor of the bottles of blacking the pictures by unknown masters and the rest of it he won and then rashly presumed on his good fortune Deprived of his last farthing he retired into a corner of the room and consoled himself with a cigar I had just arisen to follow his example when a furious uproar burst out at the card table I saw Romayne spring up and snatch the cards out of the General s hand You scoundrel he shouted you are cheating The General started to his feet in a fury You lie he cried I attempted to interfere but Romayne had already seen the necessity of controlling himself A gentleman doesn t accept an insult from a swindler he said coolly Accept this then the General answered and spat on him In an instant Romayne knocked him down The blow was dealt straight between his eyes he was a gross big boned man and he fell heavily For the time he was stunned The women ran screaming out of the room The peaceable Commander trembled from head to foot Two of the men present who to give them their due were no cowards locked the doors You don t go they said till we see whether he recovers or not Cold water assisted by the landlady s smelling salts brought the General to his senses after a while He whispered something to one of his friends who immediately turned to me The General challenges mister Romayne he said As one of his seconds I demand an appointment for to morrow morning I refused to make any appointment unless the doors were first unlocked and we were left free to depart Our carriage is waiting outside I added If it returns to the hotel without us there will be an inquiry This latter consideration had its effect On their side the doors were opened On our side the appointment was made We left the house IV IN consenting to receive the General s representative it is needless to say that I merely desired to avoid provoking another quarrel If those persons were really impudent enough to call at the hotel I had arranged to threaten them with the interference of the police and so to put an end to the matter Romayne expressed no opinion on the subject one way or the other His conduct inspired me with a feeling of uneasiness The filthy insult of which he had been made the object seemed to be rankling in his mind He went away thoughtfully to his own room Have you nothing to say to me I asked He only answered Wait till to morrow The next day the seconds appeared I had expected to see two of the men with whom we had dined To my astonishment the visitors proved to be officers of the General s regiment They brought proposals for a hostile meeting the next morning the choice of weapons being left to Romayne as the challenged man It was now quite plain to me that the General s peculiar method of card playing had thus far not been discovered and exposed He might keep doubtful company and might as I afterward heard be suspected in certain quarters But that he still had formally speaking a reputation to preserve was proved by the appearance of the two gentlemen present as his representatives They declared with evident sincerity that Romayne had made a fatal mistake had provoked the insult offered to him and had resented it by a brutal and cowardly outrage As a man and a soldier the General was doubly bound to insist on a duel No apology would be accepted even if an apology were offered In this emergency as I understood it there was but one course to follow I refused to receive the challenge Being asked for my reasons I found it necessary to speak within certain limits Though we knew the General to be a cheat it was a delicate matter to dispute his right to claim satisfaction when he had found two officers to carry his message I produced the seized cards which Romayne had brought away with him in his pocket and offered them as a formal proof that my friend had not been mistaken The seconds evidently prepared for this circumstance by their principal declined to examine the cards In the first place they said not even the discovery of foul play supposing the discovery to have been really made could justify Romayne s conduct In the second place the General s high character made it impossible under any circumstances that he could be responsible Like ourselves he had rashly associated with bad company and he had been the innocent victim of an error or a fraud committed by some other person present at the table Driven to my last resource I could now only base my refusal to receive the challenge on the ground that we were Englishmen and that the practice of dueling had been abolished in England Both the seconds at once declined to accept this statement in justification of my conduct You are now in France said the elder of the two where a duel is the established remedy for an insult among gentlemen You are bound to respect the social laws of the country in which you are for the time residing If you refuse to do so you lay yourselves open to a public imputation on your courage of a nature too degrading to be more particularly alluded to Let us adjourn this interview for three hours on the ground of informality We ought to confer with two gentlemen acting on mister Romayne s behalf Be prepared with another second to meet us and reconsider your decision before we call again The Frenchmen had barely taken their departure by one door when Romayne entered by another I have heard it all he said quietly Accept the challenge I declare solemnly that I left no means untried of opposing my friend s resolution No man could have felt more strongly convinced than I did that nothing could justify the course he was taking My remonstrances were completely thrown away He was deaf to sense and reason from the moment when he had heard an imputation on his courage suggested as a possible result of any affair in which he was concerned With your views he said I won t ask you to accompany me to the ground I can easily find French seconds And mind this if you attempt to prevent the meeting the duel will take place elsewhere and our friendship is at an end from that moment After this I suppose it is needless to add that I accompanied him to the ground the next morning as one of his seconds V WE were punctual to the appointed hour eight o clock The second who acted with me was a French gentleman a relative of one of the officers who had brought the challenge At his suggestion we had chosen the pistol as our weapon Romayne like most Englishmen at the present time knew nothing of the use of the sword He was almost equally inexperienced with the pistol Our opponents were late They kept us waiting for more than ten minutes It was not pleasant weather to wait in The day had dawned damp and drizzling A thick white fog was slowly rolling in on us from the sea When they did appear the General was not among them A tall well dressed young man saluted Romayne with stern courtesy and said to a stranger who accompanied him Explain the circumstances The stranger proved to be a surgeon He entered at once on the necessary explanation The General was too ill to appear He had been attacked that morning by a fit the consequence of the blow that he had received Under these circumstances his eldest son Maurice was now on the ground to fight the duel on his father s behalf attended by the General s seconds and with the General s full approval We instantly refused to allow the duel to take place Romayne loudly declaring that he had no quarrel with the General s son Upon this Maurice broke away from his seconds drew off one of his gloves and stepping close up to Romayne struck him on the face with the glove Have you no quarrel with me now the young Frenchman asked Must I spit on you as my father did His seconds dragged him away and apologized to us for the outbreak But the mischief was done Romayne s fiery temper flashed in his eyes Load the pistols he said After the insult publicly offered to him and the outrage publicly threatened there was no other course to take It had been left to us to produce the pistols We therefore requested the seconds of our opponent to examine and to load them While this was being done the advancing sea fog so completely enveloped us that the duelists were unable to see each other We were obliged to wait for the chance of a partial clearing in the atmosphere Romayne s temper had become calm again The generosity of his nature spoke in the words which he now addressed to his seconds After all he said the young man is a good son he is bent on redressing what he believes to be his father s wrong Does his flipping his glove in my face matter to me I think I shall fire in the air I shall refuse to act as your second if you do answered the French gentleman who was assisting us The General s son is famous for his skill with the pistol If you didn t see it in his face just now I did he means to kill you Defend your life sir I spoke quite as strongly to the same purpose when my turn came Romayne yielded he placed himself unreservedly in our hands In a quarter of an hour the fog lifted a little We measured the distance having previously arranged at my suggestion that the two men should both fire at the same moment at a given signal Romayne s composure as they faced each other was in a man of his irritable nervous temperament really wonderful I placed him sidewise in a position which in some degree lessened his danger by lessening the surface exposed to the bullet My French colleague put the pistol into his hand and gave him the last word of advice Let your arm hang loosely down with the barrel of the pistol pointing straight to the ground When you hear the signal only lift your arm as far as the elbow keep the elbow pressed against your side and fire We could do no more for him As we drew aside I own it my tongue was like a cinder in my mouth and a horrid inner cold crept through me to the marrow of my bones The signal was given and the two shots were fired at the same time My first look was at Romayne He took off his hat and handed it to me with a smile His adversary s bullet had cut a piece out of the brim of his hat on the right side He had literally escaped by a hair breadth While I was congratulating him the fog gathered again more thickly than ever Looking anxiously toward the ground occupied by our adversaries we could only see vague shadowy forms hurriedly crossing and recrossing each other in the mist Something had happened My French colleague took my arm and pressed it significantly Leave me to inquire he said Romayne tried to follow I held him back we neither of us exchanged a word The fog thickened and thickened until nothing was to be seen Once we heard the surgeon s voice calling impatiently for a light to help him No light appeared that we could see Dreary as the fog itself the silence gathered round us again On a sudden it was broken horribly broken by another voice strange to both of us shrieking hysterically through the impenetrable mist Where is he the voice cried in the French language Assassin Assassin where are you Was it a woman or was it a boy We heard nothing more The effect upon Romayne was terrible to see He who had calmly confronted the weapon lifted to kill him shuddered dumbly like a terror stricken animal I put my arm round him and hurried him away from the place We waited at the hotel until our French friend joined us After a brief interval he appeared announcing that the surgeon would follow him The duel had ended fatally The chance course of the bullet urged by Romayne s unpracticed hand had struck the General s son just above the right nostril had penetrated to the back of his neck and had communicated a fatal shock to the spinal marrow He was a dead man before they could take him back to his father s house So far our fears were confirmed But there was something else to tell for which our worst presentiments had not prepared us A younger brother of the fallen man a boy of thirteen years old had secretly followed the dueling party on their way from his father s house had hidden himself and had seen the dreadful end The seconds only knew of it when he burst out of his place of concealment and fell on his knees by his dying brother s side His were the frightful cries which we had heard from invisible lips The slayer of his brother was the assassin whom he had vainly tried to discover through the fathomless obscurity of the mist We both looked at Romayne He silently looked back at us like a man turned to stone I tried to reason with him Your life was at your opponent s mercy I said It was he who was skilled in the use of the pistol your risk was infinitely greater than his Are you responsible for an accident Rouse yourself Romayne Think of the time to come when all this will be forgotten Never he said to the end of my life He made that reply in dull monotonous tones His eyes looked wearily and vacantly straight before him I spoke to him again He remained impenetrably silent he appeared not to hear or not to understand me The surgeon came in while I was still at a loss what to say or do next Without waiting to be asked for his opinion he observed Romayne attentively and then drew me away into the next room Your friend is suffering from a severe nervous shock he said Can you tell me anything of his habits of life I mentioned the prolonged night studies and the excessive use of tea The surgeon shook his head If you want my advice he proceeded take him home at once Don t subject him to further excitement when the result of the duel is known in the town If it ends in our appearing in a court of law it will be a mere formality in this case and you can surrender when the time comes Leave me your address in London I felt that the wisest thing I could do was to follow his advice The boat crossed to Folkestone at an early hour that day we had no time to lose Romayne offered no objection to our return to England he seemed perfectly careless what became of him Leave me quiet he said and do as you like I wrote a few lines to Lady Berrick s medical attendant informing him of the circumstances A quarter of an hour afterward we were on board the steamboat There were very few passengers After we had left the harbor my attention was attracted by a young English lady traveling apparently with her mother As we passed her on the deck she looked at Romayne with compassionate interest so vividly expressed in her beautiful face that I imagined they might be acquainted With some difficulty I prevailed sufficiently over the torpor that possessed him to induce him to look at our fellow passenger Do you know that charming person I asked No he replied with the weariest indifference I never saw her before I m tired tired tired Don t speak to me leave me by myself I left him His rare personal attractions of which let me add he never appeared to be conscious had evidently made their natural appeal to the interest and admiration of the young lady who had met him by chance The expression of resigned sadness and suffering now visible in his face added greatly no doubt to the influence that he had unconsciously exercised over the sympathies of a delicate and sensitive woman It was no uncommon circumstance in his past experience of the sex as I myself well knew to be the object not of admiration only but of true and ardent love He had never reciprocated the passion had never even appeared to take it seriously Marriage might as the phrase is be the salvation of him Would he ever marry Leaning over the bulwark idly pursuing this train of thought I was recalled to present things by a low sweet voice the voice of the lady of whom I had been thinking Excuse me for disturbing you she said I think your friend wants you She spoke with the modesty and self possession of a highly bred woman A little heightening of her color made her to my eyes more beautiful than ever I thanked her and hastened back to Romayne He was standing by the barred skylight which guarded the machinery I instantly noticed a change in him His eyes wandering here and there in search of me had more than recovered their animation there was a wild look of terror in them He seized me roughly by the arm and pointed down to the engine room What do you hear there he asked I hear the thump of the engines Nothing else Nothing What do you hear He suddenly turned away I ll tell you he said when we get on shore

none	none	 THE FOREWARNINGS VI As we approached the harbor at Folkestone Romayne s agitation appeared to subside 
4480-44312-0001	train-other-500	His head drooped his eyes half closed he looked like a weary man quietly falling asleep On leaving the steamboat I ventured to ask our charming fellow passenger if I could be of any service in reserving places in the London train
4480-44312-0002	train-other-500	for her mother and herself She thanked me and said they were going to visit some friends at Folkestone In making this reply she looked at Romayne I am afraid he is very ill she said in gently lowered tones
none	none	 Before I could answer her mother turned to her with an expression of surprise and directed her attention to the friends whom she had mentioned waiting to greet her Her last look as they took her away rested tenderly and sorrowfully on Romayne 
4480-44312-0003	train-other-500	He never returned it he was not even aware of it As I led him to the train he leaned more and more heavily on my arm Seated in the carriage he sank at once into profound sleep
none	none	 We drove to the hotel at which my friend was accustomed to reside when he was in London His long sleep on the journey seemed in some degree to have relieved him We dined together in his private room When the servants had withdrawn I found that the unhappy result of the duel was still preying on his mind The horror of having killed that man 
4480-44312-0004	train-other-500	he said is more than I can bear alone For God s sake don t leave me I had received letters at Boulogne which informed me that my wife and family had accepted an invitation to stay with some friends at the sea side
4480-44312-0005	train-other-500	Under these circumstances I was entirely at his service Having quieted his anxiety on this point I reminded him of what had passed between us on board the steamboat He tried to change the subject My curiosity was too strongly aroused to permit this
none	none	 I persisted in helping his memory We were looking into the engine room I said and you asked me what I heard there You promised to tell me what you heard as soon as we got on shore He stopped me before I could say more I begin to think it was a delusion he answered You ought not to interpret too literally what a person in my dreadful situation may say 
4480-44312-0006	train-other-500	The stain of another man s blood is on me I interrupted him in my turn I refuse to hear you speak of yourself in that way I said
none	none	 You are no more responsible for the Frenchman s death than if you had been driving and had accidentally run over him in the street I am not the right companion for a man who talks as you do 
4480-44312-0007	train-other-500	The proper person to be with you is a doctor I really felt irritated with him and I saw no reason for concealing it Another man in his place might have been offended with me
4480-44312-0008	train-other-500	There was a native sweetness in Romayne s disposition which asserted itself even in his worst moments of nervous irritability He took my hand Don t be hard on me he pleaded I will try to think of it as you do
none	none	 Make some little concession on your side I want to see how I get through the night We will return to what I said to you on board the steamboat to morrow morning 
4480-44312-0009	train-other-500	Is it agreed It was agreed of course There was a door of communication between our bedrooms At his suggestion it was left open
none	none	 If I find I can t sleep he explained I want to feel assured that you can hear me if I call to you 
4480-44312-0010	train-other-500	Three times in the night I woke and seeing the light burning in his room looked in at him He always carried some of his books with him when he traveled
none	none	 On each occasion when I entered the room he was reading quietly 
4480-44312-0011	train-other-500	I suppose I forestalled my night s sleep on the railway he said It doesn t matter I am content
none	none	 Something that I was afraid of has not happened 
4480-44312-0012	train-other-500	I am used to wakeful nights Go back to bed and don t be uneasy about me The next morning the deferred explanation was put off again
none	none	 Do you mind waiting a little longer 
4480-44312-0013	train-other-500	he asked Not if you particularly wish it Will you do me another favor You know that I don t like London The noise in the streets is distracting Besides I may tell you I have a sort of distrust of noise since He stopped with an appearance of confusion
none	none	 Since I found you looking into the engine room I asked Yes I don t feel inclined to trust the chances of another night in London I want to try the effect of perfect quiet Do you mind going back with me to Vange 
4480-44312-0014	train-other-500	Dull as the place is you can amuse yourself There is good shooting as you know
none	none	 In an hour more we had left London VII VANGE ABBEY is I suppose the most solitary country house in England If Romayne wanted quiet it was exactly the place for him On the rising ground of one of the wildest moors in the North Riding of Yorkshire 
4480-44312-0015	train-other-500	the ruins of the old monastery are visible from all points of the compass There are traditions of thriving villages clustering about the Abbey in the days of the monks and of hostleries devoted to the reception of pilgrims from every part of the Christian world
4480-44312-0016	train-other-500	Not a vestige of these buildings is left
none	none	 They were deserted by the pious inhabitants it is said at the time when Henry the Eighth suppressed the monasteries and gave the Abbey and the broad lands of Vange 
4480-44312-0017	train-other-500	to his faithful friend and courtier Sir Miles Romayne In the next generation the son and heir of Sir Miles built the dwelling house helping himself liberally from the solid stone walls of the monastery With some unimportant alterations and repairs
4480-44312-0018	train-other-500	the house stands defying time and weather to the present day
none	none	 At the last station on the railway the horses were waiting for us It was a lovely moonlight night and we shortened the distance considerably by taking the bridle path over the moor 
4480-44312-0019	train-other-500	Between nine and ten o clock we reached the Abbey Years had passed since I had last been Romayne s guest Nothing out of the house or in the house seemed to have undergone any change in the interval
none	none	 Neither the good North country butler nor his buxom Scotch wife skilled in cookery looked any older they received me as if I had left them a day or two since and had come back again to live in Yorkshire My well remembered bedroom was waiting for me and the matchless old Madeira welcomed us when my host and I met in the inner hall which was the ordinary dining room of the Abbey As we faced each other at the well spread table 
4480-44312-0020	train-other-500	I began to hope that the familiar influences of his country home were beginning already to breathe
none	none	 their blessed quiet 
4480-44312-0021	train-other-500	over the disturbed mind of Romayne In the presence of his faithful old servants he seemed to be capable of controlling the morbid remorse that oppressed him He spoke to them composedly and kindly
none	none	 he was affectionately glad to see his old friend once more in the old house When we were near the end of our meal something happened that startled me I had just handed the wine to Romayne and he had filled his glass 
4480-44312-0022	train-other-500	when he suddenly turned pale and lifted his head like a man whose attention is unexpectedly roused
none	none	 No person but ourselves was in the room I was not speaking to him at the time He looked round suspiciously at the door behind him leading into the library and rang the old fashioned handbell which stood by him on the table The servant was directed to close the door Are you cold I asked No 
4480-44312-0023	train-other-500	He reconsidered that brief answer and contradicted himself Yes the library fire has burned low I suppose In my position at the table I had seen the fire the grate was heaped with blazing coals and wood I said nothing
none	none	 The pale change in his face and his contradictory reply roused doubts in me which I had hoped never to feel again He pushed away his glass of wine and still kept his eyes fixed on the closed door 
4480-44312-0024	train-other-500	His attitude and expression were plainly suggestive of the act of listening Listening to what After an interval he abruptly addressed me
none	none	 Do you call it a quiet night he said As quiet as quiet can be I replied The wind has dropped and even the fire doesn t crackle Perfect stillness indoors and out Out he repeated For a moment he looked at me intently as if I had started some new idea in his mind I asked as lightly as I could if I had said anything to surprise him Instead of answering me he sprang to his feet with a cry of terror 
4480-44312-0025	train-other-500	and left the room I hardly knew what to do
none	none	 It was impossible unless he returned immediately to let this extraordinary proceeding pass without notice After waiting for a few minutes I rang the bell The old butler came in He looked in blank amazement at the empty chair Where s the master he asked I could only answer that he had left the table suddenly without a word of explanation He may perhaps be ill I added As his old servant you can do no harm if you go and look for him Say that I am waiting here if he wants me The minutes passed slowly and more slowly I was left alone for so long a time that I began to feel seriously uneasy My hand was on the bell again when there was a knock at the door I had expected to see the butler It was the groom who entered the room Garthwaite can t come down to you sir said the man He asks if you will please go up to the master on the Belvidere 
4480-44312-0026	train-other-500	The house extending round three sides of a square was only two stories high The flat roof accessible through a species of hatchway and still surrounded by its sturdy stone parapet was called The Belvidere in reference as usual to the fine view which it commanded
4480-44312-0027	train-other-500	Fearing I knew not what I mounted the ladder which led to the roof Romayne received me with a harsh outburst of laughter that saddest false laughter which is true trouble in disguise Here s something to amuse you he cried
none	none	 I believe old Garthwaite thinks I am drunk 
4480-44312-0028	train-other-500	he won t leave me up here by myself Letting this strange assertion remain unanswered the butler withdrew
none	none	 As he passed me on his way to the ladder he whispered 
4480-44312-0029	train-other-500	Be careful of the master I tell you sir he has a bee in his bonnet this night Although not of the north country myself I knew the meaning of the phrase
none	none	 Garthwaite suspected that the master was nothing less than mad Romayne took my arm when we were alone we walked slowly from end to end of the Belvidere 
4480-44312-0030	train-other-500	The moon was by this time low in the heavens but her mild mysterious light still streamed over the roof of the house and the high heathy ground round it I looked attentively at Romayne He was deadly pale
4480-44312-0031	train-other-500	his hand shook as it rested on my arm and that was all Neither in look nor manner did he betray the faintest sign of mental derangement He had perhaps needlessly alarmed the faithful old servant by something that he had said or done
4480-44312-0032	train-other-500	I determined to clear up that doubt immediately You left the table very suddenly I said Did you feel ill Not ill he replied I was frightened Look at me I m frightened still What do you mean
4480-44312-0033	train-other-500	Instead of answering he repeated the strange question which he had put to me downstairs Do you call it a quiet night Considering the time of year and the exposed situation of the house the night was almost preternaturally quiet
4480-44312-0034	train-other-500	Throughout the vast open country all round us not even a breath of air could be heard The night birds were away or were silent at the time But one sound was audible when we stood still and listened the cool quiet bubble of a little stream
4480-44312-0035	train-other-500	lost to view in the valley ground to the south I have told you already I said So still a night I never remember on this Yorkshire moor He laid one hand heavily on my shoulder
none	none	 What did the poor boy say of me whose brother I killed he asked What words did we hear through the dripping darkness of the mist 
4480-44312-0036	train-other-500	I won t encourage you to think of them I refuse to repeat the words He pointed over the northward parapet
none	none	 It doesn t matter whether you accept or refuse he said I hear the boy at this moment there He repeated the horrid words marking the pauses in the utterance of them with his finger as if they were sounds that he heard Assassin Assassin where are you Good God I cried You don t mean that you really hear the voice Do you hear what I say 
4480-44312-0037	train-other-500	I hear the boy as plainly as you hear me The voice screams at me through the clear moonlight as it screamed at me through the sea fog Again and again It s all round the house That way now where the light just touches on the tops of the heather
4480-44312-0038	train-other-500	Tell the servants to have the horses ready the first thing in the morning We leave Vange Abbey to morrow These were wild words If he had spoken them wildly I might have shared the butler s conclusion that his mind was deranged
none	none	 There was no undue vehemence in his voice or his manner He spoke with a melancholy resignation 
4480-44312-0039	train-other-500	he seemed like a prisoner submitting to a sentence that he had deserved Remembering the cases of men suffering from nervous disease who had been haunted by apparitions I asked if he saw any imaginary figure under the form of a boy I see nothing he said
none	none	 I only hear Look yourself It is in the last degree improbable but let us make sure that nobody has followed me from Boulogne and is playing me a trick We made the circuit of the Belvidere 
4480-44312-0040	train-other-500	On its eastward side the house wall was built against one of the towers of the old Abbey On the westward side the ground sloped steeply down to a deep pool or tarn
none	none	 Northward and southward there was nothing to be seen but the open moor Look where I might with the moonlight to make the view plain to me 
4480-44312-0041	train-other-500	the solitude was as void of any living creature as if we had been surrounded by the awful dead world of the moon Was it the boy s voice that you heard on the voyage across the Channel I asked Yes I heard it for the first time
none	none	 down in the engine room rising and falling rising and falling like the sound of the engines themselves And when did you hear it again I feared to hear it in London It left me I should have told you when we stepped ashore out of the steamboat 
4480-44312-0042	train-other-500	I was afraid that the noise of the traffic in the streets might bring it back to me As you know I passed a quiet night I had the hope that my imagination had deceived me that I was the victim of a delusion as people say It is no delusion
4480-44312-0043	train-other-500	In the perfect tranquillity of this place the voice has come back to me While we were at table I heard it again behind me in the library I heard it still when the door was shut I ran up here to try if it would follow me into the open air It has followed me
none	none	 We may as well go down again into the hall I know now that there is no escaping from it My dear old home has become horrible to me Do you mind returning to London tomorrow 
4480-44312-0044	train-other-500	What I felt and feared in this miserable state of things matters little The one chance I could see for Romayne was to obtain the best medical advice
none	none	 I sincerely encouraged his idea of going back to London the next day We had sat together by the hall fire for about ten minutes when he took out his handkerchief and wiped away the perspiration from his forehead drawing a deep breath of relief It has gone he said faintly When you hear the boy s voice I asked 
4480-44312-0045	train-other-500	do you hear it continuously No at intervals sometimes longer sometimes shorter
none	none	 And thus far it comes to you suddenly and leaves you suddenly 
4480-44312-0046	train-other-500	Yes Do my questions annoy you I make no complaint he said sadly You can see for yourself I patiently suffer the punishment that I have deserved I contradicted him at once
4480-44312-0047	train-other-500	It is nothing of the sort It s a nervous malady which medical science can control and cure
none	none	 Wait till we get to London 
4480-44312-0048	train-other-500	This expression of opinion produced no effect on him
none	none	 I have taken the life of a fellow creature he said 
4480-44312-0049	train-other-500	I have closed the career of a young man who but for me might have lived long and happily and honorably
none	none	 Say what you may 
4480-44312-0050	train-other-500	I am of the race of Cain He had the mark set on his brow I have my ordeal Delude yourself if you like with false hopes I can endure and hope for nothing
none	none	 Good night VIII EARLY the next morning the good old butler came to me in great perturbation for a word of advice 
4480-44312-0051	train-other-500	Do come sir and look at the master
none	none	 I can t find it in my heart to wake him It was time to wake him if we were to go to London that day I went into the bedroom Although I was no doctor the restorative importance of that profound and quiet sleep impressed itself on me so strongly that I took the responsibility of leaving him undisturbed The event proved that I had acted wisely 
4480-44312-0052	train-other-500	He slept until noon There was no return of the torment of the voice as he called it poor fellow
none	none	 We passed a quiet day excepting one little interruption which I am warned not to pass over without a word of record in this narrative 
4480-44312-0053	train-other-500	We had returned from a ride Romayne had gone into the library to read
none	none	 and I was just leaving the stables after a look at some recent improvements when a pony chaise with a gentleman in it drove up to the door He asked politely if he might be allowed to see the house There were some fine pictures at Vange 
4480-44312-0054	train-other-500	as well as many interesting relics of antiquity and the rooms were shown in Romayne s absence to the very few travelers
none	none	 who were adventurous enough to cross the heathy desert that surrounded the Abbey On this occasion the stranger was informed that mister Romayne was at home He at once apologized with an appearance of disappointment however which induced me to step forward and speak to him 
4480-44312-0055	train-other-500	mister Romayne is not very well I said and I cannot venture to ask you into the house
none	none	 But you will be welcome I am sure to walk round the grounds 
4480-44312-0056	train-other-500	and to look at the ruins of the Abbey He thanked me and accepted the invitation I find no great difficulty in describing him generally He was elderly fat and cheerful buttoned up in a long black frockcoat and presenting that closely shaven face and that
none	none	 inveterate expression of watchful humility about the eyes which we all associate with the reverend personality of a priest To my surprise he seemed in some degree at least to know his way about the place He made straight for the dreary little lake 
4480-44312-0057	train-other-500	which I have already mentioned and stood looking at it with an interest which was so incomprehensible to me that I own I watched him He ascended the slope of the moorland and entered the gate which led to the grounds All that the gardeners had done to make the place attractive
4480-44312-0058	train-other-500	failed to claim his attention He walked past lawns shrubs and flower beds and only stopped at an old stone fountain which tradition declared to have been one of the ornaments of the garden in the time of the monks Having carefully examined this relic of antiquity
4480-44312-0059	train-other-500	he took a sheet of paper from his pocket and consulted it attentively It might have been a plan of the house and grounds or it might not I can only report that he took the path which led him by the shortest way to the ruined Abbey church
4480-44312-0060	train-other-500	As he entered the roofless inclosure he reverently removed his hat It was impossible for me to follow him any further without exposing myself to the risk of discovery I sat down on one of the fallen stones waiting to see him again
none	none	 It must have been at least half an hour before he appeared He thanked me for my kindness as composedly as if he had quite expected to find me in the place that I occupied I have been deeply interested in all that I have seen he said May I venture to ask what is perhaps an indiscreet question on the part of a stranger I ventured on my side to inquire what the question might be mister Romayne is indeed fortunate he resumed 
4480-44312-0061	train-other-500	in the possession of this beautiful place He is a young man I think Yes Is he married No Excuse my curiosity The owner of Vange Abbey is an interesting person to all good antiquaries like myself
4480-44312-0062	train-other-500	Many thanks again Good day His pony chaise took him away His last look rested not on me
none	none	 but on the old Abbey IX MY record of events approaches its conclusion On the next day we returned to the hotel in London At Romayne s suggestion I sent the same evening to my own house for any letters which might be waiting for me His mind still dwelt on the duel he was morbidly eager to know if any communication had been received from the French surgeon When the messenger returned with my letters 
4480-44312-0063	train-other-500	the Boulogne postmark was on one of the envelopes At Romayne s entreaty this was the letter that I opened first The surgeon s signature was at the end One motive for anxiety on my part was set at rest in the first lines
none	none	 After an official inquiry into the circumstances the French authorities had decided that it was not expedient to put the survivor of the duelists on his trial before a court of law 
4480-44312-0064	train-other-500	No jury hearing the evidence would find him guilty of the only charge that could be formally brought against him the charge of homicide by premeditation Homicide by misadventure occurring in a duel was not a punishable offense by the French law
4480-44312-0065	train-other-500	My correspondent cited many cases in proof of it strengthened by the publicly expressed opinion of the illustrious Berryer himself In a word we had nothing to fear
none	none	 The next page of the letter informed us that the police had surprised the card playing community with whom we had spent the evening at Boulogne and that the much bejeweled old landlady had been sent to prison for the offense of keeping a gambling house 
4480-44312-0066	train-other-500	It was suspected in the town that the General was more or less directly connected with certain disreputable circumstances discovered by the authorities
none	none	 In any case he had retired from active service 
4480-44312-0067	train-other-500	He and his wife and family had left Boulogne
none	none	 and had gone away in debt 
4480-44312-0068	train-other-500	No investigation had thus far succeeded in discovering the place of their retreat Reading this letter aloud to Romayne I was interrupted by him at the last sentence
none	none	 The inquiries must have been carelessly made he said 
4480-44312-0069	train-other-500	I will see to it myself What interest can you have in the inquiries I exclaimed The strongest possible interest he answered It has been my one hope to make some little atonement to the poor people whom I have so cruelly wronged
none	none	 If the wife and children are in distressed circumstances which seems to be only too likely I may place them beyond the reach of anxiety anonymously of course Give me the surgeon s address I shall write instructions for tracing them at my expense 
4480-44312-0070	train-other-500	merely announcing that an Unknown Friend desires to be of service to the General s family This appeared to me to be a most imprudent thing to do I said so plainly and quite in vain
none	none	 With his customary impetuosity he wrote the letter at once and sent it to the post that night X ON the question of submitting himself to medical advice which I now earnestly pressed upon him 
4480-44312-0071	train-other-500	Romayne was disposed to be equally unreasonable But in this case events declared themselves in my favor Lady Berrick s last reserves of strength had given way
none	none	 She had been brought to London in a dying state while we were at Vange Abbey 
4480-44312-0072	train-other-500	Romayne was summoned to his aunt s bedside on the third day of our residence at the hotel and was present at her death
none	none	 The impression produced on his mind roused the better part of his nature He was more distrustful of himself more accessible to persuasion than usual In this gentler frame of mind he received a welcome visit from an old friend to whom he was sincerely attached The visit of no great importance in itself led 
4480-44312-0073	train-other-500	as I have since been informed to very serious events in Romayne s later life
none	none	 For this reason I briefly relate what took place within my own healing 
4480-44312-0074	train-other-500	Lord Loring well known in society as the head of an old English Catholic family and the possessor of a magnificent gallery of pictures was distressed by the change for the worse which he perceived in Romayne when he called at the hotel
4480-44312-0075	train-other-500	I was present when they met and rose to leave the room feeling that the two friends might perhaps be embarrassed by the presence of a third person Romayne called me back Lord Loring ought to know what has happened to me he said I have no heart to speak of it myself
none	none	 Tell him everything and if he agrees with you I will submit to see the doctors 
4480-44312-0076	train-other-500	With those words he left us together It is almost needless to say that Lord Loring did agree with me He was himself disposed to think that the moral remedy in Romayne s case might prove to be the best remedy
none	none	 With submission to what the doctors may decide his lordship said the right thing to do in my opinion is to divert our friend s mind from himself I see a plain necessity for making a complete change in the solitary life that he has been leading for years past 
4480-44312-0077	train-other-500	Why shouldn t he marry A woman s influence by merely giving a new turn to his thoughts might charm away that horrible voice which haunts him Perhaps you think this a merely sentimental view of the case Look at it practically if you like and you come to the same conclusion
4480-44312-0078	train-other-500	With that fine estate and with the fortune which he has now inherited from his aunt it is his duty to marry Don t you agree with me I agree most cordially But I see serious difficulties in your lordship s way
4480-44312-0079	train-other-500	Romayne dislikes society and as to marrying his coldness toward women seems so far as I can judge to be one of the incurable defects of his character Lord Loring smiled My dear sir
4480-44312-0080	train-other-500	nothing of that sort is incurable if we can only find the right woman The tone in which he spoke suggested to me that he had got the right woman and I took the liberty of saying so He at once acknowledged that I had guessed right
none	none	 Romayne is as you say a difficult subject to deal with he resumed If I commit the slightest imprudence I shall excite his suspicion and there will be an end of my hope of being of service to him I shall proceed carefully I can tell you Luckily poor dear fellow he is fond of pictures It s quite natural that I should ask him to see some recent additions to my gallery isn t it There is the trap that I set I have a sweet girl to tempt him staying at my house who is a little out of health and spirits herself 
4480-44312-0081	train-other-500	At the right moment I shall send word upstairs She may well happen to look in at the gallery by the merest accident just at the time when Romayne is looking at my new pictures The rest depends of course on the effect she produces
none	none	 If you knew her I believe you would agree with me that the experiment is worth trying Not knowing the lady I had little faith in the success of the experiment 
4480-44312-0082	train-other-500	No one however could doubt Lord Loring s admirable devotion to his friend and with that I was fain to be content
none	none	 When Romayne returned to us it was decided to submit his case to a consultation of physicians at the earliest possible moment 
4480-44312-0083	train-other-500	When Lord Loring took his departure I accompanied him to the door of the hotel perceiving that he wished to say a word more to me in private He had it seemed decided on waiting for the result of the medical consultation before he tried the effect of the young lady s attractions
4480-44312-0084	train-other-500	and he wished to caution me against speaking prematurely of visiting the picture gallery to our friend Not feeling particularly interested in these details of the worthy nobleman s little plot I looked at his carriage and privately admired the two splendid horses that drew it
none	none	 The footman opened the door for his master and I became aware for the first time that a gentleman had accompanied Lord Loring to the hotel and had waited for him in the carriage The gentleman bent forward and looked up from a book that he was reading To my astonishment 
4480-44312-0085	train-other-500	I recognized the elderly fat and cheerful priest who had shown such a knowledge of localities and such an extraordinary interest in Vange Abbey
none	none	 It struck me as an odd coincidence that I should see the man again in London so soon after I had met with him in Yorkshire This was all I thought about it at the time If I had known then what I know now I might have dreamed let us say of throwing that priest into the lake at Vange 
4480-44312-0086	train-other-500	and might have reckoned the circumstance among the wisely improved opportunities of my life To return to the serious interests of the present narrative I may now announce that my evidence as an eye witness of events has come to an end
none	none	 The day after Lord Loring s visit domestic troubles separated me to my most sincere regret from Romayne I have only to add that the foregoing narrative of personal experience has been written with a due sense of responsibility 
4480-44312-0087	train-other-500	and that it may be depended on throughout as an exact statement of the truth
none	none	 JOHN PHILIP HYND late Major one hundred and tenth Regiment THE STORY BOOK THE FIRST CHAPTER I THE CONFIDENCES IN an upper room of one of the palatial houses which are situated on the north side of Hyde Park two ladies sat at breakfast and gossiped over their tea The elder of the two was Lady Loring still in the prime of life possessed of the golden hair and the clear blue eyes the delicately florid complexion and the freely developed figure which are among the favorite attractions popularly associated with the beauty of Englishwomen Her younger companion was the unknown lady admired by Major Hynd on the sea passage from France to England With hair and eyes of the darkest brown with a pure pallor of complexion only changing to a faint rose tint in moments of agitation with a tall graceful figure incompletely developed in substance and strength she presented an almost complete contrast to Lady Loring Two more opposite types of beauty it would have been hardly possible to place at the same table The servant brought in the letters of the morning Lady Loring ran through her correspondence rapidly pushed away the letters in a heap and poured herself out a second cup of tea Nothing interesting this morning for me she said Any news of your mother Stella The young lady handed an open letter to her hostess with a faint smile See for yourself Adelaide she answered with the tender sweetness of tone which made her voice irresistibly charming and tell me if there were ever two women so utterly unlike each other as my mother and myself Lady Loring ran through the letter as she had run through her own correspondence Never dearest Stella have I enjoyed myself as I do in this delightful country house twenty seven at dinner every day without including the neighbors a little carpet dance every evening we play billiards and go into the smoking room the hounds meet three times a week all sorts of celebrities among the company famous beauties included such dresses such conversation and serious duties my dear not neglected high church and choral service in the town on Sundays recitations in the evening from Paradise Lost by an amateur elocutionist oh you foolish headstrong child why did you make excuses and stay in London when you might have accompanied me to this earthly Paradise are you really ill my love to Lady Loring and of course if you are ill you must have medical advice they ask after you so kindly here the first dinner bell is ringing before I have half done my letter what am I to wear why is my daughter not here to advise me et cetera et cetera et cetera There is time to change your mind and advise your mother Lady Loring remarked with grave irony as she returned the letter Don t even speak of it said Stella I really know no life that I should not prefer to the life that my mother is enjoying at this moment What should I have done Adelaide if you had not offered me a happy refuge in your house My earthly Paradise is here where I am allowed to dream away my time over my drawings and my books and to resign myself to poor health and low spirits without being dragged into society and worse still threatened with that medical advice in which when she isn t threatened with it herself my poor dear mother believes so implicitly I wish you would hire me as your companion and let me stay here for the rest of my life Lady Loring s bright face became grave while Stella was speaking My dear she said kindly I know well how you love retirement and how differently you think and feel from other young women of your age And I am far from forgetting what sad circumstances have encouraged the natural bent of your disposition But since you have been staying with me this time I see something in you which my intimate knowledge of your character fails to explain We have been friends since we were together at school and in those old days we never had any secrets from each other You are feeling some anxiety or brooding over some sorrow of which I know nothing I don t ask for your confidence I only tell you what I have noticed and I say with all my heart Stella I am sorry for you She rose and with intuitive delicacy changed the subject I am going out earlier than usual this morning she resumed Is there anything I can do for you She laid her hand tenderly on Stella s shoulder waiting for the reply Stella lifted the hand and kissed it with passionate fondness Don t think me ungrateful she said I am only ashamed Her head sank on her bosom she burst into tears Lady Loring waited by her in silence She well knew the girl s self contained nature always shrinking except in moments of violent emotion from the outward betrayal of its trials and its sufferings to others The true depth of feeling which is marked by this inbred modesty is most frequently found in men The few women who possess it are without the communicative consolations of the feminine heart They are the noblest and but too often the unhappiest of their sex Will you wait a little before you go out Stella asked softly Lady Loring returned to the chair that she had left hesitated for a moment and then drew it nearer to Stella Shall I sit by you she said Close by me You spoke of our school days just now Adelaide There was some difference between us Of all the girls I was the youngest and you were the eldest or nearly the eldest I think Quite the eldest my dear There is a difference of ten years between us But why do you go back to that It s only a recollection My father was alive then I was at first home sick and frightened in the strange place among the big girls You used to let me hide my face on your shoulder and tell me stories May I hide in the old way and tell my story She was now the calmest of the two The elder woman turned a little pale and looked down in silent anxiety at the darkly beautiful head that rested on her shoulder After such an experience as mine has been said Stella would you think it possible that I could ever again feel my heart troubled by a man and that man a stranger My dear I think it quite possible You are only now in your twenty third year You were innocent of all blame at that wretched by gone time which you ought never to speak of again Love and be happy Stella if you can only find the man who is worthy of you But you frighten me when you speak of a stranger Where did you meet with him On our way back from Paris Traveling in the same carriage with you No it was in crossing the Channel There were few travelers in the steamboat or I might never have noticed him Did he speak to you I don t think he even looked at me That doesn t say much for his taste Stella You don t understand I mean I have not explained myself properly He was leaning on the arm of a friend weak and worn and wasted as I supposed by some long and dreadful illness There was an angelic sweetness in his face such patience such resignation For heaven s sake keep my secret One hears of men falling in love with women at first sight But a woman who looks at a man and feels oh it s shameful I could hardly take my eyes off him If he had looked at me in return I don t know what I should have done I burn when I think of it He was absorbed in his suffering and his sorrow My last look at his beautiful face was on the pier before they took me away The perfect image of him has been in my heart ever since In my dreams I see him as plainly as I see you now Don t despise me Adelaide My dear you interest me indescribably Do you suppose he was in our rank of life I mean of course did he look like a gentleman There could be no doubt of it Do try to describe him Stella Was he tall and well dressed Neither tall nor short rather thin quiet and graceful in all his movements dressed plainly in perfect taste How can I describe him When his friend brought him on board he stood at the side of the vessel looking out thoughtfully toward the sea Such eyes I never saw before Adelaide in any human face so divinely tender and sad and the color of them that dark violet blue so uncommon and so beautiful too beautiful for a man I may say the same of his hair I saw it completely For a minute or two he removed his hat his head was fevered I think and he let the sea breeze blow over it The pure light brown of his hair was just warmed by a lovely reddish tinge His beard was of the same color short and curling like the beards of the Roman heroes one sees in pictures I shall never see him again and it is best for me that I shall not What can I hope from a man who never once noticed me But I should like to hear that he had recovered his health and his tranquillity and that his life was a happy one It has been a comfort to me Adelaide to open my heart to you I am getting bold enough to confess everything Would you laugh at me I wonder if I She stopped Her pale complexion softly glowed into color her grand dark eyes brightened she looked her loveliest at that moment I am far more inclined Stella to cry over you than to laugh at you said Lady Loring There is something to my mind very sad about this adventure of yours I wish I could find out who the man is Even the best description of a person falls so short of the reality I thought of showing you something Stella continued which might help you to see him as I saw him It s only making one more acknowledgment of my own folly You don t mean a portrait of him Lady Loring exclaimed The best that I could do from recollection Stella answered sadly Bring it here directly Stella left the room and returned with a little drawing in pencil The instant Lady Loring looked at it she recognized Romayne and started excitedly to her feet You know him cried Stella Lady Loring had placed herself in an awkward position Her husband had described to her his interview with Major Hynd and had mentioned his project for bringing Romayne and Stella together after first exacting a promise of the strictest secrecy from his wife She felt herself bound doubly bound after what she had now discovered to respect the confidence placed in her and this at the time when she had betrayed herself to Stella With a woman s feline fineness of perception in all cases of subterfuge and concealment she picked a part of the truth out of the whole and answered harmlessly without a moment s hesitation I have certainly seen him she said probably at some party But I see so many people and I go to so many places that I must ask for time to consult my memory My husband might help me if you don t object to my asking him she added slyly Stella snatched the drawing away from her in terror You don t mean that you will tell Lord Loring she said My dear child how can you be so foolish Can t I show him the drawing without mentioning who it was done by His memory is a much better one than mine If I say to him Where did we meet that man he may tell me at once he may even remember the name Of course if you like to be kept in suspense you have only to say so It rests with you to decide Poor Stella gave way directly She returned the drawing and affectionately kissed her artful friend Having now secured the means of consulting her husband without exciting suspicion Lady Loring left the room At that time in the morning Lord Loring was generally to be found either in the library or the picture gallery His wife tried the library first On entering the room she found but one person in it not the person of whom she was in search There buttoned up in his long frock coat and surrounded by books of all sorts and sizes sat the plump elderly priest who had been the especial object of Major Hynd s aversion I beg your pardon Father Benwell said Lady Loring I hope I don t interrupt your studies Father Benwell rose and bowed with a pleasant paternal smile I am only trying to organize an improved arrangement of the library he said simply Books are companionable creatures members as it were of his family to a lonely old priest like myself Can I be of any service to your ladyship Thank you Father If you can kindly tell me where Lord Loring is To be sure His lordship was here five minutes since he is now in the picture gallery Pray permit me With a remarkably light and easy step for a man of his age and size he advanced to the further end of the library and opened a door which led into the gallery Lord Loring is among the pictures he announced And alone He laid a certain emphasis on the last word which might or might not in the case of a spiritual director of the household invite a word of explanation Lady Loring merely said Just what I wanted thank you once more Father Benwell and passed into the picture gallery Left by himself again in the library the priest walked slowly to and fro thinking His latent power and resolution began to show themselves darkly in his face A skilled observer would now have seen plainly revealed in him the habit of command and the capacity for insisting on his right to be obeyed From head to foot Father Benwell was one of those valuable soldiers of the Church who acknowledge no defeat and who improve every victory After a while he returned to the table at which he had been writing when Lady Loring entered the room An unfinished letter lay open on the desk He took up his pen and completed it in these words I have therefore decided on trusting this serious matter in the hands of Arthur Penrose I know he is young but we have to set against the drawback of his youth the counter merits of his incorruptible honesty and his true religious zeal No better man is just now within my reach and there is no time to lose Romayne has recently inherited a large increase of fortune He will be the object of the basest conspiracies conspiracies of men to win his money and worse still of women to marry him Even these contemptible efforts may be obstacles in the way of our righteous purpose unless we are first in the field Penrose left Oxford last week I expect him here this morning by my invitation When I have given him the necessary instructions and have found the means of favorably introducing him to Romayne I shall have the honor of forwarding a statement of our prospects so far Having signed these lines he addressed the letter to The Reverend the Secretary Society of Jesus Rome As he closed and sealed the envelope a servant opened the door communicating with the hall and announced mister Arthur Penrose CHAPTER II THE JESUITS FATHER BENWELL rose and welcomed the visitor with his paternal smile I am heartily glad to see you he said and held out his hand with a becoming mixture of dignity and cordiality Penrose lifted the offered hand respectfully to his lips As one of the Provincials of the Order Father Benwell occupied a high place among the English Jesuits He was accustomed to acts of homage offered by his younger brethren to their spiritual chief I fear you are not well he proceeded gently Your hand is feverish Arthur Thank you Father I am as well as usual Depression of spirits perhaps Father Benwell persisted Penrose admitted it with a passing smile My spirits are never very lively he said Father Benwell shook his head in gentle disapproval of a depressed state of spirits in a young man This must be corrected he remarked Cultivate cheerfulness Arthur I am myself thank God a naturally cheerful man My mind reflects in some degree and reflects gratefully the brightness and beauty which are part of the great scheme of creation A similar disposition is to be cultivated I know instances of it in my own experience Add one more instance and you will really gratify me In its seasons of rejoicing our Church is eminently cheerful Shall I add another encouragement A great trust is about to be placed in you Be socially agreeable or you will fail to justify the trust This is Father Benwell s little sermon I think it has a merit Arthur it is a sermon soon over Penrose looked up at his superior eager to hear more He was a very young man His large thoughtful well opened gray eyes and his habitual refinement and modesty of manner gave a certain attraction to his personal appearance of which it stood in some need In stature he was little and lean his hair had become prematurely thin over his broad forehead there were hollows already in his cheeks and marks on either side of his thin delicate lips He looked like a person who had passed many miserable hours in needlessly despairing of himself and his prospects With all this there was something in him so irresistibly truthful and sincere so suggestive even where he might be wrong of a purely conscientious belief in his own errors that he attached people to him without an effort and often without being aware of it himself What would his friends have said if they had been told that the religious enthusiasm of this gentle self distrustful melancholy man might in its very innocence of suspicion and self seeking be perverted to dangerous uses in unscrupulous hands His friends would one and all have received the scandalous assertion with contempt and Penrose himself if he had heard of it might have failed to control his temper for the first time in his life May I ask a question without giving offense he said timidly Father Benwell took his hand My dear Arthur let us open our minds to each other without reserve What is your question You have spoken Father of a great trust that is about to be placed in me Yes You are anxious no doubt to hear what it is I am anxious to know in the first place if it requires me to go back to Oxford Father Benwell dropped his young friend s hand Do you dislike Oxford he asked observing Penrose attentively Bear with me Father if I speak too confidently I dislike the deception which has obliged me to conceal that I am a Catholic and a priest Father Benwell set this little difficulty right with the air of a man who could make benevolent allowance for unreasonable scruples I think Arthur you forget two important considerations he said In the first place you have a dispensation from your superiors which absolves you of all responsibility in respect of the concealment that you have practiced In the second place we could only obtain information of the progress which our Church is silently making at the University by employing you in the capacity of let me say an independent observer However if it will contribute to your ease of mind I see no objection to informing you that you will not be instructed to return to Oxford Do I relieve you There could be no question of it Penrose breathed more freely in every sense of the word At the same time Father Benwell continued let us not misunderstand each other In the new sphere of action which we design for you you will not only be at liberty to acknowledge that you are a Catholic it will be absolutely necessary that you should do so But you will continue to wear the ordinary dress of an English gentleman and to preserve the strictest secrecy on the subject of your admission to the priesthood until you are further advised by myself Now dear Arthur read that paper It is the necessary preface to all that I have yet to say to you The paper contained a few pages of manuscript relating the early history of Vange Abbey in the days of the monks and the circumstances under which the property was confiscated to lay uses in the time of Henry the Eighth Penrose handed back the little narrative vehemently expressing his sympathy with the monks and his detestation of the King Compose yourself Arthur said Father Benwell smiling pleasantly We don t mean to allow Henry the Eighth to have it all his own way forever Penrose looked at his superior in blank bewilderment His superior withheld any further information for the present Everything in its turn the discreet Father resumed the turn of explanation has not come yet I have something else to show you first One of the most interesting relics in England Look here He unlocked a flat mahogany box and displayed to view some writings on vellum evidently of great age You have had a little sermon already he said You shall have a little story now No doubt you have heard of Newstead Abbey famous among the readers of poetry as the residence of Byron King Henry treated Newstead exactly as he treated Vange Abbey Many years since the lake at Newstead was dragged and the brass eagle which had served as the lectern in the old church was rescued from the waters in which it had lain for centuries A secret receptacle was discovered in the body of the eagle and the ancient title deeds of the Abbey were found in it The monks had taken that method of concealing the legal proof of their rights and privileges in the hope a vain hope I need hardly say that a time might come when Justice would restore to them the property of which they had been robbed Only last summer one of our bishops administering a northern diocese spoke of these circumstances to a devout Catholic friend and said he thought it possible that the precaution taken by the monks at Newstead might also have been taken by the monks at Vange The friend I should tell you was an enthusiast Saying nothing to the bishop whose position and responsibilities he was bound to respect he took into his confidence persons whom he could trust One night in the absence of the present proprietor or I should rather say the present usurper of the estate the lake at Vange was privately dragged with a result that proved the bishop s conjecture to be right Read those valuable documents Knowing your strict sense of honor my son and your admirable tenderness of conscience I wish you to be satisfied of the title of the Church to the lands of Vange by evidence which is beyond dispute With this little preface he waited while Penrose read the title deeds Any doubt on your mind he asked when the reading had come to an end Not the shadow of a doubt Is the Church s right to the property clear As clear Father as words can make it Very good We will lock up the documents Arbitrary confiscation Arthur even on the part of a king cannot override the law What the Church once lawfully possessed the Church has a right to recover Any doubt about that in your mind Only the doubt of how the Church can recover Is there anything in this particular case to be hoped from the law Nothing whatever And yet Father you speak as if you saw some prospect of the restitution of the property By what means can the restitution be made By peaceful and worthy means Father Benwell answered By honorable restoration of the confiscated property to the Church on the part of the person who is now in possession of it Penrose was surprised and interested Is the person a Catholic he asked eagerly Not yet Father Benwell laid a strong emphasis on those two little words His fat fingers drummed restlessly on the table his vigilant eyes rested expectantly on Penrose Surely you understand me Arthur he added after an interval The color rose slowly in the worn face of Penrose I am afraid to understand you he said Why I am not sure that it is my better sense which understands I am afraid Father it may be my vanity and presumption Father Benwell leaned back luxuriously in his chair I like that modesty he said with a relishing smack of his lips as if modesty was as good as a meal to him There is power of the right sort Arthur hidden under the diffidence that does you honor I am more than ever satisfied that I have been right in reporting you as worthy of this most serious trust I believe the conversion of the owner of Vange Abbey is in your hands no more than a matter of time May I ask what his name is Certainly His name is Lewis Romayne When do you introduce me to him Impossible to say I have not yet been introduced myself You don t know mister Romayne I have never even seen him These discouraging replies were made with the perfect composure of a man who saw his way clearly before him Sinking from one depth of perplexity to another Penrose ventured on putting one last question How am I to approach mister Romayne he asked I can only answer that Arthur by admitting you still further into my confidence It is disagreeable to me said the reverend gentleman with the most becoming humility to speak of myself But it must be done Shall we have a little coffee to help us through the coming extract from Father Benwell s autobiography Don t look so serious my son When the occasion justifies it let us take life lightly He rang the bell and ordered the coffee as if he was the master of the house The servant treated him with the most scrupulous respect He hummed a little tune and talked at intervals of the weather while they were waiting Plenty of sugar Arthur he inquired when the coffee was brought in No Even in trifles I should have been glad to feel that there was perfect sympathy between us I like plenty of sugar myself Having sweetened his coffee with the closest attention to the process he was at liberty to enlighten his young friend He did it so easily and so cheerfully that a far less patient man than Penrose would have listened to him with interest CHAPTER III THE INTRODUCTION TO ROMAYNE EXCEPTING my employment here in the library Father Benwell began and some interesting conversation with Lord Loring to which I shall presently allude I am almost as great a stranger in this house Arthur as yourself When the object which we now have in view was first taken seriously into consideration I had the honor of being personally acquainted with Lord Loring I was also aware that he was an intimate and trusted friend of Romayne Under these circumstances his lordship presented himself to our point of view as a means of approaching the owner of Vange Abbey without exciting distrust I was charged accordingly with the duty of establishing myself on terms of intimacy in this house By way of making room for me the spiritual director of Lord and Lady Loring was removed to a cure of souls in Ireland And here I am in his place By the way don t treat me when we are in the presence of visitors with any special marks of respect I am not Provincial of our Order in Lord Loring s house I am one of the inferior clergy Penrose looked at him with admiration It is a great sacrifice to make Father in your position and at your age Not at all Arthur A position of authority involves certain temptations to pride I feel this change as a lesson in humility which is good for me For example Lady Loring as I can plainly see dislikes and distrusts me Then again a young lady has recently arrived here on a visit She is a Protestant with all the prejudices incident to that way of thinking avoids me so carefully poor soul that I have never seen her yet These rebuffs are wholesome reminders of his fallible human nature to a man who has occupied a place of high trust and command Besides there have been obstacles in my way which have had an excellent effect in rousing my energies How do you feel Arthur when you encounter obstacles I do my best to remove them Father But I am sometimes conscious of a sense of discouragement Curious said Father Benwell I am only conscious myself of a sense of impatience What right has an obstacle to get in my way that is how I look at it For example the first thing I heard when I came here was that Romayne had left England My introduction to him was indefinitely delayed I had to look to Lord Loring for all the information I wanted relating to the man and his habits There was another obstacle Not living in the house I was obliged to find an excuse for being constantly on the spot ready to take advantage of his lordship s leisure moments for conversation I sat down in this room and I said to myself Before I get up again I mean to brush these impertinent obstacles out of my way The state of the books suggested the idea of which I was in search Before I left the house I was charged with the rearrangement of the library From that moment I came and went as often as I liked Whenever Lord Loring was disposed for a little talk there I was to lead the talk in the right direction And what is the result On the first occasion when Romayne presents himself I can place you in a position to become his daily companion All due Arthur in the first instance to my impatience of obstacles Amusing isn t it Penrose was perhaps deficient in the sense of humor Instead of being amused he appeared to be anxious for more information In what capacity am I to be mister Romayne s companion he asked Father Benwell poured himself out another cup of coffee Suppose I tell you first he suggested how circumstances present Romayne to us as a promising subject for conversion He is young still a single man not compromised by any illicit connection romantic sensitive highly cultivated No near relations are alive to influence him and to my certain knowledge his estate is not entailed He has devoted himself for years past to books and is collecting materials for a work of immense research on the Origin of Religions Some great sorrow or remorse Lord Loring did not mention what it was has told seriously on his nervous system already injured by night study Add to this that he is now within our reach He has lately returned to London and is living quite alone at a private hotel For some reason which I am not acquainted with he keeps away from Vange Abbey the very place as I should have thought for a studious man Penrose began to be interested Have you been to the Abbey he said I made a little excursion to that part of Yorkshire Arthur not long since A very pleasant trip apart from the painful associations connected with the ruin and profanation of a sacred place There is no doubt about the revenues I know the value of that productive part of the estate which stretches southward away from the barren region round the house Let us return for a moment to Romayne and to your position as his future companion He has had his books sent to him from Vange and has persuaded himself that continued study is the one remedy for his troubles whatever they may be At Lord Loring s suggestion a consultation of physicians was held on his case the other day Is he so ill as that Penrose exclaimed So it appears Father Benwell replied Lord Loring is mysteriously silent about the illness One result of the consultation I extracted from him in which you are interested The doctors protested against his employing himself on his proposed work He was too obstinate to listen to them There was but one concession that they could gain from him he consented to spare himself in some small degree by employing an amanuensis It was left to Lord Loring to find the man I was consulted by his lordship I was even invited to undertake the duty myself Each one in his proper sphere my son The person who converts Romayne must be young enough and pliable enough to be his friend and companion Your part is there Arthur you are the future amanuensis How does the prospect strike you now I beg your pardon Father I fear I am unworthy of the confidence which is placed in me In what way Penrose answered with unfeigned humility I am afraid I may fail to justify your belief in me he said unless I can really feel that I am converting mister Romayne for his own soul s sake However righteous the cause may be I cannot find in the restitution of the Church property a sufficient motive for persuading him to change his religious faith There is something so serious in the responsibility which you lay on me that I shall sink under the burden unless my whole heart is in the work If I feel attracted toward mister Romayne when I first see him if he wins upon me little by little until I love him like a brother then indeed I can promise that his conversion shall be the dearest object of my life But if there is not this intimate sympathy between us forgive me if I say it plainly I implore you to pass me over and to commit the task to the hands of another man His voice trembled his eyes moistened Father Benwell handled his young friend s rising emotion with the dexterity of a skilled angler humoring the struggles of a lively fish Good Arthur he said I see much too much dear boy of self seeking people It is as refreshing to me to hear you as a draught of water to a thirsty man At the same time let me suggest that you are innocently raising difficulties where no difficulties exist I have already mentioned as one of the necessities of the case that you and Romayne should be friends How can that be unless there is precisely that sympathy between you which you have so well described I am a sanguine man and I believe you will like each other Wait till you see him As the words passed his lips the door that led to the picture gallery was opened Lord Loring entered the library He looked quickly round him apparently in search of some person who might perhaps be found in the room A shade of annoyance showed itself in his face and disappeared again as he bowed to the two Jesuits Don t let me disturb you he said looking at Penrose Is this the gentleman who is to assist mister Romayne Father Benwell presented his young friend Arthur Penrose my lord I ventured to suggest that he should call here to day in case you wished to put any questions to him Quite needless after your recommendation Lord Loring answered graciously mister Penrose could not have come here at a more appropriate time As it happens mister Romayne has paid us a visit today he is now in the picture gallery The priests looked at each other Lord Loring left them as he spoke He walked to the opposite door of the library opened it glanced round the hall and at the stairs and returned again with the passing expression of annoyance visible once more Come with me to the gallery gentlemen he said I shall be happy to introduce you to mister Romayne Penrose accepted the proposal Father Benwell pointed with a smile to the books scattered about him With permission I will follow your lordship he said Who was my lord looking for That was the question in Father Benwell s mind while he put some of the books away on the shelves and collected the scattered papers on the table relating to his correspondence with Rome It had become a habit of his life to be suspicious of any circumstances occurring within his range of observation for which he was unable to account He might have felt some stronger emotion on this occasion if he had known that the conspiracy in the library to convert Romayne was matched by the conspiracy in the picture gallery to marry him Lady Loring s narrative of the conversation which had taken place between Stella and herself had encouraged her husband to try his proposed experiment without delay I shall send a letter at once to Romayne s hotel he said Inviting him to come here to day her ladyship inquired Yes I shall say I particularly wish to consult him about a picture Are we to prepare Stella to see him or would it be better to let the meeting take her by surprise Certainly not said Lady Loring With her sensitive disposition I am afraid of taking Stella by surprise Let me only tell her that Romayne is the original of her portrait and that he is likely to call on you to see the picture to day and leave the rest to me Lady Loring s suggestion was immediately carried out In the first fervor of her agitation Stella had declared that her courage was not equal to a meeting with Romayne on that day Becoming more composed she yielded to Lady Loring s persuasion so far as to promise that she would at least make the attempt to follow her friend to the gallery If I go down with you she said it will look as if we had arranged the thing between us I can t bear even to think of that Let me look in by myself as if it was by accident Consenting to this arrangement Lady Loring had proceeded alone to the gallery when Romayne s visit was announced The minutes passed and Stella did not appear It was quite possible that she might shrink from openly presenting herself at the main entrance to the gallery and might prefer especially if she was not aware of the priest s presence in the room to slip in quietly by the library door Failing to find her on putting this idea to the test Lord Loring had discovered Penrose and had so hastened the introduction of the younger of the two Jesuits to Romayne Having gathered his papers together Father Benwell crossed the library to the deep bow window which lighted the room and opened his dispatch box standing on a small table in the recess Placed in this position he was invisible to any person entering the room by the hall door He had secured his papers in the dispatch box and had just closed and locked it when he heard the door cautiously opened The instant afterward the rustling of a woman s dress over the carpet caught his ear Other men might have walked out of the recess and shown themselves Father Benwell stayed where he was and waited until the lady crossed his range of view The priest observed with cold attention her darkly beautiful eyes and hair her quickly changing color her modest grace of movement Slowly and in evident agitation she advanced to the door of the picture gallery and paused as if she was afraid to open it Father Benwell heard her sigh to herself softly Oh how shall I meet him She turned aside to the looking glass over the fire place The reflection of her charming face seemed to rouse her courage She retraced her steps and timidly opened the door Lord Loring must have been close by at the moment His voice immediately made itself heard in the library Come in Stella come in Here is a new picture for you to see and a friend whom I want to present to you who must be your friend too mister Lewis Romayne The door was closed again Father Benwell stood still as a statue in the recess with his head down deep in thought After a while he roused himself and rapidly returned to the writing table With a roughness strangely unlike his customary deliberation of movement he snatched a sheet of paper out of the case and frowning heavily wrote these lines on it Since my letter was sealed I have made a discovery which must be communicated without the loss of a post I greatly fear there may be a woman in our way Trust me to combat this obstacle as I have combated other obstacles In the meantime the work goes on Penrose has received his first instructions and has to day been presented to Romayne He addressed this letter to Rome as he had addressed the letter preceding it Now for the woman he said to himself and opened the door of the picture gallery CHAPTER IV FATHER BENWELL HITS ART has its trials as well as its triumphs It is powerless to assert itself against the sordid interests of everyday life The greatest book ever written the finest picture ever painted appeals in vain to minds preoccupied by selfish and secret cares On entering Lord Loring s gallery Father Benwell found but one person who was not looking at the pictures under false pretenses Innocent of all suspicion of the conflicting interests whose struggle now centered in himself Romayne was carefully studying the picture which had been made the pretext for inviting him to the house He had bowed to Stella with a tranquil admiration of her beauty he had shaken hands with Penrose and had said some kind words to his future secretary and then he had turned to the picture as if Stella and Penrose had ceased from that moment to occupy his mind In your place he said quietly to Lord Loring I should not buy this work Why not It seems to me to have the serious defect of the modern English school of painting A total want of thought in the rendering of the subject disguised under dexterous technical tricks of the brush When you have seen one of that man s pictures you have seen all He manufactures he doesn t paint Father Benwell came in while Romayne was speaking He went through the ceremonies of introduction to the master of Vange Abbey with perfect politeness but a little absently His mind was bent on putting his suspicion of Stella to the test of confirmation Not waiting to be presented he turned to her with the air of fatherly interest and chastened admiration which he well knew how to assume in his intercourse with women May I ask if you agree with mister Romayne s estimate of the picture he said in his gentlest tones She had heard of him and of his position in the house It was quite needless for Lady Loring to whisper to her Father Benwell my dear Her antipathy identified him as readily as her sympathy might have identified a man who had produced a favorable impression on her I have no pretension to be a critic she answered with frigid politeness I only know what I personally like or dislike The reply exactly answered Father Benwell s purpose It diverted Romayne s attention from the picture to Stella The priest had secured his opportunity of reading their faces while they were looking at each other I think you have just stated the true motive for all criticism Romayne said to Stella Whether we only express our opinions of pictures or books in the course of conversation or whether we assert them at full length with all the authority of print we are really speaking in either case of what personally pleases or repels us My poor opinion of that picture means that it says nothing to Me Does it say anything to You He smiled gently as he put the question to her but there was no betrayal of emotion in his eyes or in his voice Relieved of anxiety so far as Romayne was concerned Father Benwell looked at Stella Steadily as she controlled herself the confession of her heart s secret found its way into her face The coldly composed expression which had confronted the priest when she spoke to him melted away softly under the influence of Romayne s voice and Romayne s look Without any positive change of color her delicate skin glowed faintly as if it felt some animating inner warmth Her eyes and lips brightened with a new vitality her frail elegant figure seemed insensibly to strengthen and expand like the leaf of a flower under a favoring sunny air When she answered Romayne agreeing with him it is needless to say there was a tender persuasiveness in her tones shyly inviting him still to speak to her and still to look at her which would in itself have told Father Benwell the truth even if he had not been in a position to see her face Confirmed in his doubts of her he looked with concealed suspicion at Lady Loring next Sympathy with Stella was undisguisedly expressed to him in the honest blue eyes of Stella s faithful friend The discussion on the subject of the unfortunate picture was resumed by Lord Loring who thought the opinions of Romayne and Stella needlessly severe Lady Loring as usual agreed with her husband While the general attention was occupied in this way Father Benwell said a word to Penrose thus far a silent listener to the discourse on Art Have you seen the famous portrait of the first Lady Loring by Gainsborough he asked Without waiting for a reply he took Penrose by the arm and led him away to the picture which had the additional merit under present circumstances of hanging at the other end of the gallery How do you like Romayne Father Benwell put the question in low peremptory tones evidently impatient for a reply He interests me already said Penrose He looks so ill and so sad and he spoke to me so kindly In short Father Benwell interposed Romayne has produced a favorable impression on you Let us get on to the next thing You must produce a favorable impression on Romayne Penrose sighed With the best will to make myself agreeable to people whom I like he said I don t always succeed They used to tell me at Oxford that I was shy and I am afraid that is against me I wish I possessed some of your social advantages Father Leave it to me son Are they still talking about the picture Yes I have something more to say to you Have you noticed the young lady I thought her beautiful but she looks a little cold Father Benwell smiled When you are as old as I am he said you will not believe in appearances where women are concerned Do you know what I think of her Beautiful if you like and dangerous as well Dangerous In what way This is for your private ear Arthur She is in love with Romayne Wait a minute And Lady Loring unless I am entirely mistaken in what I observed knows it and favors it The beautiful Stella may be the destruction of all our hopes unless we keep Romayne out of her way These words were whispered with an earnestness and agitation which surprised Penrose His superior s equanimity was not easily overthrown Are you sure Father of what you say he asked I am quite sure or I should not have spoken Do you think mister Romayne returns the feeling Not yet luckily You must use your first friendly influence over him what is her name Her surname I mean Eyrecourt Miss Stella Eyrecourt Very well You must use your influence when you are quite sure that it is an influence to keep mister Romayne away from Miss Eyrecourt Penrose looked embarrassed I am afraid I should hardly know how to do that he said But I should naturally as his assistant encourage him to keep to his studies Whatever Arthur s superior might privately think of Arthur s reply he received it with outward indulgence That will come to the same thing he said Besides when I get the information I want this is strictly between ourselves I may be of some use in placing obstacles in the lady s way Penrose started Information he repeated What information Tell me something before I answer you said Father Benwell How old do you take Miss Eyrecourt to be I am not a good judge in such matters Between twenty and twenty five perhaps We will take her age at that estimate Arthur In former years I have had opportunities of studying women s characters in the confessional Can you guess what my experience tells me of Miss Eyrecourt No indeed A lady is not in love for the first time when she is between twenty and twenty five years old that is my experience said Father Benwell If I can find a person capable of informing me I may make some valuable discoveries in the earlier history of Miss Eyrecourt s life No more now We had better return to our friends CHAPTER V FATHER BENWELL MISSES THE group before the picture which had been the subject of dispute was broken up In one part of the gallery Lady Loring and Stella were whispering together on a sofa In another part Lord Loring was speaking privately to Romayne Do you think you will like mister Penrose his lordship asked Yes so far as I can tell at present He seems to be modest and intelligent You are looking ill my dear Romayne Have you again heard the voice that haunts you Romayne answered with evident reluctance I don t know why he said but the dread of hearing it again has oppressed me all this morning To tell you the truth I came here in the hope that the change might relieve me Has it done so Yes thus far Doesn t that suggest my friend that a greater change might be of use to you Don t ask me about it Loring I can go through my ordeal but I hate speaking of it Let us speak of something else then said Lord Loring What do you think of Miss Eyrecourt A very striking face full of expression and character Leonardo would have painted a noble portrait of her But there is something in her manner He stopped unwilling or unable to finish the sentence Something you don t like Lord Loring suggested No something I don t quite understand One doesn t expect to find any embarrassment in the manner of a well bred woman And yet she seemed to be embarrassed when she spoke to me Perhaps I produced an unfortunate impression on her Lord Loring laughed In any man but you Romayne I should call that affectation Why Romayne asked sharply Lord Loring looked unfeignedly surprised My dear fellow do you really think you are the sort of man who impresses a woman unfavorably at first sight For once in your life indulge in the amiable weakness of doing yourself justice and find a better reason for Miss Eyrecourt s embarrassment For the first time since he and his friend had been talking together Romayne turned toward Stella He innocently caught her in the act of looking at him A younger woman or a woman of weaker character would have looked away again Stella s noble head drooped her eyes sank slowly until they rested on her long white hands crossed upon her lap For a moment more Romayne looked at her with steady attention He roused himself and spoke to Lord Loring in lowered tones Have you known Miss Eyrecourt for a long time She is my wife s oldest and dearest friend I think Romayne you would feel interested in Stella if you saw more of her Romayne bowed in silent submission to Lord Loring s prophetic remark Let us look at the pictures he said quietly As he moved down the gallery the two priests met him Father Benwell saw his opportunity of helping Penrose to produce a favorable impression Forgive the curiosity of an old student mister Romayne he said in his pleasant cheerful way Lord Loring tells me you have sent to the country for your books Do you find a London hotel favorable to study It is a very quiet hotel Romayne answered and the people know my ways He turned to Arthur I have my own set of rooms mister Penrose he continued with a room at your disposal I used to enjoy the solitude of my house in the country My tastes have lately changed there are times now when I want to see the life in the streets as a relief Though we are in a hotel I can promise that you will not be troubled by interruptions when you kindly lend me the use of your pen Father Benwell answered before Penrose could speak You may perhaps find my young friend s memory of some use to you mister Romayne as well as his pen Penrose has studied in the Vatican Library If your reading leads you that way he knows more than most men of the rare old manuscripts which treat of the early history of Christianity This delicately managed reference to the projected work on The Origin of Religions produced its effect I should like very much mister Penrose to speak to you about those manuscripts Romayne said Copies of some of them may perhaps be in the British Museum Is it asking too much to inquire if you are disengaged this morning I am entirely at your service mister Romayne If you will kindly call at my hotel in an hour s time I shall have looked over my notes and shall be ready for you with a list of titles and dates There is the address With those words he advanced to take his leave of Lady Loring and Stella Father Benwell was a man possessed of extraordinary power of foresight but he was not infallible Seeing that Romayne was on the point of leaving the house and feeling that he had paved the way successfully for Romayne s amanuensis he too readily assumed that there was nothing further to be gained by remaining in the gallery Moreover the interval before Penrose called at the hotel might be usefully filled up by some wise words of advice relating to the religious uses to which he might turn his intercourse with his employer Making one of his ready and plausible excuses he accordingly returned with Penrose to the library and so committed as he himself discovered at a later time one of the few mistakes in the long record of his life In the meanwhile Romayne was not permitted to bring his visit to a conclusion without hospitable remonstrance on the part of Lady Loring She felt for Stella with a woman s enthusiastic devotion to the interests of true love and she had firmly resolved that a matter so trifling as the cultivation of Romayne s mind should not be allowed to stand in the way of the far more important enterprise of opening his heart to the influence of the sex Stay and lunch with us she said when he held out his hand to bid her good by Thank you Lady Loring I never take lunch Well then come and dine with us no party only ourselves Tomorrow and next day we are disengaged Which day shall it be Romayne still resisted You are very kind In my state of health I am unwilling to make engagements which I may not be able to keep Lady Loring was just as resolute on her side She appealed to Stella mister Romayne persists my dear in putting me off with excuses Try if you can persuade him I am not likely to have any influence Adelaide The tone in which she replied struck Romayne He looked at her Her eyes gravely meeting his eyes held him with a strange fascination She was not herself conscious how openly all that was noble and true in her nature all that was most deeply and sensitively felt in her aspirations spoke at that moment in her look Romayne s face changed he turned pale under the new emotion that she had roused in him Lady Loring observed him attentively Perhaps you underrate your influence Stella she suggested Stella remained impenetrable to persuasion I have only been introduced to mister Romayne half an hour since she said I am not vain enough to suppose that I can produce a favorable impression on any one in so short a time She had expressed in other words Romayne s own idea of himself in speaking of her to Lord Loring He was struck by the coincidence Perhaps we have begun Miss Eyrecourt by misinterpreting one another he said We may arrive at a better understanding when I have the honor of meeting you again He hesitated and looked at Lady Loring She was not the woman to let a fair opportunity escape her We will say to morrow evening she resumed at seven o clock To morrow said Romayne He shook hands with Stella and left the picture gallery Thus far the conspiracy to marry him promised even more hopefully than the conspiracy to convert him And Father Benwell carefully instructing Penrose in the next room was not aware of it But the hours in their progress mark the march of events as surely as they mark the march of time The day passed the evening came and with its coming the prospects of the conversion brightened in their turn Let Father Benwell himself relate how it happened in an extract from his report to Rome written the same evening I had arranged with Penrose that he should call at my lodgings and tell me how he had prospered at the first performance of his duties as secretary to Romayne The moment he entered the room the signs of disturbance in his face told me that something serious had happened I asked directly if there had been any disagreement between Romayne and himself He repeated the word with every appearance of surprise Disagreement he said No words can tell how sincerely I feel for mister Romayne I cannot express to you Father how eager I am to be of service to him Relieved so far I naturally asked what had happened Penrose betrayed a marked embarrassment in answering my question I have innocently surprised a secret he said on which I had no right to intrude All that I can honorably tell you shall be told Add one more to your many kindnesses don t command me to speak when it is my duty toward a sorely tried man to be silent even to you It is needless to say that I abstained from directly answering this strange appeal Let me hear what you can tell I replied and then we shall see Upon this he spoke I need hardly recall to your memory how careful we were in first planning the attempt to recover the Vange property to assure ourselves of the promise of success which the peculiar character of the present owner held out to us In reporting what Penrose said I communicate a discovery which I venture to think will be as welcome to you as it was to me He began by reminding me of what I had myself told him in speaking of Romayne You mentioned having heard from Lord Loring of a great sorrow or remorse from which he was suffering Penrose said I know what he suffers and why he suffers and with what noble resignation he submits to his affliction We were sitting together at the table looking over his notes and memoranda when he suddenly dropped the manuscript from which he was reading to me A ghastly paleness overspread his face He started up and put both his hands to his ears as if he heard something dreadful and was trying to deafen himself to it I ran to the door to call for help He stopped me he spoke in faint gasping tones forbidding me to call any one in to witness what he suffered It was not the first time he said it would soon be over If I had not courage to remain with him I could go and return when he was himself again I so pitied him that I found the courage to remain When it was over he took me by the hand and thanked me I had stayed by him like a friend he said and like a friend he would treat me Sooner or later those were his exact words I must be taken into his confidence and it should be now He told me his melancholy story I implore you Father don t ask me to repeat it Be content if I tell you the effect of it on myself The one hope the one consolation for him is in our holy religion With all my heart I devote myself to his conversion and in my inmost soul I feel the conviction that I shall succeed To this effect and in this tone Penrose spoke I abstained from pressing him to reveal Romayne s confession The confession is of no consequence to us You know how the moral force of Arthur s earnestness and enthusiasm fortifies his otherwise weak character I too believe he will succeed To turn for a moment to another subject You are already informed that there is a woman in our way I have my own idea of the right method of dealing with this obstacle when it shows itself more plainly For the present I need only assure you that neither this woman nor any woman shall succeed in her designs on Romayne if I can prevent it Having completed his report in these terms Father Benwell reverted to the consideration of his proposed inquiries into the past history of Stella s life Reflection convinced him that it would be unwise to attempt no matter how guardedly to obtain the necessary information from Lord Loring or his wife If he assumed at his age to take a strong interest in a Protestant young lady who had notoriously avoided him they would certainly feel surprise and surprise might in due course of development turn to suspicion There was but one other person under Lord Loring s roof to whom he could address himself and that person was the housekeeper As an old servant possessing Lady Loring s confidence she might prove a source of information on the subject of Lady Loring s fair friend and as a good Catholic she would feel flattered by the notice of the spiritual director of the household It may not be amiss thought Father Benwell if I try the housekeeper CHAPTER VI THE ORDER OF THE DISHES WHEN Miss Notman assumed the post of housekeeper in Lady Loring s service she was accurately described as a competent and respectable person and was praised with perfect truth for her incorruptible devotion to the interests of her employers On its weaker side her character was represented by the wearing of a youthful wig and the erroneous conviction that she still possessed a fine figure The ruling idea in her narrow little mind was the idea of her own dignity Any offense offered in this direction oppressed her memory for days together and found its way outward in speech to any human being whose attention she could secure At five o clock on the day which followed his introduction to Romayne Father Benwell sat drinking his coffee in the housekeeper s room to all appearance as much at his ease as if he had known Miss Notman from the remote days of her childhood A new contribution to the housekeeper s little library of devotional works lay on the table and bore silent witness to the means by which he had made those first advances which had won him his present position Miss Notman s sense of dignity was doubly flattered She had a priest for her guest and a new book with the reverend gentleman s autograph inscribed on the title page Is your coffee to your liking Father A little more sugar if you please Miss Notman was proud of her hand viewed as one of the meritorious details of her figure She took up the sugar tongs with suavity and grace she dropped the sugar into the cup with a youthful pleasure in ministering to the minor desires of her illustrious guest It is so good of you Father to honor me in this way she said with the appearance of sixteen super induced upon the reality of sixty Father Benwell was an adept at moral disguises of all kinds On this occasion he wore the disguise of pastoral simplicity I am an idle old man at this hour of the afternoon he said I hope I am not keeping you from any household duties I generally enjoy my duties Miss Notman answered To day they have not been so agreeable as usual it is a relief to me to have done with them Even my humble position has its trials Persons acquainted with Miss Notman s character hearing these last words would have at once changed the subject When she spoke of her humble position she invariably referred to some offense offered to her dignity and she was invariably ready to state the grievance at full length Ignorant of this peculiarity Father Benwell committed a fatal error He inquired with courteous interest what the housekeeper s trials might be Oh sir they are beneath your notice said Miss Notman modestly At the same time I should feel it an honor to have the benefit of your opinion I should so like to know that you do not altogether disapprove of my conduct under some provocation You see Father the whole responsibility of ordering the dinners falls on me And when there is company as there is this evening the responsibility is particularly trying to a timid person like myself A large dinner party Miss Notman Oh dear no Quite the reverse Only one gentleman mister Romayne Father Benwell set down his cup of coffee half way to his lips He at once drew the correct conclusion that the invitation to Romayne must have been given and accepted after he had left the picture gallery That the object was to bring Romayne and Stella together under circumstances which would rapidly improve their acquaintance was as plain to him as if he had heard it confessed in so many words If he had only remained in the gallery he might have become acquainted with the form of persuasion used to induce a man so unsocial as Romayne to accept an invitation I have myself to blame he thought bitterly for being left in the dark Anything wrong with the coffee Miss Notman asked anxiously He rushed on his fate He said Nothing whatever Pray go on Miss Notman went on You see Father Lady Loring was unusually particular about the dinner on this occasion She said Lord Loring reminds me that mister Romayne is a very little eater and yet very difficult to please in what he does eat Of course I consulted my experience and suggested exactly the sort of dinner that was wanted under the circumstances I wish to do her ladyship the utmost justice She made no objection to the dinner in itself On the contrary she complimented me on what she was pleased to call my ready invention But when we came next to the order in which the dishes were to be served Miss Notman paused in the middle of the sentence and shuddered over the private and poignant recollections which the order of the dishes called up By this time Father Benwell had discovered his mistake He took a mean advantage of Miss Notman s susceptibilities to slip his own private inquiries into the interval of silence Pardon my ignorance he said my own poor dinner is a matter of ten minutes and one dish I don t understand a difference of opinion on a dinner for three people only Lord and Lady Loring two mister Romayne three oh perhaps I am mistaken Perhaps Miss Eyrecourt makes a fourth Certainly Father A very charming person Miss Notman I only speak as a stranger You no doubt are much better acquainted with Miss Eyrecourt Much better indeed if I may presume to say so Miss Notman replied She is my lady s intimate friend we have often talked of Miss Eyrecourt during the many years of my residence in this house On such subjects her ladyship treats me quite on the footing of a humble friend A complete contrast to the tone she took Father when we came to the order of the dishes We agreed of course about the soup and the fish but we had a little a very little divergence of opinion as I may call it on the subject of the dishes to follow Her ladyship said First the sweetbreads and then the cutlets I ventured to suggest that the sweetbreads as white meat had better not immediately follow the turbot as white fish The brown meat my lady I said as an agreeable variety presented to the eye and then the white meat recalling pleasant remembrances of the white fish You see the point Father I see Miss Notman that you are a consummate mistress of an art which is quite beyond poor me Was Miss Eyrecourt present at the little discussion Oh no Indeed I should have objected to her presence I should have said she was a young lady out of her proper place Yes I understand Is Miss Eyrecourt an only child She had two sisters Father Benwell One of them is in a convent Ah indeed And the other is dead Sad for the father and mother Miss Notman Pardon me sad for the mother no doubt The father died long since Aye aye A sweet woman the mother At least I think I have heard so Miss Notman shook her head I should wish to guard myself against speaking unjustly of any one she said but when you talk of a sweet woman you imply as it seems to me the domestic virtues missus Eyrecourt is essentially a frivolous person A frivolous person is in the vast majority of cases a person easily persuaded to talk and not disposed to be reticent in keeping secrets Father Benwell began to see his way already to the necessary information Is missus Eyrecourt living in London he inquired Oh dear no At this time of year she lives entirely in other people s houses goes from one country seat to another and only thinks of amusing herself No domestic qualities Father She would know nothing of the order of the dishes Lady Loring I should have told you gave way in the matter of the sweetbread It was only at quite the latter part of my Menoo as the French call it that she showed a spirit of opposition well well I won t dwell on that I will only ask you Father at what part of a dinner an oyster omelet ought to be served Father Benwell seized his opportunity of discovering missus Eyrecourt s present address My dear lady he said I know no more when the omelet ought to be served than missus Eyrecourt herself It must be very pleasant to a lady of her way of thinking to enjoy the beauties of Nature inexpensively as seen in other people s houses from the point of view of a welcome guest I wonder whether she is staying at any country seat which I happen to have seen She may be in England Scotland or Ireland for all I know Miss Notman answered with an unaffected ignorance which placed her good faith beyond doubt Consult your own taste Father After eating jelly cream and ice pudding could you even look at an oyster omelet without shuddering Would you believe it Her ladyship proposed to serve the omelet with the cheese Oysters after sweets I am not as yet a married woman Father Benwell made a last desperate effort to pave the way for one more question before he submitted to defeat That must be your fault my dear lady he interposed with his persuasive smile Miss Notman simpered You confuse me Father she said softly I speak from inward conviction Miss Notman To a looker on like myself it is sad to see how many sweet women who might be angels in the households of worthy men prefer to lead a single life The Church I know exalts the single life to the highest place But even the Church allows exceptions to its rule Under this roof for example I think I see two exceptions One of them my unfeigned respect he bowed to Miss Notman forbids me to indicate more particularly The other seems to my humble view to be the young lady of whom we have been speaking Is it not strange that Miss Eyrecourt has never been married The trap had been elaborately set Father Benwell had every reason to anticipate that Miss Notman would walk into it The disconcerting housekeeper walked up to it and then proved unable to advance a step further I once made the same remark myself to Lady Loring she said Father Benwell s pulse began to quicken its beat Yes he murmured in tones of the gentlest encouragement And her ladyship Miss Notman proceeded did not encourage me to go on There are reasons for not pursuing that subject she said reasons into which I am sure you will not expect me to enter She spoke with a flattering confidence in my prudence which I felt gratefully Such a contrast to her tone when the omelet presented itself in the order of the dishes As I said just now I am not a married woman But if I proposed to my husband to give him an oyster omelet after his puddings and his pies I should not be surprised if he said to me My dear have you taken leave of your senses I reminded Lady Loring most respectfully that a cheese omelette might be in its proper place if it followed the sweets An oyster omelet I suggested surely comes after the birds I should be sorry to say that her ladyship lost her temper I will only mention that I kept mine Let me repeat what she said and leave you Father to draw your own conclusions She said Which of us is mistress in this house Miss Notman I order the oyster omelet to come in with the cheese There was not only irritability there was contempt oh yes contempt in her tone Out of respect for myself I made no reply As a Christian I can forgive as a wounded gentlewoman I may not find it so easy to forget Miss Notman laid herself back in her easy chair she looked as if she had suffered martyrdom and only regretted having been obliged to mention it Father Benwell surprised the wounded gentlewoman by rising to his feet You are not going away already Father Time flies fast in your society dear Miss Notman I have an engagement and I am late for it already The housekeeper smiled sadly At least let me hear that you don t disapprove of my conduct under trying circumstances she said Father Benwell took her hand A true Christian only feels offenses to pardon them he remarked in his priestly and paternal character You have shown me Miss Notman that you are a true Christian My evening has indeed been well spent God bless you He pressed her hand he shed on her the light of his fatherly smile he sighed and took his leave Miss Notman s eyes followed him out with devotional admiration Father Benwell still preserved his serenity of temper when he was out of the housekeeper s sight One important discovery he had made in spite of the difficulties placed in his way A compromising circumstance had unquestionably occurred in Stella s past life and in all probability a man was in some way connected with it My evening has not been entirely thrown away he thought as he ascended the stairs which led from the housekeeper s room to the hall CHAPTER VII THE INFLUENCE OF STELLA ENTERING the hall Father Benwell heard a knock at the house door The servants appeared to recognize the knock the porter admitted Lord Loring Father Benwell advanced and made his bow It was a perfect obeisance of its kind respect for Lord Loring unobtrusively accompanied by respect for himself Has your lordship been walking in the park he inquired I have been out on business Lord Loring answered and I should like to tell you about it If you can spare me a few minutes come into the library Some time since he resumed when the door was closed I think I mentioned that my friends had been speaking to me on a subject of some importance the subject of opening my picture gallery occasionally to the public I remember said Father Benwell Has your lordship decided what to do Yes I have decided as the phrase is to go with the times and follow the example of other owners of picture galleries Don t suppose I ever doubted that it is my duty to extend to the best of my ability the civilizing influences of Art My only hesitation in the matter arose from a dread of some accident happening or some injury being done to the pictures Even now I can only persuade myself to try the experiment under certain restrictions A wise decision undoubtedly said Father Benwell In such a city as this you could hardly open your gallery to anybody who happens to pass the house door I am glad you agree with me Father The gallery will be open for the first time on Monday Any respectably dressed person presenting a visiting card at the offices of the librarians in Bond Street and Regent Street will receive a free ticket of admission the number of tickets it is needless to say being limited and the gallery being only open to the public two days in the week You will be here I suppose on Monday Certainly My work in the library as your lordship can see has only begun I am very anxious about the success of this experiment said Lord Loring Do look in at the gallery once or twice in the course of the day and tell me what your own impression is Having expressed his readiness to assist the experiment in every possible way Father Benwell still lingered in the library He was secretly conscious of a hope that he might at the eleventh hour be invited to join Romayne at the dinner table Lord Loring only looked at the clock on the mantel piece it was nearly time to dress for dinner The priest had no alternative but to take the hint and leave the house Five minutes after he had withdrawn a messenger delivered a letter for Lord Loring in which Father Benwell s interests were directly involved The letter was from Romayne it contained his excuses for breaking his engagement literally at an hour s notice Only yesterday he wrote I had a return of what you my dear friend call the delusion of the voice The nearer the hour of your dinner approaches the more keenly I fear that the same thing may happen in your house Pity me and forgive me Even good natured Lord Loring felt some difficulty in pitying and forgiving when he read these lines This sort of caprice might be excusable in a woman he thought A man ought really to be capable of exercising some self control Poor Stella And what will my wife say He walked up and down the library with Stella s disappointment and Lady Loring s indignation prophetically present in his mind There was however no help for it he must accept his responsibility and be the bearer of the bad news He was on the point of leaving the library when a visitor appeared The visitor was no less a person than Romayne himself Have I arrived before my letter he asked eagerly Lord Loring showed him the letter Throw it into the fire he said and let me try to excuse myself for having written it You remember the happier days when you used to call me the creature of impulse An impulse produced that letter Another impulse brings me here to disown it I can only explain my strange conduct by asking you to help me at the outset Will you carry your memory back to the day of the medical consultation on my case I want you to correct me if I inadvertently misrepresent my advisers Two of them were physicians The third and last was a surgeon a personal friend of yours and he as well as I recollect told you how the consultation ended Quite right Romayne so far The first of the two physicians Romayne proceeded declared my case to be entirely attributable to nervous derangement and to be curable by purely medical means I speak ignorantly but in plain English that I believe was the substance of what he said The substance of what he said Lord Loring replied and the substance of his prescriptions which I think you afterward tore up If you have no faith in a prescription said Romayne that is in my opinion the best use to which you can put it When it came to the turn of the second physician he differed with the first as absolutely as one man can differ with another The third medical authority your friend the surgeon took a middle course and brought the consultation to an end by combining the first physician s view and the second physician s view and mingling the two opposite forms of treatment in one harmonious result Lord Loring remarked that this was not a very respectful way of describing the conclusion of the medical proceedings That it was the conclusion however he could not honestly deny As long as I am right said Romayne nothing else appears to be of much importance As I told you at the time the second physician appeared to me to be the only one of the three authorities who really understood my case Do you mind giving me in few words your own impression of what he said Are you sure that I shall not distress you On the contrary you may help me to hope As I remember it said Lord Loring the doctor did not deny the influence of the body over the mind He was quite willing to admit that the state of your nervous system might be one among other predisposing causes which led you I really hardly like to go on Which led me Romayne continued finishing the sentence for his friend to feel that I never shall forgive myself accident or no accident for having taken that man s life Now go on The delusion that you still hear the voice Lord Loring proceeded is in the doctor s opinion the moral result of the morbid state of your mind at the time when you really heard the voice on the scene of the duel The influence acts physically of course by means of certain nerves But it is essentially a moral influence and its power over you is greatly maintained by the self accusing view of the circumstances which you persist in taking That in substance is my recollection of what the doctor said And when he was asked what remedies he proposed to try Romayne inquired do you remember his answer The mischief which moral influences have caused moral influences alone can remedy I remember said Lord Loring And he mentioned as examples of what he meant the occurrence of some new and absorbing interest in your life or the working of some complete change in your habits of thought or perhaps some influence exercised over you by a person previously unknown appearing under unforeseen circumstances or in scenes quite new to you Romayne s eyes sparkled Now you are coming to it he cried Now I feel sure that I recall correctly the last words the doctor said If my view is the right one I should not be surprised to hear that the recovery which we all wish to see had found its beginning in such apparently trifling circumstances as the tone of some other person s voice or the influence of some other person s look That plain expression of his opinion only occurred to my memory after I had written my foolish letter of excuse I spare you the course of other recollections that followed to come at once to the result For the first time I have the hope the faint hope that the voice which haunts me has been once already controlled by one of the influences of which the doctor spoke the influence of a look If he had said this to Lady Loring instead of to her husband she would have understood him at once Lord Loring asked for a word more of explanation I told you yesterday Romayne answered that a dread of the return of the voice had been present to me all the morning and that I had come to see the picture with an idea of trying if change would relieve me While I was in the gallery I was free from the dread and free from the voice When I returned to the hotel it tortured me and mister Penrose I grieve to say saw what I suffered You and I attributed the remission to the change of scene I now believe we were both wrong Where was the change In seeing you and Lady Loring I saw the two oldest friends I have In visiting your gallery I only revived the familiar associations of hundreds of other visits To what influence was I really indebted for my respite Don t try to dismiss the question by laughing at my morbid fancies Morbid fancies are realities to a man like me Remember the doctor s words Loring Think of a new face seen in your house Think of a look that searched my heart for the first time Lord Loring glanced once more at the clock on the mantel piece The hands pointed to the dinner hour Miss Eyrecourt he whispered Yes Miss Eyrecourt The library door was thrown open by a servant Stella herself entered the room CHAPTER VIII THE PRIEST OR THE WOMAN LORD LORING hurried away to his dressing room I won t be more than ten minutes he said and left Romayne and Stella together She was attired with her customary love of simplicity White lace was the only ornament on her dress of delicate silvery gray Her magnificent hair was left to plead its own merits without adornment of any sort Even the brooch which fastened her lace pelerine was of plain gold only Conscious that she was showing her beauty to the greatest advantage in the eyes of a man of taste she betrayed a little of the embarrassment which Romayne had already noticed at the moment when she gave him her hand They were alone and it was the first time she had seen him in evening dress It may be that women have no positive appreciation of what is beautiful in form and color or it may be that they have no opinions of their own when the laws of fashion have spoken This at least is certain that not one of them in a thousand sees anything objectionable in the gloomy and hideous evening costume of a gentleman in the nineteenth century A handsome man is to their eyes more seductive than ever in the contemptible black coat and the stiff white cravat which he wears in common with the servant who waits on him at table After a stolen glance at Romayne Stella lost all confidence in herself she began turning over the photographs on the table The momentary silence which followed their first greeting became intolerable to her Rather than let it continue she impulsively confessed the uppermost idea in her mind when she entered the room I thought I heard my name when I came in she said Were you and Lord Loring speaking of me Romayne owned without hesitation that they had been speaking of her She smiled and turned over another photograph But when did sun pictures ever act as a restraint on a woman s curiosity The words passed her lips in spite of her I suppose I mustn t ask what you were saying It was impossible to answer this plainly without entering into explanations from which Romayne shrank He hesitated She turned over another photograph I understand she said You were talking of my faults She paused and stole another look at him I will try to correct my faults if you will tell me what they are Romayne felt that he had no alternative but to tell the truth under certain reserves Indeed you are wrong he said We were talking of the influence of a tone or a look on a sensitive person The influence on Me she asked No The influence which You might exercise on another person She knew perfectly well that he was speaking of himself But she was determined to feel the pleasure of making him own it If I have any such influence as you describe she began I hope it is for good Certainly for good You speak positively mister Romayne Almost as positively only that can hardly be as if you were speaking from experience He might still have evaded a direct reply if she had been content with merely saying this But she looked at him while she spoke He answered the look Shall I own that you are right he said I was thinking of my own experience yesterday She returned to the photographs It sounds impossible she rejoined softly There was a pause Was it anything I said she asked No It was only when you looked at me But for that look I don t think I should have been here to day She shut up the photographs on a sudden and drew her chair a little away from him I hope she said you have not so poor an opinion of me as to think I like to be flattered Romayne answered with an earnestness that instantly satisfied her I should think it an act of insolence to flatter you he said If you knew the true reason why I hesitated to accept Lady Loring s invitation if I could own to you the new hope for myself that has brought me here you would feel as I feel that I have been only speaking the truth I daren t say yet that I owe you a debt of gratitude for such a little thing as a look I must wait till time puts certain strange fancies of mine to the proof Fancies about me mister Romayne Before he could answer the dinner bell rang Lord and Lady Loring entered the library together The dinner having pursued its appointed course always excepting the case of the omelet the head servant who had waited at table was graciously invited to rest after his labors in the housekeeper s room Having additionally conciliated him by means of a glass of rare liqueur Miss Notman still feeling her grievance as acutely as ever ventured to inquire in the first place if the gentlefolks upstairs had enjoyed their dinner So far the report was on the whole favorable But the conversation was described as occasionally flagging The burden of the talk had been mainly borne by my lord and my lady mister Romayne and Miss Eyrecourt contributing but little to the social enjoyment of the evening Receiving this information without much appearance of interest the housekeeper put another question to which judging by her manner she attached a certain importance She wished to know if the oyster omelet accompanying the cheese had been received as a welcome dish and treated with a just recognition of its merits The answer to this was decidedly in the negative mister Romayne and Miss Eyrecourt had declined to taste it My lord had tried it and had left it on his plate My lady alone had really eaten her share of the misplaced dish Having stated this apparently trivial circumstance the head servant was surprised by the effect which it produced on the housekeeper She leaned back in her chair and closed her eyes with an appearance of unutterable enjoyment That night there was one supremely happy woman in London And her name was Miss Notman Ascending from the housekeeper s room to the drawing room it is to be further reported that music was tried as a means of getting through the time in the absence of general conversation Lady Loring sat down at the piano and played as admirably as usual At the other end of the room Romayne and Stella were together listening to the music Lord Loring walking backward and forward with a restlessness which was far from being characteristic of him in his after dinner hours was stopped when he reached the neighborhood of the piano by a private signal from his wife What are you walking about for Lady Loring asked in a whisper without interrupting her musical performance I m not quite easy my dear Turn over the music Indigestion Good heavens Adelaide what a question Well what is it then Lord Loring looked toward Stella and her companion They don t seem to get on together as well as I had hoped he said I should think not when you are walking about and disturbing them Sit down there behind me What am I to do Am I not playing Listen to me My dear I don t understand modern German music Then read the evening paper The evening paper had its attractions Lord Loring took his wife s advice Left entirely by themselves at the other end of the room Romayne and Stella justified Lady Loring s belief in the result of reducing her husband to a state of repose Stella ventured to speak first in a discreet undertone Do you pass most of your evenings alone mister Romayne Not quite alone I have the company of my books Are your books the companions that you like best I have been true to those companions Miss Eyrecourt for many years If the doctors are to be believed my books have not treated me very well in return They have broken down my health and have made me I am afraid a very unsocial man He seemed about to say more and suddenly checked the impulse Why am I talking of myself he resumed with a smile I never do it at other times Is this another result of your influence over me He put the question with an assumed gayety Stella made no effort on her side to answer him in the same tone I almost wish I really had some influence over you she said gravely and sadly Why I should try to induce you to shut up your books and choose some living companion who might restore you to your happier self It is already done said Romayne I have a new companion in mister Penrose Penrose she repeated He is the friend is he not of the priest here whom they call Father Benwell Yes I don t like Father Benwell Is that a reason for disliking mister Penrose Yes she said boldly because he is Father Benwell s friend Indeed you are mistaken Miss Eyrecourt mister Penrose only entered yesterday on his duties as my secretary and I have already had reason to think highly of him Many men after that experience of me he added speaking more to himself than to her might have asked me to find another secretary Stella heard those last words and looked at him in astonishment Were you angry with mister Penrose she asked innocently Is it possible that you could speak harshly to any person in your employment Romayne smiled It was not what I said he answered I am subject to attacks to sudden attacks of illness I am sorry I alarmed mister Penrose by letting him see me under those circumstances She looked at him hesitated and looked away again Would you be angry with me if I confessed something she said timidly It is impossible I can be angry with you mister Romayne I think I have seen what your secretary saw I know how you suffer and how patiently you bear it You he exclaimed I saw you with your friend when you came on board the steamboat at Boulogne Oh no you never noticed me You never knew how I pitied you And afterward when you moved away by yourself and stood by the place in which the engines work you are sure you won t think the worse of me if I tell it No no Your face frightened me I can t describe it I went to your friend and took it on myself to say that you wanted him It was an impulse I meant well I am sure you meant well As he spoke his face darkened a little betraying a momentary feeling of distrust Had she put indiscreet questions to his traveling companion and had the Major under the persuasive influence of her beauty been weak enough to answer them Did you speak to my friend he asked Only when I told him that he had better go to you And I think I said afterward I was afraid you were very ill We were in the confusion of arriving at Folkestone and even if I had thought it right to say more there was no opportunity Romayne felt ashamed of the suspicion by which he had wronged her You have a generous nature he said earnestly Among the few people whom I know how many would feel the interest in me that you felt Don t say that mister Romayne You could have had no kinder friend than the gentleman who took care of you on your journey Is he with you now in London No I am sorry to hear it You ought to have some devoted friend always near you She spoke very earnestly Romayne shrank with a strange shyness from letting her see how her sympathy affected him He answered lightly You go almost as far as my good friend there reading the newspaper he said Lord Loring doesn t scruple to tell me that I ought to marry I know he speaks with a sincere interest in my welfare He little thinks how he distresses me Why should he distress you He reminds me live as long as I may that I must live alone Can I ask a woman to share such a dreary life as mine It would be selfish it would be cruel I should deservedly pay the penalty of allowing my wife to sacrifice herself The time would come when she would repent having married me Stella rose Her eyes rested on him with a look of gentle remonstrance I think you hardly do women justice she said softly Perhaps some day a woman may induce you to change your opinion She crossed the room to the piano You must be tired of playing Adelaide she said putting her hand caressingly on Lady Loring s shoulder Will you sing Stella She sighed and turned away Not to night she answered Romayne took his leave rather hurriedly He seemed to be out of spirits and eager to get away Lord Loring accompanied his guest to the door You look sad and careworn he said Do you regret having left your books to pass an evening with us Romayne looked up absently and answered I don t know yet Returning to report this extraordinary reply to his wife and Stella Lord Loring found the drawing room empty Eager for a little private conversation the two ladies had gone upstairs Well said Lady Loring as they sat together over the fire What did he say Stella only repeated what he had said before she rose and left him What is there in mister Romayne s life she asked which made him say that he would be selfish and cruel if he expected a woman to marry him It must be something more than mere illness If he had committed a crime he could not have spoken more strongly Do you know what it is Lady Loring looked uneasy I promised my husband to keep it a secret from everybody she said It is nothing degrading Adelaide I am sure of that And you are right my dear I can understand that he has surprised and disappointed you but if you knew his motives she stopped and looked earnestly at Stella They say she went on the love that lasts longest is the love of slowest growth This feeling of yours for Romayne is of sudden growth Are you very sure that your whole heart is given to a man of whom you know little I know that I love him said Stella simply Even though he doesn t seem as yet to love you Lady Loring asked All the more because he doesn t I should be ashamed to make the confession to any one but you It is useless to say any more Good night Lady Loring allowed her to get as far as the door and then suddenly called her back Stella returned unwillingly and wearily My head aches and my heart aches she said Let me go away to my bed I don t like you to go away wronging Romayne perhaps in your thoughts said Lady Loring And more than that for the sake of your own happiness you ought to judge for yourself if this devoted love of yours may ever hope to win its reward It is time and more than time that you should decide whether it is good for you to see Romayne again Have you courage enough to do that Yes if I am convinced that it ought to be done Nothing would make me so happy Lady Loring resumed as to know that you were one day my dear to be his wife But I am not a prudent person I can never look as you can to consequences You won t betray me Stella If I am doing wrong in telling a secret which has been trusted to me it is my fondness for you that misleads me Sit down again You shall know what the misery of Romayne s life really is With those words she told the terrible story of the duel and of all that had followed it It is for you to say she concluded whether Romayne is right Can any woman hope to release him from the torment that he suffers with nothing to help her but love Determine for yourself Stella answered instantly I determine to be his wife With the same pure enthusiasm Penrose had declared that he too devoted himself to the deliverance of Romayne The loving woman was not more resolved to give her whole life to him than the fanatical man was resolved to convert him On the same common battle ground the two were now to meet in unconscious antagonism Would the priest or the woman win the day CHAPTER IX THE PUBLIC AND THE PICTURES ON the memorable Monday when the picture gallery was opened to the public for the first time Lord Loring and Father Benwell met in the library Judging by the number of carriages already at the door said Father Benwell your lordship s kindness is largely appreciated by the lovers of Art All the tickets were disposed of in three hours Lord Loring answered Everybody the librarians tell me is eager to see the pictures Have you looked in yet Not yet I thought I would get on first with my work among the books I have just come from the gallery Lord Loring continued And here I am driven out of it again by the remarks of some of the visitors You know my beautiful copies of Raphael s Cupid and Psyche designs The general impression especially among the ladies is that they are disgusting and indecent That was enough for me If you happen to meet Lady Loring and Stella kindly tell them that I have gone to the club Do the ladies propose paying a visit to the gallery Of course to see the people I have recommended them to wait until they are ready to go out for their drive In their indoor costume they might become the objects of general observation as the ladies of the house I shall be anxious to hear Father if you can discover the civilizing influences of Art among my guests in the gallery Good morning Father Benwell rang the bell when Lord Loring had left him Do the ladies drive out to day at their usual hour he inquired when the servant appeared The man answered in the affirmative The carriage was ordered at three o clock At half past two Father Benwell slipped quietly into the gallery He posted himself midway between the library door and the grand entrance on the watch not for the civilizing influences of Art but for the appearance of Lady Loring and Stella He was still of opinion that Stella s frivolous mother might be turned into a source of valuable information on the subject of her daughter s earlier life The first step toward attaining this object was to discover missus Eyrecourt s present address Stella would certainly know it and Father Benwell felt a just confidence in his capacity to make the young lady serviceable in this respect to the pecuniary interests of the Church After an interval of a quarter of an hour Lady Loring and Stella entered the gallery by the library door Father Benwell at once advanced to pay his respects For some little time he discreetly refrained from making any attempt to lead the conversation to the topic that he had in view He was too well acquainted with the insatiable interest of women in looking at other women to force himself into notice The ladies made their remarks on the pretensions to beauty and to taste in dress among the throng of visitors and Father Benwell waited by them and listened with the resignation of a modest young man Patience being a virtue is sometimes its own reward Two gentlemen evidently interested in the pictures approached the priest He drew back with his ready politeness to let them see the picture before which he happened to be standing The movement disturbed Stella She turned sharply noticed one of the gentlemen the taller of the two became deadly pale and instantly quitted the gallery Lady Loring looking where Stella had looked frowned angrily and followed Miss Eyrecourt into the library Wise Father Benwell let them go and concentrated his attention on the person who had been the object of this startling recognition Unquestionably a gentleman with light hair and complexion with a bright benevolent face and keen intelligent blue eyes apparently still in the prime of life Such was Father Benwell s first impression of the stranger He had evidently seen Miss Eyrecourt at the moment when she first noticed him and he too showed signs of serious agitation His face flushed deeply and his eyes expressed not merely surprise but distress He turned to his friend This place is hot he said let us get out of it My dear Winterfield the friend remonstrated we haven t seen half the pictures yet Excuse me if I leave you the other replied I am used to the free air of the country Let us meet again this evening Come and dine with me The same address as usual Derwent s Hotel With those words he hurried out making his way without ceremony through the crowd in the picture gallery Father Benwell returned to the library It was quite needless to trouble himself further about missus Eyrecourt or her address Thanks to Lord Loring s picture gallery he thought I have found the man He took up his pen and made a little memorandum Winterfield Derwent s Hotel CHAPTER X FATHER BENWELL S CORRESPONDENCE I To mister Bitrake Private and Confidential SIR I understand that your connection with the law does not exclude your occasional superintendence of confidential inquiries which are not of a nature to injure your professional position The inclosed letter of introduction will satisfy you that I am incapable of employing your experience in a manner unbecoming to you or to myself The inquiry that I propose to you relates to a gentleman named Winterfield He is now staying in London at Derwent s Hotel and is expected to remain there for a week from the present date His place of residence is on the North Devonshire coast and is well known in that locality by the name of Beaupark House The range of my proposed inquiry dates back over the last four or five years certainly not more My object is to ascertain as positively as may be whether within this limit of time events in mister Winterfield s life have connected him with a young lady named Miss Stella Eyrecourt If this proves to be the case it is essential that I should be made acquainted with the whole of the circumstances I have now informed you of all that I want to know Whatever the information may be it is most important that it shall be information which I can implicitly trust Please address to me when you write under cover to the friend whose letter I inclose I beg your acceptance as time is of importance of a check for preliminary expenses and remain sir your faithful servant AMBROSE BENWELL II To the Secretary Society of Jesus Rome I inclose a receipt for the remittance which your last letter confides to my care Some of the money has been already used in prosecuting inquiries the result of which will as I hope and believe enable me to effectually protect Romayne from the advances of the woman who is bent on marrying him You tell me that our Reverend Fathers lately sitting in council on the Vange Abbey affair are anxious to hear if any positive steps have yet been taken toward the conversion of Romayne I am happily able to gratify their wishes as you shall now see Yesterday I called at Romayne s hotel to pay one of those occasional visits which help to keep up our acquaintance He was out and Penrose for whom I asked next was with him Most fortunately as the event proved I had not seen Penrose or heard from him for some little time and I thought it desirable to judge for myself of the progress that he was making in the confidence of his employer I said I would wait The hotel servant knows me by sight I was shown into Romayne s waiting room This room is so small as to be a mere cupboard It is lighted by a glass fanlight over the door which opens from the passage and is supplied with air in the absence of a fireplace by a ventilator in a second door which communicates with Romayne s study Looking about me so far I crossed to the other end of the study and discovered a dining room and two bedrooms beyond the set of apartments being secluded by means of a door at the end of the passage from the other parts of the hotel I trouble you with these details in order that you may understand the events that followed I returned to the waiting room not forgetting of course to close the door of communication Nearly an hour must have passed before I heard footsteps in the passage The study door was opened and the voices of persons entering the room reached me through the ventilator I recognized Romayne Penrose and Lord Loring The first words exchanged among them informed me that Romayne and his secretary had overtaken Lord Loring in the street as he was approaching the hotel door The three had entered the house together at a time probably when the servant who had admitted me was out of the way However it may have happened there I was forgotten in the waiting room Could I intrude myself on a private conversation perhaps as an unannounced and unwelcome visitor And could I help it if the talk found its way to me through the ventilator along with the air that I breathed If our Reverend Fathers think I was to blame I bow to any reproof which their strict sense of propriety may inflict on me In the meantime I beg to repeat the interesting passages in the conversation as nearly word for word as I can remember them His lordship as the principal personage in social rank shall be reported first He said More than a week has passed Romayne and we have neither seen you nor heard from you Why have you neglected us Here judging by certain sounds that followed Penrose got up discreetly and left the room Lord Loring went on He said to Romayne Now we are alone I may speak to you more freely You and Stella seemed to get on together admirably that evening when you dined with us Have you forgotten what you told me of her influence over you Or have you altered your opinion and is that the reason why you keep away from us Romayne answered My opinion remains unchanged All that I said to you of Miss Eyrecourt I believe as firmly as ever His lordship remonstrated naturally enough Then why remain away from the good influence Why if it really can be controlled risk another return of that dreadful nervous delusion I have had another return Which as you yourself believe might have been prevented Romayne you astonish me There was a time of silence before Romayne answered this He was a little mysterious when he did reply You know the old saying my good friend of two evils choose the least I bear my sufferings as one of two evils and the least of the two Lord Loring appeared to feel the necessity of touching a delicate subject with a light hand He said in his pleasant way Stella isn t the other evil I suppose Most assuredly not Then what is it Romayne answered almost passionately My own weakness and selfishness Faults which I must resist or become a mean and heartless man For me the worst of the two evils is there I respect and admire Miss Eyrecourt I believe her to be a woman in a thousand don t ask me to see her again Where is Penrose Let us talk of something else Whether this wild way of speaking offended Lord Loring or only discouraged him I cannot say I heard him take his leave in these words You have disappointed me Romayne We will talk of something else the next time we meet The study door was opened and closed Romayne was left by himself Solitude was apparently not to his taste just then I heard him call to Penrose I heard Penrose ask Do you want me Romayne answered God knows I want a friend and I have no friend near me but you Major Hynd is away and Lord Loring is offended with me Penrose asked why Romayne thereupon entered on the necessary explanation As a priest writing to priests I pass over details utterly uninteresting to us The substance of what he said amounted to this Miss Eyrecourt had produced an impression on him which was new to him in his experience of women If he saw more of her it might end I ask your pardon for repeating the ridiculous expression in his falling in love with her In this condition of mind or body whichever it may be he would probably be incapable of the self control which he had hitherto practiced If she consented to devote her life to him he might accept the cruel sacrifice Rather than do this he would keep away from her for her dear sake no matter what he might suffer or whom he might offend Imagine any human being out of a lunatic asylum talking in this way Shall I own to you my reverend colleague how this curious self exposure struck me As I listened to Romayne I felt grateful to the famous Council which definitely forbade the priests of the Catholic Church to marry We might otherwise have been morally enervated by the weakness which degrades Romayne and priests might have become instruments in the hands of women But you will be anxious to hear what Penrose did under the circumstances For the moment I can tell you this he startled me Instead of seizing the opportunity and directing Romayne s mind to the consolations of religion Penrose actually encouraged him to reconsider his decision All the weakness of my poor little Arthur s character showed itself in his next words He said to Romayne It may be wrong in me to speak to you as freely as I wish to speak But you have so generously admitted me to your confidence you have been so considerate and so kind toward me that I feel an interest in your happiness which perhaps makes me over bold Are you very sure that some such entire change in your life as your marriage might not end in delivering you from your burden If such a thing could be is it wrong to suppose that your wife s good influence over you might be the means of making your marriage a happy one I must not presume to offer an opinion on such a subject It is only my gratitude my true attachment to you that ventures to put the question Are you conscious of having given this matter so serious a matter for you sufficient thought Make your mind easy reverend sir Romayne s answer set everything right He said I have thought of it till I could think no longer I still believe that sweet woman might control the torment of the voice But could she deliver me from the remorse perpetually gnawing at my heart I feel as murderers feel In taking another man s life a man who had not even injured me I have committed the one unatonable and unpardonable sin Can any human creature s influence make me forget that No more of it no more Come Let us take refuge in our books Those words touched Penrose in the right place Now as I understand his scruples he felt that he might honorably speak out His zeal more than balanced his weakness as you will presently see He was loud he was positive when I heard him next No he burst out your refuge is not in books and not in the barren religious forms which call themselves Protestant Dear master the peace of mind which you believe you have lost forever you will find again in the divine wisdom and compassion of the holy Catholic Church There is the remedy for all that you suffer There is the new life that will yet make you a happy man I repeat what he said so far merely to satisfy you that we can trust his enthusiasm when it is once roused Nothing will discourage nothing will defeat him now He spoke with all the eloquence of conviction using the necessary arguments with a force and feeling which I have rarely heard equaled Romayne s silence vouched for the effect on him He is not the man to listen patiently to reasoning which he thinks he can overthrow Having heard enough to satisfy me that Penrose had really begun the good work I quietly slipped out of the waiting room and left the hotel To day being Sunday I shall not lose a post if I keep my letter open until to morrow I have already sent a note to Penrose asking him to call on me at his earliest convenience There may be more news for you before post time Monday ten A M There is more news Penrose has just left me His first proceeding of course was to tell me what I had already discovered for myself He is modest as usual about the prospect of success which awaits him But he has induced Romayne to suspend his historical studies for a few days and to devote his attention to the books which we are accustomed to recommend for perusal in such cases as his This is unquestionably a great gain at starting But my news is not at an end yet Romayne is actually playing our game he has resolved definitely to withdraw himself from the influence of Miss Eyrecourt In another hour he and Penrose will have left London Their destination is kept a profound secret All letters addressed to Romayne are to be sent to his bankers The motive for this sudden resolution is directly traceable to Lady Loring Her ladyship called at the hotel yesterday evening and had a private interview with Romayne Her object no doubt was to shake his resolution and to make him submit himself again to Miss Eyrecourt s fascinations What means of persuasion she used to effect this purpose is of course unknown to us Penrose saw Romayne after her ladyship s departure and describes him as violently agitated I can quite understand it His resolution to take refuge in secret flight it is really nothing less speaks for itself as to the impression produced on him and the danger from which for the time at least we have escaped Yes I say for the time at least Don t let our reverend fathers suppose that the money expended on my private inquiries has been money thrown away Where these miserable love affairs are concerned women are daunted by no adverse circumstances and warned by no defeat Romayne has left London in dread of his own weakness we must not forget that The day may yet come when nothing will interpose between us and failure but my knowledge of events in Miss Eyrecourt s life For the present there is no more to be said CHAPTER XI STELLA ASSERTS HERSELF Two days after Father Benwell had posted his letter to Rome Lady Loring entered her husband s study and asked eagerly if he had heard any news of Romayne Lord Loring shook his head As I told you yesterday he said the proprietor of the hotel can give me no information I went myself this morning to the bankers and saw the head partner He offered to forward letters but he could do no more Until further notice he was positively enjoined not to disclose Romayne s address to anybody How does Stella bear it In the worst possible way Lady Loring answered In silence Not a word even to you Not a word At that reply the servant interrupted them by announcing the arrival of a visitor and presenting his card Lord Loring started and handed it to his wife The card bore the name of Major Hynd and this line was added in pencil On business connected with mister Romayne Show him in directly cried Lady Loring Lord Loring remonstrated My dear perhaps I had better see this gentleman alone Certainly not unless you wish to drive me into committing an act of the most revolting meanness If you send me away I shall listen at the door Major Hynd was shown in and was duly presented to Lady Loring After making the customary apologies he said I returned to London last night expressly to see Romayne on a matter of importance Failing to discover his present address at the hotel I had the hope that your lordship might be able to direct me to our friend I am sorry to say I know no more than you do Lord Loring replied Romayne s present address is a secret confided to his bankers and to no one else I will give you their names if you wish to write to him Major Hynd hesitated I am not quite sure that it would be discreet to write to him under the circumstances Lady Loring could no longer keep silence Is it possible Major Hynd to tell us what the circumstances are she asked I am almost as old a friend of Romayne as my husband and I am very anxious about him The Major looked embarrassed I can hardly answer your ladyship he said without reviving painful recollections Lady Loring s impatience interrupted the Major s apologies Do you mean the duel she inquired Lord Loring interposed I should tell you Major Hynd that Lady Loring is as well informed as I am of what happened at Boulogne and of the deplorable result so far as Romayne is concerned If you still wish to speak to me privately I will ask you to accompany me into the next room Major Hynd s embarrassment vanished After what you tell me he said I hope to be favored with Lady Loring s advice You both know that Romayne fought the fatal duel with a son of the French General who had challenged him When we returned to England we heard that the General and his family had been driven away from Boulogne by pecuniary difficulties Romayne against my advice wrote to the surgeon who had been present at the duel desiring that the General s place of retreat might be discovered and expressing his wish to assist the family anonymously as their Unknown Friend The motive of course was in his own words to make some little atonement to the poor people whom he had wronged I thought it a rash proceeding at the time and I am confirmed in my opinion by a letter from the surgeon received yesterday Will you kindly read it to Lady Loring He handed the letter to Lord Loring Translated from the French it ran as follows SIR I am at last able to answer mister Romayne s letter definitely with the courteous assistance of the French Consul in London to whom I applied when other means of investigation had produced no result A week since the General died circumstances connected with the burial expenses informed the Consul that he had taken refuge from his creditors not in Paris as we supposed but in London The address is Number ten Camp s Hill Islington I should also add that the General for obvious reasons lived in London under the assumed name of Marillac It will be necessary therefore to inquire for his widow by the name of Madame Marillac You will perhaps be surprised to find that I address these lines to you instead of to mister Romayne The reason is soon told I was acquainted with the late General as you know at a time when I was not aware of the company that he kept or of the deplorable errors into which his love of gambling had betrayed him Of his widow and his children I know absolutely nothing Whether they have resisted the contaminating influence of the head of the household or whether poverty and bad example combined have hopelessly degraded them I cannot say There is at least a doubt whether they are worthy of mister Romayne s benevolent intentions toward them As an honest man I cannot feel this doubt and reconcile it to my conscience to be the means however indirectly of introducing them to mister Romayne To your discretion I leave it to act for the best after this warning Lord Loring returned the letter to Major Hynd I agree with you he said It is more than doubtful whether you ought to communicate this information to Romayne Lady Loring was not quite of her husband s opinion While there is a doubt about these people she said it seems only just to find out what sort of character they bear in the neighborhood In your place Major Hynd I should apply to the person in whose house they live or to the tradespeople whom they have employed I am obliged to leave London again to day the Major replied but on my return I will certainly follow your ladyship s advice And you will let us know the result With the greatest pleasure Major Hynd took his leave I think you will be responsible for wasting the Major s time said Lord Loring when the visitor had retired I think not said Lady Loring She rose to leave the room Are you going out her husband asked No I am going upstairs to Stella Lady Loring found Miss Eyrecourt in her own room The little portrait of Romayne which she had drawn from recollection lay on the table before her She was examining it with the closest attention Well Stella and what does the portrait tell you What I knew before Adelaide There is nothing false and nothing cruel in that face And does the discovery satisfy you For my part I despise Romayne for hiding himself from us Can you excuse him Stella locked up the portrait in her writing case I can wait she said quietly This assertion of patience seemed to irritate Lady Loring What is the matter with you this morning she asked You are more reserved than ever No I am only out of spirits Adelaide I can t help thinking of that meeting with Winterfield I feel as if some misfortune was hanging over my head Don t speak of that hateful man her ladyship exclaimed I have something to tell you about Romayne Are you completely absorbed in your presentiments of evil or do you think you can listen to me Stella s face answered for her Lady Loring described the interview with Major Hynd in the minutest detail including by way of illustration the Major s manners and personal appearance He and Lord Loring she added both think that Romayne will never hear the last of it if he allows these foreigners to look to him for money Until something more is known about them the letter is not to be forwarded I wish I had the letter cried Stella Would you forward it to Romayne Instantly Does it matter whether these poor French people are worthy of his generosity If it restores his tranquillity to help them who cares whether they deserve the help They are not even to know who it is that assists them Romayne is to be their unknown friend It is he not they whom we have to think of his peace of mind is everything their merit is nothing I say it s cruel to him to keep him in ignorance of what has happened Why didn t you take the letter away from Major Hynd Gently Stella The Major is going to make inquiries about the widow and children when he returns to London When he returns Stella repeated indignantly Who knows what the poor wretches may be suffering in the interval and what Romayne may feel if he ever hears of it Tell me the address again it was somewhere in Islington you said Why do you want to know it Lady Loring asked You are not going to write to Romayne yourself I am going to think before I do anything If you can t trust my discretion Adelaide you have only to say so It was spoken sharply Lady Loring s reply betrayed a certain loss of temper on her side Manage your own affairs Stella I have done meddling with them Her unlucky visit to Romayne at the hotel had been a subject of dispute between the two friends and this referred to it You shall have the address my lady added in her grandest manner She wrote it on a piece of paper and left the room Easily irritated Lady Loring had the merit of being easily appeased That meanest of all vices the vice of sulkiness had no existence in her nature In five minutes she regretted her little outburst of irritability For five minutes more she waited on the chance that Stella might be the first to seek a reconciliation The interval passed and nothing happened Have I really offended her Lady Loring asked herself The next moment she was on her way back to Stella The room was empty She rang the bell for the maid Where is Miss Eyrecourt Gone out my lady Did she leave no message No my lady She went away in a great hurry Lady Loring at once drew the conclusion that Stella had rashly taken the affair of the General s family into her own hands Was it possible to say how this most imprudent proceeding might end After hesitating and reflecting and hesitating again Lady Loring s anxiety got beyond her control She not only decided on following Stella but in the excess of her nervous apprehension she took one of the men servants with her in case of emergency CHAPTER XII THE GENERAL S FAMILY NOT always remarkable for arriving at just conclusions Lady Loring had drawn the right inference this time Stella had stopped the first cab that passed her and had directed the driver to Camp s Hill Islington The aspect of the miserable little street closed at one end and swarming with dirty children quarreling over their play daunted her for the moment Even the cabman drawing up at the entrance to the street expressed his opinion that it was a queer sort of place for a young lady to venture into alone Stella thought of Romayne Her firm persuasion that she was helping him to perform an act of mercy which was to his mind an act of atonement as well roused her courage She boldly approached the open door of No ten and knocked on it with her parasol The tangled gray hair and grimy face of a hideous old woman showed themselves slowly at the end of the passage rising from the strong smelling obscurity of the kitchen regions What do you want said the half seen witch of the London slums Does Madame Marillac live here Stella asked Do you mean the foreigner Yes Second door With those instructions the upper half of the witch sank and vanished Stella gathered her skirts together and ascended a filthy flight of stairs for the first time in her life Coarse voices shameless language gross laughter behind the closed doors of the first floor hurried her on her way to the rooms on the higher flight Here there was a change for the better here at least there was silence She knocked at the door on the landing of the second floor A gentle voice answered in French Entrez then quickly substituted the English equivalent Come in Stella opened the door The wretchedly furnished room was scrupulously clean Above the truckle bed a cheap little image of the Virgin was fastened to the wall with some faded artificial flowers arranged above it in the form of a wreath Two women in dresses of coarse black stuff sat at a small round table working at the same piece of embroidery The elder of the two rose when the visitor entered the room Her worn and weary face still showed the remains of beauty in its finely proportioned parts her dim eyes rested on Stella with an expression of piteous entreaty Have you come for the work madam she asked in English spoken with a strong foreign accent Pray forgive me I have not finished it yet The second of the two workwomen suddenly looked up She too was wan and frail but her eyes were bright her movements still preserved the elasticity of youth Her likeness to the elder woman proclaimed their relationship even before she spoke Ah it s my fault she burst out passionately in French I was hungry and tired and I slept hours longer than I ought My mother was too kind to wake me and set me to work I am a selfish wretch and my mother is an angel She dashed away the tears gathering in her eyes and proudly fiercely resumed her work Stella hastened to reassure them the moment she could make herself heard Indeed I have nothing to do with the work she said speaking in French so that they might the more readily understand her I came here Madame Marillac if you will not be offended with me for plainly owning it to offer you some little help Charity asked the daughter looking up again sternly from her needle Sympathy Stella answered gently The girl resumed her work I beg your pardon she said I shall learn to submit to my lot in time The quiet long suffering mother placed a chair for Stella You have a kind beautiful face miss she said and I am sure you will make allowances for my poor girl I remember the time when I was as quick to feel as she is May I ask how you came to hear of us I hope you will excuse me Stella replied I am not at liberty to answer that question The mother said nothing The daughter asked sharply Why not Stella addressed her answer to the mother I come from a person who desires to be of service to you as an unknown friend she said The wan face of the widow suddenly brightened Oh she exclaimed has my brother heard of the General s death and has he forgiven me my marriage at last No no Stella interposed I must not mislead you The person whom I represent is no relation of yours Even in spite of this positive assertion the poor woman held desperately to the hope that had been roused in her The name by which you know me may mislead you she suggested anxiously My late husband assumed the name in his exile here Perhaps if I told you The daughter stopped her there My dear mother leave this to me The widow sighed resignedly and resumed her work Madame Marillac will do very well as a name the girl continued turning to Stella until we know something more of each other I suppose you are well acquainted with the person whom you represent Certainly or I should not be here You know the person s family connections in that case and you can say for certain whether they are French connections or not I can say for certain Stella answered that they are English connections I represent a friend who feels kindly toward Madame Marillac nothing more You see mother you were mistaken Bear it as bravely dear as you have borne other trials Saying this very tenderly she addressed herself once more to Stella without attempting to conceal the accompanying change in her manner to coldness and distrust One of us must speak plainly she said Our few friends are nearly as poor as we are and they are all French I tell you positively that we have no English friends How has this anonymous benefactor been informed of our poverty You are a stranger to us you cannot have given the information Stella s eyes were now open to the awkward position in which she had placed herself She met the difficulty boldly still upheld by the conviction that she was serving a purpose cherished by Romayne You had good reasons no doubt mademoiselle when you advised your mother to conceal her true name she rejoined Be just enough to believe that your anonymous benefactor has good reasons for concealment too It was well said and it encouraged Madame Marillac to take Stella s part My dear Blanche you speak rather harshly to this good young lady she said to her daughter You have only to look at her and to see that she means well Blanche took up her needle again with dogged submission If we are to accept charity mother I should like to know the hand that gives it she answered I will say no more When you are as old as I am my dear rejoined Madame Marillac you will not think quite so positively as you think now I have learned some hard lessons she proceeded turning to Stella and I hope I am the better for them My life has not been a happy one Your life has been a martyrdom said the girl breaking out again in spite of herself Oh my father my father She pushed aside the work and hid her face in her hands The gentle mother spoke severely for the first time Respect your father s memory she said Blanche trembled and kept silence I have no false pride Madame Marillac continued I own that we are miserably poor and I thank you my dear young lady for your kind intentions toward us without embarrassing you by any inquiries We manage to live While my eyes last our work helps to support us My good eldest daughter has some employment as a teacher of music and contributes her little share to assist our poor household I don t distrust you I only say let us try a little longer if we cannot help ourselves She had barely pronounced the last words when a startling interruption led to consequences which the persons present had not foreseen A shrill wailing voice suddenly pierced through the flimsy partition which divided the front room and the back room Bread cried the voice in French I m hungry Bread bread The daughter started to her feet Think of his betraying us at this moment she exclaimed indignantly The mother rose in silence and opened a cupboard Its position was opposite to the place in which Stella was sitting She saw two or three knives and forks some cups and saucers and plates and a folded table cloth Nothing else appeared on the shelves not even the stray crust of bread for which the poor woman had been looking Go my dear and quiet your brother she said and closed the cupboard door again as patiently as ever Stella opened her pocketbook when Blanche had left the room For God s sake take something she cried I offer it with the sincerest respect I offer it as a loan Madame Marillac gently signed to Stella to close the pocketbook again That kind heart of yours must not be distressed about trifles she said The baker will trust us until we get the money for our work and my daughter knows it If you can tell me nothing else my dear will you tell me your Christian name It is painful to me to speak to you quite as a stranger Stella at once complied with the request Madame Marillac smiled as she repeated the name There is almost another tie between us she said We have your name in France it speaks with a familiar sound to me in this strange place Dear Miss Stella when my poor boy startled you by that cry for food he recalled to me the saddest of all my anxieties When I think of him I should be tempted if my better sense did not restrain me No no put back the pocketbook I am incapable of the shameless audacity of borrowing a sum of money which I could never repay Let me tell you what my trouble is and you will understand that I am in earnest I had two sons Miss Stella The elder the most lovable the most affectionate of my children was killed in a duel The sudden disclosure drew a cry of sympathy from Stella which she was not mistress enough of herself to repress Now for the first time she understood the remorse that tortured Romayne as she had not understood it when Lady Loring had told her the terrible story of the duel Attributing the effect produced on her to the sensitive nature of a young woman Madame Marillac innocently added to Stella s distress by making excuses I am sorry to have frightened you my dear she said In your happy country such a dreadful death as my son s is unknown I am obliged to mention it or you might not understand what I have still to say Perhaps I had better not go on Stella roused herself Yes yes she answered eagerly Pray go on My son in the next room the widow resumed is only fourteen years old It has pleased God sorely to afflict a harmless creature He has not been in his right mind since since the miserable day when he followed the duelists and saw his brother s death Oh you are turning pale How thoughtless how cruel of me I ought to have remembered that such horrors as these have never overshadowed your happy life Struggling to recover her self control Stella tried to reassure Madame Marillac by a gesture The voice which she had heard in the next room was as she now knew the voice that haunted Romayne Not the words that had pleaded hunger and called for bread but those other words Assassin assassin where are you rang in her ears She entreated Madame Marillac to break the unendurable interval of silence The widow s calm voice had a soothing influence which she was eager to feel Go on she repeated Pray go on I ought not to lay all the blame of my boy s affliction on the duel said Madame Marillac In childhood his mind never grew with his bodily growth His brother s death may have only hurried the result which was sooner or later but too sure to come You need feel no fear of him He is never violent and he is the most beautiful of my children Would you like to see him No I would rather hear you speak of him Is he not conscious of his own misfortune For weeks together Stella I am sure I may call you Stella he is quite calm you would see no difference outwardly between him and other boys Unhappily it is just at those times that a spirit of impatience seems to possess him He watches his opportunity and however careful we may be he is cunning enough to escape our vigilance Do you mean that he leaves you and his sisters Yes that is what I mean For nearly two months past he has been away from us Yesterday only his return relieved us from a state of suspense which I cannot attempt to describe We don t know where he has been or in the company of what persons he has passed the time of his absense No persuasion will induce him to speak to us on the subject This morning we listened while he was talking to himself Was it part of the boy s madness to repeat the words which still tormented Romayne Stella asked if he ever spoke of the duel Never He seems to have lost all memory of it We only heard this morning one or two unconnected words something about a woman and then more that appeared to allude to some person s death Last night I was with him when he went to bed and I found that he had something to conceal from me He let me fold all his clothes as usual except his waistcoat and that he snatched away from me and put it under his pillow We have no hope of being able to examine the waistcoat without his knowledge His sleep is like the sleep of a dog if you only approach him he wakes instantly Forgive me for troubling you with these trifling details only interesting to ourselves You will at least understand the constant anxiety that we suffer In your unhappy position said Stella I should try to resign myself to parting with him I mean to placing him under medical care The mother s face saddened I have inquired about it she answered He must pass a night in the workhouse before he can be received as a pauper lunatic in a public asylum Oh my dear I am afraid there is some pride still left in me He is my only son now his father was a General in the French army I was brought up among people of good blood and breeding I can t take my own boy to the workhouse Stella understood her I feel for you with all my heart she said Place him privately dear Madame Marillac under skillful and kind control and let me do let me open the pocketbook again The widow steadily refused even to look at the pocketbook Perhaps Stella persisted you don t know of a private asylum that would satisfy you My dear I do know of such a place The good doctor who attended my husband in his last illness told me of it A friend of his receives a certain number of poor people into his house and charges no more than the cost of maintaining them An unattainable sum to me There is the temptation that I spoke of The help of a few pounds I might accept if I fell ill because I might afterward pay it back But a larger sum never She rose as if to end the interview Stella tried every means of persuasion that she could think of and tried in vain The friendly dispute between them might have been prolonged if they had not both been silenced by another interruption from the next room This time it was not only endurable it was even welcome The poor boy was playing the air of a French vaudeville on a pipe or flageolet Now he is happy said the mother He is a born musician do come and see him An idea struck Stella She overcame the inveterate reluctance in her to see the boy so fatally associated with the misery of Romayne s life As Madame Marillac led the way to the door of communication between the rooms she quickly took from her pocketbook the bank notes with which she had provided herself and folded them so that they could be easily concealed in her hand She followed the widow into the little room The boy was sitting on his bed He laid down his flageolet and bowed to Stella His long silky hair flowed to his shoulders But one betrayal of a deranged mind presented itself in his delicate face his large soft eyes had the glassy vacant look which it is impossible to mistake Do you like music mademoiselle he asked gently Stella asked him to play his little vaudeville air again He proudly complied with the request His sister seemed to resent the presence of a stranger The work is at a standstill she said and passed into the front room Her mother followed her as far as the door to give her some necessary directions Stella seized her opportunity She put the bank notes into the pocket of the boy s jacket and whispered to him Give them to your mother when I have gone away Under those circumstances she felt sure that Madame Marillac would yield to the temptation She could resist much but she could not resist her son The boy nodded to show that he understood her The moment after he laid down his flageolet with an expression of surprise You are trembling he said Are you frightened She was frightened The mere sense of touching him had made her shudder Did she feel a vague presentiment of some evil to come from that momentary association with him Madame Marillac turning away again from her daughter noticed Stella s agitation Surely my poor boy doesn t alarm you she said Before Stella could answer some one outside knocked at the door Lady Loring s servant appeared charged with a carefully worded message If you please miss a friend is waiting for you below Any excuse for departure was welcome to Stella at that moment She promised to call at the house again in a few days Madame Marillac kissed her on the forehead as she took leave Her nerves were still shaken by that momentary contact with the boy Descending the stairs she trembled so that she was obliged to hold by the servant s arm She was not naturally timid What did it mean Lady Loring s carriage was waiting at the entrance of the street with all the children in the neighborhood assembled to admire it She impulsively forestalled the servant in opening the carriage door Come in she cried Oh Stella you don t know how you have frightened me Good heavens you look frightened yourself From what wretches have I rescued you Take my smelling bottle and tell me all about it The fresh air and the reassuring presence of her old friend revived Stella She was able to describe her interview with the General s family and to answer the inevitable inquiries which the narrative called forth Lady Loring s last question was the most important of the series What are you going to do about Romayne I am going to write to him the moment we get home The answer seemed to alarm Lady Loring You won t betray me she said What do you mean You won t let Romayne discover that I have told you about the duel Certainly not You shall see my letter before I send it to be forwarded Tranquilized so far Lady Loring bethought herself next of Major Hynd Can we tell him what you have done her ladyship asked Of course we can tell him Stella replied I shall conceal nothing from Lord Loring and I shall beg your good husband to write to the Major He need only say that I have made the necessary inquiries after being informed of the circumstances by you and that I have communicated the favorable result to mister Romayne It s easy enough to write the letter my dear But it s not so easy to say what Major Hynd may think of you Does it matter to me what Major Hynd thinks Lady Loring looked at Stella with a malicious smile Are you equally indifferent she said to what Romayne s opinion of your conduct may be Stella s color rose Try to be serious Adelaide when you speak to me of Romayne she answered gravely His good opinion of me is the breath of my life An hour later the important letter to Romayne was written Stella scrupulously informed him of all that had happened with two necessary omissions In the first place nothing was said of the widow s reference to her son s death and of the effect produced by it on his younger brother The boy was simply described as being of weak intellect and as requiring to be kept under competent control In the second place Romayne was left to infer that ordinary motives of benevolence were the only motives on his part known to Miss Eyrecourt The letter ended in these lines If I have taken an undue liberty in venturing unasked to appear as your representative I can only plead that I meant well It seemed to me to be hard on these poor people and not just to you in your absence to interpose any needless delays in carrying out those kind intentions of yours which had no doubt been properly considered beforehand In forming your opinion of my conduct pray remember that I have been careful not to compromise you in any way You are only known to Madame Marillac as a compassionate person who offers to help her and who wishes to give that help anonymously If notwithstanding this you disapprove of what I have done I must not conceal that it will grieve and humiliate me I have been so eager to be of use to you when others appeared to hesitate I must find my consolation in remembering that I have become acquainted with one of the sweetest and noblest of women and that I have helped to preserve her afflicted son from dangers in the future which I cannot presume to estimate You will complete what I have only begun Be forbearing and kind to me if I have innocently offended in this matter and I shall gratefully remember the day when I took it on myself to be mister Romayne s almoner Lady Loring read these concluding sentences twice over I think the end of your letter will have its effect on him she said If it brings me a kind letter in reply Stella answered it will have all the effect I hope for If it does anything Lady Loring rejoined it will do more than that What more can it do My dear it can bring Romayne back to you Those hopeful words seemed rather to startle Stella than to encourage her Bring him back to me she repeated Oh Adelaide I wish I could think as you do Send the letter to the post said Lady Loring and we shall see CHAPTER XIII FATHER BENWELL S CORRESPONDENCE I Arthur Penrose to Father Benwell REVEREND AND DEAR FATHER When I last had the honor of seeing you I received your instructions to report by letter the result of my conversations on religion with mister Romayne As events have turned out it is needless to occupy your time by dwelling at any length on this subject in writing mister Romayne has been strongly impressed by the excellent books which I have introduced to his notice He raises certain objections which I have done my best to meet and he promises to consider my arguments with his closest attention in the time to come I am happier in the hope of restoring his mental tranquillity in other and worthier words of effecting his conversion than I can tell you in any words of mine I respect and admire I may almost say I love mister Romayne The details which are wanting in this brief report of progress I shall have the privilege of personally relating to you mister Romayne no longer desires to conceal himself from his friends He received a letter this morning which has changed all his plans and has decided him on immediately returning to London I am not acquainted with the contents of the letter or with the name of the writer but I am pleased for mister Romayne s sake to see that the reading of it has made him happy By to morrow evening I hope to present my respects to you II Mr Bitrake to Father Benwell SIR The inquiries which I have instituted at your request have proved successful in one respect I am in a position to tell you that events in mister Winterfield s life have unquestionably connected him with the young lady named Miss Stella Eyrecourt The attendant circumstances however are not so easy to discover Judging by the careful report of the person whom I employ there must have been serious reasons in this case for keeping facts secret and witnesses out of the way I mention this not to discourage you but to prepare you for delays that may occur on our way to discovery Be pleased to preserve your confidence in me and to give me time and I answer for the result BOOK THE SECOND CHAPTER I THE SANDWICH DANCE A FINE spring after a winter of unusual severity promised well for the prospects of the London season Among the social entertainments of the time general curiosity was excited in the little sphere which absurdly describes itself under the big name of Society by the announcement of a party to be given by Lady Loring bearing the quaint title of a Sandwich Dance The invitations were issued at an unusually early hour and it was understood that nothing so solid and so commonplace as the customary supper was to be offered to the guests In a word Lady Loring s ball was designed as a bold protest against late hours and heavy midnight meals The younger people were all in favor of the proposed reform Their elders declined to give an opinion beforehand In the small inner circle of Lady Loring s most intimate friends it was whispered that an innovation in the matter of refreshments was contemplated which would put the tolerant principles of the guests to a severe test Miss Notman the housekeeper politely threatening retirement on a small annuity since the memorable affair of the oyster omelet decided on carrying out her design when she heard that there was to be no supper My attachment to the family can bear a great deal she said But when Lady Loring deliberately gives a ball without a supper I must hide my head somewhere and it had better be out of the house Taking Miss Notman as representative of a class the reception of the coming experiment looked to say the least of it doubtful On the appointed evening the guests made one agreeable discovery when they entered the reception rooms They were left perfectly free to amuse themselves as they liked The drawing rooms were given up to dancing the picture gallery was devoted to chamber music Chess players and card players found remote and quiet rooms especially prepared for them People who cared for nothing but talking were accommodated to perfection in a sphere of their own And lovers in earnest or not in earnest discovered in a dimly lighted conservatory with many recesses that ideal of discreet retirement which combines solitude and society under one roof But the ordering of the refreshments failed as had been foreseen to share in the approval conferred on the arrangement of the rooms The first impression was unfavorable Lady Loring however knew enough of human nature to leave results to two potent allies experience and time Excepting the conservatory the astonished guests could go nowhere without discovering tables prettily decorated with flowers and bearing hundreds of little pure white china plates loaded with nothing but sandwiches All varieties of opinion were consulted People of ordinary tastes who liked to know what they were eating could choose conventional beef or ham encased in thin slices of bread of a delicate flavor quite new to them Other persons less easily pleased were tempted by sandwiches of pate de fois gras and by exquisite combinations of chicken and truffles reduced to a creamy pulp which clung to the bread like butter Foreigners making experiments and not averse to garlic discovered the finest sausages of Germany and Italy transformed into English sandwiches Anchovies and sardines appealed in the same unexpected way to men who desired to create an artificial thirst after having first ascertained that the champagne was something to be fondly remembered and regretted at other parties to the end of the season The hospitable profusion of the refreshments was all pervading and inexhaustible Wherever the guests might be or however they were amusing themselves there were the pretty little white plates perpetually tempting them People eat as they had never eat before and even the inveterate English prejudice against anything new was conquered at last Universal opinion declared the Sandwich Dance to be an admirable idea perfectly carried out Many of the guests paid their hostess the compliment of arriving at the early hour mentioned in the invitations One of them was Major Hynd Lady Loring took her first opportunity of speaking to him apart I hear you were a little angry she said when you were told that Miss Eyrecourt had taken your inquiries out of your hands I thought it rather a bold proceeding Lady Loring the Major replied But as the General s widow turned out to be a lady in the best sense of the word Miss Eyrecourt s romantic adventure has justified itself I wouldn t recommend her to run the same risk a second time I suppose you know what Romayne thinks of it Not yet I have been too busy to call on him since I have been in town Pardon me Lady Loring who is that beautiful creature in the pale yellow dress Surely I have seen her somewhere before That beautiful creature Major is the bold young lady of whose conduct you don t approve Miss Eyrecourt Yes I retract everything I said cried the Major quite shamelessly Such a woman as that may do anything She is looking this way Pray introduce me The Major was introduced and Lady Loring returned to her guests I think we have met before Major Hynd said Stella Her voice supplied the missing link in the Major s memory of events Remembering how she had looked at Romayne on the deck of the steamboat he began dimly to understand Miss Eyrecourt s otherwise incomprehensible anxiety to be of use to the General s family I remember perfectly he answered It was on the passage from Boulogne to Folkestone and my friend was with me You and he have no doubt met since that time He put the question as a mere formality The unexpressed thought in him was Another of them in love with Romayne and nothing as usual likely to come of it I hope you have forgiven me for going to Camp s Hill in your place said Stella I ought to be grateful to you the Major rejoined No time has been lost in relieving these poor people and your powers of persuasion have succeeded where mine might have failed Has Romayne been to see them himself since his return to London No He desires to remain unknown and he is kindly content for the present to be represented by me For the present Major Hynd repeated A faint flush passed over her delicate complexion I have succeeded she resumed in inducing Madame Marillac to accept the help offered through me to her son The poor creature is safe under kind superintendence in a private asylum So far I can do no more Will the mother accept nothing Nothing either for herself or her daughter so long as they can work I cannot tell you how patiently and beautifully she speaks of her hard lot But her health may give way and it is possible before long that I may leave London She paused the flush deepened on her face The failure of the mother s health may happen in my absence she continued and mister Romayne will ask you to look after the family from time to time while I am away I will do it with pleasure Miss Eyrecourt Is Romayne likely to be here to night She smiled brightly and looked away The Major s curiosity was excited he looked in the same direction There was Romayne entering the room to answer for himself What was the attraction which drew the unsocial student to an evening party Major Hynd s eyes were on the watch When Romayne and Stella shook hands the attraction stood self revealed to him in Miss Eyrecourt Recalling the momentary confusion which she had betrayed when she spoke of possibly leaving London and of Romayne s plans for supplying her place as his almoner the Major with military impatience of delays jumped to a conclusion I was wrong he thought my impenetrable friend is touched in the right place at last When the splendid creature in yellow leaves London the name on her luggage will be missus Romayne You are looking quite another man Romayne he said mischievously since we met last Stella gently moved away leaving them to talk freely Romayne took no advantage of the circumstance to admit his old friend to his confidence Whatever relations might really exist between Miss Eyrecourt and himself were evidently kept secret thus far My health has been a little better lately was the only reply he made The Major dropped his voice to a whisper Have you not had any return he began Romayne stopped him there I don t want my infirmities made public he whispered back irritably Look at the people all round us When I tell you I have been better lately you ought to know what it means Any discoverable reason for the improvement persisted the Major still bent on getting evidence in support of his own private conclusions None Romayne answered sharply But Major Hynd was not to be discouraged by sharp replies Miss Eyrecourt and I have been recalling our first meeting on board the steamboat he went on Do you remember how indifferent you were to that beautiful person when I asked you if you knew her I m glad to see that you show better taste to night I wish I knew her well enough to shake hands as you did Hynd When a young man talks nonsense his youth is his excuse At your time of life you have passed the excusable age even in the estimation of your friends With those words Romayne turned away The incorrigible Major instantly met the reproof inflicted on him with a smart answer Remember he said that I was the first of your friends to wish you happiness He too turned away in the direction of the champagne and the sandwiches Meanwhile Stella had discovered Penrose lost in the brilliant assemblage of guests standing alone in a corner It was enough for her that Romayne s secretary was also Romayne s friend Passing by titled and celebrated personages all anxious to speak to her she joined the shy nervous sad looking little man and did all she could to set him at his ease I am afraid mister Penrose this is not a very attractive scene to you Having said those kind words she paused Penrose was looking at her confusedly but with an expression of interest which was new to her experience of him Has Romayne told him she wondered inwardly It is a very beautiful scene Miss Eyrecourt he said in his low quiet tones Did you come here with mister Romayne she asked Yes It was by his advice that I accepted the invitation with which Lady Loring has honored me I am sadly out of place in such an assembly as this but I would make far greater sacrifices to please mister Romayne She smiled kindly Attachment so artlessly devoted to the man she loved pleased and touched her In her anxiety to discover a subject which might interest him she overcame her antipathy to the spiritual director of the household Is Father Benwell coming to us to night she inquired He will certainly be here Miss Eyrecourt if he can get back to London in time Has he been long away Nearly a week Not knowing what else to say she still paid Penrose the compliment of feigning an interest in Father Benwell Has he a long journey to make in returning to London she asked Yes all the way from Devonshire From South Devonshire No North Devonshire Clovelly The smile suddenly left her face She put another question without quite concealing the effort that it cost her or the anxiety with which she waited for the reply I know something of the neighborhood of Clovelly she said I wonder whether Father Benwell is visiting any friends of mine there I am not able to say Miss Eyrecourt The reverend Father s letters are forwarded to the hotel I know no more than that With a gentle inclination of her head she turned toward other guests looked back and with a last little courteous attention offered to him said If you like music mister Penrose I advise you to go to the picture gallery They are going to play a Quartet by Mozart Penrose thanked her noticing that her voice and manner had become strangely subdued She made her way back to the room in which the hostess received her guests Lady Loring was for the moment alone resting on a sofa Stella stooped over her and spoke in cautiously lowered tones If Father Benwell comes here to night she said try to find out what he has been doing at Clovelly Clovelly Lady Loring repeated Is that the village near Winterfield s house Yes CHAPTER II THE QUESTION OF MARRIAGE As Stella answered Lady Loring she was smartly tapped on the shoulder by an eager guest with a fan The guest was a very little woman with twinkling eyes and a perpetual smile Nature corrected by powder and paint was liberally displayed in her arms her bosom and the upper part of her back Such clothes as she wore defective perhaps in quantity were in quality absolutely perfect More adorable color shape and workmanship never appeared even in a milliner s picture book Her light hair was dressed with a fringe and ringlets on the pattern which the portraits of the time of Charles the Second have made familiar to us There was nothing exactly young or exactly old about her except her voice which betrayed a faint hoarseness attributable possibly to exhaustion produced by untold years of incessant talking It might be added that she was as active as a squirrel and as playful as a kitten But the lady must be treated with a certain forbearance of tone for this good reason she was Stella s mother Stella turned quickly at the tap of the fan Mamma she exclaimed how you startle me My dear child said missus Eyrecourt you are constitutionally indolent and you want startling Go into the next room directly mister Romayne is looking for you Stella drew back a step and eyed her mother in blank surprise Is it possible that you know him she asked mister Romayne doesn t go into Society or we should have met long since missus Eyrecourt replied He is a striking person and I noticed him when he shook hands with you That was quite enough for me I have just introduced myself to him as your mother He was a little stately and stiff but most charming when he knew who I was I volunteered to find you He was quite astonished I think he took me for your elder sister Not the least like each other are we Lady Loring She takes after her poor dear father He was constitutionally indolent My sweet child rouse yourself You have drawn a prize in the great lottery at last If ever a man was in love mister Romayne is that man I am a physiognomist Lady Loring and I see the passions in the face Oh Stella what a property Vange Abbey I once drove that way when I was visiting in the neighborhood Superb And another fortune twelve thousand a year and a villa at Highgate since the death of his aunt And my daughter may be mistress of this if she only plays her cards properly What a compensation after all that we suffered through that monster Winterfield Mamma Pray don t Stella I will not be interrupted when I am speaking to you for your own good I don t know a more provoking person Lady Loring than my daughter on certain occasions And yet I love her I would go through fire and water for my beautiful child Only last week I was at a wedding and I thought of Stella The church was crammed to the doors A hundred at the wedding breakfast The bride s lace there no language can describe it Ten bridesmaids in blue and silver Reminded me of the ten virgins Only the proportion of foolish ones this time was certainly more than five However they looked well The Archbishop proposed the health of the bride and bridegroom so sweetly pathetic Some of us cried I thought of my daughter Oh if I could live to see Stella the central attraction so to speak of such a wedding as that Only I would have twelve bridesmaids at least and beat the blue and silver with green and gold Trying to the complexion you will say But there are artificial improvements At least I am told so What a house this would be a broad hint isn t it dear Lady Loring what a house for a wedding with the drawing room to assemble in and the picture gallery for the breakfast I know the Archbishop My darling he shall marry you Why don t you go into the next room Ah that constitutional indolence If you only had my energy as I used to say to your poor father Will you go Yes dear Lady Loring I should like a glass of champagne and another of those delicious chicken sandwiches If you don t go Stella I shall forget every consideration of propriety and big as you are I shall push you out Stella yielded to necessity Keep her quiet if you can she whispered to Lady Loring in the moment of silence that followed Even missus Eyrecourt was not able to talk while she was drinking champagne In the next room Stella found Romayne He looked careworn and irritable but brightened directly when she approached him My mother has been speaking to you she said I am afraid He stopped her there She is your mother he interposed kindly Don t think that I am ungrateful enough to forget that She took his arm and looked at him with all her heart in her eyes Come into a quieter room she whispered Romayne led her away Neither of them noticed Penrose as they left the room He had not moved since Stella had spoken to him There he remained in his corner absorbed in thought and not in happy thought as his face would have plainly betrayed to any one who had cared to look at him His eyes sadly followed the retiring figures of Stella and Romayne The color rose on his haggard cheeks Like most men who are accustomed to live alone he had the habit when he was strongly excited of speaking to himself No he said as the unacknowledged lovers disappeared through the door it is an insult to ask me to do it He turned the other way escaped Lady Loring s notice in the reception room and left the house Romayne and Stella passed through the card room and the chess room turned into a corridor and entered the conservatory For the first time the place was a solitude The air of a newly invented dance faintly audible through the open windows of the ballroom above had proved an irresistible temptation Those who knew the dance were eager to exhibit themselves Those who had only heard of it were equally anxious to look on and learn Even toward the latter end of the nineteenth century the youths and maidens of Society can still be in earnest when the object in view is a new dance What would Major Hynd have said if he had seen Romayne turn into one of the recesses of the conservatory in which there was a seat which just held two But the Major had forgotten his years and his family and he too was one of the spectators in the ballroom I wonder said Stella whether you know how I feel those kind words of yours when you spoke of my mother Shall I tell you She put her arm round his neck and kissed him He was a man new to love in the nobler sense of the word The exquisite softness in the touch of her lips the delicious fragrance of her breath intoxicated him Again and again he returned the kiss She drew back she recovered her self possession with a suddenness and a certainty incomprehensible to a man From the depths of tenderness she passed to the shallows of frivolity In her own defense she was almost as superficial as her mother in less than a moment What would mister Penrose say if he saw you she whispered Why do you speak of Penrose Have you seen him to night Yes looking sadly out of his element poor man I did my best to set him at his ease because I know you like him Dear Stella No not again I am speaking seriously now mister Penrose looked at me with a strange kind of interest I can t describe it Have you taken him into our confidence He is so devoted he has such a true interest in me said Romayne I really felt ashamed to treat him like a stranger On our journey to London I did own that it was your charming letter which had decided me on returning I did say I must tell her myself how well she has understood me and how deeply I feel her kindness Penrose took my hand in his gentle considerate way I understand you too he said and that was all that passed between us Nothing more since that time Nothing Not a word of what we said to each other when we were alone last week in the picture gallery Not a word I am self tormentor enough to distrust myself even now God knows I have concealed nothing from you and yet Am I not selfishly thinking of my own happiness Stella when I ought to be thinking only of you You know my angel with what a life you must associate yourself if you marry me Are you really sure that you have love enough and courage enough to be my wife She rested her head caressingly on his shoulder and looked up at him with her charming smile How many times must I say it she asked before you will believe me Once more I have love enough and courage enough to be your wife and I knew it Lewis the first time I saw you Will that confession satisfy your scruples And will you promise never again to doubt yourself or me Romayne promised and sealed the promise unresisted this time with a kiss When are we to be married he whispered She lifted her head from his shoulder with a sigh If I am to answer you honestly she replied I must speak of my mother before I speak of myself Romayne submitted to the duties of his new position as well as he understood them Do you mean that you have told your mother of our engagement he said In that case is it my duty or yours I am very ignorant in these matters to consult her wishes My own idea is that I ought to ask her if she approves of me as her son in law and that you might then speak to her of the marriage Stella thought of Romayne s tastes all in favor of modest retirement and of her mother s tastes all in favor of ostentation and display She frankly owned the result produced in her own mind I am afraid to consult my mother about our marriage she said Romayne looked astonished Do you think missus Eyrecourt will disapprove of it he asked Stella was equally astonished on her side Disapprove of it she repeated I know for certain that my mother will be delighted Then where is the difficulty There was but one way of definitely answering that question Stella boldly described her mother s idea of a wedding including the Archbishop the twelve bridesmaids in green and gold and the hundred guests at breakfast in Lord Loring s picture gallery Romayne s consternation literally deprived him for the moment of the power of speech To say that he looked at Stella as a prisoner in the condemned cell might have looked at the sheriff announcing the morning of his execution would be to do injustice to the prisoner He receives his shock without flinching and in proof of his composure celebrates his wedding with the gallows by a breakfast which he will not live to digest If you think as your mother does Romayne began as soon as he had recovered his self possession no opinion of mine shall stand in the way He could get no further His vivid imagination saw the Archbishop and the bridesmaids heard the hundred guests and their dreadful speeches his voice faltered in spite of himself Stella eagerly relieved him My darling I don t think as my mother does she interposed tenderly I am sorry to say we have very few sympathies in common Marriages as I think ought to be celebrated as privately as possible the near and dear relations present and no one else If there must be rejoicings and banquets and hundreds of invitations let them come when the wedded pair are at home after the honeymoon beginning life in earnest These are odd ideas for a woman to have but they are my ideas for all that Romayne s face brightened How few women possess your fine sense and your delicacy of feeling he exclaimed Surely your mother must give way when she hears we are both of one mind about our marriage Stella knew her mother too well to share the opinion thus expressed missus Eyrecourt s capacity for holding to her own little ideas and for persisting where her social interests were concerned in trying to insinuate those ideas into the minds of other persons was a capacity which no resistance short of absolute brutality could overcome She was perfectly capable of worrying Romayne as well as her daughter to the utmost limits of human endurance in the firm conviction that she was bound to convert all heretics of their way of thinking to the orthodox faith in the matter of weddings Putting this view of the case with all possible delicacy in speaking of her mother Stella expressed herself plainly enough nevertheless to enlighten Romayne He made another suggestion Can we marry privately he said and tell missus Eyrecourt of it afterward This essentially masculine solution of the difficulty was at once rejected Stella was too good a daughter to suffer her mother to be treated with even the appearance of disrespect Oh she said think how mortified and distressed my mother would be She must be present at my marriage An idea of a compromise occurred to Romayne What do you say he proposed to arranging for the marriage privately and then telling missus Eyrecourt only a day or two beforehand when it would be too late to send out invitations If your mother would be disappointed She would be angry Stella interposed Very well lay all the blame on me Besides there might be two other persons present whom I am sure missus Eyrecourt is always glad to meet You don t object to Lord and Lady Loring Object They are my dearest friends as well as yours Any one else Stella Any one Lewis whom you like Then I say no one else My own love when may it be My lawyers can get the settlements ready in a fortnight or less Will you say in a fortnight His arm was round her waist his lips were touching her lovely neck She was not a woman to take refuge in the commonplace coquetries of the sex Yes she said softly if you wish it She rose and withdrew herself from him For my sake we must not be here together any longer Lewis As she spoke the music in the ballroom ceased Stella ran out of the conservatory The first person she encountered on returning to the reception room was Father Benwell CHAPTER III THE END OF THE BALL THE priest s long journey did not appear to have fatigued him He was as cheerful and as polite as ever and so paternally attentive to Stella that it was quite impossible for her to pass him with a formal bow I have come all the way from Devonshire he said The train has been behind time as usual and I am one of the late arrivals in consequence I miss some familiar faces at this delightful party mister Romayne for instance Perhaps he is not one of the guests Oh yes Has he gone away Not that I know of The tone of her replies warned Father Benwell to let Romayne be He tried another name And Arthur Penrose he inquired next I think mister Penrose has left us As she answered she looked toward Lady Loring The hostess was the center of a circle of ladies and gentlemen Before she was at liberty Father Benwell might take his departure Stella resolved to make the attempt for herself which she had asked Lady Loring to make for her It was better to try and to be defeated than not to try at all I asked mister Penrose what part of Devonshire you were visiting she resumed assuming her more gracious manner I know something myself of the north coast especially the neighborhood of Clovelly Not the faintest change passed over the priest s face his fatherly smile had never been in a better state of preservation Isn t it a charming place he said with enthusiasm Clovelly is the most remarkable and most beautiful village in England I have so enjoyed my little holiday excursions by sea and excursions by land you know I feel quite young again He lifted his eyebrows playfully and rubbed his plump hands one over the other with such an intolerably innocent air of enjoyment that Stella positively hated him She felt her capacity for self restraint failing her Under the influence of strong emotion her thoughts lost their customary discipline In attempting to fathom Father Benwell she was conscious of having undertaken a task which required more pliable moral qualities than she possessed To her own unutterable annoyance she was at a loss what to say next At that critical moment her mother appeared eager for news of the conquest of Romayne My dear child how pale you look said missus Eyrecourt Come with me directly you must have a glass of wine This dexterous device for entrapping Stella into a private conversation failed Not now mamma thank you she said Father Benwell on the point of discreetly withdrawing stopped and looked at missus Eyrecourt with an appearance of respectful interest As things were it might not have been worth his while to take the trouble of discovering her But when she actually placed herself in his way the chance of turning missus Eyrecourt to useful account was not a chance to be neglected Your mother he said to Stella I should feel honored if you will introduce me Having not very willingly performed the ceremony of presentation Stella drew back a little She had no desire to take any part in the conversation that might follow but she had her own reasons for waiting near enough to hear it In the meanwhile missus Eyrecourt turned on her inexhaustible flow of small talk with her customary facility No distinction of persons troubled her no convictions of any sort stood in her way She was equally ready provided she met him in good society to make herself agreeable to a Puritan or a Papist Delighted to make your acquaintance Father Benwell Surely I met you at that delightful evening at the Duke s I mean when we welcomed the Cardinal back from Rome Dear old man if one may speak so familiarly of a Prince of the Church How charmingly he bears his new honors Such patriarchal simplicity as every one remarked Have you seen him lately The idea of the Order to which he belonged feeling any special interest in a Cardinal except when they made him of some use to them privately amused Father Benwell How wise the Church was he thought in inventing a spiritual aristocracy Even this fool of a woman is impressed by it His spoken reply was true to his assumed character as one of the inferior clergy Poor priests like me madam see but little of Princes of the Church in the houses of Dukes Saying this with the most becoming humility he turned the talk in a more productive direction before missus Eyrecourt could proceed with her recollections of the evening at the Duke s Your charming daughter and I have been talking about Clovelly he continued I have just been spending a little holiday in that delightful place It was a surprise to me missus Eyrecourt to see so many really beautiful country seats in the neighborhood I was particularly struck you know it of course by Beaupark House missus Eyrecourt s little twinging eyes suddenly became still and steady It was only for a moment But that trifling change boded ill for the purpose which the priest had in view Even the wits of a fool can be quickened by contact with the world For many years missus Eyrecourt had held her place in society acting under an intensely selfish sense of her own interests fortified by those cunning instincts which grow best in a barren intellect Perfectly unworthy of being trusted with secrets which only concerned other people this frivolous creature could be the unassailable guardian of secrets which concerned herself The instant the priest referred indirectly to Winterfield by speaking of Beaupark House her instincts warned her as if in words Be careful for Stella s sake Oh yes said missus Eyrecourt I know Beaupark House but may I make a confession she added with her sweetest smile Father Benwell caught her tone with his customary tact A confession at a ball is a novelty even in my experience he answered with his sweetest smile How good of you to encourage me proceeded missus Eyrecourt No thank you I don t want to sit down My confession won t take long and I really must give that poor pale daughter of mine a glass of wine A student of human nature like you they say all priests are students of human nature accustomed of course to be consulted in difficulties and to hear real confessions must know that we poor women are sadly subject to whims and caprices We can t resist them as men do and the dear good men generally make allowances for us Well do you know that place of mister Winterfield s is one of my caprices Oh dear I speak carelessly I ought to have said the place represents one of my caprices In short Father Benwell Beaupark House is perfectly odious to me and I think Clovelly the most overrated place in the world I haven t the least reason to give but so it is Excessively foolish of me It s like hysterics I can t help it I m sure you will forgive me There isn t a place on the habitable globe that I am not ready to feel interested in except detestable Devonshire I am so sorry you went there The next time you have a holiday take my advice Try the Continent I should like it of all things said Father Benwell Only I don t speak French Allow me to get Miss Eyrecourt a glass of wine He spoke with the most perfect temper and tranquillity Having paid his little attention to Stella and having relieved her of the empty glass he took his leave with a parting request thoroughly characteristic of the man Are you staying in town missus Eyrecourt he asked Oh of course at the height of the season May I have the honor of calling on you and talking a little more about the Continent If he had said it in so many words he could hardly have informed missus Eyrecourt more plainly that he thoroughly understood her and that he meant to try again Strong in the worldly training of half a lifetime she at once informed him of her address with the complimentary phrases proper to the occasion Five o clock tea on Wednesdays Father Benwell Don t forget The moment he was gone she drew her daughter into a quiet corner Don t be frightened Stella That sly old person has some interest in trying to find out about Winterfield Do you know why Indeed I don t mamma I hate him Oh hush hush Hate him as much as you like but always be civil to him Tell me have you been in the conservatory with Romayne Yes All going on well Yes My sweet child Dear dear me the wine has done you no good you re as pale as ever Is it that priest Oh pooh pooh leave Father Benwell to me CHAPTER IV IN THE SMALL HOURS WHEN Stella left the conservatory the attraction of the ball for Romayne was at an end He went back to his rooms at the hotel Penrose was waiting to speak to him Romayne noticed signs of suppressed agitation in his secretary s face Has anything happened he inquired Nothing of any importance Penrose answered in sad subdued tones I only wanted to ask you for leave of absence Certainly Is it for a long time Penrose hesitated You have a new life opening before you he said If your experience of that life is as I hope and pray it may be a happy one you will need me no longer we may not meet again His voice began to tremble he could say no more Not meet again Romayne repeated My dear Penrose if you forget how many happy days I owe to your companionship my memory is to be trusted Do you really know what my new life is to be Shall I tell you what I have said to Stella to night Penrose lifted his hand with a gesture of entreaty Not a word he said eagerly Do me one more kindness leave me to be prepared as I am prepared for the change that is to come without any confidence on your part to enlighten me further Don t think me ungrateful I have reasons for saying what I have just said I cannot mention what they are I can only tell you they are serious reasons You have spoken of my devotion to you If you wish to reward me a hundred fold more than I deserve bear in mind our conversations on religion and keep the books I asked you to read as gifts from a friend who loves you with his whole heart No new duties that you can undertake are incompatible with the higher interests of your soul Think of me sometimes When I leave you I go back to a lonely life My poor heart is full of your brotherly kindness at this last moment when I may be saying good by forever And what is my one consolation What helps me to bear my hard lot The Faith that I hold Remember that Romayne If there comes a time of sorrow in the future remember that Romayne was more than surprised he was shocked Why must you leave me he asked It is best for you and for her said Penrose that I should withdraw myself from your new life He held out his hand Romayne refused to let him go Penrose he said I can t match your resignation Give me something to look forward to I must and will see you again Penrose smiled sadly You know that my career in life depends wholly on my superiors he answered But if I am still in England and if you have sorrows in the future that I can share and alleviate only let me know it There is nothing within the compass of my power which I will not do for your sake God bless and prosper you Good by In spite of his fortitude the tears rose in his eyes He hurried out of the room Romayne sat down at his writing table and hid his face in his hands He had entered the room with the bright image of Stella in his mind The image had faded from it now the grief that was in him not even the beloved woman could share His thoughts were wholly with the brave and patient Christian who had left him the true man whose spotless integrity no evil influence could corrupt By what inscrutable fatality do some men find their way into spheres that are unworthy of them Oh Penrose if the priests of your Order were all like you how easily I should be converted These were Romayne s thoughts in the stillness of the first hours of the morning The books of which his lost friend had spoken were close by him on the table He opened one of them and turned to a page marked by pencil lines His sensitive nature was troubled to its inmost depths The confession of that Faith which had upheld Penrose was before him in words The impulse was strong in him to read those words and think over them again He trimmed his lamp and bent his mind on his book While he was still reading the ball at Lord Loring s house came to its end Stella and Lady Loring were alone together talking of him before they retired to their rooms Forgive me for owning it plainly said Lady Loring I think you and your mother are a little too ready to suspect Father Benwell without any discoverable cause Thousands of people go to Clovelly and Beaupark House is one of the show places in the neighborhood Is there a little Protestant prejudice in this new idea of yours Stella made no reply she seemed to be lost in her own thoughts Lady Loring went on I am open to conviction my dear If you will only tell me what interest Father Benwell can have in knowing about you and Winterfield Stella suddenly looked up Let us speak of another person she said I own I don t like Father Benwell As you know Romayne has concealed nothing from me Ought I to have any concealments from him Ought I not to tell him about Winterfield Lady Loring started You astonish me she said What right has Romayne to know it What right have I to keep it a secret from him My dear Stella if you had been in any way to blame in that miserable matter I should be the last person in the world to advise you to keep it a secret But you are innocent of all blame No man not even the man who is soon to be your husband has a right to know what you have so unjustly suffered Think of the humiliation of even speaking of it to Romayne I daren t think of it cried Stella passionately But if it is my duty It is your duty to consider the consequences Lady Loring interposed You don t know how such things sometimes rankle in a man s mind He may be perfectly willing to do you justice and yet there may be moments when he would doubt if you had told him the whole truth I speak with the experience of a married woman Don t place yourself in that position toward your husband if you wish for a happy married life Stella was not quite convinced yet Suppose Romayne finds it out she said He can t possibly find it out I detest Winterfield but let us do him justice He is no fool He has his position in the world to keep up and that is enough of itself to close his lips And as for others there are only three people now in England who could betray you I suppose you can trust your mother and Lord Loring and me It was needless to answer such a question as that Before Stella could speak again Lord Loring s voice was audible outside the door What talking still he exclaimed Not in bed yet Come in cried his wife Let us hear what my husband thinks she said to Stella Lord Loring listened with the closest attention while the subject under discussion was communicated to him When the time came to give his opinion he sided unhesitatingly with his wife If the fault was yours even in the slightest degree he said to Stella Romayne would have a right to be taken into your confidence But my dear child we who know the truth know you to be a pure and innocent woman You go to Romayne in every way worthy of him and you know that he loves you If you did tell him that miserable story he could only pity you Do you want to be pitied Those last unanswerable words brought the debate to an end From that moment the subject was dropped There was still one other person among the guests at the ball who was waking in the small hours of the morning Father Benwell wrapped comfortably in his dressing gown was too hard at work on his correspondence to think of his bed With one exception all the letters that he had written thus far were closed directed and stamped for the post The letter that he kept open he was now engaged in reconsidering and correcting It was addressed as usual to the Secretary of the Order at Rome and when it had undergone the final revision it contained these lines My last letter informed you of Romayne s return to London and to Miss Eyrecourt Let me entreat our reverend brethren to preserve perfect tranquillity of mind in spite of this circumstance The owner of Vange Abbey is not married yet If patience and perseverance on my part win their fair reward Miss Eyrecourt shall never be his wife But let me not conceal the truth In the uncertain future that lies before us I have no one to depend on but myself Penrose is no longer to be trusted and the exertions of the agent to whom I committed my inquiries are exertions that have failed I will dispose of the case of Penrose first The zeal with which this young man has undertaken the work of conversion intrusted to him has I regret to say not been fired by devotion to the interests of the Church but by a dog like affection for Romayne Without waiting for my permission Penrose has revealed himself in his true character as a priest And more than this he has not only refused to observe the proceedings of Romayne and Miss Eyrecourt he has deliberately closed his ears to the confidence which Romayne wished to repose in him on the ground that I might have ordered him to repeat that confidence to me To what use can we put this poor fellow s ungovernable sense of honor and gratitude Under present circumstances he is clearly of little use to us I have therefore given him time to think That is to say I have not opposed his leaving London to assist in the spiritual care of a country district It will be a question for the future whether we may not turn his enthusiasm to good account in a foreign mission However as it is always possible that his influence may still be of use to us I venture to suggest keeping him within our reach until Romayne s conversion has actually taken place Don t suppose that the present separation between them is final I will answer for their meeting again I may now proceed to the failure of my agent and to the course of action that I have adopted in consequence The investigations appear to have definitely broken down at the seaside village of Clovelly in the neighborhood of mister Winterfield s country seat Knowing that I could depend upon the information which associated this gentleman with Miss Eyrecourt under compromising circumstances of some sort I decided on seeing mister Winterfield and judging for myself The agent s report informed me that the person who had finally baffled his inquiries was an aged Catholic priest long resident at Clovelly His name is Newbliss and he is much respected among the Catholic gentry in that part of Devonshire After due consideration I obtained a letter of introduction to my reverend colleague and traveled to Clovelly telling my friends here that I was taking a little holiday in the interests of my health I found Father Newbliss a venerable and reticent son of the Church with one weak point however to work on which was entirely beyond the reach of the otherwise astute person charged with my inquiries My reverend friend is a scholar and is inordinately proud of his learning I am a scholar too In that capacity I first found my way to his sympathies and then gently encouraged his pride The result will appear in certain discoveries which I number as follows one The events which connect mister Winterfield with Miss Eyrecourt happened about two years since and had their beginning at Beaupark House two At this period Miss Eyrecourt and her mother were staying at Beaupark House The general impression in the neighborhood was that mister Winterfield and Miss Eyrecourt were engaged to be married three Not long afterward Miss Eyrecourt and her mother surprised the neighborhood by suddenly leaving Beaupark House Their destination was supposed to be London four mister Winterfield himself next left his country seat for the Continent His exact destination was not mentioned to any one The steward soon afterward dismissed all the servants and the house was left empty for more than a year five At the end of that time mister Winterfield returned alone to Beaupark House and told nobody how or where he had passed the long interval of his absence six mister Winterfield remains to the present day an unmarried man Having arrived at these preliminary discoveries it was time to try what I could make of mister Winterfield next Among the other good things which this gentleman has inherited is a magnificent library collected by his father That one learned man should take another learned man to see the books was a perfectly natural proceeding My introduction to the master of the house followed my introduction to the library almost as a matter of course I am about to surprise you as I was myself surprised In all my long experience mister Winterfield is I think the most fascinating person I ever met with Genial unassuming manners a prepossessing personal appearance a sweet temper a quaint humor delightfully accompanied by natural refinement such are the characteristic qualities of the man from whom I myself saw Miss Eyrecourt accidentally meeting him in public recoil with dismay and disgust It is absolutely impossible to look at him and to believe him to be capable of a cruel or dishonorable action I never was so puzzled in my life You may be inclined to think that I am misled by a false impression derived from the gratifying welcome that I received as a friend of Father Newbliss I will not appeal to my knowledge of human nature I will refer to the unanswerable evidence of mister Winterfield s poorer neighbors Wherever I went in the village or out of it if I mentioned his name I produced a universal outburst of admiration and gratitude There never was such a friend to poor people and there never can be such another to the end of the world Such was a fisherman s description of him and the one cry of all the men and women near us answered That s the truth And yet there is something wrong for this plain reason that there is something to be concealed in the past lives of mister Winterfield and Miss Eyrecourt Under these perplexing circumstances what use have I made of my opportunities I am going to surprise you again I have mentioned Romayne s name to mister Winterfield and I have ascertained that they are so far perfect strangers to one another and that is all The little incident of mentioning Romayne arose out of my examination of the library I discovered certain old volumes which may one day be of use to him if he continues his contemplated work on the Origin of Religions Hearing me express myself to this effect mister Winterfield replied with the readiest kindness I can t compare myself to my excellent father he said but I have at least inherited his respect for the writers of books My library is a treasure which I hold in trust for the interests of literature Pray say so from me to your friend mister Romayne And what does this amount to you will ask My reverend friend it offers me an opportunity in the future of bringing Romayne and Winterfield together Do you see the complications which may ensue If I can put no other difficulty in Miss Eyrecourt s way I think there is fruitful promise of a scandal of some kind arising out of the introduction to each other of those two men You will agree with me that a scandal may prove a valuable obstacle in the way of a marriage mister Winterfield has kindly invited me to call on him when he is next in London I may then have opportunities of putting questions which I could not venture to ask on a short acquaintance In the meantime I have obtained another introduction since my return to town I have been presented to Miss Eyrecourt s mother and I am invited to drink tea with her on Wednesday My next letter may tell you what Penrose ought to have discovered whether Romayne has been already entrapped into a marriage engagement or not Farewell for the present Remind the Reverend Fathers with my respects that I possess one of the valuable qualities of an Englishman I never know when I am beaten BOOK THE THIRD CHAPTER I THE HONEYMOON MORE than six weeks had passed The wedded lovers were still enjoying their honeymoon at Vange Abbey Some offense had been given not only to missus Eyrecourt but to friends of her way of thinking by the strictly private manner in which the marriage had been celebrated The event took everybody by surprise when the customary advertisement appeared in the newspapers Foreseeing the unfavorable impression that might be produced in some quarters Stella had pleaded for a timely retreat to the seclusion of Romayne s country house The will of the bride being as usual the bridegroom s law to Vange they retired accordingly On one lovely moonlight night early in July missus Romayne left her husband on the Belvidere described in Major Hynd s narrative to give the housekeeper certain instructions relating to the affairs of the household Half an hour later as she was about to ascend again to the top of the house one of the servants informed her that the master had just left the Belvidere and had gone into his study Crossing the inner hall on her way to the study Stella noticed an unopened letter addressed to Romayne lying on a table in a corner He had probably laid it aside and forgotten it She entered his room with the letter in her hand The only light was a reading lamp with the shade so lowered that the corners of the study were left in obscurity In one of these corners Romayne was dimly visible sitting with his head sunk on his breast He never moved when Stella opened the door At first she thought he might be asleep Do I disturb you Lewis she asked softly No my dear There was a change in the tone of his voice which his wife s quick ear detected I am afraid you are not well she said anxiously I am a little tired after our long ride to day Do you want to go back to the Belvidere Not without you Shall I leave you to rest here He seemed not to hear the question There he sat with his head hanging down the shadowy counterfeit of an old man In her anxiety Stella approached him and put her hand caressingly on his head It was burning hot O she cried you are ill and you are trying to hide it from me He put his arm round her waist and made her sit on his knee Nothing is the matter with me he said with an uneasy laugh What have you got in your hand A letter Yes Addressed to you and not opened yet He took it out of her hand and threw it carelessly on a sofa near him Never mind that now Let us talk He paused and kissed her before he went on My darling I think you must be getting tired of Vange Oh no I can be happy anywhere with you and especially at Vange You don t how this noble old house interests me and how I admire the glorious country all round it He was not convinced Vange is very dull he said obstinately and your friends will be wanting to see you Have you heard from your mother lately No I am surprised she has not written She has not forgiven us for getting married so quietly he went on We had better go back to London and make our peace with her Don t you want to see the house my aunt left me at Highgate Stella sighed The society of the man she loved was society enough for her Was he getting tired of his wife already I will go with you wherever you like She said those words in tones of sad submission and gently got up from his knee He rose also and took from the sofa the letter which he had thrown on it Let us see what our friends say he resumed The address is in Loring s handwriting As he approached the table on which the lamp was burning she noticed that he moved with a languor that was new in her experience of him He sat down and opened the letter She watched him with an anxiety which had now become intensified to suspicion The shade of the lamp still prevented her from seeing his face plainly Just what I told you he said the Lorings want to know when they are to see us in London and your mother says she feels like that character in Shakespeare who was cut by his own daughters Read it He handed her the letter In taking it she contrived to touch the lamp shade as if by accident and tilted it so that the full flow of the light fell on him He started back but not before she had seen the ghastly pallor on his face She had not only heard it from Lady Loring she knew from his own unreserved confession to her what that startling change really meant In an instant she was on her knees at his feet Oh my darling she cried it was cruel to keep that secret from your wife You have heard it again She was too irresistibly beautiful at that moment to be reproved He gently raised her from the floor and owned the truth Yes he said I heard it after you left me on the Belvidere just as I heard it on another moonlight night when Major Hynd was here with me Our return to this house is perhaps the cause I don t complain I have had a long release She threw her arms round his neck We will leave Vange to morrow she said It was firmly spoken But her heart sank as the words passed her lips Vange Abbey had been the scene of the most unalloyed happiness in her life What destiny was waiting for her when she returned to London CHAPTER II EVENTS AT TEN ACRES THERE was no obstacle to the speedy departure of Romayne and his wife from Vange Abbey The villa at Highgate called Ten Acres Lodge in allusion to the measurement of the grounds surrounding the house had been kept in perfect order by the servants of the late Lady Berrick now in the employment of her nephew On the morning after their arrival at the villa Stella sent a note to her mother The same afternoon missus Eyrecourt arrived at Ten Acres on her way to a garden party Finding the house to her great relief a modern building supplied with all the newest comforts and luxuries she at once began to plan a grand party in celebration of the return of the bride and bridegroom I don t wish to praise myself missus Eyrecourt said but if ever there was a forgiving woman I am that person We will say no more Stella about your truly contemptible wedding five people altogether including ourselves and the Lorings A grand ball will set you right with society and that is the one thing needful Tea and coffee my dear Romayne in your study Coote s quadrille band the supper from Gunter s the grounds illuminated with colored lamps Tyrolese singers among the trees relieved by military music and if there are any African or other savages now in London there is room enough in these charming grounds for encampments dances squaws scalps and all the rest of it to end in a blaze of fireworks A sudden fit of coughing seized her and stopped the further enumeration of attractions at the contemplated ball Stella had observed that her mother looked unusually worn and haggard through the disguises of paint and powder This was not an uncommon result of missus Eyrecourt s devotion to the demands of society but the cough was something new as a symptom of exhaustion I am afraid mamma you have been overexerting yourself said Stella You go to too many parties Nothing of the sort my dear I am as strong as a horse The other night I was waiting for the carriage in a draught one of the most perfect private concerts of the season ending with a delightfully naughty little French play and I caught a slight cold A glass of water is all I want Thank you Romayne you are looking shockingly serious and severe our ball will cheer you If you would only make a bonfire of all those horrid books you don t know how it would improve your spirits Dearest Stella I will come and lunch here to morrow you are within such a nice easy drive from town and I ll bring my visiting book and settle about the invitations and the day Oh dear me how late it is I have nearly an hour s drive before I get to my garden party Good by my turtle doves good by She was stopped on the way to her carriage by another fit of coughing But she still persisted in making light of it I m as strong as a horse she repeated as soon as she could speak and skipped into the carriage like a young girl Your mother is killing herself said Romayne If I could persuade her to stay with us a little while Stella suggested the rest and quiet might do wonders for her Would you object to it Lewis My darling I object to nothing except giving a ball and burning my books If your mother will yield on these two points my house is entirely at her disposal He spoke playfully he looked his best since he had separated himself from the painful associations that were now connected with Vange Abbey Had the torment of the Voice been left far away in Yorkshire Stella shrank from approaching the subject in her husband s presence knowing that it must remind him of the fatal duel To her surprise Romayne himself referred to the General s family I have written to Hynd he began Do you mind his dining with us to day Of course not I want to hear if he has anything to tell me about those French ladies He undertook to see them in your absence and to ascertain He was unable to overcome his reluctance to pronounce the next words Stella was quick to understand what he meant She finished the sentence for him Yes he said I wanted to hear how the boy is getting on and if there is any hope of curing him Is it he trembled as he put the question Is it hereditary madness Feeling the serious importance of concealing the truth Stella only replied that she had hesitated to ask if there was a taint of madness in the family I suppose she added you would not like to see the boy and judge of his chances of recovery for yourself You suppose he burst out with sudden anger You might be sure The bare idea of seeing him turns me cold Oh when shall I forget when shall I forget Who spoke of him first he said with renewed irritability after a moment of silence You or I It was my fault love he is so harmless and so gentle and he has such a sweet face I thought it might soothe you to see him Forgive me we will never speak of him again Have you any notes for me to copy You know Lewis I am your secretary now So she led Romayne away to his study and his books When Major Hynd arrived she contrived to be the first to see him Say as little as possible about the General s widow and her son she whispered The Major understood her Don t be uneasy missus Romayne he answered I know your husband well enough to know what you mean Besides the news I bring is good news Romayne came in before he could speak more particularly When the servants had left the room after dinner the Major made his report I am going to agreeably surprise you he began All responsibility toward the General s family is taken off our hands The ladies are on their way back to France Stella was instantly reminded of one of the melancholy incidents associated with her visit to Camp s Hill Madame Marillac spoke of a brother of hers who disapproved of the marriage she said Has he forgiven her That is exactly what he has done missus Romayne Naturally enough he felt the disgrace of his sister s marriage to such a man as the General Only the other day he heard for the first time that she was a widow and he at once traveled to England I bade them good by yesterday most happily reunited on their journey home again Ah I thought you would be glad missus Romayne to hear that the poor widow s troubles are over Her brother is rich enough to place them all in easy circumstances he is as good a fellow as ever lived Have you seen him Stella asked eagerly I have been with him to the asylum Does the boy go back to France No We took the place by surprise and saw for ourselves how well conducted it was The boy has taken a strong liking to the proprietor a bright cheerful old man who is teaching him some of our English games and has given him a pony to ride on He burst out crying poor creature at the idea of going away and his mother burst out crying at the idea of leaving him It was a melancholy scene You know what a good mother is no sacrifice is too great for her The boy stays at the asylum on the chance that his healthier and happier life there may help to cure him By the way Romayne his uncle desires me to thank you Hynd you didn t tell the uncle my name Don t alarm yourself He is a gentleman and when I told him I was pledged to secrecy he made but one inquiry he asked if you were a rich man I told him you had eighteen thousand a year Well Well he set that matter right between us with perfect taste He said I cannot presume to offer repayment to a person so wealthy We gratefully accept our obligation to our kind unknown friend For the future however my nephew s expenses must be paid from my purse Of course I could only agree to that From time to time the mother is to hear and I am to hear how the boy goes on Or if you like Romayne now that the General s family has left England I don t see why the proprietor might not make his report directly to yourself No Romayne rejoined positively Let things remain as they are Very well I can send you any letters that I may receive from the asylum Will you give us some music missus Romayne Not to night Then let us go to the billiard room and as I am the worst of bad players I will ask you to help me to beat your accomplished husband On the afternoon of the next day missus Eyrecourt s maid arrived at Ten Acres with a note from her mistress Dearest Stella Matilda must bring you my excuses for to day I don t in the least understand it but I seem to have turned lazy It is most ridiculous I really cannot get out of bed Perhaps I did do just a little too much yesterday The opera after the garden party and a ball after the opera and this tiresome cough all night after the ball Quite a series isn t it Make my apologies to our dear dismal Romayne and if you drive out this afternoon come and have a chat with me Your affectionate mother Emily Eyrecourt P S You know what a fidget Matilda is If she talks about me don t believe a word she says to you Stella turned to the maid with a sinking heart Is my mother very ill she asked So ill ma am that I begged and prayed her to let me send for a doctor You know what my mistress is If you would please to use your influence I will order the carriage instantly and take you back with me Before she dressed to go out Stella showed the letter to her husband He spoke with perfect kindness and sympathy but he did not conceal that he shared his wife s apprehensions Go at once were his last words to her and if I can be of any use send for me It was late in the evening before Stella returned She brought sad news The physician consulted told her plainly that the neglected cough and the constant fatigue had together made the case a serious one He declined to say that there was any absolute danger as yet or any necessity for her remaining with her mother at night The experience of the next twenty four hours at most would enable him to speak positively In the meantime the patient insisted that Stella should return to her husband Even under the influence of opiates missus Eyrecourt was still drowsily equal to herself You are a fidget my dear and Matilda is a fidget I can t have two of you at my bedside Good night Stella stooped over her and kissed her She whispered Three weeks notice remember for the party By the next evening the malady had assumed so formidable an aspect that the doctor had his doubts of the patient s chance of recovery With her husband s full approval Stella remained night and day at her mother s bedside Thus in a little more than a month from the day of his marriage Romayne was for the time a lonely man again The illness of missus Eyrecourt was unexpectedly prolonged There were intervals during which her vigorous constitution rallied and resisted the progress of the disease On these occasions Stella was able to return to her husband for a few hours subject always to a message which recalled her to her mother when the chances of life or death appeared to be equally balanced Romayne s one resource was in his books and his pen For the first time since his union with Stella he opened the portfolios in which Penrose had collected the first introductory chapters of his historical work Almost at every page the familiar handwriting of his secretary and friend met his view It was a new trial to his resolution to be working alone never had he felt the absence of Penrose as he felt it now He missed the familiar face the quiet pleasant voice and more than both the ever welcome sympathy with his work Stella had done all that a wife could do to fill the vacant place and her husband s fondness had accepted the effort as adding another charm to the lovely creature who had opened a new life to him But where is the woman who can intimately associate herself with the hard brain work of a man devoted to an absorbing intellectual pursuit She can love him admire him serve him believe in him beyond all other men but in spite of exceptions which only prove the rule she is out of her place when she enters the study while the pen is in his hand More than once when he was at work Romayne closed the page bitterly the sad thought came to him Oh if I only had Penrose here Even other friends were not available as a resource in the solitary evening hours Lord Loring was absorbed in social and political engagements And Major Hynd true to the principle of getting away as often as possible from his disagreeable wife and his ugly children had once more left London One day while missus Eyrecourt still lay between life and death Romayne found his historical labors suspended by the want of a certain volume which it was absolutely necessary to consult He had mislaid the references written for him by Penrose and he was at a loss to remember whether the book was in the British Museum in the Bodleian Library or in the Bibliotheque at Paris In this emergency a letter to his former secretary would furnish him with the information that he required But he was ignorant of Penrose s present address The Lorings might possibly know it so to the Lorings he resolved to apply CHAPTER III FATHER BENWELL AND THE BOOK ROMAYNE S first errand in London was to see his wife and to make inquiries at missus Eyrecourt s house The report was more favorable than usual Stella whispered as she kissed him I shall soon come back to you I hope Leaving the horses to rest for a while he proceeded to Lord Loring s residence on foot As he crossed a street in the neighborhood he was nearly run over by a cab carrying a gentleman and his luggage The gentleman was mister Winterfield on his way to Derwent s Hotel Lady Loring very kindly searched her card basket as the readiest means of assisting Romayne Penrose had left his card on his departure from London but no address was written on it Lord Loring unable himself to give the required information suggested the right person to consult Father Benwell will be here later in the day he said If you will write to Penrose at once he will add the address Are you sure before the letter goes that the book you want is not in my library I think not Romayne answered but I will write down the title and leave it here with my letter The same evening he received a polite note from Father Benwell informing him that the letter was forwarded and that the book he wanted was not in Lord Loring s library If there should be any delay or difficulty in obtaining this rare volume the priest added I only wait the expression of your wishes to borrow it from the library of a friend of mine residing in the country By return of post the answer affectionately and gratefully written arrived from Penrose He regretted that he was not able to assist Romayne personally But it was out of his power in plain words he had been expressly forbidden by Father Benwell to leave the service on which he was then engaged In reference to the book that was wanted it was quite likely that a search in the catalogues of the British Museum might discover it He had only met with it himself in the National Library at Paris This information led Romayne to London again immediately For the first time he called at Father Benwell s lodgings The priest was at home expecting the visit His welcome was the perfection of unassuming politeness He asked for the last news of poor missus Eyrecourt s health with the sympathy of a true friend I had the honor of drinking tea with missus Eyrecourt some little time since he said Her flow of conversation was never more delightful it seemed impossible to associate the idea of illness with so bright a creature And how well she kept the secret of your contemplated marriage May I offer my humble congratulations and good wishes Romayne thought it needless to say that missus Eyrecourt had not been trusted with the secret until the wedding day was close at hand My wife and I agreed in wishing to be married as quietly as possible he answered after making the customary acknowledgments And missus Romayne pursued Father Benwell This is a sad trial for her She is in attendance on her mother I suppose In constant attendance I am quite alone now To change the subject may I ask you to look at the reply which I have received from Penrose It is my excuse for troubling you with this visit Father Benwell read the letter with the closest attention In spite of his habitual self control his vigilant eyes brightened as he handed it back Thus far the priest s well planned scheme like mister Bitrake s clever inquiries had failed He had not even entrapped missus Eyrecourt into revealing the marriage engagement Her unconquerable small talk had foiled him at every point Even when he had deliberately kept his seat after the other guests at the tea table had taken their departure she rose with the most imperturbable coolness and left him I have a dinner and two parties to night and this is just the time when I take my little restorative nap Forgive me and do come again When he sent the fatal announcement of the marriage to Rome he had been obliged to confess that he was indebted for the discovery to the newspaper He had accepted the humiliation he had accepted the defeat but he was not beaten yet I counted on Romayne s weakness and Miss Eyrecourt counted on Romayne s weakness and Miss Eyrecourt has won So let it be My turn will come In that manner he had reconciled himself to his position And now he knew it when he handed back the letter to Romayne his turn had come You can hardly go to Paris to consult the book he said in the present state of missus Eyrecourt s health Certainly not Perhaps you will send somebody to search the catalogue at the British Museum I should have done that already Father Benwell but for the very kind allusion in your note to your friend in the country Even if the book is in the Museum Library I shall be obliged to go to the Reading Room to get my information It would be far more convenient to me to have the volume at home to consult if you think your friend will trust me with it I am certain he will trust you with it My friend is mister Winterfield of Beaupark House North Devon Perhaps you may have heard of him No the name is quite new to me Then come and see the man himself He is now in London and I am entirely at your service In half an hour more Romayne was presented to a well bred amiable gentleman in the prime of life smoking and reading the newspaper The bowl of his long pipe rested on the floor on one side of him and a handsome red and white spaniel reposed on the other Before his visitors had been two minutes in the room he understood the motive which had brought them to consult him and sent for a telegraphic form My steward will find the book and forward it to your address by passenger train this afternoon he said I will tell him to put my printed catalogue of the library into the parcel in case I have any other books which may be of use to you With those words he dispatched the telegram to the office Romayne attempted to make his acknowledgments mister Winterfield would hear no acknowledgments My dear sir he said with a smile that brightened his whole face you are engaged in writing a great historical work and I am an obscure country gentleman who is lucky enough to associate himself with the production of a new book How do you know that I am not looking forward to a complimentary line in the preface I am the obliged person not you Pray consider me as a handy little boy who runs on errands for the Muse of History Do you smoke Not even tobacco would soothe Romayne s wasted and irritable nerves Father Benwell all things to all men cheerfully accepted a cigar from the box on the table Father Benwell possesses all the social virtues mister Winterfield ran on He shall have his coffee and the largest sugar basin that the hotel can produce I can quite understand that your literary labors have tried your nerves he said to Romayne when he had ordered the coffee The mere title of your work overwhelms an idle man like me The Origin of Religions what an immense subject How far must we look back to find out the first worshipers of the human family Where are the hieroglyphics mister Romayne that will give you the earliest information In the unknown center of Africa or among the ruined cities of Yucatan My own idea as an ignorant man is that the first of all forms of worship must have been the worship of the sun Don t be shocked Father Benwell I confess I have a certain sympathy with sun worship In the East especially the rising of the sun is surely the grandest of all objects the visible symbol of a beneficent Deity who gives life warmth and light to the world of his creation Very grand no doubt remarked Father Benwell sweetening his coffee But not to be compared with the noble sight at Rome when the Pope blesses the Christian world from the balcony of saint Peter s So much for professional feeling said mister Winterfield But surely something depends on what sort of man the Pope is If we had lived in the time of Alexander the Sixth would you have called him a part of that noble sight Certainly at a proper distance Father Benwell briskly replied Ah you heretics only know the worst side of that most unhappy pontiff mister Winterfield we have every reason to believe that he felt privately the truest remorse I should require very good evidence to persuade me of it This touched Romayne on a sad side of his own personal experience Perhaps he said you don t believe in remorse Pardon me mister Winterfield rejoined I only distinguish between false remorse and true remorse We will say no more of Alexander the Sixth Father Benwell If we want an illustration I will supply it and give no offense True remorse depends to my mind on a man s accurate knowledge of his own motives far from a common knowledge in my experience Say for instance that I have committed some serious offense Romayne could not resist interrupting him Say you have killed one of your fellow creatures he suggested Very well If I know that I really meant to kill him for some vile purpose of my own and if which by no means always follows I am really capable of feeling the enormity of my own crime that is as I think true remorse Murderer as I am I have in that case some moral worth still left in me But if I did not mean to kill the man if his death was my misfortune as well as his and if as frequently happens I am nevertheless troubled by remorse the true cause lies in my own inability fairly to realize my own motives before I look to results I am the ignorant victim of false remorse and if I will only ask myself boldly what has blinded me to the true state of the case I shall find the mischief due to that misdirected appreciation of my own importance which is nothing but egotism in disguise I entirely agree with you said Father Benwell I have had occasion to say the same thing in the confessional mister Winterfield looked at his dog and changed the subject Do you like dogs mister Romayne he asked I see my spaniel s eyes saying that he likes you and his tail begging you to take some notice of him Romayne caressed the dog rather absently His new friend had unconsciously presented to him a new view of the darker aspect of his own life Winterfield s refined pleasant manners his generous readiness in placing the treasures of his library at a stranger s disposal had already appealed irresistibly to Romayne s sensitive nature The favorable impression was now greatly strengthened by the briefly bold treatment which he had just heard of a subject in which he was seriously interested I must see more of this man was his thought as he patted the companionable spaniel Father Benwell s trained observation followed the vivid changes of expression on Romayne s face and marked the eager look in his eyes as he lifted his head from the dog to the dog s master The priest saw his opportunity and took it Do you remain long at Ten Acres Lodge he said to Romayne I hardly know as yet We have no other plans at present You inherit the place I think from your late aunt Lady Berrick Yes The tone of the reply was not encouraging Romayne felt no interest in talking of Ten Acres Lodge Father Benwell persisted I was told by missus Eyrecourt he went on that Lady Berrick had some fine pictures Are they still at the Lodge Certainly I couldn t live in a house without pictures Father Benwell looked at Winterfield Another taste in common between you and mister Romayne he said besides your liking for dogs This at once produced the desired result Romayne eagerly invited Winterfield to see his pictures There are not many of them he said But they are really worth looking at When will you come The sooner the better Winterfield answered cordially Will to morrow do by the noonday light Whenever you please Your time is mine Among his other accomplishments Father Benwell was a chess player If his thoughts at that moment had been expressed in language they would have said Check to the queen CHAPTER IV THE END OF THE HONEYMOON ON the next morning Winterfield arrived alone at Romayne s house Having been included as a matter of course in the invitation to see the pictures Father Benwell had made an excuse and had asked leave to defer the proposed visit From his point of view he had nothing further to gain by being present at a second meeting between the two men in the absence of Stella He had it on Romayne s own authority that she was in constant attendance on her mother and that her husband was alone Either missus Eyrecourt will get better or she will die Father Benwell reasoned I shall make constant inquiries after her health and in either case I shall know when missus Romayne returns to Ten Acres Lodge After that domestic event the next time mister Winterfield visits mister Romayne I shall go and see the pictures It is one of the defects of a super subtle intellect to trust too implicitly to calculation and to leave nothing to chance Once or twice already Father Benwell had been in the popular phrase a little too clever and chance had thrown him out As events happened chance was destined to throw him out once more Of the most modest pretensions in regard to numbers and size the pictures collected by the late Lady Berrick were masterly works of modern art With few exceptions they had been produced by the matchless English landscape painters of half a century since There was no formal gallery here The pictures were so few that they could be hung in excellent lights in the different living rooms of the villa Turner Constable Collins Danby Callcott Linnell the master of Beaupark House passed from one to the other with the enjoyment of a man who thoroughly appreciated the truest and finest landscape art that the world has yet seen You had better not have asked me here he said to Romayne in his quaintly good humored way I can t part with those pictures when I say good by to day You will find me calling here again and again till you are perfectly sick of me Look at this sea piece Who thinks of the brushes and palette of that painter There truth to Nature and poetical feeling go hand in hand together It is absolutely lovely I could kiss that picture They were in Romayne s study when this odd outburst of enthusiasm escaped Winterfield He happened to look toward the writing table next Some pages of manuscript blotted and interlined with corrections at once attracted his attention Is that the forthcoming history he asked You are not one of the authors who perform the process of correction mentally you revise and improve with the pen in your hand Romayne looked at him in surprise I suspect mister Winterfield you have used your pen for other purposes than writing letters No indeed you pay me an undeserved compliment When you come to see me in Devonshire I can show you some manuscripts and corrected proofs left by our great writers collected by my father My knowledge of the secrets of the craft has been gained by examining those literary treasures If the public only knew that every writer worthy of the name is the severest critic of his own book before it ever gets into the hands of the reviewers how surprised they would be The man who has worked in the full fervor of composition yesterday is the same man who sits in severe and merciless judgment to day on what he has himself produced What a fascination there must be in the Art which exacts and receives such double labor as this Romayne thought not unkindly of his wife Stella had once asked him how long a time he was usually occupied in writing one page The reply had filled her with pity and wonder Why do you take all that trouble she had gently remonstrated It would be just the same to the people darling if you did it in half the time By way of changing the topic Romayne led his visitor into another room I have a picture here he said which belongs to a newer school of painting You have been talking of hard work in one Art there it is in another Yes said Winterfield there it is the misdirected hard work which has been guided by no critical faculty and which doesn t know where to stop I try to admire it and I end in pitying the poor artist Look at that leafless felled tree in the middle distance Every little twig on the smallest branch is conscientiously painted and the result is like a colored photograph You don t look at a landscape as a series of separate parts you don t discover every twig on a tree you see the whole in Nature and you want to see the whole in a picture That canvas presents a triumph of patience and pains produced exactly as a piece of embroidery is produced all in little separate bits worked with the same mechanically complete care I turn away from it to your shrubbery there with an ungrateful sense of relief He walked to the window as he spoke It looked out on the grounds in front of the house At the same moment the noise of rolling wheels became audible on the drive An open carriage appeared at the turn in the road Winterfield called Romayne to the window A visitor he began and suddenly drew back without saying a word more Romayne looked out and recognized his wife Excuse me for one moment he said it is missus Romayne On that morning an improvement in the fluctuating state of missus Eyrecourt s health had given Stella another of those opportunities of passing an hour or two with her husband which she so highly prized Romayne withdrew to meet her at the door too hurriedly to notice Winterfield standing in the corner to which he had retreated like a man petrified Stella had got out of the carriage when her husband reached the porch She ascended the few steps that led to the hall as slowly and painfully as if she had been an infirm old woman The delicately tinted color in her face had faded to an ashy white She had seen Winterfield at the window For the moment Romayne looked at her in speechless consternation He led her into the nearest room that opened out of the hall and took her in his arms My love this nursing of your mother has completely broken you down he said with the tenderest pity for her If you won t think of yourself you must think of me For my sake remain here and take the rest that you need I will be a tyrant Stella for the first time I won t let you go back She roused herself and tried to smile and hid the sad result from him in a kiss I do feel the anxiety and fatigue she said But my mother is really improving and if it only continues the blessed sense of relief will make me strong again She paused and roused all her courage in anticipation of the next words so trivial and so terrible that must sooner or later be pronounced You have a visitor she said Did you see him at the window A really delightful man I know you will like him Under any other circumstances I should have introduced him You are not well enough to see strangers today She was too determined to prevent Winterfield from ever entering the house again to shrink from the meeting I am not so ill as you think Lewis she said bravely When you go to your new friend I will go with you I am a little tired that s all Romayne looked at her anxiously Let me get you a glass of wine he said She consented she really felt the need of it As he turned away to ring the bell she put the question which had been in her mind from the moment when she had seen Winterfield How did you become acquainted with this gentleman Through Father Benwell She was not surprised by the answer her suspicion of the priest had remained in her mind from the night of Lady Loring s ball The future of her married life depended on her capacity to check the growing intimacy between the two men In that conviction she found the courage to face Winterfield How should she meet him The impulse of the moment pointed to the shortest way out of the dreadful position in which she was placed it was to treat him like a stranger She drank her glass of wine and took Romayne s arm We mustn t keep your friend waiting any longer she resumed Come As they crossed the hall she looked suspiciously toward the house door Had he taken the opportunity of leaving the villa At any other time she would have remembered that the plainest laws of good breeding compelled him to wait for Romayne s return His own knowledge of the world would tell him that an act of gross rudeness committed by a well bred man would inevitably excite suspicion of some unworthy motive and might perhaps connect that motive with her unexpected appearance at the house Romayne opened the door and they entered the room together mister Winterfield let me introduce you to missus Romayne They bowed to each other they spoke the conventional words proper to the occasion but the effort that it cost them showed itself Romayne perceived an unusual formality in his wife s manner and a strange disappearance of Winterfield s easy grace of address Was he one of the few men in these days who are shy in the presence of women And was the change in Stella attributable perhaps to the state of her health The explanation might in either case be the right one He tried to set them at their ease mister Winterfield is so pleased with the pictures that he means to come and see them again he said to his wife And one of his favorites happens to be your favorite too She tried to look at Winterfield but her eyes sank She could turn toward him and that was all Is it the sea piece in the study she said to him faintly Yes he answered with formal politeness it seems to me to be one of the painter s finest works Romayne looked at him in unconcealed wonder To what flat commonplace Winterfield s lively enthusiasm had sunk in Stella s presence She perceived that some unfavorable impression had been produced on her husband and interposed with a timely suggestion Her motive was not only to divert Romayne s attention from Winterfield but to give him a reason for leaving the room The little water color drawing in my bedroom is by the same artist she said mister Winterfield might like to see it If you will ring the bell Lewis I will send my maid for it Romayne had never allowed the servants to touch his works of art since the day when a zealous housemaid had tried to wash one of his plaster casts He made the reply which his wife had anticipated No no he said I will fetch the drawing myself He turned gayly to Winterfield Prepare yourself for another work that you would like to kiss He smiled and left the room The instant the door was closed Stella approached Winterfield Her beautiful face became distorted by a mingled expression of rage and contempt She spoke to him in a fierce peremptory whisper Have you any consideration for me left His look at her as she put that question revealed the most complete contrast between his face and hers Compassionate sorrow was in his eyes tender forbearance and respect spoke in his tones as he answered her I have more than consideration for you Stella She angrily interrupted him How dare you call me by my Christian name He remonstrated with a gentleness that might have touched the heart of any woman Do you still refuse to believe that I never deceived you Has time not softened your heart to me yet She was more contemptuous toward him than ever Spare me your protestations she said I heard enough of them two years since Will you do what I ask of you You know that I will Put an end to your acquaintance with my husband Put an end to it she repeated vehemently from this day at once and forever Can I trust you to do it Do you think I would have entered this house if I had known he was your husband He made that reply with a sudden change in him with a rising color and in firm tones of indignation In a moment more his voice softened again and his kind blue eyes rested on her sadly and devotedly You may trust me to do more than you ask he resumed You have made a mistake What mistake When mister Romayne introduced us you met me like a stranger and you left me no choice but to do as you did I wish you to be a stranger Her sharpest replies made no change in his manner He spoke as kindly and as patiently as ever You forget that you and your mother were my guests at Beaupark two years ago Stella understood what he meant and more In an instant she remembered that Father Benwell had been at Beaupark House Had he heard of the visit She clasped her hands in speechless terror Winterfield gently reassured her You must not be frightened he said It is in the last degree unlikely that mister Romayne will ever find out that you were at my house If he does and if you deny it I will do for you what I would do for no other human creature I will deny it too You are safe from discovery Be happy and forget me For the first time she showed signs of relenting she turned her head away and sighed Although her mind was full of the serious necessity of warning him against Father Benwell she had not even command enough over her own voice to ask how he had become acquainted with the priest His manly devotion the perfect and pathetic sincerity of his respect pleaded with her in spite of herself For a moment she paused to recover her composure In that moment Romayne returned to them with the drawing in his hand There he said It s nothing this time but some children gathering flowers on the outskirts of a wood What do you think of it What I thought of the larger work Winterfield answered I could look at it by the hour together He consulted his watch But time is a hard master and tells me that my visit must come to an end Thank you most sincerely He bowed to Stella Romayne thought his guest might have taken the English freedom of shaking hands When will you come and look at the pictures again he asked Will you dine with us and see how they bear the lamplight I am sorry to say I must beg you to excuse me My plans are altered since we met yesterday I am obliged to leave London Romayne was unwilling to part with him on these terms You will let me know when you are next in town he said Certainly With that short answer he hurried away Romayne waited a little in the hall before he went back to his wife Stella s reception of Winterfield though not positively ungracious was nevertheless the reverse of encouraging What extraordinary caprice had made her insensible to the social attractions of a man so unaffectedly agreeable It was not wonderful that Winterfield s cordiality should have been chilled by the cold welcome that he had received from the mistress of the house At the same time some allowance was to be made for the influence of Stella s domestic anxieties and some sympathy was claimed by the state of her health Although her husband shrank from distressing her by any immediate reference to her reception of his friend he could not disguise from himself that she had disappointed him When he went back to the room Stella was lying on the sofa with her face turned toward the wall She was in tears and she was afraid to let him see it I won t disturb you he said and withdrew to his study The precious volume which Winterfield had so kindly placed at his disposal was on the table waiting for him Father Benwell had lost little by not being present at the introduction of Winterfield to Stella He had witnessed a plainer betrayal of emotion when they met unexpectedly in Lord Loring s picture gallery But if he had seen Romayne reading in his study and Stella crying secretly on the sofa he might have written to Rome by that day s post and might have announced that he had sown the first seeds of disunion between husband and wife CHAPTER V FATHER BENWELL S CORRESPONDENCE To the Secretary S J Rome In my last few hasty lines I was only able to inform you of the unexpected arrival of missus Romayne while Winterfield was visiting her husband If you remember I warned you not to attach any undue importance to my absence on that occasion My present report will satisfy my reverend brethren that the interests committed to me are as safe as ever in my hands I have paid three visits at certain intervals The first to Winterfield briefly mentioned in my last letter the second to Romayne the third to the invalid lady missus Eyrecourt In every case I have been rewarded by important results We will revert to Winterfield first I found him at his hotel enveloped in clouds of tobacco smoke Having led him with some difficulty into talking of his visit to Ten Acres Lodge I asked how he liked Romayne s pictures I envy him his pictures That was the only answer And how do you like missus Romayne I inquired next He laid down his pipe and looked at me attentively My face I flatter myself defied discovery He inhaled another mouthful of tobacco and began to play with his dog If I must answer your question he burst out suddenly I didn t get a very gracious reception from missus Romayne There he abruptly stopped He is a thoroughly transparent man you see straight into his mind through his eyes I perceived that he was only telling me a part perhaps a very small part of the truth Can you account for such a reception as you describe I asked He answered shortly No Perhaps I can account for it I went on Did mister Romayne tell his wife that I was the means of introducing you to him He fixed another searching look on me mister Romayne might have said so when he left me to receive his wife at the door In that case mister Winterfield the explanation is as plain as the sun at noonday missus Romayne is a strong Protestant and I am a Catholic priest He accepted this method of accounting for his reception with an alacrity that would not have imposed on a child You see I had relieved him from all further necessity of accounting for the conduct of missus Romayne A lady s religious prejudices I proceeded in the friendliest way are never taken seriously by a sensible man You have placed mister Romayne under obligations to your kindness he is eager to improve his acquaintance with you You will go again to Ten Acres Lodge He gave me another short answer I think not I said I was sorry to hear it However I added you can always see him here when you are in London He puffed out a big volume of smoke and made no remark I declined to be put down by silence and smoke Or perhaps I persisted you will honor me by meeting him at a simple little dinner at my lodgings Being a gentleman he was of course obliged to answer this He said You are very kind I would rather not Shall we talk of something else Father Benwell We talked of something else He was just as amiable as ever but he was not in good spirits I think I shall run over to Paris before the end of the month he said To make a long stay I asked Oh no Call in a week or ten days and you will find me here again When I got up to go he returned of his own accord to the forbidden subject He said I must beg you to do me two favors The first is not to let mister Romayne know that I am still in London The second is not to ask me for any explanations The result of our interview may be stated in very few words It has advanced me one step nearer to discovery Winterfield s voice look and manner satisfied me of this the true motive for his sudden change of feeling toward Romayne is jealousy of the man who has married Miss Eyrecourt Those compromising circumstances which baffled the inquiries of my agent are associated in plain English with a love affair Remember all that I have told you of Romayne s peculiar disposition and imagine if you can what the consequences of such a disclosure will be when we are in a position to enlighten the master of Vange Abbey As to the present relations between the husband and wife I have only to tell you next what passed when I visited Romayne a day or two later I did well to keep Penrose at our disposal We shall want him again On arriving at Ten Acres Lodge I found Romayne in his study His manuscript lay before him but he was not at work He looked worn and haggard To this day I don t know from what precise nervous malady he suffers I could only guess that it had been troubling him again since he and I last met My first conventional civilities were dedicated of course to his wife She is still in attendance on her mother missus Eyrecourt is now considered to be out of danger But the good lady who is ready enough to recommend doctors to other people persists in thinking that she is too robust a person to require medical help herself The physician in attendance trusts entirely to her daughter to persuade her to persevere with the necessary course of medicine Don t suppose that I trouble you by mentioning these trumpery circumstances without a reason We shall have occasion to return to missus Eyrecourt and her doctor Before I had been five minutes in his company Romayne asked me if I had seen Winterfield since his visit to Ten Acres Lodge I said I had seen him and waited anticipating the next question Romayne fulfilled my expectations He inquired if Winterfield had left London There are certain cases as I am told by medical authorities in which the dangerous system of bleeding a patient still has its advantages There are other cases in which the dangerous system of telling the truth becomes equally judicious I said to Romayne If I answer you honestly will you consider it as strictly confidential mister Winterfield I regret to say has no intention of improving his acquaintance with you He asked me to conceal from you that he is still in London Romayne s face plainly betrayed that he was annoyed and irritated Nothing that you say to me Father Benwell shall pass the walls of this room he replied Did Winterfield give any reason for not continuing his acquaintance with me I told the truth once more with courteous expressions of regret mister Winterfield spoke of an ungracious reception on the part of missus Romayne He started to his feet and walked irritably up and down the room It is beyond endurance he said to himself The truth had served its purpose by this time I affected not to have heard him Did you speak to me I asked He used a milder form of expression It is most unfortunate he said I must immediately send back the valuable book which mister Winterfield has lent to me And that is not the worst of it There are other volumes in his library which I have the greatest interest in consulting and it is impossible for me to borrow them now At this time too when I have lost Penrose I had hoped to find in Winterfield another friend who sympathized with my pursuits There is something so cheering and attractive in his manner and he has just the boldness and novelty of view in his opinions that appeal to a man like me It was a pleasant future to look forward to and it must be sacrificed and to what To a woman s caprice From our point of view this was a frame of mind to be encouraged I tried the experiment of modestly taking the blame on myself I suggested that I might be quite innocently answerable for Romayne s disappointment He looked at me thoroughly puzzled I repeated what I had said to Winterfield Did you mention to missus Romayne that I was the means of introducing you He was too impatient to let me finish the sentence I did mention it to missus Romayne he said And what of it Pardon me for reminding you that missus Romayne has Protestant prejudices I rejoined mister Winterfield would I fear not be very welcome to her as the friend of a Catholic priest He was almost angry with me for suggesting the very explanation which had proved so acceptable to Winterfield Nonsense he cried My wife is far too well bred a woman to let her prejudices express themselves in that way Winterfield s personal appearance must have inspired her with some unreasonable antipathy or He stopped and turned away thoughtfully to the window Some vague suspicion had probably entered his mind which he had only become aware of at that moment and which he was not quite able to realize as yet I did my best to encourage the new train of thought What other reason can there be I asked He turned on me sharply I don t know Do you I ventured on a courteous remonstrance My dear sir if you can t find another reason how can I It must have been a sudden antipathy as you say Such things do happen between strangers I suppose I am right in assuming that missus Romayne and mister Winterfield are strangers His eyes flashed with a sudden sinister brightness the new idea had caught light in his mind They met as strangers he said There he stopped again and returned to the window I felt that I might lose the place I had gained in his confidence if I pressed the subject any further Besides I had my reasons for saying a word about Penrose next As it happened I had received a letter from him relating to his present employment and sending kindest regards to his dear friend and master in the postscript I gave the message Romayne looked round with an instant change in his face The mere sound of Penrose s name seemed to act as a relief to the gloom and suspicion that had oppressed him the moment before You don t know how I miss the dear gentle little fellow he said sadly Why not write to him I suggested He would be so glad to hear from you again I don t know where to write Did I not send you his address when I forwarded your letter to him No Then let me atone for my forgetfulness at once I wrote down the address and took my leave As I approached the door I noticed on a side table the Catholic volumes which Penrose left with Romayne One of them was open with a pencil lying beside it I thought that a good sign but I said nothing Romayne pressed my hand at parting You have been very kind and friendly Father Benwell he said I shall be glad to see you again Don t mention it in quarters where it might do me harm Do you know I really pitied him He has sacrificed everything to his marriage and his marriage has disappointed him He was even reduced to be friendly with Me Of course when the right time comes I shall give Penrose leave of absence Do you foresee as I do the speedy return of the dear gentle little fellow to his old employment the resumed work of conversion advancing more rapidly than ever and the jealousy of the Protestant wife aggravating the false position in which she is already placed by her equivocal reception of Winterfield You may answer this by reminding me of the darker side of the prospect An heir may be born and the heir s mother backed by general opinion may insist if there is any hesitation in the matter on asserting the boy s natural right to succeed his father Patience my reverend colleague There is no threatening of any such calamity yet And even if it happens don t forget that Romayne has inherited a second fortune The Vange estate has an estimated value If the act of restitution represented that value in ready money do you think the Church would discourage a good convert by refusing his check You know better than that and so do I The next day I called to inquire how missus Eyrecourt was getting on The report was favorable Three days later I called again The report was still more encouraging I was also informed that missus Romayne had returned to Ten Acres Lodge Much of my success in life has been achieved by never being in a hurry I was not in a hurry now Time sometimes brings opportunities and opportunities are worth waiting for Let me make this clear by an example A man of headlong disposition in my place would have probably spoken of Miss Eyrecourt s marriage to Romayne at his first meeting with Winterfield and would have excited their distrust and put them respectively on their guard without obtaining any useful result I can at any time make the disclosure to Romayne which informs him that his wife had been Winterfield s guest in Devonshire when she affected to meet her former host on the footing of a stranger In the meanwhile I give Penrose ample opportunity for innocently widening the breach between husband and wife You see I hope that if I maintain a passive position it is not from indolence or discouragement Now we may get on After an interval of a few days more I decided on making further inquiries at missus Eyrecourt s house This time when I left my card I sent a message asking if the lady could receive me Shall I own my weakness She possesses all the information that I want and she has twice baffled my inquiries Under these humiliating circumstances it is part of the priestly pugnacity of my disposition to inquire again I was invited to go upstairs The front and back drawing rooms of the house were thrown into one missus Eyrecourt was being gently moved backward and forward in a chair on wheels propelled by her maid two gentlemen being present visitors like myself In spite of rouge and loosely folded lace and flowing draperies she presented a deplorable spectacle The bodily part of her looked like a dead woman painted and revived while the moral part in the strongest contrast was just as lively as ever So glad to see you again Father Benwell and so much obliged by your kind inquiries I am quite well though the doctor won t admit it Isn t it funny to see me being wheeled about like a child in a perambulator Returning to first principles I call it You see it s a law of my nature that I must go about The doctor won t let me go about outside the house so I go about inside the house Matilda is the nurse and I am the baby who will learn to walk some of these days Are you tired Matilda No Then give me another turn there s a good creature Movement perpetual movement is a law of Nature Oh dear no doctor I didn t make that discovery for myself Some eminent scientific person mentioned it in a lecture The ugliest man I ever saw Now back again Matilda Let me introduce you to my friends Father Benwell Introducing is out of fashion I know But I am one of the few women who can resist the tyranny of fashion I like introducing people Sir John Drone Father Benwell Father Benwell Doctor Wybrow Ah yes you know the doctor by reputation Shall I give you his character Personally charming professionally detestable Pardon my impudence doctor it is one of the consequences of the overflowing state of my health Another turn Matilda and a little faster this time Oh how I wish I was traveling by railway There her breath failed her She reclined in her chair and fanned herself silently for a while I was now able to turn my attention to the two visitors Sir John Drone it was easy to see would be no obstacle to confidential conversation with missus Eyrecourt An excellent country gentleman with the bald head the ruddy complexion and the inexhaustible capacity for silence so familiar to us in English society there you have the true description of Sir John But the famous physician was quite another sort of man I had only to look at him and to feel myself condemned to small talk while he was in the room You have always heard of it in my correspondence whenever I have been in the wrong I was in the wrong again now I had forgotten the law of chances Capricious Fortune after a long interval was about to declare herself again in my favor by means of the very woman who had twice already got the better of me What a recompense for my kind inquiries after missus Eyrecourt She recovered breath enough to begin talking again Dear me how dull you are she said to us Why don t you amuse a poor prisoner confined to the house Rest a little Matilda or you will be falling ill next Doctor is this your last professional visit Promise to take care of yourself missus Eyrecourt and I will confess that the professional visits are over I come here to day only as a friend You best of men Do me another favor Enliven our dullness Tell us some interesting story about a patient These great doctors Sir John pass their lives in a perfect atmosphere of romance doctor Wybrow s consulting room is like your confessional Father Benwell The most fascinating sins and sorrows are poured into his ears What is the last romance in real life doctor that has asked you to treat it medically We don t want names and places we are good children we only want a story doctor Wybrow looked at me with a smile It is impossible to persuade ladies he said that we too are father confessors in our way The first duty of a doctor missus Eyrecourt Is to cure people of course she interposed in her smartest manner The doctor answered seriously No indeed That is only the second duty Our first duty is invariably to respect the confidence of our patients However he resumed in his easier tone I happen to have seen a patient to day under circumstances which the rules of professional honor do not forbid me to mention I don t know missus Eyrecourt whether you will quite like to be introduced to the scene of the story The scene is in a madhouse missus Eyrecourt burst out with a coquettish little scream and shook her fan at the doctor No horrors she cried The bare idea of a madhouse distracts me with terror Oh fie fie I won t listen to you I won t look at you I positively refuse to be frightened out of my wits Matilda wheel me away to the furthest end of the room My vivid imagination Father Benwell is my rock ahead in life I declare I can smell the odious madhouse Go straight to the window Matilda I want to bury my nose among the flowers Sir John upon this spoke for the first time His language consisted entirely of beginnings of sentences mutely completed by a smile Upon my word you know Eh Doctor Wybrow A man of your experience Horrors in madhouses A lady in delicate health No really Upon my honor now I cannot Something funny oh yes But such a subject oh no He rose to leave us doctor Wybrow gently stopped him I had a motive Sir John he said but I won t trouble you with needless explanations There is a person unknown to me whom I want to discover You are a great deal in society when you are in London May I ask if you have ever met with a gentleman named Winterfield I have always considered the power of self control as one of the strongest points in my character For the future I shall be more humble When I heard that name my surprise so completely mastered me that I sat self betrayed to doctor Wybrow as the man who could answer his question In the meanwhile Sir John took his time to consider and discovered that he had never heard of a person named Winterfield Having acknowledged his ignorance in his own eloquent language he drifted away to the window box in the next room and gravely contemplated missus Eyrecourt with her nose buried in flowers The doctor turned to me Am I wrong Father Benwell in supposing that I had better have addressed myself to you I admitted that I knew a gentleman named Winterfield doctor Wybrow got up directly Have you a few minutes to spare he asked It is needless to say that I was at the doctor s disposal My house is close by and my carriage is at the door he resumed When you feel inclined to say good by to our friend missus Eyrecourt I have something to say to you which I think you ought to know We took our departure at once missus Eyrecourt leaving some of the color of her nose among the flowers patted me encouragingly with her fan and told the doctor that he was forgiven on the understanding that he would never do it again In five minutes more we were in doctor Wybrow s study My watch tells me that I cannot hope to finish this letter by post time Accept what I have written thus far and be assured that the conclusion of my report shall follow a day later II The doctor began cautiously Winterfield is not a very common name he said But it may not be amiss Father Benwell to discover if we can whether your Winterfield is the man of whom I am in search Do you only know him by name or are you a friend of his I answered of course that I was a friend doctor Wybrow went on Will you pardon me if I venture on an indiscreet question When you are acquainted with the circumstances I am sure you will understand and excuse me Are you aware of any what shall I call it any romantic incident in mister Winterfield s past life This time feeling myself in all probability on the brink of discovery I was careful to preserve my composure I said quietly Some such incident as you describe has occurred in mister Winterfield s past life There I stopped discreetly and looked as if I knew all about it The doctor showed no curiosity to hear more My object he went on was merely to be reasonably sure that I was speaking to the right person in speaking to you I may now tell you that I have no personal interest in trying to discover mister Winterfield I only act as the representative of an old friend of mine He is the proprietor of a private asylum at Sandsworth a man whose integrity is beyond dispute or he would not be my friend You understand my motive in saying this Proprietors of private asylums are in these days the objects of very general distrust in England I understood the doctor s motive perfectly He proceeded Yesterday evening my friend called upon me and said that he had a remarkable case in his house which he believed would interest me The person to whom he alluded was a French boy whose mental powers had been imperfectly developed from his childhood The mischief had been aggravated when he was about thirteen years old by a serious fright When he was placed in my asylum he was not idiotic and not dangerously mad it was a case not to use technical language of deficient intelligence tending sometimes toward acts of unreasoning mischief and petty theft but never approaching to acts of downright violence My friend was especially interested in the lad won his confidence and affection by acts of kindness and so improved his bodily health as to justify some hope of also improving the state of his mind when a misfortune occurred which has altered the whole prospect The poor creature has fallen ill of a fever and the fever has developed to typhus So far there has been little to interest you I am coming to a remarkable event at last At the stage of the fever when delirium usually occurs in patients of sound mind this crazy French boy has become perfectly sane and reasonable I looked at him when he made this amazing assertion with a momentary doubt of his being in earnest Doctor Wybrow understood me Just what I thought too when I first heard it he said My friend was neither offended nor surprised After inviting me to go to his house and judge for myself he referred me to a similar case publicly cited in the Cornhill Magazine for the month of April eighteen seventy nine in an article entitled Bodily Illness as a Mental Stimulant The article is published anonymously but the character of the periodical in which it appears is a sufficient guarantee of the trustworthiness of the statement I was so far influenced by the testimony thus cited that I drove to Sandsworth and examined the case myself Did the examination satisfy you Thoroughly When I saw him last night the poor boy was as sane as I am There is however a complication in this instance which is not mentioned in the case related in print The boy appears to have entirely forgotten every event in his past life reckoning from the time when the bodily illness brought with it the strange mental recovery which I have mentioned to you This was a disappointment I had begun to hope for some coming result obtained by the lad s confession Is it quite correct to call him sane when his memory is gone I ventured to ask In this case there is no necessity to enter into the question the doctor answered The boy s lapse of memory refers as I told you to his past life that is to say his life when his intellect was deranged During the extraordinary interval of sanity that has now declared itself he is putting his mental powers to their first free use and none of them fail him so far as I can see His new memory if I may call it so preserves the knowledge of what has happened since his illness You may imagine how this problem in brain disease interests me and you will not wonder that I am going back to Sandsworth tomorrow afternoon when I have done with my professional visits But you may be reasonably surprised at my troubling you with details which are mainly interesting to a medical man Was he about to ask me to go with him to the asylum I replied very briefly merely saying that the details were interesting to every student of human nature If he could have felt my pulse at that moment I am afraid he might have thought I was in a fair way of catching the fever too Prepare yourself he resumed for another surprising circumstance mister Winterfield is by some incomprehensible accident associated with one of the mischievous tricks played by the French boy before he was placed under my friend s care There at any rate is the only explanation by which we can account for the discovery of an envelope with inclosures found sewn up in the lining of the lad s waistcoat and directed to mister Winterfield without any place of address I leave you to imagine the effect which those words produced on me Now said the doctor you will understand why I put such strange questions to you My friend and I are both hard working men We go very little into society as the phrase is and neither he nor I had ever heard the name of Winterfield As a certain proportion of my patients happen to be people with a large experience of society I undertook to make inquiries so that the packet might be delivered if possible to the right person You heard how missus Eyrecourt surely a likely lady to assist me received my unlucky reference to the madhouse and you saw how I puzzled Sir John I consider myself most fortunate Father Benwell in having had the honor of meeting you Will you accompany me to the asylum to morrow And can you add to the favor by bringing mister Winterfield with you This last request it was out of my power really out of my power to grant Winterfield had left London that morning on his visit to Paris His address there was thus far not known to me Well you must represent your friend the doctor said Time is every way of importance in this case Will you kindly call here at five to morrow afternoon I was punctual to my appointment We drove together to the asylum There is no need for me to trouble you with a narrative of what I saw favored by Doctor Wybrow s introduction at the French boy s bedside It was simply a repetition of what I had already heard There he lay at the height of the fever asking in the intervals of relief intelligent questions relating to the medicines administered to him and perfectly understanding the answers He was only irritable when we asked him to take his memory back to the time before his illness and then he answered in French I haven t got a memory But I have something else to tell you which is deserving of your best attention The envelope and its inclosures addressed to Bernard Winterfield Esqre are in my possession The Christian name sufficiently identifies the inscription with the Winterfield whom I know The circumstances under which the discovery was made were related to me by the proprietor of the asylum When the boy was brought to the house two French ladies his mother and sister accompanied him and mentioned what had been their own domestic experience of the case They described the wandering propensities which took the lad away from home and the odd concealment of his waistcoat on the last occasion when he had returned from one of his vagrant outbreaks On his first night at the asylum he became excited by finding himself in a strange place It was necessary to give him a composing draught On going to bed he was purposely not prevented from hiding his waistcoat under the pillow as usual When the sedative had produced its effect the attendant easily possessed himself of the hidden garment It was the plain duty of the master of the house to make sure that nothing likely to be turned to evil uses was concealed by a patient The seal which had secured the envelope was found on examination to have been broken I would not have broken the seal myself our host added But as things were I thought it my duty to look at the inclosures They refer to private affairs of mister Winterfield in which he is deeply interested and they ought to have been long since placed in his possession I need hardly say that I consider myself bound to preserve the strictest silence as to what I have read An envelope containing some blank sheets of paper was put back in the boy s waistcoat so that he might feel it in its place under the lining when he woke The original envelope and inclosures with a statement of circumstances signed by my assistant and myself have been secured under another cover sealed with my own seal I have done my best to discover mister Bernard Winterfield He appears not to live in London At least I failed to find his name in the Directory I wrote next mentioning what had happened to the English gentleman to whom I send reports of the lad s health He couldn t help me A second letter to the French ladies only produced the same result I own I should be glad to get rid of my responsibility on honorable terms All this was said in the boy s presence He lay listening to it as if it had been a story told of some one else I could not resist the useless desire to question him Not speaking French myself although I can read the language I asked Doctor Wybrow and his friend to interpret for me My questions led to nothing The French boy knew no more about the stolen envelope than I did There was no discoverable motive mind for suspecting him of imposing on us When I said Perhaps you stole it he answered quite composedly Very likely they tell me I have been mad I don t remember it myself but mad people do strange things I tried him again Or perhaps you took it away out of mischief Yes And you broke the seal and looked at the papers I dare say And then you kept them hidden thinking they might be of some use to you Or perhaps feeling ashamed of what you had done and meaning to restore them if you got the opportunity You know best sir The same result followed when we tried to find out where he had been and what people had taken care of him during his last vagrant escape from home It was a new revelation to him that he had been anywhere With evident interest he applied to us to tell him where he had wandered to and what people he had seen So our last attempts at enlightenment ended We came to the final question of how to place the papers with the least possible loss of time in mister Winterfield s hands His absence in Paris having been mentioned I stated plainly my own position toward him at the present time mister Winterfield has made an appointment with me to call at his hotel on his return to London I said I shall probably be the first friend who sees him If you will trust me with your sealed packet in consideration of these circumstances I will give you a formal receipt for it in Doctor Wybrow s presence and I will add any written pledge that you may require on my part acting as mister Winterfield s representative and friend Perhaps you would like a reference as well He made a courteous reply A friend of doctor Wybrow s he said requires no other reference Excuse me I persisted I had the honor of meeting Doctor Wybrow for the first time yesterday Permit me to refer you to Lord Loring who has long known me as his spiritual director and friend This account of myself settled the matter I drew out the necessary securities and I have all the papers lying before me on my desk at this moment You remember how seals were broken and impressed again at the Roman post office in the revolutionary days when we were both young men Thanks to the knowledge then obtained the extraordinary events which once associated mister Winterfield and Miss Eyrecourt are at last plainly revealed to me Copies of the papers are in my possession and the originals are sealed again with the crest of the proprietor of the asylum as if nothing had happened I make no attempt to excuse myself You know our motto THE END JUSTIFIES THE MEANS I don t propose to make any premature use of the information which I have obtained The first and foremost necessity as I have already reminded you is to give Penrose the undisturbed opportunity of completing the conversion of Romayne During this interval my copies of the papers are at the disposal of my reverend brethren at headquarters THE STOLEN PAPERS COPIES Number One From Emma Winterfield to Bernard Winterfield four Maidwell Buildings Belhaven How shall I address you Dear Bernard or Sir It doesn t matter I am going to do one of the few good actions of my life and familiarities or formalities matter nothing to a woman who lies on her deathbed Yes I have met with another accident Shortly after the date of our separation you heard I think of the fall in the circus that fractured my skull On that occasion a surgical operation and a bit of silver plate in place of the bone put me right again This time it has been the kick of a horse in the stables Some internal injury is the consequence I may die to morrow or live till next week Anyway the doctor has confessed it my time has come Mind one thing The drink that vile habit which lost me your love and banished me from your house the drink is not to blame for this last misfortune Only the day before it happened I had taken the pledge under persuasion of the good rector here the Reverend mister Fennick It is he who has brought me to make this confession and who takes it down in writing at my bedside Do you remember how I once hated the very name of a parson and when you proposed in joke to marry me before the registrar how I took it in downright earnest and kept you to your word We poor horse riders and acrobats only knew clergymen as the worst enemies we had always using their influence to keep the people out of our show and the bread out of our mouths If I had met with mister Fennick in my younger days what a different woman I might have been Well regrets of that kind are useless now I am truly sorry Bernard for the evil that I have done to you and I ask your pardon with a contrite heart You will at least allow it in my favor that your drunken wife knew she was unworthy of you I refused to accept the allowance that you offered to me I respected your name For seven years from the time of our separation I returned to my profession under an assumed name and never troubled you The one thing I could not do was to forget you If you were infatuated by my unlucky beauty I loved devotedly on my side The well born gentleman who had sacrificed everything for my sake was something more than mortal in my estimation he was no I won t shock the good man who writes this by saying what he was Besides what do you care for my thoughts of you now If you had only been content to remain as I left you or if I had not found out that you were in love with Miss Eyrecourt and were likely to marry her in the belief that death had released you from me I should have lived and died doing you no other injury than the first great injury of consenting to be your wife But I made the discovery it doesn t matter how Our circus was in Devonshire at the time My jealous rage maddened me and I had a wicked admirer in a man who was old enough to be my father I let him suppose that the way to my favor lay through helping my revenge on the woman who was about to take my place He found the money to have you watched at home and abroad he put the false announcement of my death in the daily newspapers to complete your delusion he baffled the inquiries made through your lawyers to obtain positive proof of my death And last and in those wicked days best service of all he took me to Brussels and posted me at the door of the English church so that your lawful wife with her marriage certificate in her hand was the first person who met you and the mock missus Winterfield on your way from the altar to the wedding breakfast I own it to my shame I triumphed in the mischief I had done But I had deserved to suffer and I did suffer when I heard that Miss Eyrecourt s mother and her two friends took her away from you with her own entire approval at the church door and restored her to society without a stain on her reputation How the Brussels marriage was kept a secret I could not find out And when I threatened them with exposure I got a lawyer s letter and was advised in my own interests to hold my tongue The rector has since told me that your marriage to Miss Eyrecourt could be lawfully declared null and void and that the circumstances would excuse you before any judge in England I can now well understand that people with rank and money to help them can avoid exposure to which the poor in their places must submit One more duty the last still remains to be done I declare solemnly on my deathbed that you acted in perfect good faith when you married Miss Eyrecourt You have not only been a man cruelly injured by me but vilely insulted and misjudged by the two Eyrecourts and by the lord and lady who encouraged them to set you down as a villain guilty of heartless and shameless deceit It is my conviction that these people might have done more than misinterpret your honorable submission to the circumstances in which you were placed They might have prosecuted you for bigamy if they could have got me to appear against you I am comforted when I remember that I did make some small amends I kept out of their way and yours from that day to this I am told that I owe it to you to leave proof of my death behind me When the doctor writes my certificate he will mention the mark by which I may be identified if this reaches you as I hope and believe it will between the time of my death and my burial The rector who will close and seal these lines as soon as the breath is out of my body will add what he can to identify me and the landlady of this house is ready to answer any questions that may be put to her This time you may be really assured that you are free When I am buried and they show you my nameless grave in the churchyard I know your kind heart I die Bernard in the firm belief that you will forgive me There was one thing more that I had to ask of you relating to a poor lost creature who is in the room with us at this moment But oh I am so weary mister Fennick will tell you what it is Say to yourself sometimes perhaps when you have married some lady who is worthy of you There was good as well as bad in poor Emma Farewell Number Two From The reverend Charles Fennick to Bernard Winterfield The Rectory Belhaven Sir It is my sad duty to inform you that missus Emma Winterfield died this morning a little before five o clock I will add no comment of mine to the touching language in which she has addressed you God has I most sincerely believe accepted the poor sinner s repentance Her contrite spirit is at peace among the forgiven ones in the world beyond the grave In consideration of her wish that you should see her in death the coffin will be kept open until the last moment The medical man in attendance has kindly given me a copy of his certificate which I inclose You will see that the remains are identified by the description of a small silver plate on the right parietal bone of the skull I need hardly add that all the information I can give you is willingly at your service She mentions poor soul something which she had to ask of you I prefer the request which in her exhausted state she was unable to address to you in her own words While the performances of the circus were taking place in the next county to ours a wandering lad evidently of deficient intelligence was discovered trying to creep under the tent to see what was going on He could give no intelligible account of himself The late missus Winterfield who was born and brought up as I understand in France discovered that the boy was French and felt interested in the unfortunate creature from former happy association with kind friends of his nation She took care of him from that time to the day of her death and he appeared to be gratefully attached to her I say appeared because an inveterate reserve marks one of the peculiarities of the mental affliction from which he suffers Even his benefactress never could persuade him to take her into his confidence In other respects her influence so far as I can learn had been successfully exerted in restraining certain mischievous propensities in him which occasionally showed themselves The effect of her death has been to intensify that reserve to which I have already alluded He is sullen and irritable and the good landlady at the lodgings does not disguise that she shrinks from taking care of him even for a few days Until I hear from you he will remain under the charge of my housekeeper at the rectory You have no doubt anticipated the request which the poor sufferer wished to address to you but a few hours before her death She hoped that you might be willing to place this friendless and helpless creature under competent protection Failing your assistance I shall have no alternative however I may regret it but to send him to the workhouse of this town on his way probably to the public asylum Believe me sir your faithful servant CHARLES FENNICK P S I fear my letter and its inclosures may be delayed in reaching you Yesterday evening I had returned to my house before it occurred to me that missus Winterfield had not mentioned your address My only excuse for this forgetfulness is that I was very much distressed while I was writing by her bedside I at once went back to the lodgings but she had fallen asleep and I dared not disturb her This morning when I returned to the house she was dead There is an allusion to Devonshire in her letter which suggests that your residence may be in that county and I think she once spoke of you as a person of rank and fortune Having failed to find your name in a London Directory I am now about to search our free library here for a county history of Devon on the chance that it may assist me Let me add for your own satisfaction that no eyes but mine will see these papers For security s sake I shall seal them at once and write your name on the envelope Added by Father Benwell How the boy contrived to possess himself of the sealed packet we shall probably never discover Anyhow we know that he must have escaped from the rectory with the papers in his possession and that he did certainly get back to his mother and sister in London With such complete information as I now have at my disposal the prospect is as clear again as we can desire The separation of Romayne from his wife and the alteration of his will in favor of the Church seem to be now merely questions of time BOOK THE FOURTH CHAPTER I THE BREACH IS WIDENED A FORTNIGHT after Father Benwell s discovery Stella followed her husband one morning into his study Have you heard from mister Penrose she inquired Yes He will be here to morrow To make a long visit I hope so The longer the better She looked at him with a mingled expression of surprise and reproach Why do you say that she asked Why do you want him so much when you have got Me Thus far he had been sitting at his desk resting his head on his hand with his downcast eyes fixed on an open book When she put her last question to him he suddenly looked up Through the large window at his side the morning light fell on his face The haggard look of suffering which Stella remembered on the day when they met on the deck of the steamboat was again visible not softened and chastened now by the touching resignation of the bygone time but intensified by the dogged and despairing endurance of a man weary of himself and his life Her heart ached for him She said softly I don t mean to reproach you Are you jealous of Penrose he asked with a bitter smile She desperately told him the truth I am afraid of Penrose she answered He eyed her with a strange expression of suspicious surprise Why are you afraid of Penrose It was no time to run the risk of irritating him The torment of the Voice had returned in the past night The old gnawing remorse of the fatal day of the duel had betrayed itself in the wild words that had escaped him when he sank into a broken slumber as the morning dawned Feeling the truest pity for him she was still resolute to assert herself against the coming interference of Penrose She tried her ground by a dangerous means the means of an indirect reply I think you might have told me she said that mister Penrose was a Catholic priest He looked down again at his book How did you know Penrose was a Catholic priest I had only to look at the direction on your letters to him Well and what is there to frighten you in his being a priest You told me at the Loring s ball that you took an interest in Penrose because I liked him I didn t know then Lewis that he had concealed his profession from us I can t help distrusting a man who does that He laughed not very kindly You might as well say you distrust a man who conceals that he is an author by writing an anonymous book What Penrose did he did under orders from his superior and moreover he frankly owned to me that he was a priest If you blame anybody you had better blame me for respecting his confidence She drew back from him hurt by the tone in which he spoke to her I remember the time Lewis she said when you would have been more indulgent toward my errors even if I am wrong That simple appeal touched his better nature I don t mean to be hard on you Stella he answered It is a little irritating to hear you say that you distrust the most devoted and most affectionate friend that man ever had Why can t I love my wife and love my friend too You don t know when I am trying to get on with my book how I miss the help and sympathy of Penrose The very sound of his voice used to encourage me Come Stella give me a kiss and let us as the children say make it up He rose from his writing table She met him more than half way and pressed all her love and perhaps a little of her fear on his lips He returned the kiss as warmly as it was given and then unhappily for both of them he went back to the subject My own love he said try to like my friend for my sake and be tolerant of other forms of Christianity besides the form which happens to be yours Her smiling lips closed she turned from him With the sensitive selfishness of a woman s love she looked on Penrose as a robber who had stolen the sympathies which should have been wholly hers As she moved away her quick observation noticed the open book on the desk with notes and lines in pencil on the margin of the page What had Romayne been reading which interested him in that way If he had remained silent she would have addressed the inquiry to him openly But he was hurt on his side by the sudden manner of her withdrawal from him He spoke and his tone was colder than ever I won t attempt to combat your prejudices he said But one thing I must seriously ask of you When my friend Penrose comes here to morrow don t treat him as you treated mister Winterfield There was a momentary paleness in her face which looked like fear but it passed away again She confronted him firmly with steady eyes Why do you refer again to that she asked Is she hesitated and recovered herself Is mister Winterfield another devoted friend of yours He walked to the door as if he could hardly trust his temper if he answered her stopped and thinking better of it turned toward her again We won t quarrel Stella he rejoined I will only say I am sorry you don t appreciate my forbearance Your reception of mister Winterfield has lost me the friendship of a man whom I sincerely liked and who might have assisted my literary labors You were ill at the time and anxious about missus Eyrecourt I respected your devotion to your mother I remembered your telling me when you first went away to nurse her that your conscience accused you of having sometimes thoughtlessly neglected your mother in her days of health and good spirits and I admired the motive of atonement which took you to her bedside For those reasons I shrank from saying a word that might wound you But because I was silent it is not the less true that you surprised and disappointed me Don t do it again Whatever you may privately think of Catholic priests I once more seriously request you not to let Penrose see it He left the room She stood looking after him as he closed the door like a woman thunderstruck Never yet had he looked at her as he looked when he spoke his last warning words With a heavy sigh she roused herself The vague dread with which his tone rather than his words had inspired her strangely associated itself with the momentary curiosity which she had felt on noticing the annotated book that lay on his desk She snatched up the volume and looked at the open page It contained the closing paragraphs of an eloquent attack on Protestantism from the Roman Catholic point of view With trembling hands she turned back to the title page It presented this written inscription To Lewis Romayne from his attached friend and servant Arthur Penrose God help me she said to herself the priest has got between us already CHAPTER II A CHRISTIAN JESUIT ON the next day Penrose arrived on his visit to Romayne The affectionate meeting between the two men tested Stella s self control as it had never been tried yet She submitted to the ordeal with the courage of a woman whose happiness depended on her outward graciousness of manner toward her husband s friend Her reception of Penrose viewed as an act of refined courtesy was beyond reproach When she found her opportunity of leaving the room Romayne gratefully opened the door for her Thank you he whispered with a look which was intended to reward her She only bowed to him and took refuge in her own room Even in trifles a woman s nature is degraded by the falsities of language and manner which the artificial condition of modern society exacts from her When she yields herself to more serious deceptions intended to protect her dearest domestic interests the mischief is increased in proportion Deceit which is the natural weapon of defense used by the weak creature against the strong then ceases to be confined within the limits assigned by the sense of self respect and by the restraints of education A woman in this position will descend self blinded to acts of meanness which would be revolting to her if they were related of another person Stella had already begun the process of self degradation by writing secretly to Winterfield It was only to warn him of the danger of trusting Father Benwell but it was a letter claiming him as her accomplice in an act of deception That morning she had received Penrose with the outward cordialities of welcome which are offered to an old and dear friend And now in the safe solitude of her room she had fallen to a lower depth still She was deliberately considering the safest means of acquainting herself with the confidential conversation which Romayne and Penrose would certainly hold when she left them together He will try to set my husband against me and I have a right to know what means he uses in my own defense With that thought she reconciled herself to an action which she would have despised if she had heard of it as the action of another woman It was a beautiful autumn day brightened by clear sunshine enlivened by crisp air Stella put on her hat and went out for a stroll in the grounds While she was within view from the windows of the servants offices she walked away from the house Turning the corner of a shrubbery she entered a winding path on the other side which led back to the lawn under Romayne s study window Garden chairs were placed here and there She took one of them and seated herself after a last moment of honorable hesitation where she could hear the men s voices through the open window above her Penrose was speaking at the time Yes Father Benwell has granted me a holiday he said but I don t come here to be an idle man You must allow me to employ my term of leave in the pleasantest of all ways I mean to be your secretary again Romayne sighed Ah if you knew how I have missed you Stella waited in breathless expectation for what Penrose would say to this Would he speak of her No There was a natural tact and delicacy in him which waited for the husband to introduce the subject Penrose only said How is the great work getting on The answer was sternly spoken in one word Badly I am surprised to hear that Romayne Why Were you as innocently hopeful as I was Did you expect my experience of married life to help me in writing my book Penrose replied after a pause speaking a little sadly I expected your married life to encourage you in all your highest aspirations he said Stella turned pale with suppressed anger He had spoken with perfect sincerity The unhappy woman believed that he lied for the express purpose of rousing irritation against her in her husband s irritable mind She listened anxiously for Romayne s answer He made no answer Penrose changed the subject You are not looking very well he gently resumed I am afraid your health has interfered with your work Have you had any return It was still one of the characteristics of Romayne s nervous irritability that he disliked to hear the terrible delusion of the Voice referred to in words Yes he interposed bitterly I have heard it again and again My right hand is as red as ever Penrose with the blood of a fellow creature Another destruction of my illusions when I married Romayne I don t like to hear you speak of your marriage in that way Oh very well Let us go back to my book Perhaps I shall get on better with it now you are here to help me My ambition to make a name in the world has never taken so strong a hold on me I don t know why unless other disappointments have had something to do with it as at this time when I find I can t give my mind to my work We will make a last effort together my friend If it fails we will put my manuscripts into the fire and I will try some other career Politics are open to me Through politics I might make my mark in diplomacy There is something in directing the destinies of nations wonderfully attractive to me in my present state of feeling I hate the idea of being indebted for my position in the world like the veriest fool living to the accidents of birth and fortune Are you content with the obscure life that you lead Did you not envy that priest he is no older than I am who was sent the other day as the Pope s ambassador to Portugal Penrose spoke out at last without hesitation You are in a thoroughly unwholesome state of mind he said Romayne laughed recklessly When was I ever in a healthy state of mind he asked Penrose passed the interruption over without notice If I am to do you any good he resumed I must know what is really the matter with you The very last question that I ought to put and that I wish to put is the question which you force me to ask What is it When you speak of your married life said Penrose your tone is the tone of a disappointed man Have you any serious reason to complain of missus Romayne Stella rose to her feet in her eagerness to hear what her husband s answer would be Serious reason Romayne repeated How can such an idea have entered your head I only complain of irritating trifles now and then Even the best of women is not perfect It s hard to expect it from any of them The interpretation of this reply depended entirely on the tone in which it was spoken What was the animating spirit in this case Irony or Indulgence Stella was ignorant of the indirect methods of irritation by means of which Father Benwell had encouraged Romayne s doubts of his wife s motive for the reception of Winterfield Her husband s tone expressing this state of mind was new to her She sat down again divided between hope and fear waiting to hear more The next words spoken by Penrose astounded her The priest the Jesuit the wily spiritual intruder between man and wife actually took the wife s side Romayne he proceeded quietly I want you to be happy How am I to be happy I will try and tell you I believe your wife to be a good woman I believe she loves you There is something in her face that speaks for her even to an inexperienced person like myself Don t be impatient with her Put away from you that besetting temptation to speak in irony it is so easy to take that tone and sometimes so cruel I am only a looker on I know Domestic happiness can never be the happiness of my life But I have observed my fellow creatures of all degrees and this I tell you is the result The largest number of happy men are the husbands and fathers Yes I admit that they have terrible anxieties but they are fortified by unfailing compensations and encouragements Only the other day I met with a man who had suffered the loss of fortune and worse still the loss of health He endured those afflictions so calmly that he surprised me What is the secret of your philosophy I asked He answered I can bear anything while I have my wife and my children Think of that and judge for yourself how much happiness you may have left yet ungathered in your married life Those words touched Stella s higher nature as the dew touches the thirsty ground Surely they were nobly spoken How would her husband receive them I must think with your mind Penrose before I can do what you ask of me Is there any method of transformation by which I can change natures with you That was all he said and he said it despondingly Penrose understood and felt for him If there is anything in my nature worthy to be set as an example to you he replied you know to what blessed influence I owe self discipline and serenity of mind Remember what I said when I left you in London to go back to my friendless life I told you that I found in the Faith I held the one sufficient consolation which helped me to bear my lot And if there came a time of sorrow in the future I entreated you to remember what I had said Have you remembered it Look at the book here on my desk look at the other books within easy reach on that table are you satisfied More than satisfied Tell me do you feel nearer to an understanding of the Faith to which I have tried to convert you There was a pause Say that I do feel nearer Romayne resumed say that some of my objections are removed are you really as eager as ever to make a Catholic of me now that I am a married man I am even more eager Penrose answered I have always believed that your one sure way to happiness lay through your conversion Now when I know from what I have seen and heard in this room that you are not reconciled as you should be to your new life I am doubly confined in my belief As God is my witness I speak sincerely Hesitate no longer Be converted and be happy Have you not forgotten something Penrose What have I forgotten A serious consideration perhaps I have a Protestant wife I have borne that in mind Romayne throughout our conversation And you still say what you have just said With my whole heart I say it Be converted and be happy Be happy and you will be a good husband I speak in your wife s interest as well as in yours People who are happy in each other s society will yield a little on either side even on questions of religious belief And perhaps there may follow a more profitable result still So far as I have observed a good husband s example is gladly followed by his wife Don t think that I am trying to persuade you against your will I am only telling you in my own justification from what motives of love for yourself and of true interest in your welfare I speak You implied just now that you had still some objections left If I can remove them well and good If I fail if you cannot act on purely conscientious conviction I not only advise I entreat you to remain as you are I shall be the first to acknowledge that you have done right This moderation of tone would appeal irresistibly as Stella well knew to her husband s ready appreciation of those good qualities in others which he did not himself possess Once more her suspicion wronged Penrose Had he his own interested motives for pleading her cause At the bare thought of it she left her chair and standing under the window boldly interrupted the conversation by calling to Romayne Lewis she cried why do you stay indoors on this beautiful day I am sure mister Penrose would like a walk in the grounds Penrose appeared alone at the window You are quite right missus Romayne he said we will join you directly In a few minutes he turned the corner of the house and met Stella on the lawn Romayne was not with him Is my husband not coming with us she asked He will follow us Penrose answered I believe he has some letters to write Stella looked at him suspecting some underhand exercise of influence on her husband If she had been able to estimate the noble qualities in the nature of Penrose she might have done him the justice to arrive at a truer conclusion It was he who had asked leave when Stella had interrupted them to take the opportunity of speaking alone with missus Romayne He had said to his friend If I am wrong in my anticipation of the effect of your change of religion on your wife let me find it out from herself My one object is to act justly toward you and toward her I should never forgive myself if I made mischief between you no matter how innocent of any evil intention I might be Romayne had understood him It was Stella s misfortune ignorantly to misinterpret everything that Penrose said or did for the all sufficient reason that he was a Catholic priest She had drawn the conclusion that her husband had deliberately left her alone with Penrose to be persuaded or deluded into giving her sanction to aid the influence of the priest They shall find they are mistaken she thought to herself Have I interrupted an interesting conversation she inquired abruptly When I asked you to come out were you talking to my husband about his historical work No missus Romayne we were not speaking at that time of the book May I ask an odd question mister Penrose Certainly Are you a very zealous Catholic Pardon me I am a priest Surely my profession speaks for me I hope you are not trying to convert my husband Penrose stopped and looked at her attentively Are you strongly opposed to your husband s conversion he asked As strongly she answered as a woman can be By religious conviction missus Romayne No By experience Penrose started Is it indiscreet he said gently to inquire what your experience may have been I will tell you what my experience has been Stella replied I am ignorant of theological subtleties and questions of doctrine are quite beyond me But this I do know A well meaning and zealous Catholic shortened my father s life and separated me from an only sister whom I dearly loved I see I shock you and I daresay you think I am exaggerating I hear what you say missus Romayne with very great pain I don t presume to form any opinion thus far My sad story can be told in a few words Stella proceeded When my elder sister was still a young girl an aunt of ours my mother s sister came to stay with us She had married abroad and she was as I have said a zealous Catholic Unknown to the rest of us she held conversations on religion with my sister worked on the enthusiasm which was part of the girl s nature and accomplished her conversion Other influences of which I know nothing were afterward brought to bear on my sister She declared her intention of entering a convent As she was under age my father had only to interpose his authority to prevent this She was his favorite child He had no heart to restrain her by force he could only try all that the kindest and best of fathers could do to persuade her to remain at home Even after the years that have passed I cannot trust myself to speak of it composedly She persisted she was as hard as stone My aunt when she was entreated to interfere called her heartless obstinacy a vocation My poor father s loving resistance was worn out he slowly drew nearer and nearer to death from the day when she left us Let me do her justice if I can She has not only never regretted entering the convent she is so happily absorbed in her religious duties that she has not the slightest wish to see her mother or me My mother s patience was soon worn out The last time I went to the convent I went by myself I shall never go there again She could not conceal her sense of relief when I took my leave of her I need say no more Arguments are thrown away on me mister Penrose after what I have seen and felt I have no right to expect that the consideration of my happiness will influence you but I may perhaps ask you as a gentleman to tell me the truth Do you come here with the purpose of converting my husband Penrose owned the truth without an instant s hesitation I cannot take your view of your sister s pious devotion of herself to a religious life he said But I can and will answer you truly From the time when I first knew him my dearest object has been to convert your husband to the Catholic Faith Stella drew back from him as if he had stung her and clasped her hands in silent despair But I am bound as a Christian he went on to do to others as I would they should do to me She turned on him suddenly her beautiful face radiant with hope her hand trembling as it caught him by the arm Speak plainly she cried He obeyed her to the letter The happiness of my friend s wife missus Romayne is sacred to me for his sake Be the good angel of your husband s life I abandon the purpose of converting him He lifted her hand from his arm and raised it respectfully to his lips Then when he had bound himself by a promise that was sacred to him the terrible influence of the priesthood shook even that brave and lofty soul He said to himself as he left her God forgive me if I have done wrong CHAPTER III WINTERFIELD RETURNS TWICE Father Benwell called at Derwent s Hotel and twice he was informed that no news had been received there of mister Winterfield At the third attempt his constancy was rewarded mister Winterfield had written and was expected to arrive at the hotel by five o clock It was then half past four Father Benwell decided to await the return of his friend He was as anxious to deliver the papers which the proprietor of the asylum had confided to him as if he had never broken a seal or used a counterfeit to hide the betrayal of a trust The re sealed packet was safe in the pocket of his long black frockcoat His own future proceedings depended in some degree on the course which Winterfield might take when he had read the confession of the unhappy woman who had once been his wife Would he show the letter to Stella at a private interview as an unanswerable proof that she had cruelly wronged him And would it in this case be desirable if the thing could be done so to handle circumstances as that Romayne might be present unseen and might discover the truth for himself In the other event that is to say if Winterfield abstained from communicating the confession to Stella the responsibility of making the necessary disclosure must remain with the priest Father Benwell walked softly up and down the room looking about him with quietly observant eye A side table in a corner was covered with letters waiting Winterfield s return Always ready for information of any sort he even looked at the addresses on the letters The handwritings presented the customary variety of character All but three of the envelopes showed the London district postmarks Two of the other letters addressed to Winterfield at his club bore foreign postmarks and one as the altered direction showed had been forward from Beaupark House to the hotel This last letter especially attracted the priest s attention The address was apparently in a woman s handwriting And it was worthy of remark that she appeared to be the only person among Winterfield s correspondents who was not acquainted with the address of his hotel or of his club Who could the person be The subtly inquiring intellect of Father Benwell amused itself by speculating even on such a trifling problem as this He little thought that he had a personal interest in the letter The envelope contained Stella s warning to Winterfield to distrust no less a person than Father Benwell himself It was nearly half past five before quick footsteps were audible outside Winterfield entered the room This is friendly indeed he said I expected to return to the worst of all solitudes solitude in a hotel You will stay and dine with me That s right You must have thought I was going to settle in Paris Do you know what has kept me so long The most delightful theater in the world the Opera Comique I am so fond of the bygone school of music Father Benwell the flowing graceful delicious melodies of the composers who followed Mozart One can only enjoy that music in Paris Would you believe that I waited a week to hear Nicolo s delightful Joconde for the second time I was almost the only young man in the stalls All round me were the old men who remembered the first performances of the opera beating time with their wrinkled hands to the tunes which were associated with the happiest days of their lives What s that I hear My dog I was obliged to leave him here and he knows I have come back He flew to the door and called down the stairs to have the dog set free The spaniel rushed into the room and leaped into his master s outstretched arms Winterfield returned his caresses and kisses him as tenderly as a woman might have kissed her pet Dear old fellow it s a shame to have left you I won t do it again Father Benwell have you many friends who would be as glad to see you as this friend I haven t one And there are fools who talk of a dog as an inferior being to ourselves This creature s faithful love is mine do what I may I might be disgraced in the estimation of every human creature I know and he would be as true to me as ever And look at his physical qualities What an ugly thing for instance I won t say your ear I will say my ear is crumpled and wrinkled and naked Look at the beautiful silky covering of his ear What are our senses of smelling and hearing compared to his We are proud of our reason Could we find our way back if they shut us up in a basket and took us to a strange place away from home If we both want to run downstairs in a hurry which of us is securest against breaking his neck I on my poor two legs or he on his four Who is the happy mortal who goes to bed without unbuttoning and gets up again without buttoning Here he is on my lap knowing I am talking about him and too fond of me to say to himself What a fool my master is Father Benwell listened to this rhapsody so characteristic of the childish simplicity of the man with an inward sense of impatience which never once showed itself on the smiling surface of his face He had decided not to mention the papers in his pocket until some circumstance occurred which might appear to remind him naturally that he had such things about him If he showed any anxiety to produce the envelope he might expose himself to the suspicion of having some knowledge of the contents When would Winterfield notice the side table and open his letters The tick tick of the clock on the mantel piece steadily registered the progress of time and Winterfield s fantastic attentions were still lavished on his dog Even Father Benwell s patience was sorely tried when the good country gentleman proceeded to mention not only the spaniel s name but the occasion which had suggested it We call him Traveler and I will tell you why When he was only a puppy he strayed into the garden at Beaupark so weary and footsore that we concluded he had come to us from a great distance We advertised him but he was never claimed and here he is If you don t object we will give Traveler a treat to day He shall have dinner with us Perfectly understanding those last words the dog jumped off his master s lap and actually forwarded the views of Father Benwell in less than a minute more Scampering round and round the room as an appropriate expression of happiness he came into collision with the side table and directed Winterfield s attention to the letters by scattering them on the floor Father Benwell rose politely to assist in picking up the prostrate correspondence But Traveler was beforehand with him Warning the priest with a low growl not to interfere with another person s business the dog picked up the letters in his mouth and carried them by installments to his master s feet Even then the exasperating Winterfield went no further than patting Traveler Father Benwell s endurance reached its limits Pray don t stand on ceremony with me he said I will look at the newspaper while you read your letters Winterfield carelessly gathered the letters together tossed them on the dining table at his side and took the uppermost one of the little heap Fate was certainly against the priest on that evening The first letter that Winterfield opened led him off to another subject of conversation before he had read it to the end Father Benwell s hand already in his coat pocket appeared again empty Here s a proposal to me to go into Parliament said the Squire What do you think of representative institutions Father Benwell To my mind representative institutions are on their last legs Honorable Members vote away more of our money every year They have no alternative between suspending liberty of speech or sitting helpless while half a dozen impudent idiots stop the progress of legislation from motives of the meanest kind And they are not even sensitive enough to the national honor to pass a social law among themselves which makes it as disgraceful in a gentleman to buy a seat by bribery as to cheat at cards I declare I think the card sharper the least degraded person of the two He doesn t encourage his inferiors to be false to a public trust In short my dear sir everything wears out in this world and why should the House of Commons be an exception to the rule He picked up the next letter from the heap As he looked at the address his face changed The smile left his lips the gayety died out of his eyes Traveler entreating for more notice with impatient forepaws applied to his master s knees saw the alteration and dropped into a respectfully recumbent position Father Benwell glanced sidelong off the columns of the newspaper and waited for events with all the discretion and none of the good faith of the dog Forwarded from Beaupark Winterfield said to himself He opened the letter read it carefully to the end thought over it and read it again Father Benwell he said suddenly The priest put down the newspaper For a few moments more nothing was audible but the steady tick tick of the clock We have not been very long acquainted Winterfield resumed But our association has been a pleasant one and I think I owe to you the duty of a friend I don t belong to your Church but I hope you will believe me when I say that ignorant prejudice against the Catholic priesthood is not one of my prejudices Father Benwell bowed in silence You are mentioned Winterfield proceeded in the letter which I have just read Are you at liberty to tell me the name of your correspondent Father Benwell asked I am not at liberty to do that But I think it due to you and to myself to tell you what the substance of the letter is The writer warns me to be careful in my intercourse with you Your object I am told is to make yourself acquainted with events in my past life and you have some motive which my correspondent has thus far failed to discover I speak plainly but I beg you to understand that I also speak impartially I condemn no man unheard least of all a man whom I have had the honor of receiving under my own roof He spoke with a certain simple dignity With equal dignity Father Benwell answered It is needless to say that he now knew Winterfield s correspondent to be Romayne s wife Let me sincerely thank you mister Winterfield for a candor which does honor to us both he said You will hardly expect me if I may use such an expression to condescend to justify myself against an accusation which is an anonymous accusation so far as I am concerned I prefer to meet that letter by a plain proof and I leave you to judge whether I am still worthy of the friendship to which you have so kindly alluded With this preface he briefly related the circumstances under which he had become possessed of the packet and then handed it to Winterfield with the seal uppermost Decide for yourself he concluded whether a man bent on prying into your private affairs with that letter entirely at his mercy would have been true to the trust reposed in him He rose and took his hat ready to leave the room if his honor was profaned by the slightest expression of distrust Winterfield s genial and unsuspicious nature instantly accepted the offered proof as conclusive Before I break the seal he said let me do you justice Sit down again Father Benwell and forgive me if my sense of duty has hurried me into hurting your feelings No man ought to know better than I do how often people misjudge and wrong each other They shook hands cordially No moral relief is more eagerly sought than relief from the pressure of a serious explanation By common consent they now spoke as lightly as if nothing had happened Father Benwell set the example You actually believe in a priest he said gayly We shall make a good Catholic of you yet Don t be too sure of that Winterfield replied with a touch of his quaint humor I respect the men who have given to humanity the inestimable blessing of quinine to say nothing of preserving learning and civilization but I respect still more my own liberty as a free Christian Perhaps a free thinker mister Winterfield Anything you like to call it Father Benwell so long as it is free They both laughed Father Benwell went back to his newspaper Winterfield broke the seal of the envelope and took out the inclosures The confession was the first of the papers at which he happened to look At the opening lines he turned pale He read more and his eyes filled with tears In low broken tones he said to the priest You have innocently brought me most distressing news I entreat your pardon if I ask to be left alone Father Benwell said a few well chosen words of sympathy and immediately withdrew The dog licked his master s hand hanging listlessly over the arm of the chair Later in the evening a note from Winterfield was left by messenger at the priest s lodgings The writer announced with renewed expressions of regret that he would be again absent from London on the next day but that he hoped to return to the hotel and receive his guest on the evening of the day after Father Benwell rightly conjectured that Winterfield s destination was the town in which his wife had died His object in taking the journey was not as the priest supposed to address inquiries to the rector and the landlady who had been present at the fatal illness and the death but to justify his wife s last expression of belief in the mercy and compassion of the man whom she had injured On that nameless grave so sadly and so humbly referred to in the confession he had resolved to place a simple stone cross giving to her memory the name which she had shrunk from profaning in her lifetime When he had written the brief inscription which recorded the death of Emma wife of Bernard Winterfield and when he had knelt for a while by the low turf mound his errand had come to its end He thanked the good rector he left gifts with the landlady and her children by which he was gratefully remembered for many a year afterward and then with a heart relieved he went back to London Other men might have made their sad little pilgrimage alone Winterfield took his dog with him I must have something to love he said to the rector at such a time as this CHAPTER IV 
5019-44339-0000	train-other-500	FATHER BENWELL S CORRESPONDENCE To the Secretary S J Rome WHEN I wrote last I hardly thought I should trouble you again so soon The necessity has however arisen
5019-44339-0001	train-other-500	I must ask for instructions from our Most Reverend General on the subject of Arthur Penrose I believe that I informed you that I decided to defer my next visit to Ten Acres Lodge for two or three days
5019-44339-0002	train-other-500	in order that Winterfield if he intended to do so might have time to communicate with missus Romayne after his return from the country Naturally enough perhaps considering the delicacy of the subject
5019-44339-0003	train-other-500	he has not taken me into his confidence I can only guess that he has maintained the same reserve with missus Romayne My visit to the Lodge was duly paid this afternoon
5019-44339-0004	train-other-500	I asked first of course for the lady of the house and hearing she was in the grounds joined her there She looked ill and anxious and she received me with rigid politeness Fortunately
5019-44339-0005	train-other-500	missus Eyrecourt now convalescent was staying at Ten Acres and was then taking the air in her chair on wheels The good lady s nimble and discursive tongue offered me an opportunity of referring
5019-44339-0006	train-other-500	in the most innocent manner possible to Winterfield s favorable opinion of Romayne s pictures I need hardly say that I looked at Romayne s wife when I mentioned the name She turned pale
5019-44339-0007	train-other-500	probably fearing that I had some knowledge of her letter warning Winterfield not to trust me If she had already been informed that he was not to be blamed but to be pitied in the matter of the marriage at Brussels
none	none	 she would have turned red 
5019-44339-0008	train-other-500	Such at least is my experience drawn from recollections of other days
none	none	 The ladies having served my purpose 
5019-44339-0009	train-other-500	I ventured into the house to pay my respects to Romayne He was in the study and his excellent friend and secretary was with him After the first greetings Penrose left us
5019-44339-0010	train-other-500	His manner told me plainly that there was something wrong I asked no questions waiting on the chance that Romayne might enlighten me
none	none	 I hope you are in better spirits now that you have your old companion with you 
5019-44339-0011	train-other-500	I said I am very glad to have Penrose with me he answered And then he frowned and looked out of the window at the two ladies in the grounds
5019-44339-0012	train-other-500	It occurred to me that missus Eyrecourt might be occupying the customary false position of a mother in law I was mistaken He was not thinking of his wife s mother he was thinking of his wife
5019-44339-0013	train-other-500	I suppose you know that Penrose had an idea of converting me he said suddenly I was perfectly candid with him I said I knew it and approved of it
5019-44339-0014	train-other-500	May I hope that Arthur has succeeded in convincing you I ventured to add He might have succeeded Father Benwell if he had chosen to go on This reply as you may easily imagine took me by surprise
5019-44339-0015	train-other-500	Are you really so obdurate that Arthur despairs of your conversion I asked Nothing of the sort I have thought and thought of it and I can tell you I was more than ready to meet him half way
5019-44339-0016	train-other-500	Then where is the obstacle I exclaimed He pointed through the window to his wife There is the obstacle he said in a tone of ironical resignation Knowing Arthur s character as I knew it
5019-44339-0017	train-other-500	I at last understood what had happened For a moment I felt really angry Under these circumstances the wise course was to say nothing until I could be sure of speaking with exemplary moderation
5019-44339-0018	train-other-500	It doesn t do for a man in my position to show anger Romayne went on We talked of my wife Father Benwell the last time you were here You only knew then that her reception of mister Winterfield
5019-44339-0019	train-other-500	had determined him never to enter my house again By way of adding to your information on the subject of petticoat government I may now tell you that missus Romayne has forbidden Penrose to proceed with the attempt to convert me
5019-44339-0020	train-other-500	By common consent the subject is never mentioned between us The bitter irony of his tone thus far suddenly disappeared He spoke eagerly and anxiously
none	none	 I hope you are not angry with Arthur 
5019-44339-0021	train-other-500	he said By this time my little fit of ill temper was at an end I answered and it was really in a certain sense true I know Arthur too well to be angry with him
5019-44339-0022	train-other-500	Romayne seemed to be relieved I only troubled you with this last domestic incident he resumed to bespeak your indulgence for Penrose
5019-44339-0023	train-other-500	I am getting learned in the hierarchy of the Church Father Benwell You are the superior of my dear little friend and you exercise authority over him Oh he is the kindest and best of men It is not his fault
5019-44339-0024	train-other-500	He submits to missus Romayne against his own better conviction in the honest belief that he consults the interests of our married life
none	none	 I don t think I misinterpret the state of Romayne s mind and mislead you when I express my belief 
5019-44339-0025	train-other-500	that this second indiscreet interference of his wife between his friend and himself will produce the very result which she dreads Mark my words written after the closest observation of him
5019-44339-0026	train-other-500	this new irritation of Romayne s sensitive self respect will hasten his conversion
none	none	 You will understand that the one alternative before me after what has happened 
5019-44339-0027	train-other-500	is to fill the place from which Penrose has withdrawn I abstained from breathing a word of this to Romayne It is he if I can manage it who must invite me to complete the work of conversion
5019-44339-0028	train-other-500	and besides nothing can be done until the visit of Penrose has come to an end Romayne s secret sense of irritation may be safely left to develop itself with time to help it
5019-44339-0029	train-other-500	I changed the conversation to the subject of his literary labors The present state of his mind is not favorable to work of that exacting kind Even with the help of Penrose to encourage him he does not get on to his satisfaction
5019-44339-0030	train-other-500	and yet as I could plainly perceive the ambition to make a name in the world exercises a stronger influence over him than ever All in our favor my reverend friend all in our favor
5019-44339-0031	train-other-500	I took the liberty of asking to see Penrose alone for a moment and this request granted Romayne and I parted cordially I can make most people like me when I choose to try
none	none	 The master of Vange Abbey 
5019-44339-0032	train-other-500	is no exception to the rule Did I tell you by the by that the property has a little declined of late in value It is now not worth more than six thousand a year We will improve it when it returns to the Church
5019-44339-0033	train-other-500	My interview with Penrose was over in two minutes Dispensing with formality I took his arm and led him into the front garden I have heard all about it
none	none	 I said and I must not deny that you have disappointed me 
5019-44339-0034	train-other-500	But I know your disposition and I make allowances You have qualities dear Arthur which perhaps
none	none	 put you a little out of place among us 
5019-44339-0035	train-other-500	I shall be obliged to report what you have done but you may trust me to put it favorably Shake hands my son and while we are still together let us be as good friends as ever
5019-44339-0036	train-other-500	You may think that I spoke in this way with a view to my indulgent language being repeated to Romayne and so improving the position which I have already gained in his estimation Do you know I really believe I meant it at the time
5019-44339-0037	train-other-500	The poor fellow gratefully kissed my hand when I offered it to him he was not able to speak I wonder whether I am weak about Arthur Say a kind word for him when his conduct comes under notice
5019-44339-0038	train-other-500	but pray don t mention this little frailty of mine and don t suppose I have any sympathy with his weak minded submission to missus Romayne s prejudices If I ever felt the smallest consideration for her and I cannot call to mind
none	none	 any amiable emotion of that sort her letter to Winterfield would have effectually extinguished it There is something quite revolting to me in a deceitful woman 
5019-44339-0039	train-other-500	In closing this letter I may quiet the minds of our reverend brethren if I assure them that my former objection to associating myself directly with the conversion of Romayne no longer exists
5019-44339-0040	train-other-500	Yes even at my age and with my habits I am now resigned to hearing and confuting
none	none	 the trivial arguments of a man who is young enough to be my son 
5019-44339-0041	train-other-500	I shall write a carefully guarded letter to Romayne on the departure of Penrose and I shall send him a book to read
none	none	 from the influence of which I expect gratifying results It is not a controversial work 
5019-44339-0042	train-other-500	Arthur has been beforehand with me there
none	none	 it is Wiseman s Recollections of the Popes 
5019-44339-0043	train-other-500	I look to that essentially readable book to excite Romayne s imagination by vivid descriptions of the splendors of the Church and the vast influence and power of the higher priesthood
5019-44339-0044	train-other-500	Does this sudden enthusiasm of mine surprise you And are you altogether at a loss to know what it means It means my friend that I see our position toward Romayne in a new light
5019-44339-0045	train-other-500	Forgive me if I say no more for the present I prefer to be silent
none	none	 until my audacity is justified by events Father Benwell s experience had in this case not misled him If Stella had remained unmarried Winterfield might have justified himself But he was honorably unwilling to disturb her relations with her husband by satisfying her that he had never been unworthy of the affection which had once united them CHAPTER V BERNARD WINTERFIELD S CORRESPONDENCE I From missus Romayne to mister Winterfield HAS my letter failed to reach you I directed it as I direct this to Beaupark not knowing your London address Yesterday Father Benwell called at Ten Acres Lodge He first saw my mother and myself and he contrived to mention your name It was done with his usual adroitness and I might perhaps have passed it over if he had not looked at me I hope and pray it may be only my fancy but I thought I saw in his eyes that he was conscious of having me in his power and that he might betray me to my husband at any moment I have no sort of claim on you And Heaven knows I have little reason to trust you But I thought you meant fairly by me when we spoke together at this house In that belief I entreat you to tell me if Father Benwell has intruded himself into your confidence or even if you have hinted anything to him which gives him a hold over me II From mister Winterfield to missus Romayne Both your letters have reached me I have good reason for believing that you are entirely mistaken in your estimate of Father Benwell s character But I know by sad experience how you hold to your opinions when they are once formed and I am eager to relieve you of all anxiety so far as I am concerned I have not said one word I have not even let slip the slightest hint which could inform Father Benwell of that past event in our lives to which your letter alludes Your secret is a sacred secret to me and it has been and shall be sacredly kept There is a sentence in your letter which has given me great pain You reiterate the cruel language of the bygone time You say Heaven knows I have little reason to trust you I have reasons on my side for not justifying myself except under certain conditions I mean under conditions which might place me in a position to serve and advise you as a friend or brother In that case I undertake to prove even to you that it was a cruel injustice ever to have doubted me and that there is no man living whom you can more implicitly trust than myself My address when I am in London is at the head of this page III From doctor Wybrow to mister Winterfield Dear Sir I have received your letter mentioning that you wish to accompany me at my next visit to the asylum to see the French boy so strangely associated with the papers delivered to you by Father Benwell Your proposal reaches me too late The poor creature s troubled life has come to an end He never rallied from the exhausting effect of the fever To the last he was attended by his mother I write with true sympathy for that excellent lady but I cannot conceal from you or from myself that this death is not to be regretted In a case of the same extraordinary kind recorded in print the patient recovered from the fever and his insanity returned with his returning health Faithfully yours JOSEPH WYBROW CHAPTER VI THE SADDEST OF ALL WORDS ON the tenth morning dating from the dispatch of Father Benwell s last letter to Rome Penrose was writing in the study at Ten Acres Lodge while Romayne sat at the other end of the room looking listlessly at a blank sheet of paper with the pen lying idle beside it On a sudden he rose and snatching up paper and pen threw them irritably into the fire Don t trouble yourself to write any longer he said to Penrose My dream is over Throw my manuscripts into the waste paper basket and never speak to me of literary work again Every man devoted to literature has these fits of despondency Penrose answered Don t think of your work Send for your horse and trust to fresh air and exercise to relieve your mind Romayne barely listened He turned round at the fireplace and studied the reflection of his face in the glass I look worse and worse he said thoughtfully to himself It was true His flesh had fallen away his face had withered and whitened he stooped like an old man The change for the worse had been steadily proceeding from the time when he left Vange Abbey It s useless to conceal it from me he burst out turning toward Penrose I believe I am in some way answerable though you all deny it for the French boy s death Why not His voice is still in my ears and the stain of his brother s blood is on me I am under a spell Do you believe in the witches the merciless old women who made wax images of the people who injured them and stuck pins in their mock likenesses to register the slow wasting away of their victims day after day People disbelieve it in these times but it has never been disproved He stopped looked at Penrose and suddenly changed his tone Arthur what is the matter with you Have you had a bad night Has anything happened For the first time in Romayne s experience of him Penrose answered evasively Is there nothing to make me anxious he said when I hear you talk as you are talking now The poor French boy died of a fever Must I remind you again that he owed the happiest days of his life to you and your good wife Romayne still looked at him without attending to what he said Surely you don t think I am deceiving you Penrose remonstrated No I was thinking of something else I was wondering whether I really know you as well as I thought I did Am I mistaken in supposing that you are not an ambitious man My only ambition is to lead a worthy life and to be as useful to my fellow creatures as I can Does that satisfy you Romayne hesitated It seems strange he began What seems strange I don t say it seems strange that you should be a priest Romayne explained I am only surprised that a man of your simple way of thinking should have attached himself to the Order of the Jesuits I can quite understand that said Penrose But you should remember that circumstances often influence a man in his choice of a vocation It has been so with me I am a member of a Roman Catholic family A Jesuit College was near our place of abode and a near relative of mine since dead was one of the resident priests He paused and added in a lower tone When I was little more than a lad I suffered a disappointment which altered my character for life I took refuge in the College and I have found patience and peace of mind since that time Oh my friend you might have been a more contented man He stopped again His interest in the husband had all but deceived him into forgetting his promise to the wife Romayne held out his hand I hope I have not thoughtlessly hurt you he said Penrose took the offered hand and pressed it fervently He tried to speak and suddenly shuddered like a man in pain I am not very well this morning he stammered a turn in the garden will do me good Romayne s doubts were confirmed by the manner in which Penrose left him Something had unquestionably happened which his friend shrank from communicating to him He sat down again at his desk and tried to read The time passed and he was still left alone When the door was at last opened it was only Stella who entered the room Have you seen Penrose he asked The estrangement between them had been steadily widening of late Romayne had expressed his resentment at his wife s interference between Penrose and himself by that air of contemptuous endurance which is the hardest penalty that a man can inflict on the woman who loves him Stella had submitted with a proud and silent resignation the most unfortunate form of protest that she could have adopted toward a man of Romayne s temper When she now appeared however in her husband s study there was a change in her expression which he instantly noticed She looked at him with eyes softened by sorrow Before she could answer his first question he hurriedly added another Is Penrose really ill No Lewis He is distressed About what About you and about himself Is he going to leave us Yes But he will come back again Stella took a chair by her husband s side I am truly sorry for you Lewis she said It is even a sad parting for Me If you will let me say it I have a sincere regard for dear mister Penrose Under other circumstances this confession of feeling for the man who had sacrificed his dearest aspiration to the one consideration of her happiness might have provoked a sharp reply But by this time Romayne had really become alarmed You speak as if Arthur was going to leave England he said He leaves England this afternoon she answered for Rome Why does he tell this to you and not to me Romayne asked He cannot trust himself to speak of it to you He begged me to prepare you Her courage failed her She paused Romayne beat his hand impatiently on the desk before him Speak out he cried If Rome is not the end of the journey what is Stella hesitated no longer He goes to Rome she said to receive his instructions and to become personally acquainted with the missionaries who are associated with him They will leave Leghorn in the next vessel which sets sail for a port in Central America And the dangerous duty intrusted to them is to re establish one of the Jesuit Missions destroyed by the savages years since They will find their church a ruin and not a vestige left of the house once inhabited by the murdered priests It is not concealed from them that they may be martyred too They are soldiers of the Cross and they go willingly go to save the souls of the Indians at the peril of their lives Romayne rose and advanced to the door There he turned and spoke to Stella Where is Arthur he said Stella gently detained him There was one word more he entreated me to say pray wait and hear it she pleaded His one grief is at leaving You Apart from that he devotes himself gladly to the dreadful service which claims him He has long looked forward to it and has long prepared himself for it Those Lewis are his own words There was a knock at the door The servant appeared to announce that the carriage was waiting Penrose entered the room as the man left it Have you spoken for me he said to Stella She could only answer him by a gesture He turned to Romayne with a faint smile The saddest of all words must be spoken he said Farewell Pale and trembling Romayne took his hand Is this Father Benwell s doing he asked No Penrose answered firmly In Father Benwell s position it might have been his doing but for his goodness to me For the first time since I have known him he has shrunk from a responsibility For my sake he has left it to Rome And Rome has spoken Oh my more than friend my brother in love His voice failed him With a resolution which was nothing less than heroic in a man of his affectionate nature he recovered his composure Let us make it as little miserable as it can be he said At every opportunity we will write to each other And who knows I may yet come back to you God has preserved his servants in dangers as great as any that I shall encounter May that merciful God bless and protect you Oh Romayne what happy days we have had together His last powers of resistance were worn out Tears of noble sorrow dimmed the friendly eyes which had never once looked unkindly on the brother of his love He kissed Romayne Help me out he said turning blindly toward the hall in which the servant was waiting That last act of mercy was not left to a servant With sisterly tenderness Stella took his hand and led him away I shall remember you gratefully as long as I live she said to him when the carriage door was closed He waved his hand at the window and she saw him no more She returned to the study The relief of tears had not come to Romayne He had dropped into a chair when Penrose left him In stony silence he sat there his head down his eyes dry and staring The miserable days of their estrangement were forgotten by his wife in the moment when she looked at him She knelt by his side and lifted his head a little and laid it on her bosom Her heart was full she let the caress plead for her silently He felt it his cold fingers pressed her hand thankfully but he said nothing After a long interval the first outward expression of sorrow that fell from his lips showed that he was still thinking of Penrose Every blessing falls away from me he said I have lost my best friend Years afterward Stella remembered those words and the tone in which he had spoken them CHAPTER VII THE IMPULSIVE SEX AFTER a lapse of a few days Father Benwell was again a visitor at Ten Acres Lodge by Romayne s invitation The priest occupied the very chair by the study fireside in which Penrose had been accustomed to sit It is really kind of you to come to me said Romayne so soon after receiving my acknowledgment of your letter I can t tell you how I was touched by the manner in which you wrote of Penrose To my shame I confess it I had no idea that you were so warmly attached to him I hardly knew it myself mister Romayne until our dear Arthur was taken away from us If you used your influence Father Benwell is there no hope that you might yet persuade him To withdraw from the Mission Oh mister Romayne don t you know Arthur s character better than that Even his gentle temper has its resolute side The zeal of the first martyrs to Christianity is the zeal that burns in that noble nature The Mission has been the dream of his life it is endeared to him by the very dangers which we dread Persuade Arthur to desert the dear and devoted colleagues who have opened their arms to him I might as soon persuade that statue in the garden to desert its pedestal and join us in this room Shall we change the sad subject Have you received the book which I sent you with my letter Romayne took up the book from his desk Before he could speak of it some one called out briskly on the other side of the door May I come in and came in without waiting to be asked missus Eyrecourt painted and robed for the morning wafting perfumes as she moved appeared in the study She looked at the priest and lifted her many ringed hands with a gesture of coquettish terror Oh dear me I had no idea you were here Father Benwell I ask ten thousand pardons Dear and admirable Romayne you don t look as if you were pleased to see me Good gracious I am not interrupting a confession am I Father Benwell with his paternal smile in perfect order resigned his chair to missus Eyrecourt The traces of her illness still showed themselves in an intermittent trembling of her head and her hands She had entered the room strongly suspecting that the process of conversion might be proceeding in the absence of Penrose and determined to interrupt it Guided by his subtle intelligence Father Benwell penetrated her motive as soon as she opened the door missus Eyrecourt bowed graciously and took the offered chair Father Benwell sweetened his paternal smile and offered to get a footstool How glad I am he said to see you in your customary good spirits But wasn t it just a little malicious to talk of interrupting a confession As if mister Romayne was one of Us Queen Elizabeth herself could hardly have said a sharper thing to a poor Catholic priest You clever creature said missus Eyrecourt How easily you see through a simple woman like me There I give you my hand to kiss and I will never try to deceive you again Do you know Father Benwell a most extraordinary wish has suddenly come to me Please don t be offended I wish you were a Jew May I ask why Father Benwell inquired with an apostolic suavity worthy of the best days of Rome missus Eyrecourt explained herself with the modest self distrust of a maiden of fifteen I am really so ignorant I hardly know how to put it But learned persons have told me that it is the peculiarity of the Jews may I say the amiable peculiarity never to make converts It would be so nice if you would take a leaf out of their book when we have the happiness of receiving you here My lively imagination pictures you in a double character Father Benwell everywhere else and say the patriarch Abraham at Ten Acres Lodge Father Benwell lifted his persuasive hands in courteous protest My dear lady pray make your mind easy Not one word on the subject of religion has passed between mister Romayne and myself I beg your pardon missus Eyrecourt interposed I am afraid I fail to follow you My silent son in law looks as if he longed to smother me and my attention is naturally distracted You were about to say I was about to say dear missus Eyrecourt that you are alarming yourself without any reason Not one word on any controversial subject has passed missus Eyrecourt cocked her head with the artless vivacity of a bird Ah but it might though she suggested slyly Father Benwell once more remonstrated in dumb show and Romayne lost his temper missus Eyrecourt he cried sternly missus Eyrecourt screamed and lifted her hands to her ears I am not deaf dear Romayne and I am not to be put down by any ill timed exhibition of what I may call domestic ferocity Father Benwell sets you an example of Christian moderation Do please follow it Romayne refused to follow it Talk on any other topic that you like missus Eyrecourt I request you don t oblige me to use a harder word I request you to spare Father Benwell and myself any further expression of your opinion on controversial subjects A son in law may make a request and a mother in law may decline to comply missus Eyrecourt declined to comply No Romayne it won t do I may lament your unhappy temper for my daughter s sake but I know what I am about and you can t provoke me Our reverend friend and I understand each other He will make allowances for a sensitive woman who has had sad experience of conversions in her own household My eldest daughter Father Benwell a poor foolish creature was converted into a nunnery The last time I saw her she used to be sweetly pretty my dear husband quite adored her the last time I saw her she had a red nose and what is even more revolting at her age a double chin She received me with her lips pursed up and her eyes on the ground and she was insolent enough to say that she would pray for me I am not a furious old man with a long white beard and I don t curse my daughter and rush out into a thunderstorm afterward but I know what King Lear felt and I have struggled with hysterics just as he did With your wonderful insight into human nature I am sure you will sympathize with and forgive me mister Penrose as my daughter tells me behaved in the most gentleman like manner I make the same appeal to your kind forbearance The bare prospect of our dear friend here becoming a Catholic Romayne s temper gave way once more If anything can make me a Catholic he said your interference will do it Out of sheer perversity dear Romayne Not at all missus Eyrecourt If I became a Catholic I might escape from the society of ladies in the refuge of a monastery missus Eyrecourt hit him back again with the readiest dexterity Remain a Protestant my dear and go to your club There is a refuge for you from the ladies a monastery with nice little dinners and all the newspapers and periodicals Having launched this shaft she got up and recovered her easy courtesy of look and manner I am so much obliged to you Father Benwell I have not offended you I hope and trust You have done me a service dear missus Eyrecourt But for your salutory caution I might have drifted into controversial subjects I shall be on my guard now How very good of you We shall meet again I hope under more agreeable circumstances After that polite allusion to a monastery I understand that my visit to my son in law may as well come to an end Please don t forget five o clock tea at my house As she approached the door it was opened from the outer side Her daughter met her half way Why are you here mamma Stella asked Why indeed my love You had better leave the room with me Our amiable Romayne s present idea is to relieve himself of our society by retiring to a monastery Don t you see Father Benwell Stella coldly returned the priest s bow and looked at Romayne She felt a vague forewarning of what had happened missus Eyrecourt proceeded to enlighten her as an appropriate expression of gratitude We are indeed indebted to Father Benwell my dear He has been most considerate and kind Romayne interrupted her without ceremony Favor me he said addressing his wife by inducing missus Eyrecourt to continue her narrative in some other room Stella was hardly conscious of what her mother or her husband had said She felt that the priest s eyes were on her Under any other circumstances Father Benwell s good breeding and knowledge of the world would have impelled him to take his departure As things were he knew perfectly well that the more seriously Romayne was annoyed in his presence the better his own private interests would be served Accordingly he stood apart silently observant of Stella In spite of Winterfield s reassuring reply to her letter Stella instinctively suspected and dreaded the Jesuit Under the spell of those watchful eyes she trembled inwardly her customary tact deserted her she made an indirect apology to the man whom she hated and feared Whatever my mother may have said to you Father Benwell has been without my knowledge Romayne attempted to speak but Father Benwell was too quick for him Dear missus Romayne nothing has been said which needs any disclaimer on your part I should think not missus Eyrecourt added Really Stella I don t understand you Why may I not say to Father Benwell what you said to mister Penrose You trusted mister Penrose as your friend I can tell you this I am quite sure you may trust Father Benwell Once more Romayne attempted to speak And once more Father Benwell was beforehand with him May I hope said the priest with a finely ironical smile that missus Romayne agrees with her excellent mother With all her fear of him the exasperating influence of his tone and his look was more than Stella could endure Before she could restrain them the rash words flew out of her lips I am not sufficiently well acquainted with you Father Benwell to express an opinion With that answer she took her mother s arm and left the room The moment they were alone Romayne turned to the priest trembling with anger Father Benwell smiling indulgently at the lady s little outbreak took him by the hand with peace making intentions Now don t pray don t excite yourself Romayne was not to be pacified in that way His anger was trebly intensified by the long continued strain on his nerves of the effort to control himself I must and will speak out at last he said Father Benwell the ladies of my household have inexcusably presumed on the consideration which is due to women No words can say how ashamed I am of what has happened I can only appeal to your admirable moderation and patience to accept my apologies and the most sincere expression of my regret No more mister Romayne As a favor to Me I beg and entreat you will say no more Sit down and compose yourself But Romayne was impenetrable to the influence of friendly and forgiving demonstrations I can never expect you to enter my house again he exclaimed My dear sir I will come and see you again with the greatest pleasure on any day that you may appoint the earlier day the better Come come let us laugh I don t say it disrespectfully but poor dear missus Eyrecourt has been more amusing than ever I expect to see our excellent Archbishop to morrow and I must really tell him how the good lady felt insulted when her Catholic daughter offered to pray for her There is hardly anything more humorous even in Moliere And the double chin and the red nose all the fault of those dreadful Papists Oh dear me you still take it seriously How I wish you had my sense of humor When shall I come again and tell you how the Archbishop likes the story of the nun s mother He held out his hand with irresistible cordiality Romayne took it gratefully still bent however on making atonement Let me first do myself the honor of calling on You he said I am in no state to open my mind as I might have wished to open it to you after what has happened In a day or two more Say the day after to morrow Father Benwell hospitably suggested Do me a great favor Come and eat your bit of mutton at my lodgings Six o clock if you like and some remarkably good claret a present from one of the Faithful You will That s hearty And do promise me to think no more of our little domestic comedy Relieve your mind Look at Wiseman s Recollections of the Popes Good by God bless you The servant who opened the house door for Father Benwell was agreeably surprised by the Papist s cheerfulness He isn t half a bad fellow the man announced among his colleagues Give me half a crown and went out humming a tune CHAPTER VIII FATHER BENWELL S CORRESPONDENCE To the Secretary S J Rome I I BEG to acknowledge the receipt of your letter You mention that our Reverend Fathers are discouraged at not having heard from me for more than six weeks since I reported the little dinner given to Romayne at my lodgings I am sorry for this and more than sorry to hear that my venerated brethren are beginning to despair of Romayne s conversion Grant me a delay of another week and if the prospects of the conversion have not sensibly improved in that time I will confess myself defeated Meanwhile I bow to superior wisdom without venturing to add a word in my own defense II The week s grace granted to me has elapsed I write with humility At the same time I have something to say for myself Yesterday mister Lewis Romayne of Vange Abbey was received into the community of the Holy Catholic Church I inclose an accurate newspaper report of the ceremonies which attended the conversion Be pleased to inform me by telegraph whether our Reverend Fathers wish me to go on or not BOOK THE FIFTH CHAPTER I 
5379-44344-0000	train-other-500	missus EYRECO URT S DISCOVERY THE leaves had fallen in the grounds at Ten Acres Lodge and stormy winds told drearily that winter had come An unchanging dullness pervaded the house
5379-44344-0001	train-other-500	Romayne was constantly absent in London attending to his new religious duties under the guidance of Father Benwell The litter of books and manuscripts in the study was seen no more Hideously rigid order reigned in the unused room
5379-44344-0002	train-other-500	Some of Romayne s papers had been burned others were imprisoned in drawers and cupboards the history of the Origin of Religions had taken its melancholy place among the suspended literary enterprises of the time
5379-44344-0003	train-other-500	missus Eyrecourt after a superficially cordial reconciliation with her son in law visited her daughter every now and then as an act of maternal sacrifice She yawned perpetually she read innumerable novels
5379-44344-0004	train-other-500	she corresponded with her friends In the long dull evenings the once lively lady sometimes openly regretted that she had not been born a man with the three masculine resources of smoking drinking and swearing placed at her disposal
5379-44344-0005	train-other-500	It was a dreary existence and happier influences seemed but little likely to change it Grateful as she was to her mother no persuasion would induce Stella to leave Ten Acres and amuse herself in London
5379-44344-0006	train-other-500	missus Eyrecourt said with melancholy and metaphorical truth There is no elasticity left in my child On a dim gray morning mother and daughter sat by the fireside with another long day before them
5379-44344-0007	train-other-500	Where is that contemptible husband of yours missus Eyrecourt asked looking up from her book Lewis is staying in town Stella answered listlessly In company with Judas Iscariot Stella was too dull to immediately understand the allusion
5379-44344-0008	train-other-500	Do you mean Father Benwell she inquired Don t mention his name my dear I have re christened him on purpose to avoid it Even his name humiliates me How completely the fawning old wretch took me in with all my knowledge of the world too
5379-44344-0009	train-other-500	He was so nice and sympathetic such a comforting contrast on that occasion to you and your husband I declare I forgot every reason I had for not trusting him Ah we women are poor creatures we may own it among ourselves
5379-44344-0010	train-other-500	If a man only has nice manners and a pleasant voice how many of us can resist him Even Romayne imposed upon me assisted by his property which in some degree excuses my folly There is nothing to be done now Stella but to humor him
5379-44344-0011	train-other-500	Do as that detestable priest does and trust to your beauty there isn t as much of it left as I could wish to turn the scale in your favor Have you any idea when the new convert will come back I heard him ordering a fish dinner for himself yesterday because it was Friday
5379-44344-0012	train-other-500	Did you join him at dessert time profanely supported by meat What did he say What he has said more than once already mama His peace of mind is returning thanks to Father Benwell
none	none	 He was perfectly gentle and indulgent 
5379-44344-0013	train-other-500	but he looked as if he lived in a different world from mine
none	none	 He told me he proposed to pass a week in what he called Retreat 
5379-44344-0014	train-other-500	I didn t ask him what it meant Whatever it is I suppose he is there now My dear don t you remember your sister began in the same way She retreated
5379-44344-0015	train-other-500	We shall have Romayne with a red nose and a double chin offering to pray for us next Do you recollect that French maid of mine the woman I sent away because she would spit when she was out of temper like a cat I begin to think I treated the poor creature harshly
5379-44344-0016	train-other-500	When I hear of Romayne and his Retreat I almost feel inclined to spit myself There let us go on with your reading Take the first volume I have done with it What is it mama
5379-44344-0017	train-other-500	A very remarkable work Stella in the present state of light literature in England a novel that actually tells a story It s quite incredible I know Try the book It has another extraordinary merit it isn t written by a woman
5379-44344-0018	train-other-500	Stella obediently received the first volume turned over the leaves and wearily dropped the wonderful novel on her lap I can t attend to it she said My mind is too full of my own thoughts About Romayne said her mother
5379-44344-0019	train-other-500	No When I think of my husband now I almost wish I had his confidence in Priests and Retreats The conviction grows on me mama that my worst troubles are still to come When I was younger I don t remember being tormented by presentiments of any kind
5379-44344-0020	train-other-500	Did I ever talk of presentiments to you in the bygone days If you had done anything of the sort my love excuse me if I speak plainly I should have said Stella your liver is out of order and I should have opened the family medicine chest I will only say now
5379-44344-0021	train-other-500	send for the carriage let us go to a morning concert dine at a restaurant
none	none	 and finish the evening at the play 
5379-44344-0022	train-other-500	This characteristic proposal was entirely thrown away on Stella She was absorbed in pursuing her own train of thought I almost wish I had told Lewis she said to herself absently Told him of what my dear Of what happened to me with Winterfield
5379-44344-0023	train-other-500	missus Eyrecourt s faded eyes opened wide in astonishment Do you really mean it she asked I do indeed Are you actually simple enough Stella to think that a man of Romayne s temper would have made you his wife if you had told him of the Brussels marriage
5379-44344-0024	train-other-500	Why not Why not Would Romayne would any man believe that you really did part from Winterfield at the church door Considering that you are a married woman your innocence my sweet child is a perfect phenomenon
none	none	 It s well there were wiser people than you to keep your secret 
5379-44344-0025	train-other-500	Don t speak too positively mama Lewis may find it out yet
none	none	 Is that one of your presentiments 
5379-44344-0026	train-other-500	Yes How is he to find it out if you please I am afraid through Father Benwell Yes yes I know you only think him a fawning old hypocrite you don t fear him as I do
5379-44344-0027	train-other-500	Nothing will persuade me that zeal for his religion is the motive under which that man acts in devoting himself to Romayne He has some abominable object in view and his eyes tell me that I am concerned in it missus Eyrecourt burst out laughing
5379-44344-0028	train-other-500	What is there to laugh at Stella asked I declare my dear there is something absolutely provoking in your utter want of knowledge of the world When you are puzzled to account for anything remarkable in a clergyman s conduct I don t care my poor child to what denomination he belongs
5379-44344-0029	train-other-500	you can t be wrong in attributing his motive to Money If Romayne had turned Baptist or Methodist the reverend gentleman in charge of his spiritual welfare would not have forgotten as you have forgotten you little goose that his convert was a rich man
5379-44344-0030	train-other-500	His mind would have dwelt on the chapel or the mission or the infant school in want of funds and with no more abominable object in view than I have at this moment in poking the fire he would have ended in producing his modest subscription list and would have betrayed himself
none	none	 just as our odious Benwell will betray himself by the two amiable little words 
5379-44344-0031	train-other-500	Please contribute Is there any other presentiment my dear on which you would like to have your mother s candid opinion Stella resignedly took up the book again I daresay you are right she said Let us read our novel
none	none	 Before she had reached the end of the first page her mind was far away again from the unfortunate story 
5379-44344-0032	train-other-500	She was thinking of that other presentiment which had formed the subject of her mother s last satirical inquiry The vague fear that had shaken her when she had accidentally touched the French boy on her visit to Camp s Hill still from time to time troubled her memory
5379-44344-0033	train-other-500	Even the event of his death had failed to dissipate the delusion which associated him with some undefined evil influence that might yet assert itself A superstitious forewarning of this sort was a weakness new to her in her experience of herself She was heartily ashamed of it
5379-44344-0034	train-other-500	and yet it kept its hold Once more the book dropped on her lap She laid it aside and walked wearily to the window to look at the weather Almost at the same moment missus Eyrecourt s maid disturbed her mistress over the second volume of the novel by entering the room with a letter
5379-44344-0035	train-other-500	For me Stella asked looking round from the window No ma am for missus Eyrecourt The letter had been brought to the house by one of Lady Loring s servants In delivering it he had apparently given private instructions to the maid
5379-44344-0036	train-other-500	She laid her finger significantly on her lips when she gave the letter to her mistress In these terms Lady Loring wrote If Stella happens to be with you when you receive my note don t say anything which will let her know that I am your correspondent
5379-44344-0037	train-other-500	She has always poor dear had an inveterate distrust of Father Benwell and between ourselves I am not sure that she is quite so foolish as I once thought The Father has unexpectedly left us with a well framed excuse which satisfied Lord Loring
5379-44344-0038	train-other-500	It fails to satisfy Me Not from any wonderful exercise of penetration on my part but in consequence of something I have just heard in course of conversation with a Catholic friend Father Benwell my dear turns out to be a Jesuit
5379-44344-0039	train-other-500	and what is more a person of such high authority in the Order that his concealment of his rank while he was with us must have been a matter of necessity
5379-44344-0040	train-other-500	He must have had some very serious motive for occupying a position so entirely beneath him as his position in our house I have not the shadow of a reason for associating this startling discovery with dear Stella s painful misgivings
5379-44344-0041	train-other-500	and yet there is something in my mind which makes me want to hear what Stella s mother thinks Come and have a talk about it as soon as you possibly can missus Eyrecourt put the letter in her pocket smiling quietly to herself
5379-44344-0042	train-other-500	Applying to Lady Loring s letter the infallible system of solution which she had revealed to her daughter missus Eyrecourt solved the mystery of the priest s conduct without a moment s hesitation
5379-44344-0043	train-other-500	Lord Loring s check in Father Benwell s pocket representing such a liberal subscription that my lord was reluctant to mention it to my lady there was the reading of the riddle as plain as the sun at noonday
5379-44344-0044	train-other-500	Would it be desirable to enlighten Lady Loring as she had already enlightened Stella missus Eyrecourt decided in the negative As Roman Catholics and as old friends of Romayne the Lorings naturally rejoiced in his conversion
5379-44344-0045	train-other-500	But as old friends also of Romayne s wife they were bound not to express their sentiments too openly Feeling that any discussion of the priest s motives would probably lead to the delicate subject of the conversion missus Eyrecourt prudently determined to let the matter drop
5379-44344-0046	train-other-500	As a consequence of this decision Stella was left without the slightest warning of the catastrophe which was now close at hand
none	none	 missus Eyrecourt joined her daughter at the window 
5379-44344-0047	train-other-500	Well my dear is it clearing up Shall we take a drive before luncheon If you like mama
none	none	 She turned to her mother as she answered 
5379-44344-0048	train-other-500	The light of the clearing sky at once soft and penetrating fell full on her missus Eyrecourt looking at her as usual suddenly became serious she studied her daughter s face with an eager and attentive scrutiny
5379-44344-0049	train-other-500	Do you see any extraordinary change in me Stella asked with a faint smile
none	none	 Instead of answering missus Eyrecourt put her arm round Stella with a loving gentleness entirely at variance with any ordinary expression of her character 
5379-44344-0050	train-other-500	The worldly mother s eyes rested with a lingering tenderness on the daughter s face Stella she said softly and stopped at a loss for words for the first time in her life After a while she began again
5379-44344-0051	train-other-500	Yes I see a change in you she whispered an interesting change which tells me something Can you guess what it is Stella s color rose brightly and faded again She laid her head in silence on her mother s bosom
5379-44344-0052	train-other-500	Worldly frivolous self interested missus Eyrecourt s nature was the nature of a woman and the one great trial and triumph of a woman s life appealing to her as a trial and a triumph soon to come to her own child
5379-44344-0053	train-other-500	touched fibers under the hardened surface of her heart which were still unprofaned My poor darling she said have you told the good news to your husband No Why not He doesn t care now for anything that I can tell him Nonsense Stella
5379-44344-0054	train-other-500	You may win him back to you by a word and do you hesitate to say the word I shall tell him Stella suddenly drew herself away from her mother s caressing arm
none	none	 If you do she cried no words can say how inconsiderate and how cruel I shall think you 
5379-44344-0055	train-other-500	Promise on your word of honor promise you will leave it to me Will you tell him yourself if I leave it to you Yes at my own time Promise Hush hush don t excite yourself my love I promise Give me a kiss
5379-44344-0056	train-other-500	I declare I am agitated myself she exclaimed falling back into her customary manner Such a shock to my vanity Stella the prospect of becoming a grandmother I really must ring for Matilda and take a few drops of red lavender
5379-44344-0057	train-other-500	Be advised by me my poor dear and we will turn the priest out of the house yet When Romayne comes back from his ridiculous Retreat after his fasting and flagellation and Heaven knows what besides
none	none	 then bring him to his senses 
5379-44344-0058	train-other-500	then is the time to tell him Will you think of it Yes I will think of it And one word more before Matilda comes in
none	none	 Remember the vast importance of having a male heir to Vange Abbey On these occasions you may practice with perfect impunity on the ignorance of the men Tell him you re sure it s going to be a boy CHAPTER II THE SEED IS SOWN SITUATED in a distant quarter of the vast western suburb of London the house called The Retreat stood in the midst of a well kept garden protected on all sides by a high brick wall Excepting the grand gilt cross on the roof of the chapel nothing revealed externally the devotional purpose to which the Roman Catholic priesthood assisted by the liberality of the Faithful had dedicated the building But the convert privileged to pass the gates left Protestant England outside and found himself as it were in a new country Inside The Retreat the paternal care of the Church took possession of him surrounded him with monastic simplicity in his neat little bedroom and dazzled him with devotional splendor when his religious duties called him into the chapel The perfect taste so seldom found in the modern arrangement and decoration of convents and churches in southern countries showed itself here pressed into the service of religion in every part of the house The severest discipline had no sordid and hideous side to it in The Retreat The inmates fasted on spotless tablecloths and handled knives and forks the humble servants of half filled stomachs without a speck on their decent brightness Penitents who kissed the steps of the altar to use the expressive Oriental phrase eat no dirt Friends liberal friends permitted to visit the inmates on stated days saw copies of famous Holy Families in the reception room which were really works of Art and trod on a carpet of studiously modest pretensions exhibiting pious emblems beyond reproach in color and design The Retreat had its own artesian well not a person in the house drank impurity in his water A faint perfume of incense was perceptible in the corridors The soothing and mysterious silence of the place was intensified rather than disturbed by soft footsteps and gentle opening and closing of doors Animal life was not even represented by a cat in the kitchen And yet pervaded by some inscrutable influence the house was not dull Heretics with lively imaginations might have not inappropriately likened it to an enchanted castle In one word the Catholic system here showed to perfection its masterly knowledge of the weakness of human nature and its inexhaustible dexterity in adapting the means to the end On the morning when missus Eyrecourt and her daughter held their memorable interview by the fireside at Ten Acres Father Benwell entered one of the private rooms at The Retreat devoted to the use of the priesthood The demure attendant waiting humbly for instructions was sent to request the presence of one of the inmates of the house named Mortleman Father Benwell s customary serenity was a little ruffled on this occasion by an appearance of anxiety More than once he looked impatiently toward the door and he never even noticed the last new devotional publications laid invitingly on the table mister Mortleman made his appearance a young man and a promising convert The wild brightness of his eyes revealed that incipient form of brain disease which begins in fanaticism and ends not infrequently in religious madness His manner of greeting the priest was absolutely servile He cringed before the illustrious Jesuit Father Benwell took no notice of these demonstrations of humility Be seated my son he said mister Mortleman looked as if he would have preferred going down on his knees but he yielded and took a chair I think you have been mister Romayne s companion for a few days in the hours of recreation the priest began Yes Father Does he appear to be at all weary of his residence in this house Oh far from it He feels the benign influence of The Retreat we have had some delightful hours together Have you anything to report mister Mortleman crossed his hands on his breast and bowed profoundly I have to report of myself Father that I have committed the sin of presumption I presumed that mister Romayne was like myself not married Have I spoken to you on that subject No Father Then you have committed no sin You have only made an excusable mistake How were you led into error In this way Father mister Romayne had been speaking to me of a book which you had been so good as to send to him He had been especially interested by the memoir therein contained of the illustrious Englishman Cardinal Acton The degrees by which his Eminence rose to the rank of a Prince of the Church seemed as I thought to have aroused in my friend a new sense of vocation He asked me if I myself aspired to belong to the holy priesthood I answered that this was indeed my aspiration if I might hope to be found worthy He appeared to be deeply affected I ventured to ask if he too had the same prospect before him He grieved me indescribably He sighed and said I have no such hope I am married Tell me Father I entreat you have I done wrong Father Benwell considered for a moment Did mister Romayne say anything more he asked No Father Did you attempt to return to the subject I thought it best to be silent Father Benwell held out his hand My young friend you have not only done no wrong you have shown the most commendable discretion I will detain you no longer from your duties Go to mister Romayne and say that I wish to speak with him mister Mortleman dropped on one knee and begged for a blessing Father Benwell lifted the traditional two fingers and gave the blessing The conditions of human happiness are easily fulfilled if we rightly understand them mister Mortleman retired perfectly happy Left by himself again Father Benwell paced the room rapidly from end to end The disturbing influence visible in his face had now changed from anxiety to excitement I ll try it to day he said to himself and stopped and looked round him doubtfully No not here he decided it may get talked about too soon It will be safer in every way at my lodgings He recovered his composure and returned to his chair Romayne opened the door The double influence of the conversion and of the life in The Retreat had already changed him His customary keenness and excitability of look had subsided and had left nothing in their place but an expression of suave and meditative repose All his troubles were now in the hands of his priest There was a passive regularity in his bodily movements and a beatific serenity in his smile My dear friend said Father Benwell cordially shaking hands you were good enough to be guided by my advice in entering this house Be guided by me again when I say that you have been here long enough You can return after an interval if you wish it But I have something to say to you first and I beg to offer the hospitality of my lodgings The time had been when Romayne would have asked for some explanation of this abrupt notice of removal Now he passively accepted the advice of his spiritual director Father Benwell made the necessary communication to the authorities and Romayne took leave of his friends in The Retreat The great Jesuit and the great landowner left the place with becoming humility in a cab I hope I have not disappointed you said Father Benwell I am only anxious Romayne answered to hear what you have to say CHAPTER III THE HARVEST IS REAPED ON their way through the streets Father Benwell talked as persistently of the news of the day as if he had nothing else in his thoughts To keep his companion s mind in a state of suspense was in certain emergencies to exert a useful preparatory influence over a man of Romayne s character Even when they reached his lodgings the priest still hesitated to approach the object that he had in view He made considerate inquiries in the character of a hospitable man They breakfast early at The Retreat he said What may I offer you I want nothing thank you Romayne answered with an effort to control his habitual impatience of needless delay Pardon me we have a long interview before us I fear Our bodily necessities Romayne excuse me if I take the friendly liberty of suppressing the formal mister our bodily necessities are not to be trifled with A bottle of my famous claret and a few biscuits will not hurt either of us He rang the bell and gave the necessary directions Another damp day he went on cheerfully I hope you don t pay the rheumatic penalties of a winter residence in England Ah this glorious country would be too perfect if it possessed the delicious climate of Rome The wine and biscuits were brought in Father Benwell filled the glasses and bowed cordially to his guest Nothing of this sort at The Retreat he said gayly Excellent water I am told which is a luxury in its way especially in London Well my dear Romayne I must begin by making my apologies You no doubt thought me a little abrupt in running away with you from your retirement at a moment s notice I believed that you had good reasons Father and that was enough for me Thank you you do me justice it was in your best interests that I acted There are men of phlegmatic temperament over whom the wise monotony of discipline at The Retreat exercises a wholesome influence I mean an influence which may be prolonged with advantage You are not one of those persons Protracted seclusion and monotony of life are morally and mentally unprofitable to a man of your ardent disposition I abstained from mentioning these reasons at the time out of a feeling of regard for our excellent resident director who believes unreservedly in the institution over which he presides Very good The Retreat has done all that it could usefully do in your case We must think next of how to employ that mental activity which rightly developed is one of the most valuable qualities that you possess Let me ask first if you have in some degree recovered your tranquillity I feel like a different man Father Benwell That s right And your nervous sufferings I don t ask what they are I only want to know if you experience a sense of relief A most welcome sense of relief Romayne answered with a revival of the enthusiasm of other days The complete change in all my thoughts and convictions which I owe to you And to dear Penrose Father Benwell interposed with the prompt sense of justice which no man could more becomingly assume We must not forget Arthur Forget him Romayne repeated Not a day passes without my thinking of him It is one of the happy results of the change in me that my mind does not dwell bitterly on the loss of him now I think of Penrose with admiration as of one whose glorious life with all its dangers I should like to share He spoke with a rising color and brightening eyes Already the absorbent capacity of the Roman Church had drawn to itself that sympathetic side of his character which was also one of its strongest sides Already his love for Penrose hitherto inspired by the virtues of the man had narrowed its range to sympathy with the trials and privileges of the priest Truly and deeply indeed had the physician consulted in bygone days reasoned on Romayne s case That occurrence of some new and absorbing influence in his life of which the doctor had spoken that working of some complete change in his habits of thought had found its way to him at last after the wife s simple devotion had failed through the subtler ministrations of the priest Some men having Father Benwell s object in view would have taken instant advantage of the opening offered to them by Romayne s unguarded enthusiasm The illustrious Jesuit held fast by the wise maxim which forbade him to do anything in a hurry No he said your life must not be the life of our dear friend The service on which the Church employs Penrose is not the fit service for you You have other claims on us Romayne looked at his spiritual adviser with a momentary change of expression a relapse into the ironical bitterness of the past time Have you forgotten that I am and can be only a layman he asked What claims can I have except the common claim of all faithful members of the Church on the good offices of the priesthood He paused for a moment and continued with the abruptness of a man struck by a new idea Yes I have perhaps one small aim of my own the claim of being allowed to do my duty In what respect dear Romayne Surely you can guess I am a rich man I have money lying idle which it is my duty and my privilege to devote to the charities and necessities of the Church And while I am speaking of this I must own that I am a little surprised at your having said nothing to me on the subject You have never yet pointed out to me the manner in which I might devote my money to the best and noblest uses Was it forgetfulness on your part Father Benwell shook his head No he replied I can t honestly say that Then you had a reason for your silence Yes May I not know it Father Benwell got up and walked to the fireplace Now there are various methods of getting up and walking to a fireplace and they find their way to outward expression through the customary means of look and manner We may feel cold and may only want to warm ourselves Or we may feel restless and may need an excuse for changing our position Or we may feel modestly confused and may be anxious to hide it Father Benwell from head to foot expressed modest confusion and polite anxiety to hide it My good friend he said I am afraid of hurting your feelings Romayne was a sincere convert but there were instincts still left in him which resented this expression of regard even when it proceeded from a man whom he respected and admired You will hurt my feelings he answered a little sharply if you are not plain with me Then I will be plain with you Father Benwell rejoined The Church speaking through me as her unworthy interpreter feels a certain delicacy in approaching You on the subject of money Why Father Benwell left the fireplace without immediately answering He opened a drawer and took out of it a flat mahogany box His gracious familiarity became transformed by some mysterious process of congelation into a dignified formality of manner The priest took the place of the man The Church mister Romayne hesitates to receive as benevolent contributions money derived from property of its own arbitrarily taken from it and placed in a layman s hands No he cried interrupting Romayne who instantly understood the allusion to Vange Abbey no I must beg you to hear me out I state the case plainly at your own request At the same time I am bound to admit that the lapse of centuries has in the eye of the law sanctioned the deliberate act of robbery perpetrated by Henry the Eighth You have lawfully inherited Vange Abbey from your ancestors The Church is not unreasonable enough to assert a merely moral right against the law of the country It may feel the act of spoliation but it submits He unlocked the flat mahogany box and gently dropped his dignity the man took the place of the priest As the master of Vange he said you may be interested in looking at a little historical curiosity which we have preserved The title deeds dear Romayne by which the monks held your present property in their time Take another glass of wine Romayne looked at the title deeds and laid them aside unread Father Benwell had roused his pride his sense of justice his wild and lavish instincts of generosity He who had always despised money except when it assumed its only estimable character as a means for the attainment of merciful and noble ends he was in possession of property to which he had no moral right without even the poor excuse of associations which attached him to the place I hope I have not offended you said Father Benwell You have made me ashamed of myself Romayne answered warmly On the day when I became a Catholic I ought to have remembered Vange Better late than never I refuse to take shelter under the law I respect the moral right of the Church I will at once restore the property which I have usurped Father Benwell took both Romayne s hands in his and pressed them fervently I am proud of you he said We shall all be proud of you when I write word to Rome of what has passed between us But no Romayne this must not be I admire you feel with you and I refuse On behalf of the Church I say it I refuse the gift Wait a little Father Benwell You don t know the state of my affairs I don t deserve the admiration which you feel for me The loss of the Vange property will be no pecuniary loss in my case I have inherited a fortune from my aunt My income from that source is far larger than my income from the Yorkshire property Romayne it must not be Pardon me it must be I have more money than I can spend without Vange And I have painful associations with the house which disincline me ever to enter it again Even this confession failed to move Father Benwell He obstinately crossed his arms obstinately tapped his foot on the floor No he said Plead as generously as you may my answer is No Romayne only became more resolute on his side The property is absolutely my own he persisted I am without a near relation in the world I have no children My wife is already provided for at my death out of the fortune left me by my aunt It is downright obstinacy forgive me for saying so to persist in your refusal It is downright duty Romayne If I gave way to you I should be the means of exposing the priesthood to the vilest misinterpretation I should be deservedly reprimanded and your proposal of restitution if you expressed it in writing would without a moment s hesitation be torn up If you have any regard for me drop the subject Romayne refused to yield even to this unanswerable appeal Very well he said there is one document you can t tear up You can t interfere with my making another will I shall leave the Vange property to the Church and I shall appoint you one of the trustees You can t object to that Father Benwell smiled sadly The law spares me the ungracious necessity of objecting in this case he answered My friend you forget the Statutes of Mortmain They positively forbid you to carry out the intention which you have just expressed Romayne dismissed this appeal to the law irritably by waving his hand The Statutes of Mortmain he rejoined can t prevent my bequeathing my property to an individual I shall leave Vange Abbey to You Now Father Benwell have I got the better of you at last With Christian humility the Jesuit accepted the defeat for which he had paved the way from the outset of the interview At the same time he shuffled all personal responsibility off his own shoulders He had gained the victory for the Church without to do him justice thinking of himself Your generosity has conquered me he said But I must be allowed to clear myself of even the suspicion of an interested motive On the day when your will is executed I shall write to the General of our Order at Rome leaving my inheritance to him This proceeding will be followed by a deed in due form conveying the property to the Church You have no objection to my taking that course No My dear Romayne words are useless at such a time as this My acts shall speak for me I am too agitated to say more Let us talk of something else let us have some wine He filled the glasses he offered more biscuits he was really and even perceptibly agitated by the victory that he had won But one last necessity now confronted him the necessity of placing a serious obstacle in the way of any future change of purpose on the part of Romayne As to the choice of that obstacle Father Benwell s mind had been made up for some time past What was it I had to say to you he resumed Surely I was speaking on the subject of your future life You are very kind Father Benwell The subject has little interest for me My future life is shaped out domestic retirement ennobled by religious duties Still pacing the room Father Benwell stopped at that reply and put his hand kindly on Romayne s shoulder We don t allow a good Catholic to drift into domestic retirement who is worthy of better things he said The Church Romayne wishes to make use of you I never flattered any one in my life but I may say before your face what I have said behind your back A man of your strict sense of honor of your intellect of your high aspirations of your personal charm and influence is not a man whom we can allow to run to waste Open your mind my friend fairly to me and I will open my mind fairly to you Let me set the example I say it with authority an enviable future is before you Romayne s pale cheeks flushed with excitement What future he asked eagerly Am I free to choose Must I remind you that a man with a wife cannot think only of himself Suppose you were not a man with a wife What do you mean Romayne I am trying to break my way through that inveterate reserve which is one of the failings in your character Unless you can prevail on yourself to tell me those secret thoughts those unexpressed regrets which you can confide to no other man this conversation must come to an end Is there no yearning in your inmost soul for anything beyond the position which you now occupy There was a pause The flush on Romayne s face faded away He was silent You are not in the confessional Father Benwell reminded him with melancholy submission to circumstances You are under no obligation to answer me Romayne roused himself He spoke in low reluctant tones I am afraid to answer you he said That apparently discouraging reply armed Father Benwell with the absolute confidence of success which he had thus far failed to feel He wound his way deeper and deeper into Romayne s mind with the delicate ingenuity of penetration of which the practice of years had made him master Perhaps I have failed to make myself clearly understood he said I will try to put it more plainly You are no half hearted man Romayne What you believe you believe fervently Impressions are not dimly and slowly produced on your mind As the necessary result your conversion being once accomplished your whole soul is given to the Faith that is in you Do I read your character rightly So far as I know it yes Father Benwell went on Bear in mind what I have just said he resumed and you will understand why I feel it my duty to press the question which you have not answered yet You have found in the Catholic Faith the peace of mind which you have failed to obtain by other means If I had been dealing with an ordinary man I should have expected from the change no happier result than this But I ask You has that blessed influence taken no deeper and nobler hold on your heart Can you truly say to me I am content with what I have gained I wish for no more I cannot truly say it Romayne answered The time had now come for speaking plainly Father Benwell no longer advanced to his end under cover of a cloud of words A little while since he said you spoke of Penrose as of a man whose lot in life you longed to share The career which has associated him with an Indian mission is as I told you only adapted to a man of his special character and special gifts But the career which has carried him into the sacred ranks of the priesthood is open to every man who feels the sense of divine vocation which has made Penrose one of Us No Father Benwell Not open to every man I say Yes It is not open to Me I say it is open to You And more I enjoin I command you to dismiss from your mind all merely human obstacles and discouragements They are beneath the notice of a man who feels himself called to the priesthood Give me your hand Romayne Does your conscience tell you that you are that man Romayne started to his feet shaken to the soul by the solemnity of the appeal I can t dismiss the obstacles that surround me he cried passionately To a man in my position your advice is absolutely useless The ties that bind me are beyond the limit of a priest s sympathies Nothing is beyond the limit of a priest s sympathies Father Benwell I am married Father Benwell folded his arms over his breast looked with immovable resolution straight in Romayne s face and struck the blow which he had been meditating for months past Rouse your courage he said sternly You are no more married than I am CHAPTER IV ON THE ROAD TO ROME THERE was not a sound in the room Romayne stood looking at the priest Did you hear what I said Father Benwell asked Yes Do you understand that I really mean what I said He made no reply he waited like a man expecting to hear more Father Benwell was alive to the vast importance at such a moment of not shrinking from the responsibility which he had assumed I see how I distress you he said but for your sake I am bound to speak out Romayne the woman whom you have married is the wife of another man Don t ask me how I know it I do know it You shall have positive proof as soon as you have recovered Come rest a little in the easy chair He took Romayne s arm and led him to the chair and made him drink some wine They waited a while Romayne lifted his head with a heavy sigh The woman whom I have married is the wife of another man He slowly repeated the words to himself and then looked at Father Benwell Who is the man he asked I introduced you to him when I was as ignorant of the circumstances as you are the priest answered The man is mister Bernard Winterfield Romayne half raised himself from the chair A momentary anger glittered in his eyes and faded out again extinguished by the nobler emotions of grief and shame He remembered Winterfield s introduction to Stella Her husband he said speaking again to himself And she let me introduce him to her And she received him like a stranger He paused and thought of it The proofs if you please sir he resumed with sudden humility I don t want to hear any particulars It will be enough for me if I know beyond all doubt that I have been deceived and disgraced Father Benwell unlocked his desk and placed two papers before Romayne He did his duty with a grave indifference to all minor considerations The time had not yet come for expressions of sympathy and regret The first paper he said is a certified copy of the register of the marriage of Miss Eyrecourt to mister Winterfield celebrated as you will see by the English chaplain at Brussels and witnessed by three persons Look at the names The bride s mother was the first witness The two names that followed were the names of Lord and Lady Loring They too in the conspiracy to deceive me Romayne said as he laid the paper back on the table I obtained that piece of written evidence Father Benwell proceeded by the help of a reverend colleague of mine residing at Brussels I will give you his name and address if you wish to make further inquiries Quite needless What is this other paper This other paper is an extract from the short hand writer s notes suppressed in the reports of the public journals of proceedings in an English court of law obtained at my request by my lawyer in London What have I to do with it He put the question in a tone of passive endurance resigned to the severest moral martyrdom that could be inflicted on him I will answer you in two words said Father Benwell In justice to Miss Eyrecourt I am bound to produce her excuse for marrying you Romayne looked at him in stern amazement Excuse he repeated Yes excuse The proceedings to which I have alluded declare Miss Eyrecourt s marriage to mister Winterfield to be null and void by the English law in consequence of his having been married at the time to another woman Try to follow me I will put it as briefly as possible In justice to yourself and to your future career you must understand this revolting case thoroughly from beginning to end With those prefatory words he told the story of Winterfield s first marriage altering nothing concealing nothing doing the fullest justice to Winterfield s innocence of all evil motive from first to last When the plain truth served his purpose as it most assuredly did in this case the man has never yet been found who could match Father Benwell at stripping himself of every vestige of reserve and exhibiting his naked heart to the moral admiration of mankind You were mortified and I was surprised he went on when mister Winterfield dropped his acquaintance with you We now know that he acted like an honorable man He waited to see what effect he had produced Romayne was in no state of mind to do justice to Winterfield or to any one His pride was mortally wounded his high sense of honor and delicacy writhed under the outrage inflicted on it And mind this Father Benwell persisted poor human nature has its right to all that can be justly conceded in the way of excuse and allowance Miss Eyrecourt would naturally be advised by her friends would naturally be eager on her own part to keep hidden from you what happened at Brussels A sensitive woman placed in a position so horribly false and degrading must not be too severely judged even when she does wrong I am bound to say this and more Speaking from my own knowledge of all the parties I have no doubt that Miss Eyrecourt and mister Winterfield did really part at the church door Romayne answered by a look so disdainfully expressive of the most immovable unbelief that it absolutely justified the fatal advice by which Stella s worldly wise friends had encouraged her to conceal the truth Father Benwell prudently closed his lips He had put the case with perfect fairness his bitterest enemy could not have denied that Romayne took up the second paper looked at it and threw it back again on the table with an expression of disgust You told me just now he said that I was married to the wife of another man And there is the judge s decision releasing Miss Eyrecourt from her marriage to mister Winterfield May I ask you to explain yourself Certainly Let me first remind you that you owe religious allegiance to the principles which the Church has asserted for centuries past with all the authority of its divine institution You admit that I admit it Now listen In our church Romayne marriage is even more than a religious institution it is a sacrament We acknowledge no human laws which profane that sacrament Take two examples of what I say When the great Napoleon was at the height of his power Pius the Seventh refused to acknowledge the validity of the Emperor s second marriage to Maria Louisa while Josephine was living divorced by the French Senate Again in the face of the Royal Marriage Act the Church sanctioned the marriage of missus Fitzherbert to George the Fourth and still declares in justice to her memory that she was the king s lawful wife In one word marriage to be marriage at all must be the object of a purely religious celebration and this condition complied with marriage is only to be dissolved by death You remember what I told you of mister Winterfield Yes His first marriage took place before the registrar In plain English Romayne mister Winterfield and the woman rider in the circus pronounced a formula of words before a layman in an office That is not only no marriage it is a blasphemous profanation of a holy rite Acts of Parliament which sanction such proceedings are acts of infidelity The Church declares it in defense of religion I understand you said Romayne mister Winterfield s marriage at Brussels Which the English law Father Benwell interposed declares to be annulled by the marriage before the registrar stands good nevertheless by the higher law of the Church mister Winterfield is Miss Eyrecourt s husband as long as they both live An ordained priest performed the ceremony in a consecrated building and Protestant marriages so celebrated are marriages acknowledged by the Catholic Church Under those circumstances the ceremony which afterward united you to Miss Eyrecourt though neither you nor the clergyman were to blame was a mere mockery Need I to say any more Shall I leave you for a while by yourself No I don t know what I may think I don t know what I may do if you leave me by myself Father Benwell took a chair by Romayne s side It has been my hard duty to grieve and humiliate you he said Do you bear me no ill will He held out his hand Romayne took it as an act of justice if not as an act of gratitude Can I be of any use in advising you Father Benwell asked Who can advise a man in my position Romayne bitterly rejoined I can at least suggest that you should take time to think over your position Time take time You talk as if my situation was endurable Everything is endurable Romayne It may be so to you Father Benwell Did you part with your humanity when you put on the black robe of the priest I parted my son with those weaknesses of our humanity on which women practice You talk of your position I will put it before you at its worst For what purpose To show you exactly what you have now to decide Judged by the law of England missus Romayne is your wife Judged by the principles held sacred among the religious community to which you belong she is not missus Romayne she is missus Winterfield living with you in adultery If you regret your conversion I don t regret it Father Benwell If you renounce the holy aspirations which you have yourself acknowledged to me return to your domestic life But don t ask us while you are living with that lady to respect you as a member of our communion Romayne was silent The more violent emotions aroused in him had with time subsided into calm Tenderness mercy past affection found their opportunity and pleaded with him The priest s bold language had missed the object at which it aimed It had revived in Romayne s memory the image of Stella in the days when he had first seen her How gently her influence had wrought on him for good how tenderly how truly she had loved him Give me some more wine he cried I feel faint and giddy Don t despise me Father Benwell I was once so fond of her The priest poured out the wine I feel for you he said Indeed indeed I feel for you It was not all a lie there were grains of truth in that outburst of sympathy Father Benwell was not wholly merciless His far seeing intellect his daring duplicity carried him straight on to his end in view But that end once gained and let it be remembered not gained in this case wholly for himself there were compassionate impulses left in him which sometimes forced their way to the surface A man of high intelligence however he may misuse it however unworthy he may be of it has a gift from Heaven When you want to see unredeemed wickedness look for it in a fool Let me mention one circumstance Father Benwell proceeded which may help to relieve you for the moment In your present state of mind you cannot return to The Retreat Impossible I have had a room prepared for you in this house Here free from any disturbing influence you can shape the future course of your life If you wish to communicate with your residence at Highgate Don t speak of it Father Benwell sighed Ah I understand he said sadly The house associated with mister Winterfield s visit Romayne again interrupted him this time by gesture only The hand that had made the sign clinched itself when it rested afterward on the table His eyes looked downward under frowning brows At the name of Winterfield remembrances that poisoned every better influence in him rose venomously in his mind Once more he loathed the deceit that had been practiced on him Once more the detestable doubt of that asserted parting at the church door renewed its stealthy torment and reasoned with him as if in words She has deceived you in one thing why not in another Can I see my lawyer here he asked suddenly My dear Romayne you can see any one whom you like to invite I shall not trouble you by staying very long Father Benwell Do nothing in a hurry my son Pray do nothing in a hurry Romayne paid no attention to this entreaty Shrinking from the momentous decision that awaited him his mind instinctively took refuge in the prospect of change of scene I shall leave England he said impatiently Not alone Father Benwell remonstrated Who will be my companion I will the priest answered Romayne s weary eyes brightened faintly In his desolate position Father Benwell was the one friend on whom he could rely Penrose was far away the Lorings had helped to keep him deceived Major Hynd had openly pitied and despised him as a victim to priestcraft Can you go with me at any time he asked Have you no duties that keep you in England My duties Romayne are already confided to other hands Then you have foreseen this I have thought it possible Your journey may be long or it may be short you shall not go away alone I can think of nothing yet my mind is a blank Romayne confessed sadly I don t know where I shall go I know where you ought to go and where you will go said Father Benwell emphatically Where To Rome Romayne understood the true meaning of that brief reply A vague sense of dismay began to rise in his mind While he was still tortured by doubt it seemed as if Father Benwell had by some inscrutable process of prevision planned out his future beforehand Had the priest foreseen events No he had only foreseen possibilities on the day when it first occurred to him that Romayne s marriage was assailable before the court of Romayne s conscience from the Roman Catholic point of view By this means the misfortune of Romayne s marriage having preceded his conversion might be averted and the one certain obstacle in the way of any change of purpose on his part the obstacle of the priesthood might still be set up by the voluntary separation of the husband from the wife Thus far the Jesuit had modestly described himself to his reverend colleagues as regarding his position toward Romayne in a new light His next letter might boldly explain to them what he had really meant The triumph was won Not a word more passed between his guest and himself that morning Before post time on the same day Father Benwell wrote his last report to the Secretary of the Society of Jesus in these lines Romayne is free from the domestic ties that bound him He leaves it to me to restore Vange Abbey to the Church and he acknowledges a vocation for the priesthood Expect us at Rome in a fortnight s time AFTER THE STORY EXTRACTS FROM BERNARD WINTERFIELD S DIARY I WINTERFIELD DEFENDS HIMSELF Beaupark House June seventeenth eighteen You and I Cousin Beeminster seldom meet But I occasionally hear of you from friends acquainted with both of us I have heard of you last at Sir Philip s rent day dinner a week since My name happened to be mentioned by one of the gentlemen present a guest like yourself You took up the subject of your own free will and spoke of me in these terms I am sorry to say it of the existing head of the family but Bernard is really unfit for the position which he holds He has to say the least of it compromised himself and his relatives on more than one occasion He began as a young man by marrying a circus rider He got into some other scrape after that which he has contrived to keep a secret from us We only know how disgraceful it must have been by the results he was a voluntary exile from England for more than a year And now to complete the list he has mixed himself up in that miserable and revolting business of Lewis Romayne and his wife If any other person had spoken of me in this manner I should have set him down as a mischievous idiot to be kicked perhaps but not to be noticed in any other way With you the case is different If I die without male offspring the Beaupark estate goes to you as next heir I don t choose to let a man in this position slander me and those dear to me without promptly contradicting him The name I bear is precious to me in memory of my father Your unanswered allusion to my relations with Lewis Romayne and his wife coming from a member of the family will be received as truth Rather than let this be I reveal to you without reserve some of the saddest passages of my life I have nothing to be ashamed of and if I have hitherto kept certain events in the dark it has been for the sake of others not for my own sake I know better now A woman s reputation if she is a good woman is not easily compromised by telling the truth The person of whom I am thinking when I write this knows what I am going to do and approves of it You will receive with these lines the most perfectly candid statement that I can furnish being extracts cut out of my own private Diary They are accompanied where plain necessity seems to call for it by the written evidence of other persons There has never been much sympathy between us But you have been brought up like a gentleman and when you have read my narrative I expect that you will do justice to me and to others even though you think we acted indiscreetly under trying and critical circumstances B W II WINTERFIELD MAKES EXTRACTS First Extract April eleventh eighteen sixty nine missus Eyrecourt and her daughter have left Beaupark to day for London Have I really made any impression on the heart of the beautiful Stella In my miserable position ignorant whether I am free or not I have shrunk from formally acknowledging that I love her twelfth I am becoming superstitious In the Obituary of to day s Times the death is recorded of that unhappy woman whom I was mad enough to marry After hearing nothing of her for seven years I am free Surely this is a good omen Shall I follow the Eyrecourts to London and declare myself I have not confidence enough in my own power of attraction to run the risk Better to write first in strictest confidence to missus Eyrecourt fourteenth An enchanting answer from my angel s mother written in great haste They are on the point of leaving for Paris Stella is restless and dissatisfied she wants change of scene and missus Eyrecourt adds in so many words It is you who have upset her why did you not speak while we were at Beaupark I am to hear again from Paris Good old Father Newbliss said all along that she was fond of me and wondered like missus Eyrecourt why I failed to declare myself How could I tell them of the hideous fetters which bound me in those days eighteenth Paris She has accepted me Words are useless to express my happiness nineteenth A letter from my lawyer full of professional subtleties and delays I have no patience to enumerate them We move to Belgium to morrow Not on our way back to England Stella is so little desirous of leaving the Continent that we are likely to be married abroad But she is weary of the perpetual gayety and glitter of Paris and wants to see the old Belgian cities Her mother leaves Paris with regret The liveliest woman of her age that I ever met with Brussels May seven My blessing on the old Belgian cities missus Eyrecourt is so eager to get away from them that she backs me in hurrying the marriage and even consents sorely against the grain to let the wedding be celebrated at Brussels in a private and unpretending way She has only stipulated that Lord and Lady Loring old friends shall be present They are to arrive tomorrow and two days afterward we are to be married An inclosure is inserted in this place It consists of the death bed confession of mister Winterfield s wife and of the explanatory letter written by the rector of Belhaven The circumstances related in these documents already known to the reader are left to speak for themselves and the Extracts from the Diary are then continued Bingen on the Rhine May nineteen Letters from Devonshire at last which relieve my wretchedness in some small degree The frightful misfortune at Brussels will at least be kept secret so far as I am concerned Beaupark House is shut up and the servants are dismissed in consequence of my residence abroad To Father Newbliss I have privately written Not daring to tell him the truth I leave him to infer that my marriage engagement has been broken off he writes back a kind and comforting letter Time will I suppose help me to bear my sad lot Perhaps a day may come when Stella and her friends will know how cruelly they have wronged me London November eighteen eighteen sixty The old wound has been opened again I met her accidentally in a picture gallery She turned deadly pale and left the place Oh Stella Stella London August twelve eighteen sixty one Another meeting with her And another shock to endure which I might not have suffered if I had been a reader of the marriage announcements in the newspapers Like other men I am in the habit of leaving the marriage announcements to the women I went to visit an agreeable new acquaintance mister Romayne His wife drove up to the house while I was looking out of window I recognized Stella After two years she has made use of the freedom which the law has given to her I must not complain of that or of her treating me like a stranger when her husband innocently introduced us But when are were afterward left together for a few minutes no I cannot write down the merciless words she said to me Why am I fool enough to be as fond of her as ever Beaupark November sixteen Stella s married life is not likely to be a happy one To day s newspaper announces the conversion of her husband to the Roman Catholic Faith I can honestly say I am sorry for her knowing how she has suffered among her own relatives by these conversions But I so hate him that this proof of his weakness is a downright consolation to me Beaupark January twenty seven eighteen sixty two A letter from Stella so startling and deplorable that I cannot remain away from her after reading it Her husband has deliberately deserted her He has gone to Rome to serve his term of probation for the priesthood I travel to London by to day s train London January twenty seven Short as it is I looked at Stella s letter again and again on the journey The tone of the closing sentences is still studiously cold After informing me that she is staying with her mother in London she concludes her letter in these terms Be under no fear that the burden of my troubles will be laid on your shoulders Since the fatal day when we met at Ten Acres you have shown forbearance and compassion toward me I don t stop to inquire if you are sincere it rests with you to prove that But I have some questions to ask which no person but you can answer For the rest my friendless position will perhaps plead with you not to misunderstand me May I write again Inveterate distrust in every sentence If any other woman had treated me in this way I should have put her letter into the fire and should not have stirred from my comfortable house January twenty nine A day missed out of my Diary The events of yesterday unnerved me for the time Arriving at Derwent s Hotel on the evening of the twenty seventh I sent a line to Stella by messenger to ask when she could receive me It is strange how the merest trifles seem to touch women Her note in reply contains the first expression of friendly feeling toward me which has escaped her since we parted at Brussels And this expression proceeds from her ungovernable surprise and gratitude at my taking the trouble to travel from Devonshire to London on her account For the rest she proposed to call on me at the hotel the next morning She and her mother it appeared differed in opinion on the subject of mister Romayne s behavior to her and she wished to see me in the first instance unrestrained by missus Eyrecourt s interference There was little sleep for me that night I passed most of the time in smoking and walking up and down the room My one relief was afforded by Traveler he begged so hard to go to London with me I could not resist him The dog always sleeps in my room His surprise at my extraordinary restlessness ending in downright anxiety and alarm was expressed in his eyes and in his little whinings and cries quite as intelligibly as if he had put his meaning into words Who first called a dog a dumb creature It must have been a man I think and a thoroughly unlovable man too from a dog s point of view Soon after ten on the morning of the twenty eighth she entered my sitting room In her personal appearance I saw a change for the worse produced I suppose by the troubles that have tried her sorely poor thing There was a sad loss of delicacy in her features and of purity in her complexion Even her dress I should certainly not have noticed it in any other woman seemed to be loose and slovenly In the agitation of the moment I forgot the long estrangement between us I half lifted my hand to take hers and checked myself Was I mistaken in supposing that she yielded to the same impulse and resisted it as I did She concealed her embarrassment if she felt any by patting the dog I am ashamed that you should have taken the journey to London in this wintry weather she began It was impossible in her situation to let her assume this commonplace tone with me I sincerely feel for you I said and sincerely wish to help you if I can She looked at me for the first time Did she believe me or did she still doubt Before I could decide she took a letter from her pocket opened it and handed it to me Women often exaggerate their troubles she said It is perhaps an unfair trial of your patience but I should like you to satisfy yourself that I have not made the worst of my situation That letter will place it before you in mister Romayne s own words Read it except where the page is turned down It was her husband s letter of farewell The language was scrupulously delicate and considerate But to my mind it entirely failed to disguise the fanatical cruelty of the man s resolution addressed to his wife In substance it came to this He had discovered the marriage at Brussels which she had deliberately concealed from him when he took her for his wife She had afterward persisted in that concealment under circumstances which made it impossible that he could ever trust her again This no doubt referred to her ill advised reception of me as a total stranger at Ten Acres Lodge In the miserable break up of his domestic life the Church to which he now belonged offered him not only her divine consolation but the honor above all earthly distinctions of serving the cause of religion in the sacred ranks of the priesthood Before his departure for Rome he bade her a last farewell in this world and forgave her the injuries that she had inflicted on him For her sake he asked leave to say some few words more In the first place he desired to do her every justice in a worldly sense Ten Acres Lodge was offered to her as a free gift for her lifetime with a sufficient income for all her wants In the second place he was anxious that she should not misinterpret his motives Whatever his opinion of her conduct might be he did not rely on it as affording his only justification for leaving her Setting personal feeling aside he felt religious scruples connected with his marriage which left him no other alternative than the separation on which he had resolved He would briefly explain those scruples and mention his authority for entertaining them before he closed his letter There the page was turned down and the explanation was concealed from me A faint color stole over her face as I handed the letter back to her It is needless for you to read the end she said You know under his own hand that he has left me and if such a thing pleads with you in his favor you also know that he is liberal in providing for his deserted wife I attempted to speak She saw in my face how I despised him and stopped me Whatever you may think of his conduct she continued I beg that you will not speak of it to me May I ask your opinion now you have read his letter on another matter in which my own conduct is concerned In former days She paused poor soul in evident confusion and distress Why speak of those days I ventured to say I must speak of them In former days I think you were told that my father s will provided for my mother and for me You know that we have enough to live on I had heard of it at the time of our betrothal when the marriage settlement was in preparation The mother and daughter had each a little income of a few hundreds a year The exact amount had escaped my memory After answering her to this effect I waited to hear more She suddenly became silent the most painful embarrassment showed itself in her face and manner Never mind the rest she said mastering her confusion after an interval I have had some hard trials to bear I forget things she made an effort to finish the sentence and gave it up and called to the dog to come to her The tears were in her eyes and that was the way she took to hide them from me In general I am not quick at reading the minds of others but I thought I understood Stella Now that we were face to face the impulse to trust me had for the moment got the better of her caution and her pride she was half ashamed of it half inclined to follow it I hesitated no longer The time for which I had waited the time to prove without any indelicacy on my side that I had never been unworthy of her had surely come at last Do you remember my reply to your letter about Father Benwell I asked Yes every word of it I promised if you ever had need of me to prove that I had never been unworthy of your confidence In your present situation I can honorably keep my promise Shall I wait till you are calmer or shall I go on at once At once When your mother and your friends took you from me I resumed if you had shown any hesitation She shuddered The image of my unhappy wife vindictively confronting us on the church steps seemed to be recalled to her memory Don t go back to it she cried Spare me I entreat you I opened the writing case in which I keep the papers sent to me by the Rector of Belhaven and placed them on the table by which she was sitting The more plainly and briefly I spoke now the better I thought it might be for both of us Since we parted at Brussels I said my wife has died Here is a copy of the medical certificate of her death Stella refused to look at it I don t understand such things she answered faintly What is this She took up my wife s death bed confession Read it I said She looked frightened What will it tell me she asked It will tell you Stella that false appearances once led you into wronging an innocent man Having said this I walked away to a window behind her at the further end of the room so that she might not see me while she read After a time how much longer it seemed to be than it really was I heard her move As I turned from the window she ran to me and fell on her knees at my feet I tried to raise her I entreated her to believe that she was forgiven She seized my hands and held them over her face they were wet with her tears I am ashamed to look at you she said Oh Bernard what a wretch I have been I never was so distressed in my life I don t know what I should have said what I should have done if my dear old dog had not helped me out of it He too ran up to me with the loving jealousy of his race and tried to lick my hands still fast in Stella s hold His paws were on her shoulder he attempted to push himself between us I think I successfully assumed a tranquillity which I was far from really feeling Come come I said you mustn t make Traveler jealous She let me raise her Ah if she could have kissed me but that was not to be done she kissed the dog s head and then she spoke to me I shall not set down what she said in these pages While I live there is no fear of my forgetting those words I led her back to her chair The letter addressed to me by the Rector of Belhaven still lay on the table unread It was of some importance to Stella s complete enlightenment as containing evidence that the confession was genuine But I hesitated for her sake to speak of it just yet Now you know that you have a friend to help and advise you I began No she interposed more than a friend say a brother I said it You had something to ask of me I resumed and you never put the question She understood me I meant to tell you she said that I had written a letter of refusal to mister Romayne s lawyers I have left Ten Acres never to return and I refuse to accept a farthing of mister Romayne s money My mother though she knows that we have enough to live on tells me I have acted with inexcusable pride and folly I wanted to ask if you blame me Bernard as she does I daresay I was inexcusably proud and foolish too It was the second time she had called me by my Christian name since the happy bygone time never to come again Under whatever influence I acted I respected and admired her for that refusal and I owned it in so many words This little encouragement seemed to relieve her She was so much calmer that I ventured to speak of the Rector s letter She wouldn t hear of it Oh Bernard have I not learned to trust you yet Put away those papers There is only one thing I want to know Who gave them to you The Rector No How did they reach you then Through Father Benwell She started at that name like a woman electrified I knew it she cried It is the priest who has wrecked my married life and he got his information from those letters before he put them into your hands She waited a while and recovered herself That was the first of the questions I wanted to put to you she said I am answered I ask no more She was surely wrong about Father Benwell I tried to show her why I told her that my reverend friend had put the letters into my hand with the seal which protected them unbroken She laughed disdainfully Did I know him so little as to doubt for a moment that he could break a seal and replace it again This view was entirely new to me I was startled but not convinced I never desert my friends even when they are friends of no very long standing and I still tried to defend Father Benwell The only result was to make her alter her intention of asking me no more questions I innocently roused in her a new curiosity She was eager to know how I had first become acquainted with the priest and how he had contrived to possess himself of papers which were intended for my reading only There was but one way of answering her It was far from easy to a man like myself unaccustomed to state circumstances in their proper order but I had no other choice than to reply by telling the long story of the theft and discovery of the Rector s papers So far as Father Benwell was concerned the narrative only confirmed her suspicions For the rest the circumstances which most interested her were the circumstances associated with the French boy Anything connected with that poor creature she said has a dreadful interest for me now Did you know him I asked with some surprise I knew him and his mother you shall hear how at another time I suppose I felt a presentiment that the boy would have some evil influence over me At any rate when I accidentally touched him I trembled as if I had touched a serpent You will think me superstitious but after what you have said it is certainly true that he has been the indirect cause of the misfortune that has fallen on me How came he to steal the papers Did you ask the Rector when you went to Belhaven I asked the Rector nothing But he thought it his duty to tell me all that he knew of the theft She drew her chair nearer to me Let me hear every word of it she pleaded eagerly I felt some reluctance to comply with the request Is it not fit for me to hear she asked This forced me to be plain with her If I repeat what the Rector told me I said I must speak of my wife She took my hand You have pitied and forgiven her she answered Speak of her Bernard and don t for God s sake think that my heart is harder than yours I kissed the hand that she had given to me even her brother might do that It began I said in the grateful attachment which the boy felt for my wife He refused to leave her bedside on the day when she dictated her confession to the Rector As he was entirely ignorant of the English language there seemed to be no objection to letting him have his own way He became inquisitive as the writing went on His questions annoyed the Rector and as the easiest way of satisfying his curiosity my wife told him that she was making her will He knew just enough from what he had heard at various times to associate making a will with gifts of money and the pretended explanation silenced and satisfied him Did the Rector understand it Stella asked Yes Like many other Englishmen in his position although he was not ready at speaking French he could read the language and could fairly well understand it when it was spoken After my wife s death he kindly placed the boy for a few days under the care of his housekeeper Her early life had been passed in the island of Martinique and she was able to communicate with the friendless foreigner in his own language When he disappeared she was the only person who could throw any light on his motive for stealing the papers On the day when he entered the house she caught him peeping through the keyhole of the study door He must have seen where the confession was placed and the color of the old fashioned blue paper on which it was written would help him to identify it The next morning during the Rector s absence he brought the manuscript to the housekeeper and asked her to translate it into French so that he might know how much money was left to him in the will She severely reproved him made him replace the paper in the desk from which he had taken it and threatened to tell the Rector if his misconduct was repeated He promised amendment and the good natured woman believed him On that evening the papers were sealed and locked up In the morning the lock was found broken and the papers and the boy were both missing together Do you think he showed the confession to any other person Stella asked I happen to know that he concealed it from his mother After the housekeeper s reproof I replied he would be cunning enough in my opinion not to run the risk of showing it to strangers It is far more likely that he thought he might learn English enough to read it himself There the subject dropped We were silent for a while She was thinking and I was looking at her On a sudden she raised her head Her eyes rested on me gravely It is very strange she said What is strange I have been thinking of the Lorings They encouraged me to doubt you They advised me to be silent about what happened at Brussels And they too are concerned in my husband s desertion of me He first met Father Benwell at their house Her head drooped again her next words were murmured to herself I am still a young woman she said Oh God what is my future to be This morbid way of thinking distressed me I reminded her that she had dear and devoted friends Not one she answered but you Have you not seen Lady Loring I asked She and her husband have written most kindly inviting me to make their house my home I have no right to blame them they meant well But after what has happened I can t go back to them I am sorry to hear it I said Are you thinking of the Lorings she asked I don t even know the Lorings I can think of nobody but you I was still looking at her and I am afraid my eyes said more than my words If she had doubted it before she must have now known that I was as fond of her as ever She looked distressed rather than confused I made an awkward attempt to set myself right Surely your brother may speak plainly I pleaded She agreed to this But nevertheless she rose to go with a friendly word intended as I hoped to show me that I had got my pardon for that time Will you come and see us to morrow she said Can you forgive my mother as generously as you have forgiven me I will take care Bernard that she does you justice at last She held out her hand to take leave How could I reply If I had been a resolute man I might have remembered that it would be best for me not to see too much of her But I am a poor weak creature I accepted her invitation for the next day January thirty I have just returned from my visit My thoughts are in a state of indescribable conflict and confusion and her mother is the cause of it I wish I had not gone to the house Am I a bad man I wonder and have I only found it out now missus Eyrecourt was alone in the drawing room when I went in Judging by the easy manner in which she got up to receive me the misfortune that has befallen her daughter seemed to have produced no sobering change in this frivolous woman My dear Winterfield she began I have behaved infamously I won t say that appearances were against you at Brussels I will only say I ought not to have trusted to appearances You are the injured person please forgive me Shall we go on with the subject or shall we shake hands and say no more about it I shook hands of course missus Eyrecourt perceived that I was looking for Stella Sit down she said and be good enough to put up with no more attractive society than mine Unless I set things straight my good friend you and my daughter oh with the best intentions will drift into a false position You won t see Stella to day Quite impossible and I will tell you why I am the worldly old mother I don t mind what I say My innocent daughter would die before she would confess what I am going to tell you Can I offer you anything Have you had lunch I begged her to continue She perplexed I am not sure that she did not even alarm me Very well she proceeded You may be surprised to hear it but I don t mean to allow things to go on in this way My contemptible son in law shall return to his wife This startled me and I suppose I showed it Wait a little said missus Eyrecourt There is nothing to be alarmed about Romayne is a weak fool and Father Benwell s greedy hands are of course in both his pockets But he has unless I am entirely mistaken some small sense of shame and some little human feeling still left After the manner in which he has behaved these are the merest possibilities you will say Very likely I have boldly appealed to those possibilities nevertheless He has already gone away to Rome and I need hardly add Father Benwell would take good care of that he has left us no address It doesn t in the least matter One of the advantages of being so much in society as I am is that I have nice acquaintances everywhere always ready to oblige me provided I don t borrow money of them I have written to Romayne under cover to one of my friends living in Rome Wherever he may be there my letter will find him So far I listened quietly enough naturally supposing that missus Eyrecourt trusted to her own arguments and persuasions I confess it even to myself with shame It was a relief to me to feel that the chances with such a fanatic as Romayne were a hundred to one against her This unworthy way of thinking was instantly checked by missus Eyrecourt s next words Don t suppose that I am foolish enough to attempt to reason with him she went on My letter begins and ends on the first page His wife has a claim on him which no newly married man can resist Let me do him justice He knew nothing of it before he went away My letter my daughter has no suspicion that I have written it tells him plainly what the claim is She paused Her eyes softened her voice sank low she became quite unlike the missus Eyrecourt whom I knew In a few months more Winterfield she said my poor Stella will be a mother My letter calls Romayne back to his wife and his child missus Eyrecourt paused evidently expecting me to offer an opinion of some sort For the moment I was really unable to speak Stella s mother never had a very high opinion of my abilities She now appeared to consider me the stupidest person in the circle of her acquaintance Are you a little deaf Winterfield she asked Not that I know of Do you understand me Oh yes Then why can t you say something I want a man s opinion of our prospects Good gracious how you fidget Put yourself in Romayne s place and tell me this If you had left Stella I should never have left her missus Eyrecourt Be quiet You don t know what you would have done I insist on your supposing yourself to be a weak superstitious conceited fanatical fool You understand Now tell me then Could you keep away from your wife when you were called back to her in the name of your firstborn child Could you resist that Most assuredly not I contrived to reply with an appearance of tranquillity It was not very easy to speak with composure Envious selfish contemptible no language is too strong to describe the turn my thoughts now took I never hated any human being as I hated Romayne at that moment Damn him he will come back There was my inmost feeling expressed in words In the meantime missus Eyrecourt was satisfied She dashed at the next subject as fluent and as confident as ever Now Winterfield it is surely plain to your mind that you must not see Stella again except when I am present to tie the tongue of scandal My daughter s conduct must not allow her husband if you only knew how I detest that man must not I say allow her husband the slightest excuse for keeping away from her If we give that odious old Jesuit the chance he will make a priest of Romayne before we know where we are The audacity of these Papists is really beyond belief You remember how they made Bishops and Archbishops here in flat defiance of our laws Father Benwell follows that example and sets our other laws at defiance I mean our marriage laws I am so indignant I can t express myself as clearly as usual Did Stella tell you that he actually shook Romayne s belief in his own marriage Ah I understand she kept that to herself poor dear and with good reason too I thought of the turned down page in the letter missus Eyrecourt readily revealed what her daughter s delicacy had forbidden me to read including the monstrous assumption which connected my marriage before the registrar with her son in law s scruples Yes she proceeded these Catholics are all alike My daughter I don t mean my sweet Stella I mean the unnatural creature in the nunnery sets herself above her own mother Did I ever tell you she was impudent enough to say she would pray for me Father Benwell and the Papal Aggression over again Now tell me Winterfield don t you think taking the circumstances into consideration that you will act like a thoroughly sensible man if you go back to Devonshire while we are in our present situation What with foot warmers in the carriage and newspapers and magazines to amuse you it isn t such a very long journey And then Beaupark dear Beaupark is such a remarkably comfortable house in the winter and you you enviable creature are such a popular man in the neighborhood Oh go back go back I got up and took my hat She patted me on the shoulder I could have throttled her at that moment And yet she was right You will make my excuses to Stella I said You dear good fellow I will do more than make your excuses I will sing your praises as the poet says In her ungovernable exultation at having got rid of me she burst into extravagant language I feel like a mother to you she went on as we shook hands at parting I declare I could almost let you kiss me There was not a single kissable place about missus Eyrecourt unpainted undyed or unpowdered I resisted temptation and opened the door There was still one last request that I could not help making Will you let me know I said when you hear from Rome With the greatest pleasure missus Eyrecourt answered briskly Good by you best of friends good by I write these lines while the servant is packing my portmanteau Traveler knows what that means My dog is glad at any rate to get away from London I think I shall hire a yacht and try what a voyage round the world will do for me I wish to God I had never seen Stella Second Extract Beaupark February ten News at last from missus Eyrecourt Romayne has not even read the letter that she addressed to him it has actually been returned to her by Father Benwell missus Eyrecourt writes naturally enough in a state of fury Her one consolation under this insulting treatment is that her daughter knows nothing of the circumstances She warns me quite needlessly to keep the secret and sends me a copy of Father Benwell s letter Dear Madam mister Romayne can read nothing that diverts his attention from his preparation for the priesthood or that recalls past associations with errors which he has renounced forever When a letter reaches him it is his wise custom to look at the signature first He has handed your letter to me unread with a request that I will return it to you In his presence I instantly sealed it up Neither he nor I know or wish to know on what subject you have addressed him We respectfully advise you not to write again This is really too bad but it has one advantage so far as I am concerned It sets my own unworthy doubts and jealousies before me in a baser light than ever How honestly I defended Father Benwell and how completely he has deceived me I wonder whether I shall live long enough to see the Jesuit caught in one of his own traps eleventh I was disappointed at not hearing from Stella yesterday This morning has made amends it has brought me a letter from her She is not well and her mother s conduct sadly perplexes her At one time missus Eyrecourt s sense of injury urges her to indulge in violent measures she is eager to place her deserted daughter under the protection of the law to insist on a restitution of conjugal rights or on a judicial separation At another time she sinks into a state of abject depression declares that it is impossible for her in Stella s deplorable situation to face society and recommends immediate retirement to some place on the Continent in which they can live cheaply This latter suggestion Stella is not only ready but eager to adopt She proves it by asking for my advice in a postscript no doubt remembering the happy days when I courted her in Paris and the many foreign friends of mine who called at our hotel The postscript gave me the excuse that I wanted I knew perfectly well that it would be better for me not to see her and I went to London for the sole purpose of seeing her by the first train London February twelve I found mother and daughter together in the drawing room It was one of missus Eyrecourt s days of depression Her little twinkling eyes tried to cast on me a look of tragic reproach she shook her dyed head and said Oh Winterfield I didn t think you would have done this Stella fetch me my smelling bottle But Stella refused to take the hint She almost brought the tears into my eyes she received me so kindly If her mother had not been in the room but her mother was in the room I had no other choice than to enter on my business as if I had been the family lawyer missus Eyrecourt began by reproving Stella for asking my advice and then assured me that she had no intention of leaving London How am I to get rid of my house she asked irritably enough I knew that her house as she called it was the furnished upper part of a house belonging to another person and that she could leave it at a short notice But I said nothing I addressed myself to Stella I have been thinking of two or three places which you might like I went on The nearest place belongs to an old French gentleman and his wife They have no children and they don t let lodgings but I believe they would be glad to receive friends of mine if their spare rooms are not already occupied They live at saint Germain close to Paris I looked at missus Eyrecourt as I said those last words I was as sly as Father Benwell himself Paris justified my confidence the temptation was too much for her She not only gave way but actually mentioned the amount of rent which she could afford to pay Stella whispered her thanks to me as I went out My name is not mentioned but my misfortune is alluded to in the newspapers she said Well meaning friends are calling and condoling with me already I shall die if you don t help me to get away among strangers I start for Paris by the mail train to night Paris February thirteen It is evening I have just returned from saint Germain Everything is settled with more slyness on my part I begin to think I am a born Jesuit there must have been some detestable sympathy between Father Benwell and me My good friends Monsieur and Madame Villeray will be only too glad to receive English ladies known to me for many years The spacious and handsome first floor of their house inherited from once wealthy ancestors by Madame Villeray can be got ready to receive missus Eyrecourt and her daughter in a week s time Our one difficulty related to the question of money Monsieur Villeray living on a Government pension was modestly unwilling to ask terms and I was too absolutely ignorant of the subject to be of the slightest assistance to him It ended in our appealing to a house agent at saint Germain His estimate appeared to me to be quite reasonable But it exceeded the pecuniary limit mentioned by missus Eyrecourt I had known the Villerays long enough to be in no danger of offending them by proposing a secret arrangement which permitted me to pay the difference So that difficulty was got over in due course of time We went into the large garden at the back of the house and there I committed another act of duplicity In a nice sheltered corner I discovered one of those essentially French buildings called a pavilion a delightful little toy house of three rooms Another private arrangement made me the tenant of this place Madame Villeray smiled I bet you she said to me in her very best English one of these ladies is in her fascinating first youth The good lady little knows what a hopeless love affair mine is I must see Stella sometimes I ask and hope for no more Never have I felt how lonely my life is as I feel it now Third Extract London March one Stella and her mother have set forth on their journey to saint Germain this morning without allowing me as I had hoped and planned to be their escort missus Eyrecourt set up the old objection of the claims of propriety If that were the only obstacle in my way I should have set it aside by following them to France Where is the impropriety of my seeing Stella as her friend and brother especially when I don t live in the same house with her and when she has her mother on one side and Madame Villeray on the other to take care of her No the influence that keeps me away from saint Germain is the influence of Stella herself I will write to you often she said but I beg you for my sake not to accompany us to France Her look and tone reduced me to obedience Stupid as I am I think after what passed between me and her mother I can guess what she meant Am I never to see you again I asked Do you think I am hard and ungrateful she answered Do you doubt that I shall be glad more than glad to see you when She turned away from me and said no more It was time to take leave We were under her mother s superintendence we shook hands and that was all Matilda missus Eyrecourt s maid followed me downstairs to open the door I suppose I looked as I felt wretchedly enough The good creature tried to cheer me Don t be anxious about them she said I am used to traveling sir and I ll take care of them She is a woman to be thoroughly depended on a faithful and attached servant I made her a little present at parting and I asked her if she would write to me from time to time Some people might consider this to be rather an undignified proceeding on my part I can only say it came naturally to me I am not a dignified man and when a person means kindly toward me I don t ask myself whether that person is higher or lower richer or poorer than I am We are to my mind on the same level when the same sympathy unites us Matilda was sufficiently acquainted with all that had passed to foresee as I did that there would be certain reservations in Stella s letters to me You shall have the whole truth from Me sir don t doubt it she whispered I believed her When my heart is sore give me a woman for my friend Whether she is lady or lady s maid she is equally precious to me Cowes March two I am in treaty with an agent for the hire of a yacht I must do something and go somewhere Returning to Beaupark is out of the question People with tranquil minds can find pleasure in the society of their country neighbors I am a miserable creature with a mind in a state of incessant disturbance Excellent fathers of families talking politics to me exemplary mothers of families offering me matrimonial opportunities with their daughters that is what society means if I go back to Devonshire No I will go for a cruise in the Mediterranean and I will take one friend with me whose company I never weary of my dog The vessel is discovered a fine schooner of three hundred tons just returned from a cruise to Madeira The sailing master and crew only ask for a few days on shore In that time the surveyor will have examined the vessel and the stores will be on board March three I have written to Stella with a list of addresses at which letters will reach me and I have sent another list to my faithful ally the maid When we leave Gibraltar our course will be to Naples thence to Civita Vecchia Leghorn Genoa Marseilles From any of those places I am within easy traveling distance of saint Germain March seven At Sea It is half past six in the evening We have just passed the Eddystone Lighthouse with the wind abeam The log registers ten knots an hour Fourth Extract Naples May ten The fair promise at the beginning of my voyage has not been fulfilled Owing to contrary winds storms and delays at Cadiz in repairing damages we have only arrived at Naples this evening Under trying circumstances of all sorts the yacht has behaved admirably A stouter and finer sea boat never was built We are too late to find the post office open I shall send ashore for letters the first thing tomorrow morning My next movements will depend entirely on the news I get from saint Germain If I remain for any length of time in these regions I shall give my crew the holiday they have well earned at Civita Vecchia I am never weary of Rome but I always did and always shall dislike Naples May eleven My plans are completely changed I am annoyed and angry the further I get away from France the better I shall be pleased I have heard from Stella and heard from the maid Both letters inform me that the child is born and that it is a boy Do they expect me to feel any interest in the boy He is my worst enemy before he is out of his long clothes Stella writes kindly enough Not a line in her letter however invites me or holds out the prospect of inviting me to saint Germain She refers to her mother very briefly merely informing me that missus Eyrecourt is well and is already enjoying the gayeties of Paris Three fourths of the letter are occupied with the baby When I wrote to her I signed myself yours affectionately Stella signs yours sincerely It is a trifle I daresay but I feel it for all that Matilda is faithful to her engagement Matilda s letter tells me the truth Since the birth of the baby she writes missus Romayne has never once mentioned your name she can talk of nothing and think of nothing but her child I make every allowance I hope for a lady in her melancholy situation But I do think it is not very grateful to have quite forgotten mister Winterfield who has done so much for her and who only asks to pass a few hours of his day innocently in her society Perhaps being a single woman I write ignorantly about mothers and babies But I have my feelings and though I never liked mister Romayne I feel for you sir if you will forgive the familiarity In my opinion this new craze about the baby will wear out He is already a cause of difference of opinion My good mistress who possesses knowledge of the world and a kind heart as well advises that mister Romayne should be informed of the birth of a son and heir missus Eyrecourt says most truly that the hateful old priest will get possession of mister Romayne s property to the prejudice of the child unless steps are taken to shame him into doing justice to his own son But missus Romayne is as proud as Lucifer she will not hear of making the first advances as she calls it The man who has deserted me she says has no heart to be touched either by wife or child My mistress does not agree with her There have been hard words already and the nice old French gentleman and his wife try to make peace You will smile when I tell you that they offer sugar plums as a sort of composing gift My mistress accepts the gift and has been to the theater at Paris with Monsieur and Madame Villeray more than once already To conclude sir if I might venture to advise you I should recommend trying the effect on missus R of absence and silence A most sensibly written letter I shall certainly take Matilda s advice My name is never mentioned by Stella and not a day has passed without my thinking of her Well I suppose a man can harden his heart if he likes Let me harden my heart and forget her The crew shall have three days ashore at Naples and then we sail for Alexandria In that port the yacht will wait my return I have not yet visited the cataracts of the Nile I have not yet seen the magnificent mouse colored women of Nubia A tent in the desert and a dusky daughter of Nature to keep house for me there is a new life for a man who is weary of the vapid civilization of Europe I shall begin by letting my beard grow Fifth Extract Civita Vecchia February twenty eight eighteen sixty three Back again on the coast of Italy after an absence at sea and ashore of nine months What have my travels done for me They have made me browner and thinner they have given me a more patient mind and a taste for mild tobacco Have they helped me to forget Stella Not the least in the world I am more eager than ever to see her again When I look back at my diary I am really ashamed of my own fretfulness and impatience What miserable vanity on my part to expect her to think of me when she was absorbed in the first cares and joys of maternity especially sacred to her poor soul as the one consolation of her melancholy life I withdraw all that I wrote about her and from the bottom of my heart I forgive the baby Rome March one I have found my letters waiting for me at the office of my banker The latest news from saint Germain is all that I could wish In acknowledging the receipt of my last letter from Cairo I broke my rash vow of silence when we got into port after leaving Naples Stella sends me the long desired invitation Pray take care to return to us dear Bernard before the first anniversary of my boy s birthday on the twenty seventh of March After those words she need feel no apprehension of my being late at my appointment Traveler the dog has well merited his name by this time will have to bid good by to the yacht which he loves and journey homeward by the railway which he hates No more risk of storms and delays for me Good by to the sea for one while I have sent the news of my safe return from the East by telegraph But I must not be in too great a hurry to leave Rome or I shall commit a serious error I shall disappoint Stella s mother missus Eyrecourt writes to me earnestly requesting if I return by way of Italy that I will get her some information about Romayne She is eager to know whether they have made him a priest yet I am also to discover if I can what are his prospects whether he is as miserable as he deserves to be whether he has been disappointed in his expectations and is likely to be brought back to his senses in that way and above all whether Father Benwell is still at Rome with him My idea is that missus Eyrecourt has not given up her design of making Romayne acquainted with the birth of his son The right person to apply to for information is evidently my banker He has been a resident in Rome for twenty years but he is too busy a man to be approached by an idler like myself in business hours I have asked him to dine with me to morrow March two My guest has just left me I am afraid missus Eyrecourt will be sadly disappointed when she hears what I have to tell her The moment I mentioned Romayne s name the banker looked at me with an expression of surprise The man most talked about in Rome he said I wonder you have not heard of him already Is he a priest Certainly And what is more the ordinary preparations for the priesthood were expressly shortened by high authority on his account The Pope takes the greatest interest in him and as for the people the Italians have already nicknamed him the young cardinal Don t suppose as some of our countrymen do that he is indebted to his wealth for the high position which he has already attained His wealth is only one of the minor influences in his favor The truth is he unites in himself two opposite qualities both of the greatest value to the Church which are very rarely found combined in the same man He has already made a popular reputation here as a most eloquent and convincing preacher A preacher I exclaimed And a popular reputation How do the Italians understand him The banker looked puzzled Why shouldn t they understand a man who addresses them in their own language he said Romayne could speak Italian when he came here and since that time he has learned by constant practice to think in Italian While our Roman season lasts he preaches alternately in Italian and in English But I was speaking of the two opposite accomplishments which this remarkable man possesses Out of the pulpit he is capable of applying his mind successfully to the political necessities of the Church As I am told his intellect has had severe practical training by means of historical studies in the past years of his life Anyhow in one of the diplomatic difficulties here between the Church and the State he wrote a memorial on the subject which the Cardinal Secretary declared to be a model of ability in applying the experience of the past to the need of the present time If he doesn t wear himself out his Italian nickname may prove prophetically true We may live to see the new convert Cardinal Romayne Are you acquainted with him yourself I asked No Englishman is acquainted with him the banker answered There is a report of some romantic event in his life which has led to his leaving England and which makes him recoil from intercourse with his own nation Whether this is true or false it is certain that the English in Rome find him unapproachable I have even heard that he refuses to receive letters from England If you wish to see him you must do what I have done you must go to church and look at him in the pulpit He preaches in English I think for the last time this season on Thursday evening next Shall I call here and take you to the church If I had followed my inclinations I should have refused I feel no sort of interest in Romayne I might even say I feel a downright antipathy toward him But I have no wish to appear insensible to the banker s kindness and my reception at saint Germain depends greatly on the attention I show to missus Eyrecourt s request So it was arranged that I should hear the great preacher with a mental reservation on my part which contemplated my departure from the church before the end of his sermon But before I see him I feel assured of one thing especially after what the banker has told me Stella s view of his character is the right one The man who has deserted her has no heart to be touched by wife or child They are separated forever March three I have just seen the landlord of the hotel he can help me to answer one of missus Eyrecourt s questions A nephew of his holds some employment at the Jesuit headquarters here adjoining their famous church Il Gesu I have requested the young man to ascertain if Father Benwell is still in Rome without mentioning me It would be no small trial to my self control if we met in the street March four Good news this time for missus Eyrecourt as far as it goes Father Benwell has long since left Rome and has returned to his regular duties in England If he exercises any further influence over Romayne it must be done by letter March five I have returned from Romayne s sermon This double renegade has he not deserted his religion and his wife has failed to convince my reason But he has so completely upset my nerves that I ordered a bottle of champagne to the great amusement of my friend the banker the moment we got back to the hotel We drove through the scantily lighted streets of Rome to a small church in the neighborhood of the Piazza Navona To a more imaginative man than myself the scene when we entered the building would have been too impressive to be described in words though it might perhaps have been painted The one light in the place glimmered mysteriously from a great wax candle burning in front of a drapery of black cloth and illuminating dimly a sculptured representation in white marble of the crucified Christ wrought to the size of life In front of this ghastly emblem a platform projected also covered with black cloth We could penetrate no further than to the space just inside the door of the church Everywhere else the building was filled with standing sitting and kneeling figures shadowy and mysterious fading away in far corners into impenetrable gloom The only sounds were the low wailing notes of the organ accompanied at intervals by the muffled thump of fanatic worshipers penitentially beating their breasts On a sudden the organ ceased the self inflicted blows of the penitents were heard no more In the breathless silence that followed a man robed in black mounted the black platform and faced the congregation His hair had become prematurely gray his face was of the ghastly paleness of the great crucifix at his side The light of the candle falling on him as he slowly turned his head cast shadows into the hollows of his cheeks and glittered in his gleaming eyes In tones low and trembling at first he stated the subject of his address A week since two noteworthy persons had died in Rome on the same day One of them was a woman of exemplary piety whose funeral obsequies had been celebrated in that church The other was a criminal charged with homicide under provocation who had died in prison refusing the services of the priest impenitent to the last The sermon followed the spirit of the absolved woman to its eternal reward in heaven and described the meeting with dear ones who had gone before in terms so devout and so touching that the women near us and even some of the men burst into tears Far different was the effect produced when the preacher filled with the same overpowering sincerity of belief which had inspired his description of the joys of heaven traced the downward progress of the lost man from his impenitent death bed to his doom in hell The dreadful superstition of everlasting torment became doubly dreadful in the priest s fervent words He described the retributive voices of the mother and the brother of the murdered man ringing incessantly in the ears of the homicide I who speak to you hear the voices he cried Assassin assassin where are you I see him I see the assassin hurled into his place in the sleepless ranks of the damned I see him dripping with the flames that burn forever writhing under the torments that are without respite and without end The climax of this terrible effort of imagination was reached when he fell on his knees and prayed with sobs and cries of entreaty prayed pointing to the crucifix at his side that he and all who heard him might die the death of penitent sinners absolved in the divinely atoning name of Christ The hysterical shrieks of women rang through the church I could endure it no longer I hurried into the street and breathed again freely when I looked up at the cloudless beauty of the night sky bright with the peaceful radiance of the stars And this man was Romayne I had last met with him among his delightful works of art an enthusiast in literature the hospitable master of a house filled with comforts and luxuries to its remotest corner And now I had seen what Rome had made of him Yes said my companion the Ancient Church not only finds out the men who can best serve it but develops qualities in those men of which they have been themselves unconscious The advance which Roman Catholic Christianity has been and is still making has its intelligible reason Thanks to the great Reformation the papal scandals of past centuries have been atoned for by the exemplary lives of servants of the Church in high places and low places alike If a new Luther arose among us where would he now find abuses sufficiently wicked and widely spread to shock the sense of decency in Christendom He would find them nowhere and he would probably return to the respectable shelter of the Roman sheepfold I listened without making any remark To tell the truth I was thinking of Stella March six I have been to Civita Vecchia to give a little farewell entertainment to the officers and crew before they take the yacht back to England In a few words I said at parting I mentioned that it was my purpose to make an offer for the purchase of the vessel and that my guests should hear from me again on the subject This announcement was received with enthusiasm I really like my crew and I don t think it is vain in me to believe that they return the feeling from the sailing master to the cabin boy My future life after all that has passed is likely to be a roving life unless No I may think sometimes of that happier prospect but I had better not put my thoughts into words I have a fine vessel I have plenty of money and I like the sea There are three good reasons for buying the yacht Returning to Rome in the evening I found waiting for me a letter from Stella She writes immediately on the receipt of my telegram to make a similar request to the request addressed to me by her mother Now that I am at Rome she too wants to hear news of a Jesuit priest He is absent on a foreign mission and his name is Penrose You shall hear what obligations I owe to his kindness she writes when we meet In the meantime I will only say that he is the exact opposite of Father Benwell and that I should be the most ungrateful of women if I did not feel the truest interest in his welfare This is strange and to my mind not satisfactory Who is Penrose and what has he done to deserve such strong expressions of gratitude If anybody had told me that Stella could make a friend of a Jesuit I am afraid I should have returned a rude answer Well I must wait for further enlightenment and apply to the landlord s nephew once more March seven There is small prospect I fear of my being able to appreciate the merits of mister Penrose by personal experience He is thousands of miles away from Europe and he is in a situation of peril which makes the chance of his safe return doubtful in the last degree The Mission to which he is attached was originally destined to find its field of work in Central America Rumors of more fighting to come in that revolutionary part of the world reached Rome before the missionaries had sailed from the port of Leghorn Under these discouraging circumstances the priestly authorities changed the destination of the Mission to the territory of Arizona bordering on New Mexico and recently purchased by the United States Here in the valley of Santa Cruz the Jesuits had first attempted the conversion of the Indian tribes two hundred years since and had failed Their mission house and chapel are now a heap of ruins and the ferocious Apache Indians keep the fertile valley a solitude by the mere terror of their name To this ill omened place Penrose and his companions have made their daring pilgrimage and they are now risking their lives in the attempt to open the hearts of these bloodthirsty savages to the influence of Christianity Nothing has been yet heard of them At the best no trustworthy news is expected for months to come What will Stella say to this Anyhow I begin to understand her interest in Penrose now He is one of a company of heroes I am already anxious to hear more of him To morrow will be a memorable day in my calendar To morrow I leave Rome for saint Germain If any further information is to be gained for missus Eyrecourt and her daughter I have made the necessary arrangements for receiving it The banker has promised to write to me if there is a change in Romayne s life and prospects And my landlord will take care that I hear of it in the event of news reaching Rome from the Mission at Arizona Sixth Extract saint Germain March fourteen I arrived yesterday Between the fatigue of the journey and the pleasurable agitation caused by seeing Stella again I was unfit to make the customary entry in my diary when I retired for the night She is more irresistibly beautiful than ever Her figure a little too slender as I remember it has filled out Her lovely face has lost its haggard careworn look her complexion has recovered its delicacy I see again in her eyes the pure serenity of expression which first fascinated me years since It may be due to the consoling influence of the child assisted perhaps by the lapse of time and the peaceful life which she now leads but this at least is certain such a change for the better I never could have imagined as the change I find in Stella after a year s absence As for the baby he is a bright good humored little fellow and he has one great merit in my estimation he bears no resemblance to his father I saw his mother s features when I first took him on my knee and looked at his face lifted to mine in grave surprise The baby and I are certain to get on well together Even missus Eyrecourt seems to have improved in the French air and under the French diet She has a better surface to lay the paint on her nimble tongue runs faster than ever and she has so completely recovered her good spirits that Monsieur and Madame Villeray declare she must have French blood in her veins They were all so unaffectedly glad to see me Matilda included that it was really like returning to one s home As for Traveler I must interfere in the interests of his figure and his health to prevent everybody in the house from feeding him with every eatable thing from plain bread to pate de foie gras My experience of to day will as Stella tells me be my general experience of the family life at saint Germain We begin the morning with the customary cup of coffee At eleven o clock I am summoned from my pavilion of three rooms to one of those delicious and artfully varied breakfasts which are only to be found in France and in Scotland An interval of about three hours follows during which the child takes his airing and his siesta and his elders occupy themselves as they please At three o clock we all go out with a pony chaise which carries the weaker members of the household for a ramble in the forest At six o clock we assemble at the dinner table At coffee time some of the neighbors drop in for a game at cards At ten we all wish each other good night Such is the domestic programme varied by excursions in the country and by occasional visits to Paris I am naturally a man of quiet stay at home habits It is only when my mind is disturbed that I get restless and feel longings for change Surely the quiet routine at saint Germain ought to be welcome to me now I have been looking forward to this life through a long year of travel What more can I wish for Nothing more of course And yet and yet Stella has innocently made it harder than ever to play the part of her brother The recovery of her beauty is a subject for congratulation to her mother and her friends How does it affect Me I had better not think of my hard fate Can I help thinking of it Can I dismiss from memory the unmerited misfortunes which have taken from me in the prime of her charms the woman whom I love At least I can try The good old moral must be my moral Be content with such things as ye have March fifteen It is eight in the morning and I hardly know how to employ myself Having finished my coffee I have just looked again at my diary It strikes me that I am falling into a bad habit of writing too much about myself The custom of keeping a journal certainly has this drawback it encourages egotism Well the remedy is easy From this date I lock up my book only to open it again when some event has happened which has a claim to be recorded for its own sake As for myself and my feelings they have made their last appearance in these pages Seventh Extract June seven The occasion for opening my diary once more has presented itself this morning News has reached me of Romayne which is too important to be passed over without notice He has been appointed one of the Pope s Chamberlains It is also reported on good authority that he will be attached to a Papal embassy when a vacancy occurs These honors present and to come seem to remove him further than ever from the possibility of a return to his wife and child June eight In regard to Romayne missus Eyrecourt seems to be of my opinion Being in Paris to day at a morning concert she there met with her old friend Doctor Wybrow The famous physician is suffering from overwork and is on his way to Italy for a few months of rest and recreation They took a drive together after the performance in the Bois de Boulogne and missus Eyrecourt opened her mind to the doctor as freely as usual on the subject of Stella and the child He entirely agreed speaking in the future interests of the boy that precious time has been lost in informing Romayne of the birth of an heir and he has promised no matter what obstacles may be placed in his way to make the announcement himself when he reaches Rome June nine Madame Villeray has been speaking to me confidentially on a very delicate subject I am pledged to discontinue writing about myself But in these private pages I may note the substance of what my good friend said to me If I only look back often enough at this little record I may gather the resolution to profit by her advice In brief these were her words Stella has spoken to me in confidence since she met you accidentally in the garden yesterday She cannot be guilty of the poor affectation of concealing what you must have already discovered for yourself But she prefers to say the words that must be said to you through me Her husband s conduct to her is an outrage that she can never forget She now looks back with sentiments of repulsion which she dare not describe to that love at first sight as you call it in England conceived on the day when they first met and she remembers regretfully that other love of years since which was love of steadier and slower growth To her shame she confesses that she failed to set you the example of duty and self restraint when you two happened to be alone yesterday She leaves it to my discretion to tell you that you must see her for the future always in the presence of some other person Make no reference to this when you next meet and understand that she has only spoken to me instead of to her mother because she fears that missus Eyrecourt might use harsh words and distress you again as she once distressed you in England If you will take my advice you will ask permission to go away again on your travels It matters nothing what I said in reply Let me only relate that we were interrupted by the appearance of the nursemaid at the pavilion door She led the child by the hand Among his first efforts at speaking under his mother s instruction had been the effort to call me Uncle Bernard He had now got as far as the first syllable of my Christian name and he had come to me to repeat his lesson Resting his little hands on my knees he looked up at me with his mother s eyes and said Uncle Ber A trifling incident but at that moment it cut me to the heart I could only take the boy in my arms and look at Madame Villeray The good woman felt for me I saw tears in her eyes No no more writing about myself I close the book again Eighth Extract July three A letter has reached missus Eyrecourt this morning from Doctor Wybrow It is dated Castel Gandolpho near Rome Here the doctor is established during the hot months and here he has seen Romayne in attendance on the Holy Father in the famous summer palace of the Popes How he obtained the interview missus Eyrecourt is not informed To a man of his celebrity doors are no doubt opened which remain closed to persons less widely known I have performed my promise he writes and I may say for myself that I spoke with every needful precaution The result a little startled me Romayne was not merely unprepared to hear of the birth of his child he was physically and morally incapable of sustaining the shock of the disclosure For the moment I thought he had been seized with a fit of catalepsy He moved however when I tried to take his hand to feel the pulse shrinking back in his chair and feebly signing to me to leave him I committed him to the care of his servant The next day I received a letter from one of his priestly colleagues informing me that he was slowly recovering after the shock that I had inflicted and requesting me to hold no further communication with him either personally or by letter I wish I could have sent you a more favorable report of my interference in this painful matter Perhaps you or your daughter may hear from him July four nine No letter has been received missus Eyrecourt is uneasy Stella on the contrary seems to be relieved July ten A letter has arrived from London addressed to Stella by Romayne s English lawyers The income which missus Romayne has refused for herself is to be legally settled on her child Technical particulars follow which it is needless to repeat here By return of post Stella has answered the lawyers declaring that so long as she lives and has any influence over her son he shall not touch the offered income missus Eyrecourt Monsieur and Madame Villeray and even Matilda entreated her not to send the letter To my thinking Stella acted with becoming spirit Though there is no entail still Vange Abbey is morally the boy s birthright it is a cruel wrong to offer him anything else July eleven For the second time I have proposed to leave saint Germain The presence of the third person whenever I am in her company is becoming unendurable to me She still uses her influence to defer my departure Nobody sympathizes with me she said but you I am failing to keep my promise to myself not to write about myself But there is some little excuse this time For the relief of my own conscience I may surely place it on record that I have tried to do what is right It is not my fault if I remain at saint Germain insensible to Madame Villeray s warning Ninth Extract September thirteen Terrible news from Rome of the Jesuit Mission to Arizona The Indians have made a night attack on the new mission house The building is burned to the ground and the missionaries have been massacred with the exception of two priests carried away captive The names of the priests are not known News of the atrocity has been delayed four months on its way to Europe owing partly to the civil war in the United States and partly to disturbances in Central America Looking at the Times which we receive regularly at saint Germain I found this statement confirmed in a short paragraph but here also the names of the two prisoners failed to appear Our one present hope of getting any further information seems to me to depend on our English newspaper The Times stands alone as the one public journal which has the whole English nation for volunteer contributors In their troubles at home they appeal to the Editor In their travels abroad over civilized and savage regions alike if they meet with an adventure worth mentioning they tell it to the Editor If any one of our countrymen knows anything of this dreadful massacre I foresee with certainty where we shall find the information in print Soon after my arrival here Stella had told me of her memorable conversation with Penrose in the garden at Ten Acres Lodge I was well acquainted with the nature of her obligation to the young priest but I was not prepared for the outbreak of grief which escaped her when she had read the telegram from Rome She actually went the length of saying I shall never enjoy another happy moment till I know whether Penrose is one of the two living priests The inevitable third person with us this morning was Monsieur Villeray Sitting at the window with a book in his hand sometimes reading sometimes looking at the garden with the eye of a fond horticulturist he discovered a strange cat among his flower beds Forgetful of every other consideration the old gentleman hobbled out to drive away the intruder and left us together I spoke to Stella in words which I would now give everything I possess to recall A detestable jealousy took possession of me I meanly hinted that Penrose could claim no great merit in the matter of Romayne s conversion for yielding to the entreaties of a beautiful woman who had fascinated him though he might be afraid to own it She protested against my unworthy insinuation but she failed to make me ashamed of myself Is a woman ever ignorant of the influence which her beauty exercises over a man I went on like the miserable creature that I was from bad to worse Excuse me I said if I have unintentionally made you angry I ought to have known that I was treading on delicate ground Your interest in Penrose may be due to a warmer motive than a sense of obligation She turned away from me sadly not angrily intending as it appeared to leave the room in silence Arrived at the door she altered her mind and came back Even if you insult me Bernard I am not able to resent it she said very gently I once wronged you I have no right to complain of your now wronging me I will try to forget it She held out her hand She raised her eyes and looked at me It was not her fault I alone am to blame In another moment she was in my arms I held her to my breast I felt the quick beating of her heart on me I poured out the wild confession of my sorrow my shame my love I tasted again and again and again the sweetness of her lips She put her arms round my neck and drew her head back with a long sigh Be merciful to my weakness she whispered We must meet no more She pushed me back from her with a trembling hand and left the room I have broken my resolution not to write about myself but there is no egotism there is a sincere sense of humiliation in me when I record this confession of misconduct I can make but one atonement I must at once leave saint Germain Now when it is too late I feel how hard for me this life of constant repression has been Thus far I had written when the nursemaid brought me a little note addressed in pencil No answer was required The few lines were in Stella s handwriting You must not leave us too suddenly or you may excite my mother s suspicions Wait until you receive letters from England and make them the pretext for your departure S I never thought of her mother She is right Even if she were wrong I must obey her September fourteen The letters from England have arrived One of them presents me with the necessary excuse for my departure ready made My proposal for the purchase of the yacht is accepted The sailing master and crew have refused all offers of engagement and are waiting at Cowes for my orders Here is an absolute necessity for my return to England The newspaper arrived with the letters My anticipations have been realized Yesterday s paragraph has produced another volunteer contributor An Englishman just returned from Central America after traveling in Arizona writes to the Times He publishes his name and address and he declares that he has himself seen the two captive priests The name of this correspondent carries its own guarantee with it He is no less a person than mister Murthwaite the well known traveler in India who discovered the lost diamond called the Moonstone set in the forehead of a Hindoo idol He writes to the editor as follows Sir I can tell you something of the two Jesuit priests who were the sole survivors of the massacre in the Santa Cruz Valley four months since I was traveling at the time in Arizona under the protection of an Apache chief bribed to show me his country and his nation instead of cutting my throat and tearing off my scalp by a present tribute of whisky and gunpowder and by the promise of more when our association came to an end About twelve miles northward of the little silver mining town of Tubac we came upon an Apache encampment I at once discovered two white men among the Indians These were the captive priests One of them was a Frenchman named L Herbier The other was an Englishman named Penrose They owed their lives to the influence of two powerful considerations among the Indians Unhappy L Herbier lost his senses under the horror of the night massacre Insanity as you may have heard is a sacred thing in the estimation of the American savages they regard this poor madman as a mysteriously inspired person The other priest Penrose had been in charge of the mission medicine chest and had successfully treated cases of illness among the Apaches As a great medicine man he too is a privileged person under the strong protection of their interest in their own health The lives of the prisoners are in no danger provided they can endure the hardship of their wandering existence among the Indians Penrose spoke to me with the resignation of a true hero I am in the hands of God he said and if I die I die in God s service I was entirely unprovided with the means of ransoming the missionaries and nothing that I could say or that I could promise had the smallest effect on the savages But for severe and tedious illness I should long since have been on my way back to Arizona with the necessary ransom As it is I am barely strong enough to write this letter But I can head a subscription to pay expenses and I can give instructions to any person who is willing to attempt the deliverance of the priests So the letter ended Before I had read it I was at a loss to know where to go or what to do when I leave saint Germain I am now at no loss I have found an object in life and a means of making atonement to Stella for my own ungracious and unworthy words Already I have communicated by telegraph with mister Murthwaite and with my sailing master The first is informed that I hope to be with him in London to morrow morning The second is instructed to have the yacht fitted out immediately for a long voyage If I can save these men especially Penrose I shall not have lived in vain London September fifteen No I have resolution enough to go to Arizona but I have no courage to record the parting scene when it was time to say good by I had intended to keep the coming enterprise a secret and only to make the disclosure in writing when the vessel was ready to sail But after reading the letter to the Times Stella saw something in my face as I suppose that betrayed me Well it s over now I do my best to keep myself from thinking of it and for this reason I abstain from dwelling on the subject here mister Murthwaite has not only given me valuable instructions he has provided me with letters of introduction to persons in office and to the padres or priests in Mexico which will be of incalculable use in such an expedition as mine In the present disturbed condition of the United States he recommends me to sail for a port on the eastern coast of Mexico and then to travel northward overland and make my first inquiries in Arizona at the town of Tubac Time is of such importance in his opinion that he suggests making inquiries in London and Liverpool for a merchant vessel under immediate sailing orders for Vera Cruz or Tampico The fitting out of the yacht cannot be accomplished I find in less than a fortnight or three weeks I have therefore taken mister Murthwaite s advice September sixteen No favorable answer so far as the port of London is concerned Very little commerce with Mexico and bad harbors in that country when you do trade Such is the report September seventeen A Mexican brig has been discovered at Liverpool under orders for Vera Cruz But the vessel is in debt and the date of departure depends on expected remittances In this state of things I may wait with my conscience at ease to sail in comfort on board my own schooner September eighteen thirty I have settled my affairs I have taken leave of my friends good mister Murthwaite included I have written cheerfully to Stella and I sail from Portsmouth to morrow well provided with the jars of whisky and the kegs of gunpowder which will effect the release of the captives It is strange considering the serious matters I have to think of but it is also true that I feel out of spirits at the prospect of leaving England without my traveling companion the dog I am afraid to take the dear old fellow with me on such a perilous expedition as mine may be Stella takes care of him and if I don t live to return she will never part with him for his master s sake It implies a childish sort of mind I suppose but it is a comfort to me to remember that I have never said a hard word to Traveler and never lifted my hand on him in anger All this about a dog And not a word about Stella Not a word Those thoughts are not to be written I have reached the last page of my diary I shall lock it and leave it in charge of my bankers on my way to the Portsmouth train Shall I ever want a new diary Superstitious people might associate this coming to the end of the book with coming to an end of another kind I have no imagination and I take my leap in the dark hopefully with Byron s glorious lines in my mind Here s a sigh to those who love me And a smile to those that hate And whatever sky s above met Here s heart for every fate An inclosure is inserted here marking a lapse of seven months before the entries in the diary are resumed It consists of two telegrams dispatched respectively on the first and twod of May eighteen sixty four one From Bernard Winterfield Portsmouth England To missus Romayne care of M Villeray saint Germain near Paris Penrose is safe on board my yacht His unfortunate companion has died of exhaustion and he is himself in a feeble state of health I at once take him with me to London for medical advice We are eager for news of you Telegraph to Derwent s Hotel two From missus Eyrecourt saint Germain To Bernard Winterfield Derwent s Hotel London Your telegram received with joy and sent on to Stella in Paris All well But strange events have happened If you cannot come here at once go to Lord Loring He will tell you everything Tenth Extract London twod May eighteen sixty four missus Eyrecourt s telegram reached me just after Doctor Wybrow had paid his first professional visit to Penrose at the hotel I had hardly time to feel relieved by the opinion of the case which he expressed before my mind was upset by missus Eyrecourt Leaving Penrose under the charge of our excellent landlady I hurried away to Lord Loring It was still early in the day his lordship was at home He maddened me with impatience by apologizing at full length for the inexcusable manner in which he had misinterpreted my conduct on the deplorable occasion of the marriage ceremony at Brussels I stopped his flow of words very earnestly spoken it is only right to add and entreated him to tell me in the first place what Stella was doing in Paris Stella is with her husband Lord Loring replied My head turned giddy my heart beat furiously Lord Loring looked at me ran to the luncheon table in the next room and returned with a glass of wine I really don t know whether I drank the wine or not I know I stammered out another inquiry in one word Reconciled I said Yes mister Winterfield reconciled before he dies We were both silent for a while What was he thinking of I don t know What was I thinking of I daren t write it down Lord Loring resumed by expressing some anxiety on the subject of my health I made the best excuse for myself that I could and told him of the rescue of Penrose He had heard of my object in leaving England and heartily congratulated me This will be welcome news indeed he said to Father Benwell Even the name of Father Benwell now excites my distrust Is he in Paris too I inquired He left Paris last night Lord Loring answered and he is now in London on important business as I understand connected with Romayne s affairs I instantly thought of the boy Is Romayne in possession of his faculties I asked In complete possession While justice is in his power has he done justice to his son Lord Loring looked a little confused I have not heard was all he said in reply I was far from satisfied You are one of Romayne s oldest friends I persisted Have you not seen him yourself I have seen him more than once But he has never referred to his affairs Having said this he hastily changed the subject Is there any other information that I can give you he suggested I had still to learn under what circumstances Romayne had left Italy for France and how the event of his illness in Paris had been communicated to his wife Lord Loring had only to draw on his own recollections to enlighten me Lady Loring and I passed the last winter in Rome he said And there we saw Romayne You look surprised Perhaps you are aware that we had offended him by advice which we thought it our duty to offer to Stella before her marriage I was certainly thinking of what Stella had said of the Lorings on the memorable day when she visited me at the hotel Romayne would probably have refused to receive us Lord Loring resumed but for the gratifying circumstance of my having been admitted to an interview with the Pope The Holy Father spoke of him with the most condescending kindness and hearing that I had not yet seen him gave instructions commanding Romayne to present himself Under these circumstances it was impossible for him to refuse to receive Lady Loring and myself on a later occasion I cannot tell you how distressed we were at the sad change for the worse in his personal appearance The Italian physician whom he occasionally consulted told me that there was a weakness in the action of his heart produced in the first instance by excessive study and the excitement of preaching and aggravated by the further drain on his strength due to insufficient nourishment He would eat and drink just enough to keep him alive and no more and he persistently refused to try the good influence of rest and change of scene My wife at a later interview with him when they were alone induced him to throw aside the reserve which he had maintained with me and discovered another cause for the deterioration in his health I don t refer to the return of a nervous misery from which he has suffered at intervals for years past I speak of the effect produced on his mind by the announcement made no doubt with best intentions by Doctor Wybrow of the birth of his child This disclosure he was entirely ignorant of his wife s situation when he left her appears to have affected him far more seriously than the English doctor supposed Lady Loring was so shocked at what he said to her on the subject that she has only repeated it to me with a certain reserve If I could believe I did wrong he said in dedicating myself to the service of the Church after the overthrow of my domestic happiness I should also believe that the birth of this child was the retributive punishment of my sin and the warning of my approaching death I dare not take this view And yet I have it not in me after the solemn vows by which I am bound to place any more consoling interpretation on an event which as a priest it disturbs and humiliates me even to think of That one revelation of his tone of thought will tell you what is the mental state of this unhappy man He gave us little encouragement to continue our friendly intercourse with him It was only when we were thinking of our return to England that we heard of his appointment to the vacant place of first attache to the Embassy at Paris The Pope s paternal anxiety on the subject of Romayne s health had chosen this wise and generous method of obliging him to try a salutary change of air as well as a relaxation from his incessant employments in Rome On the occasion of his departure we met again He looked like a worn out old man We could now only remember his double claim on us as a priest of our religion and as a once dear friend and we arranged to travel with him The weather at the time was mild our progress was made by easy stages We left him at Paris apparently the better for his journey I asked if they had seen Stella on that occasion No said Lord Loring We had reason to doubt whether Stella would be pleased to see us and we felt reluctant to meddle unasked with a matter of extreme delicacy I arranged with the Nuncio whom I have the honor to know that we should receive written information of Romayne s state of health and on that understanding we returned to England A week since our news from the Embassy was so alarming that Lady Loring at once returned to Paris Her first letter informed me that she had felt it her duty to tell Stella of the critical condition of Romayne s health She expressed her sense of my wife s kindness most gratefully and feelingly and at once removed to Paris to be on the spot if her husband expressed a wish to see her The two ladies are now staying at the same hotel I have thus far been detained in London by family affairs But unless I hear of a change for the better before evening I follow Lady Loring to Paris by the mail train It was needless to trespass further on Lord Loring s time I thanked him and returned to Penrose He was sleeping when I got to the hotel On the table in the sitting room I found a telegram waiting for me It had been sent by Stella and it contained these lines I have just returned from his bedside after telling him of the rescue of Penrose He desires to see you There is no positive suffering he is sinking under a complete prostration of the forces of life That is what the doctors tell me They said when I spoke of writing to you Send a telegram there is no time to lose Toward evening Penrose awoke I showed him the telegram Throughout our voyage the prospect of seeing Romayne again had been the uppermost subject in his thoughts In the extremity of his distress he declared that he would accompany me to Paris by the night train Remembering how severely he had felt the fatigue of the short railway journey from Portsmouth I entreated him to let me go alone His devotion to Romayne was not to be reasoned with While we were still vainly trying to convince each other Doctor Wybrow came in To my amazement he sided with Penrose Oh get up by all means he said we will help you to dress We took him out of bed and put on his dressing gown He thanked us and saying he would complete his toilet by himself sat down in an easy chair In another moment he was asleep again so soundly asleep that we put him back in his bed without waking him Doctor Wybrow had foreseen this result he looked at the poor fellow s pale peaceful face with a kindly smile There is the treatment he said that will set our patient on his legs again Sleeping eating and drinking let that be his life for some weeks to come and he will be as good a man as ever If your homeward journey had been by land Penrose would have died on the way I will take care of him while you are in Paris At the station I met Lord Loring He understood that I too had received bad news and gave me a place in the coupe carriage which had been reserved for him We had hardly taken our seats when we saw Father Benwell among the travelers on the platform accompanied by a gray haired gentleman who was a stranger to both of us Lord Loring dislikes strangers Otherwise I might have found myself traveling to Paris with that detestable Jesuit for a companion Paris May three On our arrival at the hotel I was informed that no message had yet been received from the Embassy We found Lady Loring alone at the breakfast table when we had rested after our night journey Romayne still lives she said But his voice has sunk to a whisper and he is unable to breathe if he tries to rest in bed Stella has gone to the Embassy she hopes to see him to day for the second time Only for the second time I exclaimed You forget mister Winterfield that Romayne is a priest He was only consecrated on the customary condition of an absolute separation from his wife On her side never let her know that I told you this Stella signed a formal document sent from Rome asserting that she consented of her own free will to the separation She was relieved from the performance of another formality which I need not mention more particularly by a special dispensation Under these circumstances communicated to me while Stella and I have been together in this house the wife s presence at the bedside of her dying husband is regarded by the other priests at the Embassy as a scandal and a profanation The kind hearted Nuncio is blamed for having exceeded his powers in yielding even under protest to the last wishes of a dying man He is now in communication with Rome waiting for the final instructions which are to guide him Has Romayne seen his child I asked Stella has taken the child with her to day It is doubtful in the last degree whether the poor little boy will be allowed to enter his father s room That complication is even more serious than the other The dying Romayne persists in his resolution to see the child So completely has his way of thinking been altered by the approach of death and by the closing of the brilliant prospect which was before him that he even threatens to recant with his last breath if his wishes are not complied with How it will end I cannot even venture to guess Unless the merciful course taken by the Nuncio is confirmed said Lord Loring it may end in a revival of the protest of the Catholic priests in Germany against the prohibition of marriage to the clergy The movement began in Silesia in eighteen twenty six and was followed by unions or Leagues as we should call them now in Baden Wurtemburg Bavaria and Rhenish Prussia Later still the agitation spread to France and Austria It was only checked by a papal bull issued in eighteen forty seven reiterating the final decision of the famous Council of Trent in favor of the celibacy of the priesthood Few people are aware that this rule has been an institution of slow growth among the clergy of the Church of Rome Even as late as the twelfth century there were still priests who set the prohibition of marriage at defiance I listened as one of the many ignorant persons alluded to by Lord Loring It was with difficulty that I fixed my attention on what he was saying My thoughts wandered to Stella and to the dying man I looked at the clock Lady Loring evidently shared the feeling of suspense that had got possession of me She rose and walked to the window Here is the message she said recognizing her traveling servant as he entered the hotel door The man appeared with a line written on a card I was requested to present the card at the Embassy without delay May four I am only now able to continue my record of the events of yesterday A silent servant received me at the Embassy looked at the card and led the way to an upper floor of the house Arrived at the end of a long passage he opened a door and retired As I crossed the threshold Stella met me She took both my hands in hers and looked at me in silence All that was true and good and noble expressed itself in that look The interval passed and she spoke very sadly very quietly One more work of mercy Bernard Help him to die with a heart at rest She drew back and I approached him He reclined propped up with pillows in a large easy chair it was the one position in which he could still breathe with freedom The ashy shades of death were on his wasted face In the eyes alone as they slowly turned on me there still glimmered the waning light of life One of his arms hung down over the chair the other was clasped round his child sitting on his knee The boy looked at me wonderingly as I stood by his father Romayne signed to me to stoop so that I might hear him Penrose he asked faintly whispering Dear Arthur Not dying like me I quieted that anxiety For a moment there was even the shadow of a smile on his face as I told him of the effort that Penrose had vainly made to be the companion of my journey He asked me by another gesture to bend my ear to him once more My last grateful blessing to Penrose And to you May I not say it You have saved Arthur his eyes turned toward Stella you have been her best friend He paused to recover his feeble breath looking round the large room without a creature in it but ourselves Once more the melancholy shadow of a smile passed over his face and vanished I listened nearer to him still Christ took a child on His knee The priests call themselves ministers of Christ They have left me because of this child here on my knee Wrong wrong wrong Winterfield Death is a great teacher I know how I have erred what I have lost Wife and child How poor and barren all the rest of it looks now He was silent for a while Was he thinking No he seemed to be listening and yet there was no sound in the room Stella anxiously watching him saw the listening expression as I did Her face showed anxiety but no surprise Does it torture you still she asked No he said I have never heard it plainly since I left Rome It has grown fainter and fainter from that time It is not a Voice now It is hardly a whisper my repentance is accepted my release is coming Where is Winterfield She pointed to me I spoke of Rome just now What did Rome remind me of He slowly recovered the lost recollection Tell Winterfield he whispered to Stella what the Nuncio said when he knew that I was going to die The great man reckoned up the dignities that might have been mine if I had lived From my place here in the Embassy Let me say it she gently interposed and spare your strength for better things From your place in the Embassy you would have mounted a step higher to the office of Vice Legate Those duties wisely performed another rise to the Auditorship of the Apostolic Chamber That office filled a last step upward to the highest rank left the rank of a Prince of the Church All vanity said the dying Romayne He looked at his wife and his child The true happiness was waiting for me here And I only know it now Too late Too late He laid his head back on the pillow and closed his weary eyes We thought he was composing himself to sleep Stella tried to relieve him of the boy No he whispered I am only resting my eyes to look at him again We waited The child stared at me in infantine curiosity His mother knelt at his side and whispered in his ear A bright smile irradiated his face his clear brown eyes sparkled he repeated the forgotten lesson of the bygone time and called me once more Uncle Ber Romayne heard it His heavy eyelids opened again No he said Not uncle Something better and dearer Stella give me your hand Still kneeling she obeyed him He slowly raised himself on the chair Take her hand he said to me I too knelt Her hand lay cold in mine After a long interval he spoke to me Bernard Winterfield he said love them and help them when I am gone He laid his weak hand on our hands clasped together May God protect you may God bless you he murmured Kiss me Stella I remember no more As a man I ought to have set a better example I ought to have preserved my self control It was not to be done I turned away from them and burst out crying The minutes passed Many minutes or few minutes I don t know which A soft knock at the door aroused me I dashed away the useless tears Stella had retired to the further end of the room She was sitting by the fireside with the child in her arms I withdrew to the same part of the room keeping far enough away not to disturb them Two strangers came in and placed themselves on either side of Romayne s chair He seemed to recognize them unwillingly From the manner in which they examined him I inferred that they were medical men After a consultation in low tones one of them went out He returned again almost immediately followed by the gray headed gentleman whom I had noticed on the journey to Paris and by Father Benwell The Jesuit s vigilant eyes discovered us instantly in our place near the fireside I thought I saw suspicion as well as surprise in his face But he recovered himself so rapidly that I could not feel sure He bowed to Stella She made no return she looked as if she had not even seen him One of the doctors was an Englishman He said to Father Benwell Whatever your business may be with mister Romayne we advise you to enter on it without delay Shall we leave the room Certainly not Father Benwell answered The more witnesses are present the more relieved I shall feel He turned to his traveling companion Let mister Romayne s lawyer he resumed state what our business is The gray headed gentleman stepped forward Are you able to attend to me sir he asked Romayne reclining in his chair apparently lost to all interest in what was going on heard and answered The weak tones of his voice failed to reach my ear at the other end of the room The lawyer seeming to be satisfied so far put a formal question to the doctors next He inquired if mister Romayne was in full possession of his faculties Both the physicians answered without hesitation in the affirmative Father Benwell added his attestation Throughout mister Romayne s illness he said firmly his mind has been as clear as mine is While this was going on the child had slipped off his mother s lap with the natural restlessness of his age He walked to the fireplace and stopped fascinated by the bright red glow of the embers of burning wood In one corner of the low fender lay a loose little bundle of sticks left there in case the fire might need relighting The boy noticing the bundle took out one of the sticks and threw it experimentally into the grate The flash of flame as the stick caught fire delighted him He went on burning stick after stick The new game kept him quiet his mother was content to be on the watch to see that no harm was done In the meantime the lawyer briefly stated his case You remember mister Romayne that your will was placed for safe keeping in our office he began Father Benwell called upon us and presented an order signed by yourself authorizing him to convey the will from London to Paris The object was to obtain your signature to a codicil which had been considered a necessary addition to secure the validity of the will Are you favoring me with your attention sir Romayne answered by a slight bending of his head His eyes were fixed on the boy still absorbed in throwing his sticks one by one into the fire At the time when your will was executed the lawyer went on Father Benwell obtained your permission to take a copy of it Hearing of your illness he submitted the copy to a high legal authority The written opinion of this competent person declares the clause bequeathing the Vange estate to Father Benwell to be so imperfectly expressed that the will might be made a subject of litigation after the testator s death He has accordingly appended a form of codicil amending the defect and we have added it to the will I thought it my duty as one of your legal advisers to accompany Father Benwell on his return to Paris in charge of the will in case you might feel disposed to make any alteration He looked toward Stella and the child as he completed that sentence The Jesuit s keen eyes took the same direction Shall I read the will sir the lawyer resumed or would you prefer to look at it yourself Romayne held out his hand for the will in silence He was still watching his son There were but few more sticks now left to be thrown in the fire Father Benwell interfered for the first time One word mister Romayne before you examine that document he said The Church receives back from you through me the property which was once its own Beyond that it authorizes and even desires you to make any changes which you or your trusted legal adviser may think right I refer to the clauses of the will which relate to the property you have inherited from the late Lady Berrick and I beg the persons present to bear in memory the few plain words that I have now spoken He bowed with dignity and drew back Even the lawyer was favorably impressed The doctors looked at each other with silent approval For the first time the sad repose of Stella s face was disturbed I could see that it cost her an effort to repress her indignation The one unmoved person was Romayne The sheet of paper on which the will was written lay unregarded upon his lap his eyes were still riveted on the little figure at the fireplace The child had thrown his last stick into the glowing red embers He looked about him for a fresh supply and found nothing His fresh young voice rose high through the silence of the room More he cried More His mother held up a warning finger Hush she whispered He shrank away from her as she tried to take him on her knee and looked across the room at his father More he burst out louder than ever Romayne beckoned to me and pointed to the boy I led him across the room He was quite willing to go with me he reiterated his petition standing at his father s knees Lift him to me said Romayne I could barely hear the words even his strength to whisper seemed to be fast leaving him He kissed his son with a panting fatigue under that trifling exertion pitiable to see As I placed the boy on his feet again he looked up at his dying father with the one idea still in his mind More papa More Romayne put the will into his hand The child s eyes sparkled Burn he asked eagerly Yes Father Benwell sprang forward with outstretched hands I stopped him He struggled with me I forgot the privilege of the black robe I took him by the throat The boy threw the will into the fire Oh he shouted in high delight and clapped his chubby hands as the bright little blaze flew up the chimney I released the priest In a frenzy of rage and despair he looked round at the persons in the room I take you all to witness he cried this is an act of madness You yourself declared just now said the lawyer that mister Romayne was in perfect possession of his faculties The baffled Jesuit turned furiously on the dying man They looked at each other For one awful moment Romayne s eyes brightened Romayne s voice rallied its power as if life was returning to him Frowning darkly the priest put his question What did you do it for Quietly and firmly the answer came Wife and child The last long drawn sigh rose and fell With those sacred words on his lips Romayne died London sixth May At Stella s request I have returned to Penrose with but one fellow traveler My dear old companion the dog is coiled up fast asleep at my feet while I write these lines Penrose has gained strength enough to keep me company in the sitting room In a few days more he will see Stella again What instructions reached the Embassy from Rome whether Romayne received the last sacrament at the earlier period of his illness we never heard No objection was made when Lord Loring proposed to remove the body to England to be buried in the family vault at Vange Abbey I had undertaken to give the necessary directions for the funeral on my arrival in London Returning to the hotel I met Father Benwell in the street I tried to pass on He deliberately stopped me How is missus Romayne he asked with that infernal suavity which he seems always to have at command Fairly well I hope And the boy Ah he little thought how he was changing his prospects for the better when he made that blaze in the fire Pardon me mister Winterfield you don t seem to be quite so cordial as usual Perhaps you are thinking of your inconsiderate assault on my throat Let us forgive and forget Or perhaps you object to my having converted poor Romayne and to my being ready to accept from him the restoration of the property of the Church In both cases I only did my duty as a priest You are a liberal minded man Surely I deserve a favorable construction of my conduct I really could not endure this I have my own opinion of what you deserve I answered Don t provoke me to mention it He eyed me with a sinister smile I am not so old as I look he said I may live another twenty years Well I asked Well he answered much may happen in twenty years With that he left me If he means any further mischief I can tell him this he will find Me in his way To turn to a more pleasant subject Reflecting on all that had passed at my memorable interview with Romayne I felt some surprise that one of the persons present had made no effort to prevent the burning of the will It was not to be expected of Stella or of the doctors who had no interest in the matter but I was unable to understand the passive position maintained by the lawyer He enlightened my ignorance in two words The Vange property and the Berrick property were both absolutely at the disposal of mister Romayne he said If he died without leaving a will he knew enough of the law to foresee that houses lands and money would go to his nearest of kin In plainer words his widow and his son When Penrose can travel he accompanies me to Beaupark Stella and her little son and missus Eyrecourt will be the only other guests in my house Time must pass and the boy will be older before I may remind Stella of Romayne s last wishes on that sad morning when we two knelt on either side of him In the meanwhile it is almost happiness enough for me to look forward to the day NOTE The next leaf of the Diary is missing By some accident a manuscript page has got into its place bearing a later date and containing elaborate instructions for executing a design for a wedding dress The handwriting has since been acknowledged as her own by no less a person than missus Eyrecourt End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Black Robe by Wilkie
