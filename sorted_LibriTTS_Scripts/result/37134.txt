1618-32399-0000	train-other-500	Follow this rule whatever the final consonant Thus write Charles s friend Burns s poems the witch s malice
1618-32399-0001	train-other-500	This is the usage of the United States Government Printing Office and of the Oxford University Press Exceptions
1618-32399-0002	train-other-500	are the possessive of ancient proper names
none	none	 in es and is the possessive Jesus 
1618-32399-0003	train-other-500	and such forms as for conscience sake
1618-32399-0004	train-other-500	for righteousness sake
1618-32399-0005	train-other-500	But such forms as Achilles heel Moses laws Isis temple are commonly replaced by the heel of Achilles the laws of Moses
1618-32399-0006	train-other-500	the temple of Isis The pronominal possessives hers its theirs yours and oneself have no apostrophe two
none	none	 In a series of three or more terms 
1618-32399-0007	train-other-500	with a single conjunction use a comma after each term except the last Thus write
none	none	 red white and blue gold silver or copper He opened the letter read it 
1618-32399-0008	train-other-500	and made a note of its contents This is also the usage of the Government Printing Office and of the Oxford University Press In the names of business firms
1618-32399-0009	train-other-500	the last comma is omitted as
none	none	 Brown Shipley company three Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas The best way to see a country 
1618-32399-0011	train-other-500	unless you are pressed for time is
none	none	 to travel on foot 
1618-32399-0012	train-other-500	This rule is difficult to apply it is frequently hard to decide whether a single word such as however or a brief phrase
1618-32399-0013	train-other-500	is or is not parenthetic If the interruption to the flow of the sentence is but slight the writer may safely omit the commas
1618-32399-0014	train-other-500	But whether the interruption be slight or considerable
none	none	 he must never insert one comma and omit the other 
1618-32399-0015	train-other-500	Such punctuation as
none	none	 Marjorie s husband 
1618-32399-0016	train-other-500	Colonel Nelson paid us a visit yesterday
none	none	 or My brother you will be pleased to hear is now in perfect health is indefensible If a parenthetic expression is preceded by a conjunction place the first comma before the conjunction not after it He saw us coming and unaware that we had learned of his treachery greeted us with a smile Always to be regarded as parenthetic and to be enclosed between commas or at the end of the sentence between comma and period are the following one the year when forming part of a date and the day of the month when following the day of the week February to July nineteen sixteen April six nineteen seventeen Monday November eleven nineteen eighteen two the abbreviations etc and jr three non restrictive relative clauses that is those which do not serve to identify or define the antecedent noun and similar clauses introduced by conjunctions indicating time or place The audience which had at first been indifferent became more and more interested In this sentence the clause introduced by which does not serve to tell which of several possible audiences is meant what audience is in question is supposed to be already known The clause adds parenthetically a statement supplementing that in the main clause The sentence is virtually a combination of two statements which might have been made independently The audience had at first been indifferent It became more and more interested Compare the restrictive relative clause not set off by commas in the sentence The candidate who best meets these requirements will obtain the place Here the clause introduced by who does serve to tell which of several possible candidates is meant the sentence cannot be split up into two independent statements The difference in punctuation in the two sentences following is based on the same principle Nether Stowey where Coleridge wrote The Rime of the Ancient Mariner is a few miles from Bridgewater The day will come when you will admit your mistake Nether Stowey is completely identified by its name the statement about Coleridge is therefore supplementary and parenthetic The day spoken of is identified only by the dependent clause which is therefore restrictive Similar in principle to the enclosing of parenthetic expressions between commas is the setting off by commas of phrases or dependent clauses preceding or following the main clause of a sentence Partly by hard fighting partly by diplomatic skill they enlarged their dominions to the east and rose to royal rank with the possession of Sicily exchanged afterwards for Sardinia Other illustrations may be found in sentences quoted under Rules four five six seven sixteen and eighteen The writer should be careful not to set off independent clauses by commas see under Rule five four Place a comma before a conjunction introducing a company ordinate clause The early records of the city have disappeared and 
1618-32399-0021	train-other-500	the story of its first years can no longer be reconstructed
1618-32399-0023	train-other-500	the story of its first years can no longer be reconstructed
1618-32399-0017	train-other-500	can no longer be reconstructed
none	none	 The situation is perilous but there is still one chance of escape 
1618-32399-0018	train-other-500	Sentences of this type isolated from their context may seem to be in need of rewriting As they make complete sense when the comma is reached the second clause
1618-32399-0019	train-other-500	has the appearance of an afterthought Further and is the least specific of connectives Used between independent clauses it indicates only
1618-32399-0020	train-other-500	that a relation exists between them without defining that relation In the example above the relation is that of cause and result The two sentences might be rewritten
none	none	 As the early records of the city have disappeared the story of its first years can no longer be reconstructed Although the situation is perilous 
1618-32399-0022	train-other-500	there is still one chance of escape Or the subordinate clauses might be replaced by phrases Owing to the disappearance of the early records of the city
none	none	 the story of its first years can no longer be reconstructed In this perilous situation 
1618-32399-0024	train-other-500	there is still one chance of escape But a writer may err
none	none	 by making his sentences too uniformly compact and periodic 
1618-32399-0025	train-other-500	and an occasional loose sentence prevents the style from becoming too formal and gives the reader a certain relief Consequently loose sentences of the type first quoted
1618-32399-0026	train-other-500	are common in easy unstudied writing But a writer should be careful not to construct too many of his sentences after this pattern see Rule fourteen
1618-32399-0027	train-other-500	Two part sentences of which the second member is introduced by as in the sense of because for or nor and while in the sense of
1618-32399-0028	train-other-500	and at the same time likewise require a comma
none	none	 before the conjunction If the second member is introduced by an adverb a semicolon not a comma is required see Rule five The connectives so and yet may be used either as adverbs or as conjunctions accordingly as the second clause is felt to be company ordinate or subordinate consequently either mark of punctuation may be justified But these uses of so equivalent to accordingly or to so that are somewhat colloquial and should as a rule be avoided in writing A simple correction usually serviceable is to omit the word so and begin the first clause with as or since I had never been in the place before so I had difficulty in finding my way about As I had never been in the place before I had difficulty in finding my way about If a dependent clause or an introductory phrase requiring to be set off by a comma precedes the second independent clause no comma is needed after the conjunction The situation is perilous but if we are prepared to act promptly there is still one chance of escape When the subject is the same for both clauses and is expressed only once a comma is required if the connective is but If the connective is and the comma should be omitted if the relation between the two statements is close or immediate I have heard his arguments but am still unconvinced He has had several years experience and is thoroughly competent five Do not join independent clauses by a comma If two or more clauses grammatically complete and not joined by a conjunction are to form a single compound sentence the proper mark of punctuation is a semicolon Stevenson s romances are entertaining they are full of exciting adventures It is nearly half past five we cannot reach town before dark It is of course equally correct to write the above as two sentences each replacing the semicolons by periods Stevenson s romances are entertaining They are full of exciting adventures It is nearly half past five We cannot reach town before dark If a conjunction is inserted the proper mark is a comma Rule four Stevenson s romances are entertaining for they are full of exciting adventures It is nearly half past five and we cannot reach town before dark A comparison of the three forms given above will show clearly the advantage of the first It is at least in the examples given better than the second form because it suggests the close relationship between the two statements in a way that the second does not attempt and better than the third because briefer and therefore more forcible Indeed it may be said that this simple method of indicating relationship between statements is one of the most useful devices of composition The relationship as above is commonly one of cause or of consequence Note that if the second clause is preceded by an adverb such as accordingly besides then therefore or thus and not by a conjunction the semicolon is still required Two exceptions to the rule may be admitted If the clauses are very short and are alike in form a comma is usually permissible Man proposes God disposes The gate swung apart the bridge fell the portcullis was drawn up Note that in these examples the relation is not one of cause or consequence Also in the colloquial form of expression I hardly knew him he was so changed a comma not a semicolon is required But this form of expression is inappropriate in writing except in the dialogue of a story or play or perhaps in a familiar letter six Do not break sentences in two In other words do not use periods for commas I met them on a Cunard liner several years ago Coming home from Liverpool to New York He was an interesting talker A man who had traveled all over the world and lived in half a dozen countries In both these examples the first period should be replaced by a comma and the following word begun with a small letter It is permissible to make an emphatic word or expression serve the purpose of a sentence and to punctuate it accordingly Again and again he called out No reply The writer must however be certain that the emphasis is warranted and that he will not be suspected of a mere blunder in syntax or in punctuation Rules three four five and six cover the most important principles in the punctuation of ordinary sentences they should be so thoroughly mastered that their application becomes second nature seven A participial phrase at the beginning of a sentence must refer to the grammatical subject Walking slowly down the road he saw a woman accompanied by two children The word walking refers to the subject of the sentence not to the woman If the writer wishes to make it refer to the woman he must recast the sentence He saw a woman accompanied by two children walking slowly down the road Participial phrases preceded by a conjunction or by a preposition nouns in apposition adjectives and adjective phrases come under the same rule if they begin the sentence On arriving in Chicago his friends met him at the station When he arrived or On his arrival in Chicago his friends met him at the station A soldier of proved valor they entrusted him with the defence of the city A soldier of proved valor he was entrusted with the defence of the city Young and inexperienced the task seemed easy to me Young and inexperienced I thought the task easy Without a friend to counsel him the temptation proved irresistible Without a friend to counsel him he found the temptation irresistible Sentences violating this rule are often ludicrous Being in a dilapidated condition I was able to buy the house very cheap Wondering irresolutely what to do next the clock struck twelve III ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES OF COMPOSITION eight Make the paragraph the unit of composition one paragraph to each topic If the subject on which you are writing is of slight extent or if you intend to treat it very briefly there may be no need of subdividing it into topics Thus a brief description a brief summary of a literary work a brief account of a single incident a narrative merely outlining an action the setting forth of a single idea any one of these is best written in a single paragraph After the paragraph has been written examine it to see whether subdivision will not improve it Ordinarily however a subject requires subdivision into topics each of which should be made the subject of a paragraph The object of treating each topic in a paragraph by itself is of course to aid the reader The beginning of each paragraph is a signal to him that a new step in the development of the subject has been reached The extent of subdivision will vary with the length of the composition For example a short notice of a book or poem might consist of a single paragraph One slightly longer might consist of two paragraphs A Account of the work B Critical discussion A report on a poem written for a class in literature might consist of seven paragraphs A Facts of composition and publication B Kind of poem metrical form C Subject D Treatment of subject E For what chiefly remarkable F Wherein characteristic of the writer G Relationship to other works The contents of paragraphs C and D would vary with the poem Usually paragraph C would indicate the actual or imagined circumstances of the poem the situation if these call for explanation and would then state the subject and outline its development If the poem is a narrative in the third person throughout paragraph C need contain no more than a concise summary of the action Paragraph D would indicate the leading ideas and show how they are made prominent or would indicate what points in the narrative are chiefly emphasized A novel might be discussed under the heads A Setting B Plot C Characters D Purpose An historical event might be discussed under the heads A What led up to the event B Account of the event C What the event led up to In treating either of these last two subjects the writer would probably find it necessary to subdivide one or more of the topics here given As a rule single sentences should not be written or printed as paragraphs An exception may be made of sentences of transition indicating the relation between the parts of an exposition or argument Frequent exceptions are also necessary in textbooks guidebooks and other works in which many topics are treated briefly In dialogue each speech even if only a single word is a paragraph by itself that is a new paragraph begins with each change of speaker The application of this rule when dialogue and narrative are combined is best learned from examples in well printed works of fiction nine As a rule begin each paragraph with a topic sentence end it in conformity with the beginning Again the object is to aid the reader The practice here recommended enables him to discover the purpose of each paragraph as he begins to read it and to retain this purpose in mind as he ends it For this reason the most generally useful kind of paragraph particularly in exposition and argument is that in which a the topic sentence comes at or near the beginning b the succeeding sentences explain or establish or develop the statement made in the topic sentence and c the final sentence either emphasizes the thought of the topic sentence or states some important consequence Ending with a digression or with an unimportant detail is particularly to be avoided If the paragraph forms part of a larger composition its relation to what precedes or its function as a part of the whole may need to be expressed This can sometimes be done by a mere word or phrase again therefore for the same reason in the topic sentence Sometimes however it is expedient to precede the topic sentence by one or more sentences of introduction or transition If more than one such sentence is required it is generally better to set apart the transitional sentences as a separate paragraph According to the writer s purpose he may as indicated above relate the body of the paragraph to the topic sentence in one or more of several different ways He may make the meaning of the topic sentence clearer by restating it in other forms by defining its terms by denying the contrary by giving illustrations or specific instances he may establish it by proofs or he may develop it by showing its implications and consequences In a long paragraph he may carry out several of these processes one Now to be properly enjoyed a walking tour should be gone upon alone two If you go in a company or even in pairs it is no longer a walking tour in anything but name it is something else and more in the nature of a picnic three A walking tour should be gone upon alone because freedom is of the essence because you should be able to stop and go on and follow this way or that as the freak takes you and because you must have your own pace and neither trot alongside a champion walker nor mince in time with a girl four And you must be open to all impressions and let your thoughts take colour from what you see five You should be as a pipe for any wind to play upon six I cannot see the wit says Hazlitt of walking and talking at the same time seven When I am in the country I wish to vegetate like the country which is the gist of all that can be said upon the matter eight There should be no cackle of voices at your elbow to jar on the meditative silence of the morning nine And so long as a man is reasoning he cannot surrender himself to that fine intoxication that comes of much motion in the open air that begins in a sort of dazzle and sluggishness of the brain and ends in a peace that passes comprehension Stevenson Walking Tours one Topic sentence two The meaning made clearer by denial of the contrary three The topic sentence repeated in abridged form and supported by three reasons the meaning of the third you must have your own pace made clearer by denying the contrary four A fourth reason stated in two forms five The same reason stated in still another form six seven The same reason as stated by Hazlitt eight Repetition in paraphrase of the quotation from Hazlitt nine Final statement of the fourth reason in language amplified and heightened to form a strong conclusion one It was chiefly in the eighteenth century that a very different conception of history grew up two Historians then came to believe that their task was not so much to paint a picture as to solve a problem to explain or illustrate the successive phases of national growth prosperity and adversity three The history of morals of industry of intellect and of art the changes that take place in manners or beliefs the dominant ideas that prevailed in successive periods the rise fall and modification of political constitutions in a word all the conditions of national well being became the subject of their works four They sought rather to write a history of peoples than a history of kings five They looked especially in history for the chain of causes and effects six They undertook to study in the past the physiology of nations and hoped by applying the experimental method on a large scale to deduce some lessons of real value about the conditions on which the welfare of society mainly depend Lecky The Political Value of History one Topic sentence two The meaning of the topic sentence made clearer the new conception of history defined three The definition expanded four The definition explained by contrast five The definition supplemented another element in the new conception of history six Conclusion an important consequence of the new conception of history In narration and description the paragraph sometimes begins with a concise comprehensive statement serving to hold together the details that follow The breeze served us admirably The campaign opened with a series of reverses The next ten or twelve pages were filled with a curious set of entries But this device if too often used would become a mannerism More commonly the opening sentence simply indicates by its subject with what the paragraph is to be principally concerned At length I thought I might return towards the stockade He picked up the heavy lamp from the table and began to explore Another flight of steps and they emerged on the roof The brief paragraphs of animated narrative however are often without even this semblance of a topic sentence The break between them serves the purpose of a rhetorical pause throwing into prominence some detail of the action ten Use the active voice The active voice is usually more direct and vigorous than the passive I shall always remember my first visit to Boston 
1618-32402-0000	train-other-500	This is much better than My first visit to Boston will always be remembered by me The latter sentence is less direct less bold and less concise
1618-32402-0001	train-other-500	If the writer tries to make it more concise by omitting by me My first visit to Boston will always be remembered it becomes indefinite is it the writer
1618-32402-0002	train-other-500	or some person undisclosed or the world at large that will always remember this visit
none	none	 This rule does not of course mean that the writer should entirely discard the passive voice 
1618-32402-0003	train-other-500	which is frequently convenient and sometimes necessary The dramatists of the Restoration are little esteemed to day
none	none	 Modern readers have little esteem for the dramatists of the Restoration 
1618-32402-0004	train-other-500	The first would be the right form in a paragraph on the dramatists of the Restoration
none	none	 the second in a paragraph on the tastes of modern readers 
1618-32402-0005	train-other-500	The need of making a particular word the subject of the sentence will often as in these examples determine which voice is to be used
none	none	 As a rule avoid making one passive 
1618-32402-0006	train-other-500	depend directly upon another Gold was not allowed to be exported
none	none	 It was forbidden to export gold 
1618-32402-0007	train-other-500	The export of gold was prohibited He has been proved to have been seen entering the building It has been proved that he was seen to enter the building
1618-32402-0008	train-other-500	In both the examples above before correction the word properly related to the second passive is made the subject of the first A common fault
1618-32402-0009	train-other-500	is to use as the subject of a passive construction
none	none	 a noun which expresses the entire action 
1618-32402-0010	train-other-500	leaving to the verb no function beyond that of completing the sentence A survey of this region was made in nineteen hundred This
1618-32402-0011	train-other-500	region was surveyed in nineteen hundred
none	none	 Mobilization of the army was rapidly effected The army was rapidly mobilized Confirmation of these reports cannot be obtained These reports cannot be confirmed Compare the sentence The export of gold was prohibited in which the predicate was prohibited expresses something not implied in export The habitual use of the active voice makes for forcible writing This is true not only in narrative principally concerned with action but in writing of any kind Many a tame sentence of description or exposition can be made lively and emphatic by substituting a verb in the active voice for some such perfunctory expression as there is or could be heard There were a great number of dead leaves lying on the ground Dead leaves covered the ground The sound of a guitar somewhere in the house could be heard Somewhere in the house a guitar hummed sleepily The reason that he left college was that his health became impaired Failing health compelled him to leave college It was not long before he was very sorry that he had said what he had He soon repented his words eleven Put statements in positive form Make definite assertions Avoid tame colorless hesitating non committal language Use the word not as a means of denial or in antithesis never as a means of evasion He was not very often on time 
1618-32402-0012	train-other-500	He usually came late He did not think that studying Latin was much use He thought the study of Latin useless The Taming of the Shrew is rather weak in spots
1618-32402-0013	train-other-500	Shakespeare does not portray Katharine as a very admirable character nor does Bianca remain long in memory as an important character in Shakespeare s works
1618-32402-0014	train-other-500	The women in The Taming of the Shrew are unattractive Katharine is disagreeable Bianca insignificant The last example before correction is indefinite as well as negative
1618-32402-0015	train-other-500	The corrected version consequently is simply a guess at the writer s intention All three examples show the weakness inherent in the word not
1618-32402-0016	train-other-500	Consciously or unconsciously the reader is dissatisfied with being told only what is not he wishes to be told what is Hence as a rule
none	none	 it is better to express even a negative in positive form 
1618-32402-0017	train-other-500	not honest dishonest not important trifling did not remember forgot did not pay any attention to ignored
1618-32402-0018	train-other-500	did not have much confidence in distrusted The antithesis of negative and positive is strong Not charity but simple justice
none	none	 Not that I loved Caesar less but Rome the more Negative words other than not are usually strong The sun never sets upon the British flag twelve Use definite specific concrete language Prefer the specific to the general the definite to the vague the concrete to the abstract A period of unfavorable weather set in It rained every day for a week He showed satisfaction as he took possession of his well earned reward He grinned as he pocketed the coin There is a general agreement among those who have enjoyed the experience that surf riding is productive of great exhilaration All who have tried surf riding agree that it is most exhilarating If those who have studied the art of writing are in accord on any one point it is on this that the surest method of arousing and holding the attention of the reader is by being specific definite and concrete Critics have pointed out how much of the effectiveness of the greatest writers Homer Dante Shakespeare results from their constant definiteness and concreteness Browning to cite a more modern author affords many striking examples Take for instance the lines from My Last Duchess Sir twas all one My favour at her breast The dropping of the daylight in the west The bough of cherries some officious fool Broke in the orchard for her the white mule She rode with round the terrace all and each Would draw from her alike the approving speech Or blush at least and those which end the poem Notice Neptune though Taming a sea horse thought a rarity Which Claus of Innsbruck cast in bronze for me These words call up pictures Recall how in The Bishop Orders his Tomb in saint Praxed s Church the Renaissance spirit its worldliness inconsistency pride hypocrisy ignorance of itself love of art of luxury of good Latin to quote Ruskin s comment on the poem is made manifest in specific details and in concrete terms Prose in particular narrative and descriptive prose is made vivid by the same means If the experiences of Jim Hawkins and of David Balfour of Kim of Nostromo have seemed for the moment real to countless readers if in reading Carlyle we have almost the sense of being physically present at the taking of the Bastille it is because of the definiteness of the details and the concreteness of the terms used It is not that every detail is given that would be impossible as well as to no purpose but that all the significant details are given and not vaguely but with such definiteness that the reader in imagination can project himself into the scene In exposition and in argument the writer must likewise never lose his hold upon the concrete and even when he is dealing with general principles he must give particular instances of their application This superiority of specific expressions is clearly due to the effort required to translate words into thoughts As we do not think in generals but in particulars as whenever any class of things is referred to we represent it to ourselves by calling to mind individual members of it it follows that when an abstract word is used the hearer or reader has to choose from his stock of images one or more by which he may figure to himself the genus mentioned In doing this some delay must arise some force be expended and if by employing a specific term an appropriate image can be at once suggested an economy is achieved and a more vivid impression produced Herbert Spencer from whose Philosophy of Style the preceding paragraph is quoted illustrates the principle by the sentences In proportion as the manners customs and amusements of a nation are cruel and barbarous the regulations of their penal code will be severe In proportion as men delight in battles bull fights and combats of gladiators will they punish by hanging burning and the rack thirteen Omit needless words Vigorous writing is concise 
1618-32402-0019	train-other-500	A sentence should contain no unnecessary words a paragraph no unnecessary sentences for the same reason that a drawing
none	none	 should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts 
1618-32402-0020	train-other-500	This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short
none	none	 or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline but that he make every word tell 
1618-32402-0021	train-other-500	Many expressions in common use violate this principle the question as to whether whether the question whether there is no doubt but that no doubt
1618-32402-0022	train-other-500	doubtless used for fuel purposes used for fuel he is a man who he in a hasty manner hastily this is a subject which
1618-32402-0023	train-other-500	this subject His story is a strange one His story is strange In especial the expression the fact that should be revised out of every sentence in which it occurs

use the present tense In summarizing a poem story or novel he should preferably use the present though he may use the past if he prefers If the summary is in the present tense antecedent action should be expressed by the perfect if in the past by the past perfect An unforeseen chance prevents Friar John from delivering Friar Lawrence s letter to Romeo Meanwhile owing to her father s arbitrary change of the day set for her wedding Juliet has been compelled to drink the potion on Tuesday night with the result that Balthasar informs Romeo of her supposed death before Friar Lawrence learns of the non delivery of the letter But whichever tense be used in the summary a past tense in indirect discourse or in indirect question remains unchanged The Friar confesses that it was he who married them Apart from the exceptions noted whichever tense the writer chooses he should use throughout Shifting from one tense to the other gives the appearance of uncertainty and irresolution compare Rule fifteen In presenting the statements or the thought of some one else as in summarizing an essay or reporting a speech the writer should avoid intercalating such expressions as he said he stated the speaker added the speaker then went on to say the author also thinks or the like He should indicate clearly at the outset once for all that what follows is summary and then waste no words in repeating the notification In notebooks in newspapers in handbooks of literature summaries of one kind or another may be indispensable and for children in primary schools it is a useful exercise to retell a story in their own words But in the criticism or interpretation of literature the writer should be careful to avoid dropping into summary He may find it necessary to devote one or two sentences to indicating the subject or the opening situation of the work he is discussing he may cite numerous details to illustrate its qualities But he should aim to write an orderly discussion supported by evidence not a summary with occasional comment Similarly if the scope of his discussion includes a number of works he will as a rule do better not to take them up singly in chronological order but to aim from the beginning at establishing general conclusions eighteen Place the emphatic words of a sentence at the end The proper place in the sentence for the word or group of words which the writer desires to make most prominent is usually the end Humanity has hardly advanced in fortitude since that time though it has advanced in many other ways Humanity since that time has advanced in many other ways but it has hardly advanced in fortitude This steel is principally used for making razors because of its hardness Because of its hardness this steel is principally used in making razors The word or group of words entitled to this position of prominence is usually the logical predicate that is the new element in the sentence as it is in the second example The effectiveness of the periodic sentence arises from the prominence which it gives to the main statement Four centuries ago Christopher Columbus one of the Italian mariners whom the decline of their own republics had put at the service of the world and of adventure seeking for Spain a westward passage to the Indies as a set off against the achievements of Portuguese discoverers lighted on America With these hopes and in this belief I would urge you laying aside all hindrance thrusting away all private aims to devote yourself unswervingly and unflinchingly to the vigorous and successful prosecution of this war The other prominent position in the sentence is the beginning Any element in the sentence other than the subject may become emphatic when placed first Deceit or treachery he could never forgive So vast and rude fretted by the action of nearly three thousand years the fragments of this architecture may often seem at first sight like works of nature A subject coming first in its sentence may be emphatic but hardly by its position alone In the sentence Great kings worshipped at his shrine the emphasis upon kings arises largely from its meaning and from the context To receive special emphasis the subject of a sentence must take the position of the predicate Through the middle of the valley flowed a winding stream The principle that the proper place for what is to be made most prominent is the end applies equally to the words of a sentence to the sentences of a paragraph and to the paragraphs of a composition IV A FEW MATTERS OF FORM Headings Leave a blank line or its equivalent in space after

Tale of Two Cities V WORDS AND EXPRESSIONS COMMONLY MISUSED Some of the forms here listed as like I did are downright bad English others as the split infinitive have their defenders but are in such general disfavor that it is at least inadvisable to use them still others as case factor feature interesting one of the most are good in their place but are constantly obtruding themselves into places where they have no right to be If the writer will make it his purpose from the beginning to express accurately his own individual thought and will refuse to be satisfied with a ready made formula that saves him the trouble of doing so this last set of expressions will cause him little trouble But if he finds that in a moment of inadvertence he has used one of them his proper course will probably be not to patch up the sentence by substituting one word or set of words for another but to recast it completely as illustrated in a number of examples below and in others under Rules twelve and thirteen All right Idiomatic in familiar speech as a detached phrase in the sense Agreed or Go ahead In other uses better avoided Always written as two words As good or better than Expressions of this type should be corrected by rearranging the sentence My opinion is as good or better than his My opinion is as good as his or better if not better As to whether Whether is sufficient see under Rule thirteen Bid Takes the infinitive without to The past tense in the sense ordered is bade But Unnecessary after doubt and help I have no doubt but that I have no doubt that He could not help see but that He could not help seeing that The too frequent use of but as a conjunction leads to the fault discussed under Rule fourteen A loose sentence formed with but can always be converted into a periodic sentence formed with although as illustrated under Rule four Particularly awkward is the following of one but by another making a contrast to a contrast or a reservation to a reservation This is easily corrected by re arrangement America had vast resources but she seemed almost wholly unprepared for war But within a year she had created an army of four million men America seemed almost

Participle for verbal noun Do you mind me asking a question Do you mind my asking a question There was little prospect of the Senate accepting even this compromise There was little prospect of the Senate s accepting even this compromise In the left hand column asking and accepting are present participles in the right hand column they are verbal nouns gerunds The construction shown in the left hand column is occasionally found and has its defenders Yet it is easy to see that the second sentence has to do not with a prospect of the Senate but with a prospect of accepting In this example at least the construction is plainly illogical As the authors of The King s English point out there are sentences apparently but not really of this type in which the possessive is not called for I cannot imagine Lincoln refusing his assent to this measure In this sentence what the writer cannot imagine is Lincoln himself in the act of refusing his assent Yet the meaning would be virtually the same except for a slight loss of vividness if he had written I cannot imagine Lincoln s refusing his assent to this measure By using the possessive the writer will always be on the safe side In the examples above the subject of the action is a single unmodified term immediately preceding the verbal noun and the construction is as good as any that could be used But in any sentence in which it is a mere clumsy substitute for something simpler or in which the use of the possessive is awkward or impossible should of course be recast In the event of a reconsideration of the whole matter s

such as each each one everybody every one many a man which though implying more than one person requires the pronoun to be in the singular Similar to this but with even less justification is the use

strong in themselves Viewpoint Write point of view but do not misuse this as many do for view or opinion While Avoid the indiscriminate use of this word for and but and although Many writers use it frequently as a substitute for and or but either from a mere desire to vary the connective or from uncertainty which of the two connectives is the more appropriate In this use it is best replaced by a semicolon The office and salesrooms are on the ground floor while the rest of the building is devoted to manufacturing The office and salesrooms are on the ground floor the rest of the building is devoted to manufacturing Its use as a virtual equivalent of although is allowable in sentences where this leads to no ambiguity or absurdity While I admire his energy I wish it were employed in a better cause This is entirely correct as shown by the paraphrase I admire his energy at the same time I wish it were employed in a better cause Compare While the temperature reaches ninety or ninety five degrees in the daytime the nights are often chilly Although the temperature reaches ninety or ninety five degrees in the daytime the nights are often chilly The paraphrase The temperature reaches ninety or ninety five degrees in the daytime at the same time the nights are often chilly shows why the use of while is incorrect In general the writer will do well to use while only with strict literalness in the sense of during the time that Whom Often incorrectly used for who before he said or similar expressions when it is really the subject of a following verb His brother whom he said would send him the money His brother who he said would send him the money The man whom he thought was his friend The man who that he thought was his friend whom he thought his friend Worth while Overworked as a term of vague approval and with not of disapproval Strictly applicable only to actions Is it worth while to telegraph His books are not worth while His books are not worth reading are not worth one s while to read do not repay reading are worthless The use of worth while before a noun a worth while story is indefensible Would A conditional statement in the first person requires should not would I should not have succeeded without his help The equivalent of shall in indirect quotation after a verb in the past tense is should not would He predicted that before long we should have a great surprise To express habitual or repeated action the past tense without would is usually sufficient and from its brevity more emphatic Once a year he would visit the old mansion Once a year he visited the old mansion VI SPELLING The spelling of English words is not fixed and invariable nor does it depend on any other authority than general agreement At the present day there is practically unanimous agreement as to the spelling of most words In the list below for example rime for rhyme is the only allowable variation all the other forms are company extensive with the English language At any given moment however a relatively small number of words may be spelled in more than one way Gradually as a rule one of these forms comes to be generally preferred and the less customary form comes to look obsolete and is discarded From time to time new forms mostly simplifications are introduced by innovators and either win their place or die of neglect The practical objection to unaccepted and over simplified spellings is the disfavor with which they are received by the reader They distract his attention and exhaust his patience He reads the form though automatically without thought of its needless complexity he reads the abbreviation tho and mentally supplies the missing letters at the cost of a fraction of his attention The writer has defeated his own purpose WORDS OFTEN MISSPELLED accidentally advice affect believe benefit challenge coarse course criticize deceive definite describe despise develop disappoint dissipate duel ecstasy effect embarrass existence fascinate fiery formerly humorous hypocrisy immediately impostor incident incidentally latter led lose marriage mischief murmur necessary occurred opportunity parallel Philip playwright preceding prejudice principal principle privilege pursue repetition rhyme rhythm ridiculous sacrilegious seize separate shepherd siege similar simile too tragedy tries undoubtedly until villain Note that a single consonant other than v preceded by a stressed short vowel is doubled before ed and ing planned letting beginning Coming is an exception Write to day to night to morrow but not together with a hyphen Write any one every one some one some time except in the sense of formerly as two words VII EXERCISES ON CHAPTERS II AND III I Punctuate one In seventeen eighty eight the King s advisers warned him that the nation was facing bankruptcy therefore he summoned a body called the States General believing that it would authorize him to levy new taxes The people of France however were suffering from burdensome taxation oppressive social injustice and acute scarcity of food and their representatives refused to consider projects of taxation until social and economic reforms should be granted The King who did not realize the gravity of the situation tried to overawe them collecting soldiers in and about Versailles where the sessions were being held The people of Paris seeing the danger organized militia companies to defend their representatives In order to supply themselves with arms they attacked the Invalides and the Bastille which contained the principal supplies of arms and munitions in Paris two On his first continental tour begun in eighteen oh nine Byron visited Portugal Spain Albania Greece and Turkey Of this tour he composed a poetical journal Childe Harold s Pilgrimage in which he ascribed his experiences and reflections not to himself but to a fictitious character Childe Harold described as a melancholy young nobleman prematurely familiar with evil sated with pleasures and embittered against humanity The substantial merits of the work however lay not in this shadowy and somewhat theatrical figure but in Byron s spirited descriptions of wild or picturesque scenes and in his eloquent championing of Spain and Greece against their oppressors On his return to England in eighteen eleven he was persuaded rather against his own judgment into allowing the work to be published Its success was almost unprecedented in his own words he awoke and found himself famous II Explain the difference in meaning three God save thee ancyent Marinere From the fiends that plague thee thus Lyrical Ballads seventeen ninety eight God save thee ancient Mariner From the fiends that plague thee thus Lyrical Ballads eighteen hundred III Explain and correct the errors in punctuation four This course is intended for Freshmen who in the opinion of the Department are not qualified for military drill five A restaurant not a cafeteria where good meals are served at popular prices Advt six The poets of The Nation for all their intensity of patriotic feeling followed the English rather than the Celtic tradition their work has a political rather than a literary value and bears little upon the development of modern Irish verse seven We were in one of the strangest places imaginable A long and narrow passage overhung on either side by a stupendous barrier of black and threatening rocks eight Only a few years ago after a snow storm in the passes not far north of Jerusalem no less than twenty six Russian pilgrims perished amidst the snow One cannot help thinking largely because they made little attempt to save themselves IV Point out and correct the faults in the following sentences nine During childhood his mother had died ten Any language study is good mind training while acquiring vocabulary eleven My farm consisted of about twenty acres of excellent land having given a hundred pounds for my predecessor s lease twelve Prepared to encounter a woman of disordered mind the appearance presented by missus Taylor at his entrance greatly astonished him thirteen Pale and swooning with two broken legs they carried him into the house fourteen Count Cassini the Russian plenipotentiary had several long and intimate conversations during the tedious weeks of the conference with his British colleague Sir Arthur Nicholson fifteen But though they had been victorious in the land engagements they were so little decisive as to lead to no important results sixteen Knowing nothing of the rules of the college or of its customs it was with the greatest difficulty that the Dean could make me comprehend wherein my wrong doing lay seventeen Fire therefore was the first object of my search Happily some embers were found upon the hearth together with potato stalks and dry chips Of these with much difficulty I kindled a fire by which some warmth was imparted to our shivering limbs eighteen In this connection a great deal of historic fact is introduced into the novel about the past history of the cathedral and of Spain nineteen Over the whole scene hung the haze of twilight that is so peaceful twenty Compared with Italy living is more expensive twenty one It is a fundamental principle of law to believe a man innocent until he is proved guilty and once proved guilty to remain so until proved to the contrary
