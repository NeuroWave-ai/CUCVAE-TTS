Gaelic And you will see What you will see Illustration The Sea Maiden Celtic Folk and Fairy Tales SELECTED AND EDITED BY JOSEPH JACOBS EDITOR OF FOLK LORE ILLUSTRATED BY JOHN D BATTEN G P PUTNAM S SONS NEW YORK AND LONDON To ALFRED NUTT Preface Last year in giving the young ones a volume of English Fairy Tales my difficulty was one of collection This time in offering them specimens of the rich folk fancy of the Celts of these islands my trouble has rather been one of selection Ireland began to collect her folk tales almost as early as any country in Europe and Croker has found a whole school of successors in Carleton Griffin Kennedy Curtin and Douglas Hyde Scotland had the great name of Campbell and has still efficient followers in MacDougall MacInnes Carmichael MacLeod and Campbell of Tiree Gallant little Wales has no name to rank alongside these in this department the Cymru have shown less vigour than the Gaedhel Perhaps the Eisteddfod by offering prizes for the collection of Welsh folk tales may remove this inferiority Meanwhile Wales must be content to be somewhat scantily represented among the Fairy Tales of the Celts while the extinct Cornish tongue has only contributed one tale In making my selection I have chiefly tried to make the stories characteristic It would have been easy especially from Kennedy to have made up a volume entirely filled with Grimm s Goblins a la Celtique But one can have too much even of that very good thing and I have therefore avoided as far as possible the more familiar formulae of folk tale literature To do this I had to withdraw from the English speaking Pale both in Scotland and Ireland and I laid down the rule to include only tales that have been taken down from Celtic peasants ignorant of English Having laid down the rule I immediately proceeded to break it The success of a fairy book I am convinced depends on the due admixture of the comic and the romantic Grimm and Asbjornsen knew the secret and they alone But the Celtic peasant who speaks Gaelic takes the pleasure of telling tales somewhat sadly so far as he has been printed and translated I found him to my surprise conspicuously lacking in humour For the comic relief of this volume I have therefore had to turn mainly to the Irish peasant of the Pale and what richer source could I draw from For the more romantic tales I have depended on the Gaelic and as I know about as much of Gaelic as an Irish Nationalist M P I have had to depend on translators But I have felt myself more at liberty than the translators themselves who have generally been over literal in changing excising or modifying the original I have even gone further In order that the tales should be characteristically Celtic I have paid more particular attention to tales that are to be found on both sides of the North Channel In re telling them I have had no scruple in interpolating now and then a Scotch incident into an Irish variant of the same story or vice versa Where the translators appealed to English folk lorists and scholars I am trying to attract English children They translated I endeavoured to transfer In short I have tried to put myself into the position of an ollamh or sheenachie familiar with both forms of Gaelic and anxious to put his stories in the best way to attract English children I trust I shall be forgiven by Celtic scholars for the changes I have had to make to effect this end The stories collected in this volume are longer and more detailed than the English ones I brought together last Christmas The romantic ones are certainly more romantic and the comic ones perhaps more comic though there may be room for a difference of opinion on this latter point This superiority of the Celtic folk tales is due as much to the conditions under which they have been collected as to any innate superiority of the folk imagination The folk tale in England is in the last stages of exhaustion The Celtic folk tales have been collected while the practice of story telling is still in full vigour though there is every sign that its term of life is already numbered The more the reason why they should be collected and put on record while there is yet time On the whole the industry of the collectors of Celtic folk lore is to be commended as may be seen from the survey of it I have prefixed to the Notes and References at the end of the volume Among these I would call attention to the study of the legend of Beth Gellert the origin of which I believe I have settled While I have endeavoured to render the language of the tales simple and free from bookish artifice I have not felt at liberty to re tell the tales in the English way I have not scrupled to retain a Celtic turn of speech and here and there a Celtic word which I have not explained within brackets a practice to be abhorred of all good men A few words unknown to the reader only add effectiveness and local colour to a narrative as mister Kipling well knows One characteristic of the Celtic folk tale I have endeavoured to represent in my selection because it is nearly unique at the present day in Europe Nowhere else is there so large and consistent a body of oral tradition about the national and mythical heroes as amongst the Gaels Only the byline or hero songs of Russia equal in extent the amount of knowledge about the heroes of the past that still exists among the Gaelic speaking peasantry of Scotland and Ireland And the Irish tales and ballads have this peculiarity that some of them have been extant and can be traced for well nigh a thousand years I have selected as a specimen of this class

none	none	 collected among the Scotch peasantry a few years ago into which I have been able to insert a passage taken from an Irish vellum of the twelfth century I could have more than filled this volume with similar oral traditions about Finn the Fingal of Macpherson s Ossian But the story of Finn as told by the Gaelic peasantry of to day deserves a volume by itself while the adventures of the Ultonian hero Cuchulain could easily fill another I have endeavoured to include in this volume the best and most typical stories told by the chief masters of the Celtic folk tale Campbell Kennedy Hyde and Curtin and to these I have added the best tales scattered elsewhere By this means I hope I have put together a volume containing both the best and the best known folk tales of the Celts I have only been enabled to do this by the courtesy of those who owned the copyright of these stories Lady Wilde has kindly granted me the use of her effective version of The Horned Women and I have specially to thank Messrs Macmillan for right to use Kennedy s Legendary Fictions and Messrs Sampson Low company for the use of mister Curtin s Tales In making my selection and in all doubtful points of treatment I have had resource to the wide knowledge of my friend mister Alfred Nutt in all branches of Celtic folk lore If this volume does anything to represent to English children the vision and colour the magic and charm of the Celtic folk imagination this is due in large measure to the care with which mister Nutt has watched its inception and progress With him by my side I could venture into regions where the non Celt wanders at his own risk Lastly I have again to rejoice in the company operation of my friend mister J D Batten in giving form to the creations of the folk fancy He has endeavoured in his illustrations to retain as much as possible of Celtic ornamentation for all details of Celtic archaeology he has authority Yet both he and I have striven to give Celtic things as they appear to and attract the English mind rather than attempt the hopeless task of representing them as they are to Celts The fate of the Celt in the British Empire bids fair to resemble that of the Greeks among the Romans They went forth to battle but they always fell yet the captive Celt has enslaved his captor in the realm of imagination The present volume attempts to begin the pleasant captivity from the earliest years If it could succeed in giving a common fund of imaginative wealth to the Celtic and the Saxon children of these isles it might do more for a true union of hearts than all your politics JOSEPH JACOBS Contents PAGE I CONNLA AND THE FAIRY MAIDEN one II GULEESH six III THE FIELD OF BOLIAUNS twenty nine IV THE HORNED WOMEN thirty four V

company CELTIC FAIRY TALES Connla and the Fairy Maiden Connla of the Fiery Hair was son of Conn of the Hundred Fights One day as he stood by the side of his father on the height of Usna he saw a maiden clad in strange attire towards him coming Whence comest thou maiden said Connla I come from the Plains of the Ever Living she said there where is neither death nor sin There we keep holiday alway nor need we help from any in our joy And in all our pleasure we have no strife And because we have our homes in the round green hills men call us the Hill Folk The king and all with him wondered much to hear a voice when they saw no one For save Connla alone none saw the Fairy Maiden To whom art thou talking my son said Conn the king Then the maiden answered Connla speaks to a young fair maid whom neither death nor old age awaits I love Connla and now I call him away to the Plain of Pleasure Moy Mell where Boadag is king for aye nor has there been sorrow or complaint in that land since he held the kingship Oh come with me Connla of the Fiery Hair ruddy as the dawn with thy tawny skin A fairy crown awaits thee to grace thy comely face and royal form Come and never shall thy comeliness fade nor thy youth till the last awful day of judgment The king in fear at what the maiden said which he heard though he could not see her called aloud to his Druid Coran by name O Coran of the many spells he said and of the cunning magic I call upon thy aid A task is upon me too great for all my skill and wit greater than any laid upon me since I seized the kingship A maiden unseen has met us and by her power would take from me my dear my comely son If thou help not he will be taken from thy king by woman s wiles and witchery Then Coran the Druid stood forth and chanted his spells towards the spot where the maiden s voice had been heard And none heard her voice again nor could Connla see her longer Only as she vanished before the Druid s mighty spell she threw an apple to Connla For a whole month from that day Connla would take nothing either to eat or to drink save only from that apple But as he ate it grew again and always kept whole And all the while there grew within him a mighty yearning and longing after the maiden he had seen But when the last day of the month of waiting came Connla stood by the side of the king his father on the Plain of Arcomin and again he saw the maiden come towards him and again she spoke to him Tis a glorious place forsooth that Connla holds among shortlived mortals awaiting the day of death But now the folk of life the ever living ones beg and bid thee come to Moy Mell the Plain of Pleasure for they have learnt to know thee seeing thee in thy home among thy dear ones When Conn the king heard the maiden s voice he called to his men aloud and said Summon swift my Druid Coran for I see she has again this day the power of speech Then the maiden said O mighty Conn Fighter of a Hundred Fights the Druid s power is little loved it has little honour in the mighty land peopled with so many of the upright When the Law comes it will do away with the Druid s magic spells that issue from the lips of the false black demon Then Conn the king observed that since the coming of the maiden Connla his son spoke to none that spake to him So Conn of the Hundred Fights said to him Is it to thy mind what the woman says my son Tis hard upon me said Connla I love my own folk above all things but yet a longing seizes me for the maiden When the maiden heard this she answered and said The ocean is not so strong as the waves of thy longing Come with me in my curragh the gleaming straight gliding crystal canoe Soon can we reach Boadag s realm I see the bright sun sink yet far as it is we can reach it before dark There is too another land worthy of thy journey a land joyous to all that seek it Only wives and maidens dwell there If thou wilt we can seek it and live there alone together in joy When the maiden ceased to speak Connla of the Fiery Hair rushed away from his kinsmen and sprang into the curragh the gleaming straight gliding crystal canoe And then they all king and court saw it glide away over the bright sea towards the setting sun away and away till eye could see it no longer So Connla and the Fairy Maiden went forth on the sea and were no more seen nor did any know whither they came Illustration Connla and the fairy maiden Guleesh There was once a boy in the County Mayo Guleesh was his name There was the finest rath a little way off from the gable of the house and he was often in the habit of seating himself on the fine grass bank that was running round it One night he stood half leaning against the gable of the house and looking up into the sky and watching the beautiful white moon over his head After he had been standing that way for a couple of hours he said to himself My bitter grief that I am not gone away out of this place altogether I d sooner be any place in the world than here Och it s well for you white moon says he that s turning round turning round as you please yourself and no man can put you back I wish I was the same as you Hardly was the word out of his mouth when he heard a great noise coming like the sound of many people running together and talking and laughing and making sport and the sound went by him like a whirl of wind and he was listening to it going into the rath Musha by my soul says he but ye re merry enough and I ll follow ye What was in it but the fairy host though he did not know at first that it was they who were in it but he followed them into the rath It s there he heard the fulparnee and the folpornee the rap lay hoota and the roolya boolya that they had there and every man of them crying out as loud as he could My horse and bridle and saddle My horse and bridle and saddle By my hand said Guleesh my boy that s not bad I ll imitate ye and he cried out as well as they My horse and bridle and saddle My horse and bridle and saddle And on the moment there was a fine horse with a bridle of gold and a saddle of silver standing before him He leaped up on it and the moment he was on its back he saw clearly that the rath was full of horses and of little people going riding on them Said a man of them to him Are you coming with us to night Guleesh I am surely said Guleesh If you are come along said the little man and out they went all together riding like the wind faster than the fastest horse ever you saw a hunting and faster than the fox and the hounds at his tail The cold winter s wind that was before them they overtook her and the cold winter s wind that was behind them she did not overtake them And stop nor stay of that full race did they make none until they came to the brink of the sea Then every one of them said Hie over cap Hie over cap and that moment they were up in the air and before Guleesh had time to remember where he was they were down on dry land again and were going like the wind At last they stood still and a man of them said to Guleesh Guleesh do you know where you are now Not a know says Guleesh You re in France Guleesh said he The daughter of the king of France is to be married to night the handsomest woman that the sun ever saw and we must do our best to bring her with us if we re only able to carry her off and you must come with us that we may be able to put the young girl up behind you on the horse when we ll be bringing her away for it s not lawful for us to put her sitting behind ourselves But you re flesh and blood and she can take a good grip of you so that she won t fall off the horse Are you satisfied Guleesh and will you do what we re telling you Why shouldn t I be satisfied said Guleesh I m satisfied surely and anything that ye will tell me to do I ll do it without doubt They got off their horses there and a man of them said a word that Guleesh did not understand and on the moment they were lifted up and Guleesh found himself and his companions in the palace There was a great feast going on there and there was not a nobleman or a gentleman in the kingdom but was gathered there dressed in silk and satin and gold and silver and the night was as bright as the day with all the lamps and candles that were lit and Guleesh had to shut his two eyes at the brightness When he opened them again and looked from him he thought he never saw anything as fine as all he saw there There were a hundred tables spread out and their full of meat and drink on each table of them flesh meat and cakes and sweetmeats and wine and ale and every drink that ever a man saw The musicians were at the two ends of the hall and they were playing the sweetest music that ever a man s ear heard and there were young women and fine youths in the middle of the hall dancing and turning and going round so quickly and so lightly that it put a soorawn in Guleesh s head to be looking at them There were more there playing tricks and more making fun and laughing for such a feast as there was that day had not been in France for twenty years because the old king had no children alive but only the one daughter and she was to be married to the son of another king that night Three days the feast was going on and the third night she was to be married and that was the night that Guleesh and the sheehogues came hoping if they could to carry off with them the king s young daughter Guleesh and his companions were standing together at the head of the hall where there was a fine altar dressed up and two bishops behind it waiting to marry the girl as soon as the right time should come Now nobody could see the sheehogues for they said a word as they came in that made them all invisible as if they had not been in it at all Tell me which of them is the king s daughter said Guleesh when he was becoming a little used to the noise and the light Don t you see her there away from you said the little man that he was talking to Guleesh looked where the little man was pointing with his finger and there he saw the loveliest woman that was he thought upon the ridge of the world The rose and the lily were fighting together in her face and one could not tell which of them got the victory Her arms and hands were like the lime her mouth as red as a strawberry when it is ripe her foot was as small and as light as another one s hand her form was smooth and slender and her hair was falling down from her head in buckles of gold Her garments and dress were woven with gold and silver and the bright stone that was in the ring on her hand was as shining as the sun Guleesh was nearly blinded with all the loveliness and beauty that was on her but when he looked again he saw that she was crying and that there was the trace of tears in her eyes It can t be said Guleesh that there s grief on her when everybody round her is so full of sport and merriment Musha then she is grieved said the little man for it s against her own will she s marrying and she has no love for the husband she is to marry The king was going to give her to him three years ago when she was only fifteen but she said she was too young and requested him to leave her as she was yet The king gave her a year s grace and when that year was up he gave her another year s grace and then another but a week or a day he would not give her longer and she is eighteen years old to night and it s time for her to marry but indeed says he and he crooked his mouth in an ugly way indeed it s no king s son she ll marry if I can help it Guleesh pitied the handsome young lady greatly when he heard that and he was heart broken to think that it would be necessary for her to marry a man she did not like or what was worse to take a nasty sheehogue for a husband However he did not say a word though he could not help giving many a curse to the ill luck that was laid out for himself to be helping the people that were to snatch her away from her home and from her father He began thinking then what it was he ought to do to save her but he could think of nothing Oh if I could only give her some help and relief said he I wouldn t care whether I were alive or dead but I see nothing that I can do for her He was looking on when the king s son came up to her and asked her for a kiss but she turned her head away from him Guleesh had double pity for her then when he saw the lad taking her by the soft white hand and drawing her out to dance They went round in the dance near where Guleesh was and he could plainly see that there were tears in her eyes When the dancing was over the old king her father and her mother the queen came up and said that this was the right time to marry her that the bishop was ready and it was time to put the wedding ring on her and give her to her husband The king took the youth by the hand and the queen took her daughter and they went up together to the altar with the lords and great people following them Illustration When they came near the altar and were no more than about four yards from it the little sheehogue stretched out his foot before the girl and she fell Before she was able to rise again he threw something that was in his hand upon her said a couple of words and upon the moment the maiden was gone from amongst them Nobody could see her for that word made her invisible The little man een seized her and raised her up behind Guleesh and the king nor no one else saw them but out with them through the hall till they came to the door Oro dear Mary it s there the pity was and the trouble and the crying and the wonder and the searching and the rookawn when that lady disappeared from their eyes and without their seeing what did it Out of the door of the palace they went without being stopped or hindered for nobody saw them and My horse my bridle and saddle says every man of them My horse my bridle and saddle says Guleesh and on the moment the horse was standing ready caparisoned before him Now jump up Guleesh said the little man and put the lady behind you and we will be going the morning is not far off from us now Guleesh raised her up on the horse s back and leaped up himself before her and Rise horse said he and his horse and the other horses with him went in a full race until they came to the sea Hie over cap said every man of them Hie over cap said Guleesh and on the moment the horse rose under him and cut a leap in the clouds and came down in Erin They did not stop there but went of a race to the place where was Guleesh s house and the rath And when they came as far as that Guleesh turned and caught the young girl in his two arms and leaped off the horse I call and cross you to myself in the name of God said he and on the spot before the word was out of his mouth the horse fell down and what was in it but the beam of a plough of which they had made a horse and every other horse they had it was that way they made it Some of them were riding on an old besom and some on a broken stick and more on a bohalawn or a hemlock stalk The good people called out together when they heard what Guleesh said O Guleesh you clown you thief that no good may happen you Why did you play that trick on us But they had no power at all to carry off the girl after Guleesh had consecrated her to himself O Guleesh isn t that a nice turn you did us and we so kind to you What good have we now out of our journey to France Never mind yet you clown but you ll pay us another time for this Believe us you ll repent it He ll have no good to get out of the young girl said the little man that was talking to him in the palace before that and as he said the word he moved over to her and struck her a slap on the side of the head Now says he she ll be without talk any more now Guleesh what good will she be to you when she ll be dumb It s time for us to go but you ll remember us Guleesh When he said that he stretched out his two hands and before Guleesh was able to give an answer he and the rest of them were gone into the rath out of his sight and he saw them no more He turned to the young woman and said to her Thanks be to God they re gone Would you not sooner stay with me than with them She gave him no answer There s trouble and grief on her yet said Guleesh in his own mind and he spoke to her again I am afraid that you must spend this night in my father s house lady and if there is anything that I can do for you tell me and I ll be your servant The beautiful girl remained silent but there were tears in her eyes and her face was white and red after each other Lady said Guleesh tell me what you would like me to do now I never belonged at all to that lot of sheehogues who carried you away with them I am the son of an honest farmer and I went with them without knowing it If I ll be able to send you back to your father I ll do it and I pray you make any use of me now that you may wish He looked into her face and saw the mouth moving as if she were going to speak but there came no word from it It cannot be said Guleesh that you are dumb Did I not hear you speaking to the king s son in the palace to night Or has that devil made you really dumb when he struck his nasty hand on your jaw The girl raised her white smooth hand and laid her finger on her tongue to show him that she had lost her voice and power of speech and the tears ran out of her two eyes like streams and Guleesh s own eyes were not dry for as rough as he was on the outside he had a soft heart and could not stand the sight of the young girl and she in that unhappy plight He began thinking with himself what he ought to do and he did not like to bring her home with himself to his father s house for he knew well that they would not believe him that he had been in France and brought back with him the king of France s daughter and he was afraid they might make a mock of the young lady or insult her As he was doubting what he ought to do and hesitating he chanced to remember the priest Glory be to God said he I know now what I ll do I ll bring her to the priest s house and he won t refuse me to keep the lady and care for her He turned to the lady again and told her that he was loth to take her to his father s house but that there was an excellent priest very friendly to himself who would take good care of her if she wished to remain in his house but that if there was any other place she would rather go he said he would bring her to it She bent her head to show him she was obliged and gave him to understand that she was ready to follow him to any place he was going We will go to the priest s house then said he he is under an obligation to me and will do anything I ask him They went together accordingly to the priest s house and the sun was just rising when they came to the door Guleesh beat it hard and as early as it was the priest was up and opened the door himself He wondered when he saw Guleesh and the girl for he was certain that it was coming wanting to be married they were Guleesh Guleesh isn t it the nice boy you are that you can t wait till ten o clock or till twelve but that you must be coming to me at this hour looking for marriage you and your sweetheart You ought to know that I can t marry you at such a time or at all events can t marry you lawfully But ubbubboo said he suddenly as he looked again at the young girl in the name of God who have you here Who is she or how did you get her Father said Guleesh you can marry me or anybody else if you wish but it s not looking for marriage I came to you now but to ask you if you please to give a lodging in your house to this young lady The priest looked at him as though he had ten heads on him but without putting any other question to him he desired him to come in himself and the maiden and when they came in he shut the door brought them into the parlour and put them sitting Now Guleesh said he tell me truly who is this young lady and whether you re out of your senses really or are only making a joke of me I m not telling a word of lie nor making a joke of you said Guleesh but it was from the palace of the king of France I carried off this lady and she is the daughter of the king of France He began his story then and told the whole to the priest and the priest was so much surprised that he could not help calling out at times or clapping his hands together When Guleesh said from what he saw he thought the girl was not satisfied with the marriage that was going to take place in the palace before he and the sheehogues broke it up there came a red blush into the girl s cheek and he was more certain than ever that she had sooner be as she was badly off as she was than be the married wife of the man she hated When Guleesh said that he would be very thankful to the priest if he would keep her in his own house the kind man said he would do that as long as Guleesh pleased but that he did not know what they ought to do with her because they had no means of sending her back to her father again Guleesh answered that he was uneasy about the same thing and that he saw nothing to do but to keep quiet until they should find some opportunity of doing something better They made it up then between themselves that the priest should let on that it was his brother s daughter he had who was come on a visit to him from another county and that he should tell everybody that she was dumb and do his best to keep every one away from her They told the young girl what it was they intended to do and she showed by her eyes that she was obliged to them Guleesh went home then and when his people asked him where he had been he said that he had been asleep at the foot of the ditch and had passed the night there There was great wonderment on the priest s neighbours at the girl who came so suddenly to his house without any one knowing where she was from or what business she had there Some of the people said that everything was not as it ought to be and others that Guleesh was not like the same man that was in it before and that it was a great story how he was drawing every day to the priest s house and that the priest had a wish and a respect for him a thing they could not clear up at all That was true for them indeed for it was seldom the day went by but Guleesh would go to the priest s house and have a talk with him and as often as he would come he used to hope to find the young lady well again and with leave to speak but alas she remained dumb and silent without relief or cure Since she had no other means of talking she carried on a sort of conversation between herself and himself by moving her hand and fingers winking her eyes opening and shutting her mouth laughing or smiling and a thousand other signs so that it was not long until they understood each other very well Guleesh was always thinking how he should send her back to her father but there was no one to go with her and he himself did not know what road to go for he had never been out of his own country before the night he brought her away with him Nor had the priest any better knowledge than he but when Guleesh asked him he wrote three or four letters to the king of France and gave them to buyers and sellers of wares who used to be going from place to place across the sea but they all went astray and never a one came to the king s hand This was the way they were for many months and Guleesh was falling deeper and deeper in love with her every day and it was plain to himself and the priest that she liked him The boy feared greatly at last lest the king should really hear where his daughter was and take her back from himself and he besought the priest to write no more but to leave the matter to God So they passed the time for a year until there came a day when Guleesh was lying by himself on the grass on the last day of the last month in autumn and he was thinking over again in his own mind of everything that happened to him from the day that he went with the sheehogues across the sea He remembered then suddenly that it was one November night that he was standing at the gable of the house when the whirlwind came and the sheehogues in it and he said to himself We have November night again to day and I ll stand in the same place I was last year until I see if the good people come again Perhaps I might see or hear something that would be useful to me and might bring back her talk again to Mary that was the name himself and the priest called the king s daughter for neither of them knew her right name He told his intention to the priest and the priest gave him his blessing Guleesh accordingly went to the old rath when the night was darkening and he stood with his bent elbow leaning on a grey old flag waiting till the middle of the night should come The moon rose slowly and it was like a knob of fire behind him and there was a white fog which was raised up over the fields of grass and all damp places through the coolness of the night after a great heat in the day The night was calm as is a lake when there is not a breath of wind to move a wave on it and there was no sound to be heard but the cronawn of the insects that would go by from time to time or the hoarse sudden scream of the wild geese as they passed from lake to lake half a mile up in the air over his head or the sharp whistle of the golden and green plover rising and lying lying and rising as they do on a calm night There were a thousand thousand bright stars shining over his head and there was a little frost out which left the grass under his foot white and crisp He stood there for an hour for two hours for three hours and the frost increased greatly so that he heard the breaking of the traneens under his foot as often as he moved He was thinking in his own mind at last that the sheehogues would not come that night and that it was as good for him to return back again when he heard a sound far away from him coming towards him and he recognised what it was at the first moment The sound increased and at first it was like the beating of waves on a stony shore and then it was like the falling of a great waterfall and at last it was like a loud storm in the tops of the trees and then the whirlwind burst into the rath of one rout and the sheehogues were in it It all went by him so suddenly that he lost his breath with it but he came to himself on the spot and put an ear on himself listening to what they would say Scarcely had they gathered into the rath till they all began shouting and screaming and talking amongst themselves and then each one of them cried out My horse and bridle and saddle My horse and bridle and saddle and Guleesh took courage and called out as loudly as any of them My horse and bridle and saddle My horse and bridle and saddle But before the word was well out of his mouth another man cried out Ora Guleesh my boy are you here with us again How are you getting on with your woman There s no use in your calling for your horse to night I ll go bail you won t play such a trick on us again It was a good trick you played on us last year It was said another man he won t do it again Isn t he a prime lad the same lad to take a woman with him that never said as much to him as How do you do since this time last year says the third man Perhaps he likes to be looking at her said another voice And if the omadawn only knew that there s an herb growing up by his own door and if he were to boil it and give it to her she d be well said another voice That s true for you He is an omadawn Don t bother your head with him we ll be going We ll leave the bodach as he is And with that they rose up into the air and out with them with one roolya boolya the way they came and they left poor Guleesh standing where they found him and the two eyes going out of his head looking after them and wondering Illustration He did not stand long till he returned back and he thinking in his own mind on all he saw and heard and wondering whether there was really an herb at his own door that would bring back the talk to the king s daughter It can t be says he to himself that they would tell it to me if there was any virtue in it but perhaps the sheehogue didn t observe himself when he let the word slip out of his mouth I ll search well as soon as the sun rises whether there s any plant growing beside the house except thistles and dockings He went home and as tired as he was he did not sleep a wink until the sun rose on the morrow He got up then and it was the first thing he did to go out and search well through the grass round about the house trying could he get any herb that he did not recognise And indeed he was not long searching till he observed a large strange herb that was growing up just by the gable of the house He went over to it and observed it closely and saw that there were seven little branches coming out of the stalk and seven leaves growing on every brancheen of them and that there was a white sap in the leaves It s very wonderful said he to himself that I never noticed this herb before If there s any virtue in an herb at all it ought to be in such a strange one as this He drew out his knife cut the plant and carried it into his own house stripped the leaves off it and cut up the stalk and there came a thick white juice out of it as there comes out of the sow thistle when it is bruised except that the juice was more like oil He put it in a little pot and a little water in it and laid it on the fire until the water was boiling and then he took a cup filled it half up with the juice and put it to his own mouth It came into his head then that perhaps it was poison that was in it and that the good people were only tempting him that he might kill himself with that trick or put the girl to death without meaning it He put down the cup again raised a couple of drops on the top of his finger and put it to his mouth It was not bitter and indeed had a sweet agreeable taste He grew bolder then and drank the full of a thimble of it and then as much again and he never stopped till he had half the cup drunk He fell asleep after that and did not wake till it was night and there was great hunger and great thirst on him Illustration He had to wait then till the day rose but he determined as soon as he should wake in the morning that he would go to the king s daughter and give her a drink of the juice of the herb As soon as he got up in the morning he went over to the priest s house with the drink in his hand and he never felt himself so bold and valiant and spirited and light as he was that day and he was quite certain that it was the drink he drank which made him so hearty When he came to the house he found the priest and the young lady within and they were wondering greatly why he had not visited them for two days He told them all his news and said that he was certain that there was great power in that herb and that it would do the lady no hurt for he tried it himself and got good from it and then he made her taste it for he vowed and swore that there was no harm in it Guleesh handed her the cup and she drank half of it and then fell back on her bed and a heavy sleep came on her and she never woke out of that sleep till the day on the morrow Guleesh and the priest sat up the entire night with her waiting till she should awake and they between hope and unhope between expectation of saving her and fear of hurting her She awoke at last when the sun had gone half its way through the heavens She rubbed her eyes and looked like a person who did not know where she was She was like one astonished when she saw Guleesh and the priest in the same room with her and she sat up doing her best to collect her thoughts The two men were in great anxiety waiting to see would she speak or would she not speak and when they remained silent for a couple of minutes the priest said to her Did you sleep well Mary And she answered him I slept thank you No sooner did Guleesh hear her talking than he put a shout of joy out of him and ran over to her and fell on his two knees and said A thousand thanks to God who has given you back the talk lady of my heart speak again to me The lady answered him that she understood it was he who boiled that drink for her and gave it to her that she was obliged to him from her heart for all the kindness he showed her since the day she first came to Ireland and that he might be certain that she never would forget it Guleesh was ready to die with satisfaction and delight Then they brought her food and she ate with a good appetite and was merry and joyous and never left off talking with the priest while she was eating After that Guleesh went home to his house and stretched himself on the bed and fell asleep again for the force of the herb was not all spent and he passed another day and a night sleeping When he woke up he went back to the priest s house and found that the young lady was in the same state and that she was asleep almost since the time that he left the house He went into her chamber with the priest and they remained watching beside her till she awoke the second time and she had her talk as well as ever and Guleesh was greatly rejoiced The priest put food on the table again and they ate together and Guleesh used after that to come to the house from day to day and the friendship that was between him and the king s daughter increased because she had no one to speak to except Guleesh and the priest and she liked Guleesh best So they married one another and that was the fine wedding they had and if I were to be there then I would not be here now but I heard it from a bird een that there was neither cark nor care sickness nor sorrow mishap nor misfortune on them till the hour of their death and may the same be with me and with us all Illustration The Field of Boliauns Illustration One fine day in harvest it was indeed Lady day in harvest that everybody knows to be one of the greatest holidays in the year Tom Fitzpatrick was taking a ramble through the ground and went along the sunny side of a hedge when all of a sudden he heard a clacking sort of noise a little before him in the hedge Dear me said Tom but isn t it surprising to hear the stone chatters singing so late in the season So Tom stole on going on the tops of his toes to try if he could get a sight of what was making the noise to see if he was right in his guess The noise stopped but as Tom looked sharply through the bushes what should he see in a nook of the hedge but a brown pitcher that might hold about a gallon and a half of liquor and by and by a little wee teeny tiny bit of an old man with a little motty of a cocked hat stuck upon the top of his head a deeshy daushy leather apron hanging before him pulled out a little wooden stool and stood up upon it and dipped a little piggin into the pitcher and took out the full of it and put it beside the stool and then sat down under the pitcher and began to work at putting a heel piece on a bit of a brogue just fit for himself Well by the powers said Tom to himself I often heard tell of the Lepracauns and to tell God s truth I never rightly believed in them but here s one of them in real earnest If I go knowingly to work I m a made man They say a body must never take their eyes off them or they ll escape Tom now stole on a little further with his eye fixed on the little man just as a cat does with a mouse So when he got up quite close to him God bless your work neighbour said Tom The little man raised up his head and Thank you kindly said he I wonder you d be working on the holiday said Tom That s my own business not yours was the reply Well maybe you d be civil enough to tell us what you ve got in the pitcher there said Tom That I will with pleasure said he it s good beer Beer said Tom Thunder and fire where did you get it Where did I get it is it Why I made it And what do you think I made it of Devil a one of me knows said Tom but of malt I suppose what else There you re out I made it of heath Of heath said Tom bursting out laughing sure you don t think me to be such a fool as to believe that Do as you please said he but what I tell you is the truth Did you never hear tell of the Danes Well what about them said Tom Why all the about them there is is that when they were here they taught us to make beer out of the heath and the secret s in my family ever since Will you give a body a taste of your beer said Tom I ll tell you what it is young man it would be fitter for you to be looking after your father s property than to be bothering decent quiet people with your foolish questions There now while you re idling away your time here there s the cows have broke into the oats and are knocking the corn all about Tom was taken so by surprise with this that he was just on the very point of turning round when he recollected himself so afraid that the like might happen again he made a grab at the Lepracaun and caught him up in his hand but in his hurry he overset the pitcher and spilt all the beer so that he could not get a taste of it to tell what sort it was He then swore that he would kill him if he did not show him where his money was Tom looked so wicked and so bloody minded that the little man was quite frightened so says he Come along with me a couple of fields off and I will show you a crock of gold So they went and Tom held the Lepracaun fast in his hand and never took his eyes from off him though they had to cross hedges and ditches and a crooked bit of bog till at last they came to a great field all full of boliauns and the Lepracaun pointed to a big boliaun and says he Dig under that boliaun and you ll get the great crock all full of guineas Tom in his hurry had never thought of bringing a spade with him so he made up his mind to run home and fetch one and that he might know the place again he took off one of his red garters and tied it round the boliaun Then he said to the Lepracaun Swear ye ll not take that garter away from that boliaun And the Lepracaun swore right away not to touch it I suppose said the Lepracaun very civilly you have no further occasion for me No says Tom you may go away now if you please and God speed you and may good luck attend you wherever you go Well good bye to you Tom Fitzpatrick said the Lepracaun and much good may it do you when you get it So Tom ran for dear life till he came home and got a spade and then away with him as hard as he could go back to the field of boliauns but when he got there lo and behold not a boliaun in the field but had a red garter the very model of his own tied about it and as to digging up the whole field that was all nonsense for there were more than forty good Irish acres in it So Tom came home again with his spade on his shoulder a little cooler than he went and many s the hearty curse he gave the Lepracaun every time he thought of the neat turn he had served him The Horned Women Illustration A rich woman sat up late one night carding and preparing wool while all the family and servants were asleep Suddenly a knock was given at the door and a voice called Open open Who is there said the woman of the house I am the Witch of one Horn was answered The mistress supposing that one of her neighbours had called and required assistance opened the door and a woman entered having in her hand a pair of wool carders and bearing a horn on her forehead as if growing there She sat down by the fire in silence and began to card the wool with violent haste Suddenly she paused and said aloud Where are the women they delay too long Then a second knock came to the door and a voice called as before Open open The mistress felt herself obliged to rise and open to the call and immediately a second witch entered having two horns on her forehead and in her hand a wheel for spinning wool Give me place she said I am the Witch of the two Horns and she began to spin as quick as lightning And so the knocks went on and the call was heard and the witches entered until at last twelve women sat round the fire the first with one horn the last with twelve horns And they carded the thread and turned their spinning wheels and wound and wove all singing together an ancient rhyme but no word did they speak to the mistress of the house Strange to hear and frightful to look upon were these twelve women with their horns and their wheels and the mistress felt near to death and she tried to rise that she might call for help but she could not move nor could she utter a word or a cry for the spell of the witches was upon her Then one of them called to her in Irish and said Rise woman and make us a cake Then the mistress searched for a vessel to bring water from the well that she might mix the meal and make the cake but she could find none And they said to her Take a sieve and bring water in it And she took the sieve and went to the well but the water poured from it and she could fetch none for the cake and she sat down by the well and wept Then a voice came by her and said Take yellow clay and moss and bind them together and plaster the sieve so that it will hold This she did and the sieve held the water for the cake and the voice said again Return and when thou comest to the north angle of the house cry aloud three times and say The mountain of the Fenian women and the sky over it is all on fire And she did so When the witches inside heard the call a great and terrible cry broke from their lips and they rushed forth with wild lamentations and shrieks and fled away to Slievenamon where was their chief abode But the Spirit of the Well bade the mistress of the house to enter and prepare her home against the enchantments of the witches if they returned again And first to break their spells she sprinkled the water in which she had washed her child s feet the feet water outside the door on the threshold secondly she took the cake which in her absence the witches had made of meal mixed with the blood drawn from the sleeping family and she broke the cake in bits and placed a bit in the mouth of each sleeper and they were restored and she took the cloth they had woven and placed it half in and half out of the chest with the padlock and lastly she secured the door with a great crossbeam fastened in the jambs so that the witches could not enter and having done these things she waited Not long were the witches in coming back and they raged and called for vengeance Open open they screamed open feet water I cannot said the feet water I am scattered on the ground and my path is down to the Lough Open open wood and trees and beam they cried to the door I cannot said the door for the beam is fixed in the jambs and I have no power to move Open open cake that we have made and mingled with blood they cried again I cannot said the cake for I am broken and bruised and my blood is on the lips of the sleeping children Then the witches rushed through the air with great cries and fled back to Slievenamon uttering strange curses on the Spirit of the Well who had wished their ruin but the woman and the house were left in peace and a mantle dropped by one of the witches in her flight was kept hung up by the mistress in memory of that night and this mantle was kept by the same family from generation to generation for five hundred years after Conall Yellowclaw 
6294_86679_000001_000000	train-clean-360	Conall Yellowclaw was a sturdy tenant in Erin he had three sons There was at that time a king over every fifth of Erin 
none	none	It fell out for the children of the king that was near Conall that they themselves and the children of Conall came to blows 
6294_86679_000001_000002	train-clean-360	The children of Conall got the upper hand and they killed the king s big son 
none	none	The king sent a message for Conall and he said to him O Conall what made your sons go to spring on my sons till my big son was killed by your children 
6294_86679_000001_000004	train-clean-360	But I see that though I follow you revengefully I shall not be much better for it and I will now set a thing before you and if you will do it I will not follow you with revenge 
6294_86679_000001_000005	train-clean-360	If you and your sons will get me the brown horse of the king of Lochlann you shall get the souls of your sons 
none	none	Why said Conall should not I do the pleasure of the king though there should be no souls of my sons in dread at all 
6294_86679_000002_000001	train-clean-360	Hard is the matter you require of me but I will lose my own life and the life of my sons or else I will do the pleasure of the king 
6294_86679_000003_000000	train-clean-360	After these words Conall left the king and he went home when he got home he was under much trouble and perplexity 
none	none	When he went to lie down he told his wife the thing the king had set before him 
6294_86679_000003_000002	train-clean-360	His wife took much sorrow that he was obliged to part from herself while she knew not if she should see him more 
none	none	O Conall said she why didst not thou let the king do his own pleasure to thy sons rather than be going now while I know not if ever I shall see thee more 
6294_86679_000005_000000	train-clean-360	When he rose on the morrow he set himself and his three sons in order and they took their journey towards Lochlann and they made no stop but tore through ocean till they reached it 
none	none	When they reached Lochlann they did not know what they should do Said the old man to his sons Stop ye and we will seek out the house of the king s miller 
6294_86679_000006_000000	train-clean-360	When they went to the house of the king s miller the man asked them to stop there for the night 
6294_86679_000006_000001	train-clean-360	Conall told the miller that his own children and the children of his king had fallen out and that his children had killed the king s son and there was nothing that would please the king but that he should get the brown horse of the king of Lochlann 
6294_86679_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 If you will do me a kindness and will put me in a way to get him for certain I will pay ye for it 
6294_86679_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 The thing is silly that you are come to seek said the miller for the king has laid his mind on him so greatly that you will not get him in any way unless you steal him but if you can make out a way I will keep it secret 
6294_86679_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 This is what I am thinking said Conall since you are working every day for the king you and your gillies could put myself and my sons into four sacks of bran 
6294_86679_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 The plan that has come into your head is not bad said the miller 
none	none	The miller spoke to his gillies and he said to them to do this and they put them in four sacks 
6294_86679_000011_000001	train-clean-360	The king s gillies came to seek the bran and they took the four sacks with them and they emptied them before the horses 
6294_86679_000011_000002	train-clean-360	The servants locked the door and they went away 
6294_86679_000012_000000	train-clean-360	When they rose to lay hand on the brown horse said Conall You shall not do that 
none	none	It is hard to get out of this let us make for ourselves four hiding holes so that if they hear us we may go and hide They made the holes then they laid hands on the horse The horse was pretty well unbroken and he set to making a terrible noise through the stable The king heard the noise
6294_86679_000012_000004	train-clean-360	 It must be my brown horse said he to his gillies find out what is wrong with him 
6294_86679_000013_000000	train-clean-360	The servants went out and when Conall and his sons saw them coming they went into the hiding holes 
6294_86679_000013_000001	train-clean-360	The servants looked amongst the horses and they did not find anything wrong and they returned and they told this to the king and the king said to them that if nothing was wrong they should go to their places of rest 
6294_86679_000013_000002	train-clean-360	When the gillies had time to be gone Conall and his sons laid their hands again on the horse 
6294_86679_000013_000003	train-clean-360	If the noise was great that he made before the noise that he made now was seven times greater 
6294_86679_000013_000004	train-clean-360	The king sent a message for his gillies again and said for certain there was something troubling the brown horse 
none	none	Go and look well about him The servants went out and the others went to their hiding holes 
6294_86679_000013_000006	train-clean-360	The servants rummaged well and did not find a thing 
none	none	They returned and they told this That is marvellous for me said the king go you to lie down again and if I notice it again I will go out myself 
6294_86679_000015_000000	train-clean-360	When Conall and his sons perceived that the gillies were gone they laid hands again on the horse and one of them caught him and if the noise that the horse made on the two former times was great he made more this time 
6294_86679_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Be this from me said the king it must be that some one is troubling my brown horse He sounded the bell hastily and when his waiting man came to him he said to him to let the stable gillies know that something was wrong with the horse 
6294_86679_000016_000001	train-clean-360	The gillies came and the king went with them 
6294_86679_000016_000002	train-clean-360	When Conall and his sons perceived the company coming they went to the hiding holes 
none	none	The king was a wary man and he saw where the horses were making a noise
6294_86679_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Be wary said the king there are men within the stable let us get at them somehow 
6294_86679_000019_000000	train-clean-360	The king followed the tracks of the men and he found them 
none	none	Every one knew Conall for he was a valued tenant of the king of Erin and when the king brought them up out of the holes he said O Conall is it you that are here I am O king without question and necessity made me come 
6294_86679_000020_000001	train-clean-360	I am under thy pardon and under thine honour and under thy grace He told how it happened to him and that he had to get the brown horse for the king of Erin or that his sons were to be put to death 
none	none	I knew that I should not get him by asking and I was going to steal him
6294_86679_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes Conall it is well enough but come in said the king 
none	none	He desired his look out men to set a watch on the sons of Conall and to give them meat 
6294_86679_000021_000002	train-clean-360	And a double watch was set that night on the sons of Conall 
6294_86679_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Now O Conall said the king were you ever in a harder place than to be seeing your lot of sons hanged to morrow 
6294_86679_000022_000001	train-clean-360	But you set it to my goodness and to my grace and say that it was necessity brought it on you so I must not hang you 
6294_86679_000022_000002	train-clean-360	Tell me any case in which you were as hard as this and if you tell that you shall get the soul of your youngest son 
6294_86679_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 I will tell a case as hard in which I was said Conall 
6294_86679_000023_000001	train-clean-360	 I was once a young lad and my father had much land and he had parks of year old cows and one of them had just calved and my father told me to bring her home 
6294_86679_000023_000002	train-clean-360	I found the cow and took her with us 
6294_86679_000023_000003	train-clean-360	There fell a shower of snow 
none	none	We went into the herd s bothy and we took the cow and the calf in with us and we were letting the shower pass from us 
6294_86679_000023_000005	train-clean-360	Who should come in but one cat and ten and one great one eyed fox coloured cat as head bard over them 
none	none	When they came in in very deed I myself had no liking for their company Strike up with you said the head bard why should we be still and sing a cronan to Conall Yellowclaw I was amazed that my name was known to the cats themselves When they had sung the cronan said the head bard Now O Conall pay the reward of the cronan that the cats have sung to thee Well then said I myself I have no reward whatsoever for you unless you should go down and take that calf No sooner said I the word than the two cats and ten went down to attack the calf and in very deed he did not last them long
6294_86679_000023_000008	train-clean-360	 Play up with you why should you be silent 
6294_86679_000023_000009	train-clean-360	Make a cronan to Conall Yellowclaw said the head bard 
none	none	I had no liking at all for the cronan but up came the one cat and ten and if they did not sing me a cronan then and there
6294_86679_000023_000011	train-clean-360	 Pay them now their reward said the great fox coloured cat 
6294_86679_000023_000012	train-clean-360	 I am tired myself of yourselves and your rewards said I I have no reward for you unless you take that cow down there They betook themselves to the cow and indeed she did not last them long 
none	none	Illustration Why will you be silent 
6294_86679_000025_000001	train-clean-360	Go up and sing a cronan to Conall Yellowclaw said the head bard 
6294_86679_000025_000002	train-clean-360	And surely O king I had no care for them or for their cronan for I began to see that they were not good comrades 
none	none	When they had sung me the cronan they betook themselves down where the head bard was
6294_86679_000025_000004	train-clean-360	 Pay now their reward said the head bard and for sure O king I had no reward for them and I said to them I have no reward for you And surely O king there was a catterwauling between them 
none	none	So I leapt out at a turf window that was at the back of the house I took myself off as hard as I might into the wood I was swift enough and strong at that time and when I felt the rustling toirm of the cats after me I climbed into as high a tree as I saw in the place and one that was close in the top and I hid myself as well as I might 
6294_86679_000025_000008	train-clean-360	The cats began to search for me through the wood and they could not find me and when they were tired each one said to the other that they would turn back 
none	none	But said the one eyed fox coloured cat that was commander in chief over them you saw him not with your two eyes and though I have but one eye there s the rascal up in the tree When he had said that one of them went up in the tree and as he was coming where I was I drew a weapon that I had and I killed him Be this from me said the one eyed one I must not be losing my company thus gather round the root of the tree and dig about it and let down that villain to earth On this they gathered about the tree and they dug about the root and the first branching root that they cut she gave a shiver to fall and I myself gave a shout and it was not to be wondered at There was in the neighbourhood of the wood a priest and he had ten men with him delving and he said There is a shout of a man in extremity and I must not be without replying to it And the wisest of the men said Let it alone till we hear it again The cats began again digging wildly and they broke the next root and I myself gave the next shout and in very deed it was not a weak one
6294_86679_000025_000012	train-clean-360	 Certainly said the priest it is a man in extremity let us move They set themselves in order for moving 
none	none	And the cats arose on the tree and they broke the third root and the tree fell on her elbow 
6294_86679_000025_000014	train-clean-360	Then I gave the third shout 
none	none	The stalwart men hastened and when they saw how the cats served the tree they began at them with the spades and they themselves and the cats began at each other till the cats ran away And surely O king I did not move till I saw the last one of them off 
6294_86679_000025_000016	train-clean-360	And then I came home 
none	none	And there s the hardest case in which I ever was and it seems to me that tearing by the cats were harder than hanging to morrow by the king of Lochlann Och 
6294_86679_000026_000001	train-clean-360	Conall said the king you are full of words 
6294_86679_000026_000002	train-clean-360	You have freed the soul of your son with your tale and if you tell me a harder case than that you will get your second youngest son and then you will have two sons 
6294_86679_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Well then said Conall on condition that thou dost that I will tell thee how I was once in a harder case than to be in thy power in prison to night 
6294_86679_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Let s hear said the king 
none	none	I was then said Conall quite a young lad and 
6294_86679_000033_000002	train-clean-360	I went out 
none	none	hunting and my father s land was beside the sea and it was rough with rocks caves and rifts When I was going on the top of the shore I saw as if there were a smoke coming up between two rocks and I began to look what might be the meaning of the smoke coming up there When I was looking what should I do but fall and the place was so full of heather that neither bone nor skin was broken I knew not how I should get out of this I was not looking before me but I kept looking overhead the way I came and thinking that the day would never come that I could get up there It was terrible for me to be there till I should die 
6294_86679_000029_000006	train-clean-360	I heard a great clattering coming and what was there but a great giant and two dozen of goats with him and a buck at their head 
none	none	And when the giant had tied the goats he came up and he said to me Hao O Conall it s long since my knife has been rusting in my pouch waiting for thy tender flesh Och said I it s not much you will be bettered by me though you should tear me asunder I will make but one meal for you But I see that you are one eyed 
6294_86679_000029_000009	train-clean-360	I am a good leech and I will give you the sight of the other eye The giant went and he drew the great caldron on the site of the fire 
6294_86679_000029_000010	train-clean-360	I myself was telling him how he should heat the water so that I should give its sight to the other eye 
6294_86679_000029_000011	train-clean-360	I got heather and I made a rubber of it and I set him upright in the caldron 
6294_86679_000029_000012	train-clean-360	I began at the eye that was well pretending to him that I would give its sight to the other one till I left them as bad as each other and surely it was easier to spoil the one that was well than to give sight to the other 
none	none	Illustration There thou art thou pretty buck Thou seest me but I see thee not When he saw that he could not see a glimpse and when I myself said to him that I would get out in spite of him he gave a spring out of the water and he stood in the mouth of the cave and he said that he would have revenge for the sight of his eye I had but to stay there crouched the length of the night holding in my breath in such a way that he might not find out where I was
6294_86679_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 When he felt the birds calling in the morning and knew that the day was he said Art thou sleeping 
6294_86679_000032_000001	train-clean-360	Awake and let out my lot of goats I killed the buck 
none	none	He cried I do believe that thou art killing my buck I am not said I but the ropes are so tight that I take long to loose them I let out one of the goats and there he was caressing her and he said to her There thou art thou shaggy hairy white goat and thou seest me but I see thee not I kept letting them out by the way of one and one as I flayed the buck and before the last one was out I had him flayed bag wise 
6294_86679_000033_000001	train-clean-360	Then I went and I put my legs in place of his legs and my hands in place of his forelegs and my head in place of his head and the horns on top of my head so that the brute might think that it was the buck 
none	none	I went out When I was going out the giant laid his hand on me and he said There thou art thou pretty buck thou seest me but I see thee not When I myself got out and I saw the world about me surely O king joy was on me When I was out and had shaken the skin off me I said to the brute I am out now in spite of you
6294_86679_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Aha said he hast thou done this to me 
none	none	Since thou wert so stalwart that thou hast got out I will give thee a ring that I have here keep the ring and it will do thee good I will not take the ring from you said I but throw it and I will take it with me He threw the ring on the flat ground I went myself and lifted the ring and I put it on my finger When he said to me then Is the ring fitting thee I said to him It is Then he said Where art thou ring And the ring said I am here The brute went and went towards where the ring was speaking and now I saw that I was in a harder case than ever I was 
6294_86679_000035_000002	train-clean-360	I drew a dirk 
none	none	I cut the finger from off me and I threw it from me as far as I could out on the loch and there was a great depth in the place 
6294_86679_000035_000004	train-clean-360	He shouted Where art thou ring And the ring said I am here though it was on the bed of the ocean 
6294_86679_000035_000005	train-clean-360	He gave a spring after the ring and out he went in the sea 
none	none	And I was as pleased then when I saw him drowning as though you should grant my own life and the life of my two sons with me and not lay any more trouble on me
6294_86679_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 When the giant was drowned I went in and I took with me all he had of gold and silver and I went home and surely great joy was on my people when I arrived 
none	none	And as a sign now look the finger is off me
6294_86679_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes indeed Conall you are wordy and wise said the king 
6294_86679_000037_000001	train-clean-360	 I see the finger is off you 
none	none	You have freed your two sons but tell me a case in which you ever were that is harder than to be looking on your son being hanged to morrow and you shall get the soul of your eldest son Then went my father said Conall and he got me a wife and I was married 
6294_86679_000038_000001	train-clean-360	I went to hunt 
none	none	I was going beside the sea and I saw an island over in the midst of the loch and I came there where a boat was with a rope before her and a rope behind her and many precious things within her 
6294_86679_000038_000003	train-clean-360	I looked myself on the boat to see how I might get part of them 
none	none	I put in the one foot and the other foot was on the ground and when I raised my head what was it but the boat over in the middle of the loch and she never stopped till she reached the island When I went out of the boat the boat returned where she was before 
6294_86679_000038_000005	train-clean-360	I did not know now what I should do 
6294_86679_000038_000006	train-clean-360	The place was without meat or clothing without the appearance of a house on it 
none	none	I came out on the top of a hill Then I came to a glen I saw in it at the bottom of a hollow a woman with a child and the child was naked on her knee and she had a knife in her hand 
6294_86679_000038_000009	train-clean-360	She tried to put the knife to the throat of the babe and the babe began to laugh in her face and she began to cry and she threw the knife behind her 
6294_86679_000038_000010	train-clean-360	I thought to myself that I was near my foe and far from my friends and I called to the woman What are you doing here And she said to me What brought you here I told her myself word upon word how I came 
6294_86679_000038_000011	train-clean-360	 Well then said she it was so I came also She showed me to the place where I should come in where she was 
6294_86679_000038_000012	train-clean-360	I went in and I said to her What was the matter that you were putting the knife on the neck of the child It is that he must be cooked for the giant who is here or else no more of my world will be before me Just then we could be hearing the footsteps of the giant What shall I do 
6294_86679_000038_000013	train-clean-360	what shall I do cried the woman 
6294_86679_000038_000014	train-clean-360	I went to the caldron and by luck it was not hot so in it I got just as the brute came in 
none	none	Hast thou boiled that youngster for me he cried He s not done yet said she and I cried out from the caldron Mammy mammy it s boiling I am Then the giant laughed out HAI HAW HOGARAICH and heaped on wood under the caldron And now I was sure I would scald before I could get out of that 
6294_86679_000039_000001	train-clean-360	As fortune favoured me the brute slept beside the caldron 
6294_86679_000039_000002	train-clean-360	There I was scalded by the bottom of the caldron 
6294_86679_000039_000003	train-clean-360	When she perceived that he was asleep she set her mouth quietly to the hole that was in the lid and she said to me was I alive I said I was 
none	none	I put up my head and the hole in the lid was so large that my head went through easily Everything was coming easily with me till I began to bring up my hips I left the skin of my hips behind me but I came out 
6294_86679_000039_000005	train-clean-360	When I got out of the caldron I knew not what to do and she said to me that there was no weapon that would kill him but his own weapon 
none	none	I began to draw his spear and every breath that he drew I thought I would be down his throat and when his breath came out I was back again just as far 
6294_86679_000039_000007	train-clean-360	But with every ill that befell me I got the spear loosed from him 
none	none	Then I was as one under a bundle of straw in a great wind for I could not manage the spear 
6294_86679_000039_000009	train-clean-360	And it was fearful to look on the brute who had but one eye in the midst of his face and it was not agreeable for the like of me to attack him 
none	none	I drew the dart as best I could and I set it in his eye When he felt this he gave his head a lift and he struck the other end of the dart on the top of the cave and it went through to the back of his head 
6294_86679_000039_000012	train-clean-360	And he fell cold dead where he was and you may be sure O king that joy was on me 
none	none	I myself and the woman went out on clear ground and we passed the night there I went and got the boat with which I came and she was no way lightened and took the woman and the child over on dry land and I returned home 
6294_86679_000040_000000	train-clean-360	The king of Lochlann s mother was putting on a fire at this time and listening to Conall telling the tale about the child 
6294_86679_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Is it you said she that were there 
none	none	Well then said he t was I Och och said she t was I that was there and the king is the child whose life you saved and it is to you that life thanks should be given Then they took great joy 
6294_86679_000044_000000	train-clean-360	The king said O Conall you came through great hardships 
none	none	And now the brown horse is yours and his sack full of the most precious things that are in my treasury 
6294_86679_000045_000000	train-clean-360	They lay down that night and if it was early that Conall rose it was earlier than that that the queen was on foot making ready 
6294_86679_000045_000001	train-clean-360	He got the brown horse and his sack full of gold and silver and stones of great price and then Conall and his three sons went away and they returned home to the Erin realm of gladness 
6294_86679_000045_000002	train-clean-360	He left the gold and silver in his house and he went with the horse to the king 
6294_86679_000045_000003	train-clean-360	They were good friends evermore 
none	none	He returned home to his wife and they set in order a feast and that was a feast if ever there was one O son and brother Hudden and Dudden and Donald O Neary Illustration There was once upon a time two farmers and their names were Hudden and Dudden They had poultry in their yards sheep on the uplands and scores of cattle in the meadow land alongside the river But for all that they weren t happy For just between their two farms there lived a poor man by the name of Donald O Neary He had a hovel over his head and a strip of grass that was barely enough to keep his one cow Daisy from starving and though she did her best it was but seldom that Donald got a drink of milk or a roll of butter from Daisy You would think there was little here to make Hudden and Dudden jealous but so it is the more one has the more one wants and Donald s neighbours lay awake of nights scheming how they might get hold of his little strip of grass land Daisy poor thing they never thought of she was just a bag of bones One day Hudden met Dudden and they were soon grumbling as usual and all to the tune of If only we could get that vagabond Donald O Neary out of the country Let s kill Daisy said Hudden at last if that doesn t make him clear out nothing will No sooner said than agreed and it wasn t dark before Hudden and Dudden crept up to the little shed where lay poor Daisy trying her best to chew the cud though she hadn t had as much grass in the day as would cover your hand And when Donald came to see if Daisy was all snug for the night the poor beast had only time to lick his hand once before she died Well Donald was a shrewd fellow and down hearted though he was began to think if he could get any good out of Daisy s death He thought and he thought and the next day you could have seen him trudging off early to the fair Daisy s hide over his shoulder every penny he had jingling in his pockets Just before he got to the fair he made several slits in the hide put a penny in each slit walked into the best inn of the town as bold as if it belonged to him and hanging the hide up to a nail in the wall sat down Some of your best whisky says he to the landlord But the landlord didn t like his looks Is it fearing I won t pay you you are says Donald why I have a hide here that gives me all the money I want And with that he hit it a whack with his stick and out hopped a penny The landlord opened his eyes as you may fancy What ll you take for that hide It s not for sale my good man Will you take a gold piece It s not for sale I tell you Hasn t it kept me and mine for years and with that Donald hit the hide another whack and out jumped a second penny Well the long and the short of it was that Donald let the hide go and that very evening who but he should walk up to Hudden s door Good evening Hudden Will you lend me your best pair of scales Hudden stared and Hudden scratched his head but he lent the scales When Donald was safe at home he pulled out his pocketful of bright gold and began to weigh each piece in the scales But Hudden had put a lump of butter at the bottom and so the last piece of gold stuck fast to the scales when he took them back to Hudden If Hudden had stared before he stared ten times more now and no sooner was Donald s back turned than he was off as hard as he could pelt to Dudden s Good evening Dudden That vagabond bad luck to him You mean Donald O Neary And who else should I mean He s back here weighing out sackfuls of gold How do you know that Here are my scales that he borrowed and here s a gold piece still sticking to them Illustration Off they went together and they came to Donald s door Donald had finished making the last pile of ten gold pieces And he couldn t finish because a piece had stuck to the scales In they walked without an If you please or By your leave Well I never that was all they could say Good evening Hudden good evening Dudden Ah you thought you had played me a fine trick but you never did me a better turn in all your lives When I found poor Daisy dead I thought to myself Well her hide may fetch something and it did Hides are worth their weight in gold in the market just now Hudden nudged Dudden and Dudden winked at Hudden Good evening Donald O Neary Good evening kind friends The next day there wasn t a cow or a calf that belonged to Hudden or Dudden but her hide was going to the fair in Hudden s biggest cart drawn by Dudden s strongest pair of horses When they came to the fair each one took a hide over his arm and there they were walking through the fair bawling out at the top of their voices Hides to sell hides to sell Out came the tanner How much for your hides my good men Their weight in gold It s early in the day to come out of the tavern That was all the tanner said and back he went to his yard Hides to sell Fine fresh hides to sell Out came the cobbler How much for your hides my men Their weight in gold Is it making game of me you are Take that for your pains and the cobbler dealt Hudden a blow that made him stagger Up the people came running from one end of the fair to the other What s the matter What s the matter cried they Here are a couple of vagabonds selling hides at their weight in gold said the cobbler Hold em fast hold em fast bawled the innkeeper who was the last to come up he was so fat I ll wager it s one of the rogues who tricked me out of thirty gold pieces yesterday for a wretched hide It was more kicks than halfpence that Hudden and Dudden got before they were well on their way home again and they didn t run the slower because all the dogs of the town were at their heels Well as you may fancy if they loved Donald little before they loved him less now What s the matter friends said he as he saw them tearing along their hats knocked in and their coats torn off and their faces black and blue Is it fighting you ve been or mayhap you met the police ill luck to them We ll police you you vagabond It s mighty smart you thought yourself deluding us with your lying tales Who deluded you Didn t you see the gold with your own two eyes But it was no use talking Pay for it he must and should There was a meal sack handy and into it Hudden and Dudden popped Donald O Neary tied him up tight ran a pole through the knot and off they started for the Brown Lake of the Bog each with a pole end on his shoulder and Donald O Neary between But the Brown Lake was far the road was dusty Hudden and Dudden were sore and weary and parched with thirst There was an inn by the roadside Let s go in said Hudden I m dead beat It s heavy he is for the little he had to eat If Hudden was willing so was Dudden As for Donald you may be sure his leave wasn t asked but he was lumped down at the inn door for all the world as if he had been a sack of potatoes Sit still you vagabond said Dudden if we don t mind waiting you needn t Donald held his peace but after a while he heard the glasses clink and Hudden singing away at the top of his voice I won t have her I tell you I won t have her said Donald But nobody heeded what he said I won t have her I tell you I won t have her said Donald and this time he said it louder but nobody heeded what he said I won t have her I tell you I won t have her said Donald and this time he said it as loud as he could And who won t you have may I be so bold as to ask said a farmer who had just come up with a drove of cattle and was turning in for a glass It s the king s daughter They are bothering the life out of me to marry her You re the lucky fellow I d give something to be in your shoes Do you see that now Wouldn t it be a fine thing for a farmer to be marrying a princess all dressed in gold and jewels Jewels do you say Ah now couldn t you take me with you Well you re an honest fellow and as I don t care for the king s daughter though she s as beautiful as the day and is covered with jewels from top to toe you shall have her Just undo the cord and let me out they tied me up tight as they knew I d run away from her Out crawled Donald in crept the farmer Now lie still and don t mind the shaking it s only rumbling over the palace steps you ll be And maybe they ll abuse you for a vagabond who won t have the king s daughter but you needn t mind that Ah it s a deal I m giving up for you sure as it is that I don t care for the princess Take my cattle in exchange said the farmer and you may guess it wasn t long before Donald was at their tails driving them homewards Out came Hudden and Dudden and the one took one end of the pole and the other the other I m thinking he s heavier said Hudden Ah never mind said Dudden it s only a step now to the Brown Lake I ll have her now I ll have her now bawled the farmer from inside the sack By my faith and you shall though said Hudden and he laid his stick across the sack I ll have her I ll have her bawled the farmer louder than ever Well here you are said Dudden for they were now come to the Brown Lake and unslinging the sack they pitched it plump into the lake You ll not be playing your tricks on us any longer said Hudden True for you said Dudden Ah Donald my boy it was an ill day when you borrowed my scales Off they went with a light step and an easy heart but when they were near home whom should they see but Donald O Neary and all around him the cows were grazing and the calves were kicking up their heels and butting their heads together Is it you Donald said Dudden Faith you ve been quicker than we have True for you Dudden and let me thank you kindly the turn was good if the will was ill You ll have heard like me that the Brown Lake leads to the Land of Promise I always put it down as lies but it is just as true as my word Look at the cattle Hudden stared and Dudden gaped but they couldn t get over the cattle fine fat cattle they were too It s only the worst I could bring up with me said Donald O Neary the others were so fat there was no driving them Faith too it s little wonder they didn t care to leave with grass as far as you could see and as sweet and juicy as fresh butter Ah now Donald we haven t always been friends said Dudden but as I was just saying you were ever a decent lad and you ll show us the way won t you I don t see that I m called upon to do that there is a power more cattle down there Why shouldn t I have them all to myself Faith they may well say the richer you get the harder the heart You always were a neighbourly lad Donald You wouldn t wish to keep the luck all to yourself True for you Hudden though tis a bad example you set me But I ll not be thinking of old times There is plenty for all there so come along with me Off they trudged with a light heart and an eager step When they came to the Brown Lake the sky was full of little white clouds and if the sky was full the lake was as full Ah now look there they are cried Donald as he pointed to the clouds in the lake Where where cried Hudden and Don t be greedy cried Dudden as he jumped his hardest to be up first with the fat cattle But if he jumped first Hudden wasn t long behind They never came back Maybe they got too fat like the cattle As for Donald O Neary he had cattle and sheep all his days to his heart s content The Shepherd of Myddvai Illustration Up in the Black Mountains in Caermarthenshire lies the lake known as Lyn y Van Vach To the margin of this lake the shepherd of Myddvai once led his lambs and lay there whilst they sought pasture Suddenly from the dark waters of the lake he saw three maidens rise Shaking the bright drops from their hair and gliding to the shore they wandered about amongst his flock They had more than mortal beauty and he was filled with love for her that came nearest to him He offered her the bread he had with him and she took it and tried it but then sang to him Hard baked is thy bread Tis not easy to catch me and then ran off laughing to the lake Next day he took with him bread not so well done and watched for the maidens When they came ashore he offered his bread as before and the maiden tasted it and sang Unbaked is thy bread I will not have thee and again disappeared in the waves A third time did the shepherd of Myddvai try to attract the maiden and this time he offered bread that he had found floating about near the shore This pleased her and she promised to become his wife if he were able to pick her out from among her sisters on the following day When the time came the shepherd knew his love by the strap of her sandal Then she told him she would be as good a wife to him as any earthly maiden could be unless he should strike her three times without cause Of course he deemed that this could never be and she summoning from the lake three cows two oxen and a bull as her marriage portion was led homeward by him as his bride The years passed happily and three children were born to the shepherd and the lake maiden But one day they were going to a christening and she said to her husband it was far to walk so he told her to go for the horses I will said she If you bring me my gloves which I ve left in the house But when he came back with the gloves he found she had not gone for the horses so he tapped her lightly on the shoulder with the gloves and said Go go That s one said she Another time they were at a wedding when suddenly the lake maiden fell a sobbing and a weeping amid the joy and mirth of all around her Her husband tapped her on the shoulder and asked her Why do you weep Because they are entering into trouble and trouble is upon you for that is the second causeless blow you have given me Be careful the third is the last The husband was very careful never to strike her But one day at a funeral she suddenly burst out into fits of laughter Her husband forgot and touched her rather roughly on the shoulder saying Is this a time for laughter I laugh she said because those that die go out of trouble but your trouble has come The last blow has been struck our marriage is at an end and so farewell And with that she rose up and left the house and went to their home Then she looking round upon her home called to the cattle she had brought with her Brindle cow white speckled Spotted cow bold freckled Old white face and grey Geringer And the white bull from the king s coast Grey ox and black calf All all follow me home Now the black calf had just been slaughtered and was hanging on the hook but it got off the hook alive and well and followed her and the oxen though they were ploughing trailed the plough with them and did her bidding So she fled to the lake again they following her and with them plunged into the dark waters And to this day is the furrow seen which the plough left as it was dragged across the mountains to the tarn Only once did she come again when her sons were grown to manhood and then she gave them gifts of healing by which they won the name of Meddygon Myddvai the physicians of Myddvai The Sprightly Tailor Illustration 
7315-86682-0000	train-other-500	A Sprightly tailor was employed by the great Macdonald in his castle at Saddell
none	none	 in order to make the laird a pair of trews used in olden time 
7315-86682-0001	train-other-500	And trews being the vest and breeches united in one piece and ornamented with fringes were very comfortable and suitable to be worn in walking or dancing
none	none	 Macdonald had said to the tailor that if he would make the trews by night in the church he would get a handsome reward For it was thought that the old ruined church was haunted 
7315-86682-0002	train-other-500	and that fearsome things were to be seen there at night The tailor was well aware of this but he was a sprightly man and when the laird dared him to make the trews
none	none	 by night in the church the tailor was not to be daunted 
7315-86682-0003	train-other-500	but took it in hand to gain the prize So when night came away he went up the glen about half a mile distance from the castle till he came to the old church Then he chose him a nice grave stone for a seat
none	none	 and he lighted his candle 
7315-86682-0004	train-other-500	and put on his thimble and set to work at the trews plying his needle nimbly
none	none	 and thinking about the hire that the laird would have to give him For some time he got on pretty well until he felt the floor all of a tremble under his feet and looking about him but keeping his fingers at work he saw the appearance of a great human head rising up through the stone pavement of the church And when the head had risen above the surface there came from it a great great voice And the voice said 
7315-86682-0005	train-other-500	Do you see this great head of mine I see that but I ll sew this replied the sprightly tailor and he stitched away at the trews Then the head rose higher up through the pavement until its neck appeared And when its neck was shown
7315-86682-0006	train-other-500	the thundering voice came again and said Do you see this great neck of mine I see that but I ll sew this said the sprightly tailor
none	none	 and he stitched away at his trews 
7315-86682-0007	train-other-500	Then the head and neck rose higher still until the great shoulders and chest were shown above the ground And again the mighty voice thundered Do you see this great chest of mine And again the sprightly tailor replied
7315-86682-0008	train-other-500	I see that but I ll sew this and stitched away at his trews And still it kept rising through the pavement until it shook a great pair of arms in the tailor s face and said Do you see these great arms of mine
none	none	 I see those but I ll sew this answered the tailor and he stitched hard at his trews for he knew that he had 
7315-86682-0009	train-other-500	no time to lose The sprightly tailor was taking the long stitches when he saw it gradually rising and rising through the floor
none	none	 until it lifted out a great leg 
7315-86682-0010	train-other-500	and stamping with it upon the pavement
none	none	 said in a roaring voice 
7315-86682-0011	train-other-500	Do you see this great leg of mine Aye aye I see that but I ll sew this cried the tailor and his fingers flew with the needle and he took such long stitches that he was just come to the end of the trews when
7315-86682-0012	train-other-500	it was taking up its other leg But before it could pull it out of the pavement the sprightly tailor had finished his task and
none	none	 blowing out his candle and springing from off his grave stone he buckled up and ran out of the church with the trews under his arm Then the fearsome thing gave a loud roar and stamped with both his feet upon the pavement 
7315-86682-0013	train-other-500	and out of the church he went after the sprightly tailor Down the glen they ran faster than the stream
none	none	 when the flood rides it 
7315-86682-0014	train-other-500	but the tailor had got the start and a nimble pair of legs and he did not choose to lose the laird s reward And though the thing roared to him to stop
none	none	 yet the sprightly tailor was not the man to be beholden to a monster 
7315-86682-0015	train-other-500	So he held his trews tight and let no darkness grow under his feet
none	none	 until he had reached Saddell Castle 
7315-86682-0016	train-other-500	He had no sooner got inside the gate and shut it than the monster came up to it and enraged at losing his prize struck the wall above the gate and left there the mark of his five great fingers
7315-86682-0017	train-other-500	You may see them plainly to this day if you ll only peer close enough
none	none	 But the sprightly tailor gained his reward for Macdonald paid him handsomely for the trews and never discovered that a few of the stitches were somewhat long The Story of Deirdre Illustration There was a man in Ireland once who was called Malcolm Harper 
6553_86683_000003_000001	train-clean-360	The man was a right good man and he had a goodly share of this world s goods He had a wife but no family 
none	none	What did Malcolm hear but that a soothsayer had come home to the place and as the man was a right good man he wished that the soothsayer might come near them 
6553_86683_000003_000003	train-clean-360	Whether it was that he was invited or that he came of himself the soothsayer came to the house of Malcolm 
none	none	Are you doing any soothsaying says Malcolm
6553_86683_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes I am doing a little 
none	none	Are you in need of soothsaying
6553_86683_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I do not mind taking soothsaying from you if you had soothsaying for me and you would be willing to do it 
none	none	Well I will do soothsaying for you What kind of soothsaying do you want Well the soothsaying I wanted was that you would tell me my lot or what will happen to me if you can give me knowledge of it
6553_86683_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I am going out and when I return I will tell you 
none	none	And the soothsayer went forth out of the house and he was not long outside when he returned Well said the soothsayer I saw in my second sight that it is on account of a daughter of yours that the greatest amount of blood shall be shed that has ever been shed in Erin since time and race began 
6553_86683_000011_000001	train-clean-360	And the three most famous heroes that ever were found will lose their heads on her account 
none	none	After a time a daughter was born to Malcolm 
6553_86683_000012_000001	train-clean-360	He did not allow a living being to come to his house only himself and the nurse 
6553_86683_000012_000002	train-clean-360	He asked this woman Will you yourself bring up the child to keep her in hiding far away where eye will not see a sight of her nor ear hear a word about her 
none	none	The woman said she would so Malcolm got three men and he took them away to a large mountain distant and far from reach without the knowledge or notice of any one 
6553_86683_000013_000001	train-clean-360	He caused there a hillock round and green to be dug out of the middle and the hole thus made to be covered carefully over so that a little company could dwell there together 
6553_86683_000013_000002	train-clean-360	This was done 
6553_86683_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Deirdre and her foster mother dwelt in the bothy mid the hills without the knowledge or the suspicion of any living person about them and without anything occurring until Deirdre was sixteen years of age Deirdre grew like the white sapling straight and trim as the rash on the moss 
none	none	She was the creature of fairest form of loveliest aspect and of gentlest nature that existed between earth and heaven in all Ireland whatever colour of hue she had before there was nobody that looked into her face but she would blush fiery red over it 
6553_86683_000015_000000	train-clean-360	The woman that had charge of her gave Deirdre every information and skill of which she herself had knowledge and skill 
6553_86683_000015_000001	train-clean-360	There was not a blade of grass growing from root nor a bird singing in the wood nor a star shining from heaven but Deirdre had a name for it 
6553_86683_000015_000002	train-clean-360	But one thing she did not wish her to have either part or parley with any single living man of the rest of the world 
6553_86683_000015_000003	train-clean-360	But on a gloomy winter night with black scowling clouds a hunter of game was wearily travelling the hills and what happened but that he missed the trail of the hunt and lost his course and companions 
none	none	A drowsiness came upon the man as he wearily wandered over the hills and he laid down by the side of the beautiful green knoll in which Deirdre lived and he slept The man was faint from hunger and wandering and benumbed with cold and a deep sleep fell upon him When he lay down beside the green hill where Deirdre was a troubled dream came to the man and he thought that he enjoyed the warmth of a fairy broch the fairies being inside playing music The hunter shouted out in his dream if there was any one in the broch to let him in for the Holy One s sake Deirdre heard the voice and said to her foster mother O foster mother what cry is that It is nothing at all Deirdre merely the birds of the air astray and seeking each other But let them go past to the bosky glade 
6553_86683_000015_000009	train-clean-360	There is no shelter or house for them here O foster mother the bird asked to get inside for the sake of the God of the Elements and you yourself tell me that anything that is asked in His name we ought to do 
6553_86683_000015_000010	train-clean-360	If you will not allow the bird that is being benumbed with cold and done to death with hunger to be let in I do not think much of your language or your faith 
none	none	But since I give credence to your language and to your faith which you taught me I will myself let in the bird And Deirdre arose and drew the bolt from the leaf of the door and she let in the hunter 
6553_86683_000015_000012	train-clean-360	She placed a seat in the place for sitting food in the place for eating and drink in the place for drinking for the man who came to the house 
none	none	Oh for this life and raiment you man that came in keep restraint on your tongue said the old woman It is not a great thing for you to keep your mouth shut and your tongue quiet when you get a home and shelter of a hearth on a gloomy winter s night Well said the hunter I may do that keep my mouth shut and my tongue quiet since I came to the house and received hospitality from you but by the hand of thy father and grandfather and by your own two hands if some other of the people of the world saw this beauteous creature you have here hid away they would not long leave her with you I swear
6553_86683_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 What men are these you refer to said Deirdre 
none	none	Well I will tell you young woman said the hunter They are Naois son of Uisnech and Allen and Arden his two brothers What like are these men when seen if we were to see them said Deirdre Why the aspect and form of the men when seen are these said the hunter they have the colour of the raven on their hair their skin like swan on the wave in whiteness and their cheeks as the blood of the brindled red calf and their speed and their leap are those of the salmon of the torrent and the deer of the grey mountain side And Naois is head and shoulders over the rest of the people of Erin However they are said the nurse be you off from here and take another road And King of Light and Sun in good sooth and certainty little are my thanks for yourself or for her that let you in The hunter went away and went straight to the palace of King Connachar He sent word in to the king that he wished to speak to him if he pleased The king answered the message and came out to speak to the man What is the reason of your journey said the king to the hunter Illustration Deirdre O Nurse what cry is that Only the birds of the air calling one to the other There is no home for them here Let them go by to the thicket I have only to tell you O king said the hunter that I saw the fairest creature that ever was born in Erin and I came to tell you of it Who is this beauty and where is she to be seen when she was not seen before till you saw her if you did see her
6553_86683_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I did see her said the hunter 
6553_86683_000026_000001	train-clean-360	 But if I did no man else can see her unless he get directions from me as to where she is dwelling 
6553_86683_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 And will you direct me to where she dwells and the reward of your directing me will be as good as the reward of your message said the king 
6553_86683_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I will direct you O king although it is likely that this will not be what they want said the hunter 
6553_86683_000029_000000	train-clean-360	Connachar king of Ulster sent for his nearest kinsmen and he told them of his intent 
none	none	Though early rose the song of the birds mid the rocky caves and the music of the birds in the grove earlier than that did Connachar king of Ulster arise with his little troop of dear friends in the delightful twilight of the fresh and gentle May the dew was heavy on each bush and flower and stem as they went to bring Deirdre forth from the green knoll where she stayed Many a youth was there who had a lithe leaping and lissom step when they started whose step was faint failing and faltering when they reached the bothy on account of the length of the way and roughness of the road Yonder now down in the bottom of the glen is the bothy where the woman dwells but I will not go nearer than this to the old woman said the hunter 
6553_86683_000030_000000	train-clean-360	Connachar with his band of kinsfolk went down to the green knoll where Deirdre dwelt and he knocked at the door of the bothy 
6553_86683_000030_000001	train-clean-360	The nurse replied No less than a king s command and a king s army could put me out of my bothy to night 
6553_86683_000030_000002	train-clean-360	And I should be obliged to you were you to tell who it is that wants me to open my bothy door It is I Connachar king of Ulster When the poor woman heard who was at the door she rose with haste and let in the king and all that could get in of his retinue 
6553_86683_000031_000000	train-clean-360	When the king saw the woman that was before him that he had been in quest of he thought he never saw in the course of the day nor in the dream of night a creature so fair as Deirdre and he gave his full heart s weight of love to her 
6553_86683_000031_000001	train-clean-360	Deirdre was raised on the topmost of the heroes shoulders and she and her foster mother were brought to the Court of King Connachar of Ulster 
6553_86683_000032_000000	train-clean-360	With the love that Connachar had for her he wanted to marry Deirdre right off there and then will she nill she marry him 
none	none	But she said to him I would be obliged to you if you will give me the respite of a year and a day He said I will grant you that hard though it is if you will give me your unfailing promise that you will marry me at the year s end And she gave the promise Connachar got for her a woman teacher and merry modest maidens fair that would lie down and rise with her that would play and speak with her 
6553_86683_000032_000003	train-clean-360	Deirdre was clever in maidenly duties and wifely understanding and Connachar thought he never saw with bodily eye a creature that pleased him more 
none	none	Deirdre and her women companions were one day out on the hillock behind the house enjoying the scene and drinking in the sun s heat What did they see coming but three men a journeying 
6553_86683_000032_000006	train-clean-360	Deirdre was looking at the men that were coming and wondering at them 
none	none	When the men neared them Deirdre remembered the language of the huntsman and she said to herself that these were the three sons of Uisnech and that this was Naois he having what was above the bend of the two shoulders above the men of Erin all The three brothers went past without taking any notice of them without even glancing at the young girls on the hillock What happened but that love for Naois struck the heart of Deirdre so that she could not but follow after him 
6553_86683_000032_000010	train-clean-360	She girded up her raiment and went after the men that went past the base of the knoll leaving her women attendants there 
none	none	Allen and Arden had heard of the woman that Connachar king of Ulster had with him and they thought that if Naois their brother saw her he would have her himself more especially as she was not married to the king 
6553_86683_000032_000012	train-clean-360	They perceived the woman coming and called on one another to hasten their step as they had a long distance to travel and the dusk of night was coming on They did so 
none	none	She cried Naois son of Uisnech will you leave me What piercing shrill cry is that the most melodious my ear ever heard and the shrillest that ever struck my heart of all the cries I ever heard
6553_86683_000032_000014	train-clean-360	 It isn t anything else but the wail of the wave swans of Connachar said his brothers 
none	none	No yonder is a woman s cry of distress said Naois and he swore he would not go further until he saw from whom the cry came and Naois turned back Naois and Deirdre met and Deirdre kissed Naois three times and a kiss each to his brothers 
6553_86683_000032_000017	train-clean-360	With the confusion that she was in Deirdre went into a crimson blaze of fire and her colour came and went as rapidly as the movement of the aspen by the stream side 
none	none	Naois thought he never saw a fairer creature and Naois gave Deirdre the love that he never gave to thing to vision or to creature but to herself Then Naois placed Deirdre on the topmost height of his shoulder and told his brothers to keep up their pace and they kept up their pace Naois thought that it would not be well for him to remain in Erin on account of the way in which Connachar king of Ulster his uncle s son had gone against him because of the woman though he had not married her and he turned back to Alba that is Scotland 
6553_86683_000033_000001	train-clean-360	He reached the side of Loch Ness and made his habitation there 
none	none	He could kill the salmon of the torrent from out his own door and the deer of the grey gorge from out his window Naois and Deirdre and Allen and Arden dwelt in a tower and they were happy so long a time as they were there 
6553_86683_000034_000000	train-clean-360	By this time the end of the period came at which Deirdre had to marry Connachar king of Ulster 
none	none	Connachar made up his mind to take Deirdre away by the sword whether she was married to Naois or not So he prepared a great and gleeful feast 
6553_86683_000034_000003	train-clean-360	He sent word far and wide through Erin to all his kinspeople to come to the feast 
none	none	Connachar thought to himself that Naois would not come though he should bid him and the scheme that arose in his mind was to send for his father s brother Ferchar Mac Ro and to send him on an embassy to Naois He did so and Connachar said to Ferchar Tell Naois son of Uisnech that I am setting forth a great and gleeful feast to my friends and kinspeople throughout the wide extent of Erin all and that I shall not have rest by day nor sleep by night if he and Allen and Arden be not partakers of the feast Ferchar Mac Ro and his three sons went on their journey and reached the tower where Naois was dwelling by the side of Loch Etive The sons of Uisnech gave a cordial kindly welcome to Ferchar Mac Ro and his three sons and asked of him the news of Erin The best news that I have for you said the hardy hero is that Connachar king of Ulster is setting forth a great sumptuous feast to his friends and kinspeople throughout the wide extent of Erin all and he has vowed by the earth beneath him by the high heaven above him and by the sun that wends to the west that he will have no rest by day nor sleep by night if the sons of Uisnech the sons of his own father s brother will not come back to the land of their home and the soil of their nativity and to the feast likewise and he has sent us on embassy to invite you We will go with you said Naois We will said his brothers But Deirdre did not wish to go with Ferchar Mac Ro and she tried every prayer to turn Naois from going with him she said I saw a vision Naois and do you interpret it to me said Deirdre then she sang O Naois son of Uisnech hear What was shown in a dream to me 
6553_86683_000041_000000	train-clean-360	There came three white doves out of the South Flying over the sea And drops of honey were in their mouth From the hive of the honey bee 
none	none	O Naois son of Uisnech hear What was shown in a dream to me 
6553_86683_000043_000000	train-clean-360	I saw three grey hawks out of the South Come flying over the sea And the red drops they bare in their mouth They were dearer than life to me 
none	none	Said Naois 
6553_86683_000045_000000	train-clean-360	It is nought but the fear of woman s heart And a dream of the night Deirdre 
6553_86683_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 The day that Connachar sent the invitation to his feast will be unlucky for us if we don t go O Deirdre 
none	none	You will go there said Ferchar Mac Ro and if Connachar show kindness to you show ye kindness to him and if he will display wrath towards you display ye wrath towards him and I and my three sons will be with you We will said Daring Drop We will said Hardy Holly We will said Fiallan the Fair I have three sons and they are three heroes and in any harm or danger that may befall you they will be with you and I myself will be along with them And Ferchar Mac Ro gave his vow and his word in presence of his arms that in any harm or danger that came in the way of the sons of Uisnech he and his three sons would not leave head on live body in Erin despite sword or helmet spear or shield blade or mail be they ever so good Deirdre was unwilling to leave Alba but she went with Naois 
6553_86683_000050_000001	train-clean-360	Deirdre wept tears in showers and she sang 
none	none	Dear is the land the land over there Alba full of woods and lakes Bitter to my heart is leaving thee But I go away with Naois Ferchar Mac Ro did not stop till he got the sons of Uisnech away with him despite the suspicion of Deirdre The coracle was put to sea The sail was hoisted to it And the second morrow they arrived On the white shores of Erin As soon as the sons of Uisnech landed in Erin Ferchar Mac Ro sent word to Connachar king of Ulster that the men whom he wanted were come and let him now show kindness to them Well said Connachar I did not expect that the sons of Uisnech would come though I sent for them and I am not quite ready to receive them 
6553_86683_000054_000002	train-clean-360	But there is a house down yonder where I keep strangers and let them go down to it to day and my house will be ready before them to morrow 
6553_86683_000055_000000	train-clean-360	But he that was up in the palace felt it long that he was not getting word as to how matters were going on for those down in the house of the strangers 
6553_86683_000055_000001	train-clean-360	 Go you Gelban Grednach son of Lochlin s King go you down and bring me information as to whether her former hue and complexion are on Deirdre 
none	none	If they be I will take her out with edge of blade and point of sword and if not let Naios son of Uisnech have her for himself said Connachar Gelban the cheering and charming son of Lochlin s King went down to the place of the strangers where the sons of Uisnech and Deirdre were staying He looked in through the bicker hole on the door leaf 
6553_86683_000056_000002	train-clean-360	Now she that he gazed upon used to go into a crimson blaze of blushes when any one looked at her 
none	none	Naois looked at Deirdre and knew that some one was looking at her from the back of the door leaf He seized one of the dice on the table before him and fired it through the bicker hole and knocked the eye out of Gelban Grednach the Cheerful and Charming right through the back of his head Gelban returned back to the palace of King Connachar You were cheerful charming going away but you are cheerless charmless returning What has happened to you Gelban But have you seen her and are Deirdre s hue and complexion as before said Connachar Well I have seen Deirdre and I saw her also truly and while I was looking at her through the bicker hole on the door Naois son of Uisnech knocked out my eye with one of the dice in his hand But of a truth and verity although he put out even my eye it were my desire still to remain looking at her with the other eye were it not for the hurry you told me to be in said Gelban That is true said Connachar let three hundred brave heroes go down to the abode of the strangers and let them bring hither to me Deirdre and kill the rest 
6553_86683_000060_000000	train-clean-360	Connachar ordered three hundred active heroes to go down to the abode of the strangers and to take Deirdre up with them and kill the rest The pursuit is coming said Deirdre 
none	none	Yes but I will myself go out and stop the pursuit said Naois It is not you but we that will go said Daring Drop and Hardy Holly and Fiallan the Fair it is to us that our father entrusted your defence from harm and danger when he himself left for home And the gallant youths full noble full manly full handsome with beauteous brown locks went forth girt with battle arms fit for fierce fight and clothed with combat dress for fierce contest fit which was burnished bright brilliant bladed blazing on which were many pictures of beasts and birds and creeping things lions and lithe limbed tigers brown eagle and harrying hawk and adder fierce and the young heroes laid low three thirds of the company Connachar came out in haste and cried with wrath Who is there on the floor of fight slaughtering my men We the three sons of Ferchar Mac Ro Well said the king I will give a free bridge to your grandfather a free bridge to your father and a free bridge each to you three brothers if you come over to my side to night
6553_86683_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 Well Connachar we will not accept that offer from you nor thank you for it 
6553_86683_000066_000001	train-clean-360	Greater by far do we prefer to go home to our father and tell the deeds of heroism we have done than accept anything on these terms from you 
none	none	Naois son of Uisnech and Allen and Arden are as nearly related to yourself as they are to us though you are so keen to shed their blood and you would shed our blood also Connachar And the noble manly handsome youths with beauteous brown locks returned inside We are now said they going home to tell our father that you are now safe from the hands of the king And the youths all fresh and tall and lithe and beautiful went home to their father to tell that the sons of Uisnech were safe This happened at the parting of the day and night in the morning twilight time and Naois said they must go away leave that house and return to Alba Naois and Deirdre Allen and Arden started to return to Alba 
6553_86683_000067_000001	train-clean-360	Word came to the king that the company he was in pursuit of were gone 
none	none	The king then sent for Duanan Gacha Druid the best magician he had and he spake to him as follows Much wealth have I expended on you Duanan Gacha Druid to give schooling and learning and magic mystery to you I ll hold you to account if these people get away from me to day without care without consideration or regard for me without chance of overtaking them and without power to stop them Well I will stop them said the magician until the company you send in pursuit return And the magician placed a wood before them through which no man could go but the sons of Uisnech marched through the wood without halt or hesitation and Deirdre held on to Naois s hand
6553_86683_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 What is the good of that 
6553_86683_000069_000001	train-clean-360	that will not do yet said Connachar They are off without bending of their feet or stopping of their step without heed or respect to me and I am without power to keep up to them or opportunity to turn them back this night 
6553_86683_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 I will try another plan on them said the druid and he placed before them a grey sea instead of a green plain 
none	none	The three heroes stripped and tied their clothes behind their heads and Naois placed Deirdre on the top of his shoulder They stretched their sides to the stream And sea and land were to them the same The rough grey ocean was the same As meadow land green and plain
6553_86683_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 Though that be good O Duanan it will not make the heroes return said Connachar they are gone without regard for me and without honor to me and without power on my part to pursue them or to force them to return this night 
none	none	Illustration
6553_86683_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 We shall try another method on them since yon one did not stop them said the druid 
none	none	And the druid froze the grey ridged sea into hard rocky knobs the sharpness of sword being on the one edge and the poison power of adders on the other

wife lovely to me at the trysting place came thy clear voice through the woods of Ireland I cannot eat or smile henceforth Break not to day my heart soon enough shall I lie within my grave Strong are the waves of sorrow but stronger is sorrow s self Connachar The people then gathered round the heroes bodies and asked Connachar what was to be done with the bodies The order that he gave was that they should dig a pit and put the three brothers in it side by side Deirdre kept sitting on the brink of the grave constantly asking the gravediggers to dig the pit wide and free When the bodies of the brothers were put in the grave Deirdre said Come over hither Naois my love Let Arden close to Allen lie If the dead had any sense to feel Ye would have made a place for Deirdre The men did as she told them She jumped into the grave and lay down by Naois and she was dead by his side The king ordered the body to be raised from out the grave and to be buried on the other side of the loch It was done as the king bade and the pit closed Thereupon a fir shoot grew out of the grave of Deirdre and a fir shoot from the grave of Naois and the two shoots united in a knot above the loch The king ordered the shoots to be cut down and this was done twice until at the third time the wife whom the king had married caused him to stop this work of evil and his vengeance on the remains of the dead

Illustration Gold Tree and Silver Tree Illustration Once upon a time there was a king who had a wife whose name was Silver tree and a daughter whose name was Gold tree On a certain day of the days Gold tree and Silver tree went to a glen where there was a well and in it there was a trout Said Silver tree Troutie bonny little fellow am not I the most beautiful queen in the world Oh indeed you are not Who then Why Gold tree your daughter Silver tree went home blind with rage She lay down on the bed and vowed she would never be well until she could get the heart and the liver of Gold tree her daughter to eat At nightfall the king came home and it was told him that Silver tree his wife was very ill He went where she was and asked her what was wrong with her Oh only a thing which you may heal if you like Oh indeed there is nothing at all which I could do for you that I would not do If I get the heart and the liver of Gold tree my daughter to eat I shall be well Now it happened about this time that the son of a great king had come from abroad to ask Gold tree for marrying The king now agreed to this and they went abroad The king then went and sent his lads to the hunting hill for a he goat and he gave its heart and its liver to his wife to eat and she rose well and healthy A year after this Silver tree went to the glen where there was the well in which there was the trout Troutie bonny little fellow said she am not I the most beautiful queen in the world Oh indeed you are not Who then Why Gold tree your daughter Oh well it is long since she was living It is a year since I ate her heart and liver Oh indeed she is not dead She is married to a great prince abroad Silver tree went home and begged the king to put the long ship in order and said I am going to see my dear Gold tree for it is so long since I saw her The long ship was put in order and they went away It was Silver tree herself that was at the helm and she steered the ship so well that they were not long at all before they arrived The prince was out hunting on the hills Gold tree knew the long ship of her father coming Oh she said to the servants my mother is coming and she will kill me She shall not kill you at all we will lock you in a room where she cannot get near you This is how it was done and when Silver tree came ashore she began to cry out Come to meet your own mother when she comes to see you Gold tree said that she could not that she was locked in the room and that she could not get out of it Will you not put out said Silver tree your little finger through the key hole so that your own mother may give a kiss to it She put out her little finger and Silver tree went and put a poisoned stab in it and Gold tree fell dead Illustration When the prince came home and found Gold tree dead he was in great sorrow and when he saw how beautiful she was he did not bury her at all but he locked her in a room where nobody would get near her In the course of time he married again and the whole house was under the hand of this wife but one room and he himself always kept the key of that room On a certain day of the days he forgot to take the key with him and the second wife got into the room What did she see there but the most beautiful woman that she ever saw She began to turn and try to wake her and she noticed the poisoned stab in her finger She took the stab out and Gold tree rose alive as beautiful as she was ever At the fall of night the prince came home from the hunting hill looking very downcast What gift said his wife would you give me that I could make you laugh Oh indeed nothing could make me laugh except Gold tree were to come alive again Well you ll find her alive down there in the room When the prince saw Gold tree alive he made great rejoicings and he began to kiss her and kiss her and kiss her Said the second wife Since she is the first one you had it is better for you to stick to her and I will go away Oh indeed you shall not go away but I shall have both of you At the end of the year Silver tree went to the glen where there was the well in which there was the trout Troutie bonny little fellow said she am not I the most beautiful queen in the world Oh indeed you are not Who then Why Gold tree your daughter Oh well she is not alive It is a year since I put the poisoned stab into her finger Oh indeed she is not dead at all at all Silver tree went home and begged the king to put the long ship in order for that she was going to see her dear Gold tree as it was so long since she saw her The long ship was put in order and they went away It was Silver tree herself that was at the helm and she steered the ship so well that they were not long at all before they arrived The prince was out hunting on the hills Gold tree knew her father s ship coming Oh said she my mother is coming and she will kill me Not at all said the second wife we will go down to meet her Silver tree came ashore Come down Gold tree love said she for your own mother has come to you with a precious drink It is a custom in this country said the second wife that the person who offers a drink takes a draught out of it first Silver tree put her mouth to it and the second wife went and struck it so that some of it went down her throat and she fell dead They had only to carry her home a dead corpse and bury her The prince and his two wives were long alive

7263-86687-0006	train-other-500	and an apple of gold was at each corner Precious gold was upon the stirrups and shoes and the blade of grass bent not beneath them so light was the courser s tread as he went towards the gate of King Arthur s palace
7263-86687-0007	train-other-500	Arthur received him with great ceremony and asked him to remain at the palace but the youth replied that he came not to consume meat and drink but to ask a boon of the king Then said Arthur
7263-86687-0008	train-other-500	Since thou wilt not remain here chieftain thou shalt receive the boon whatsoever thy tongue may name as far as the wind dries and the rain moistens and the sun revolves and the sea encircles and the earth extends

7263-86687-0011	train-other-500	Then said Arthur O chieftain I have never heard of the maiden of whom thou speakest nor of her kindred but I will gladly send messengers in search of her And the youth said
7263-86687-0012	train-other-500	I will willingly grant from this night to that at the end of the year to do so Then Arthur sent messengers to every land within his dominions to seek for the maiden
7263-86687-0013	train-other-500	and at the end of the year Arthur s messengers returned without having gained any knowledge or information concerning Olwen more than on the first day Then said Kilhuch Every one has received his boon and I yet lack mine
7263-86687-0014	train-other-500	I will depart and bear away thy honour with me Then said Kay Rash chieftain dost thou reproach Arthur Go with us and we will not part until thou dost either confess that the maiden exists not in the world
7263-86687-0015	train-other-500	or until we obtain her Thereupon Kay rose up Kay had this peculiarity that his breath lasted nine nights and nine days under water and he could exist nine nights and nine days without sleep
7263-86687-0016	train-other-500	A wound from Kay s sword no physician could heal Very subtle was Kay When it pleased him he could render himself as tall as the highest tree in the forest And he had another peculiarity
7263-86687-0017	train-other-500	so great was the heat of his nature that when it rained hardest whatever he carried remained dry for a handbreadth above and a handbreadth below his hand and when his companions were coldest
7263-86687-0018	train-other-500	it was to them as fuel with which to light their fire And Arthur called Bedwyr who never shrank from any enterprise upon which Kay was bound None was equal to him in swiftness throughout this island except Arthur

none	none	 Another property he had 
7263-86687-0020	train-other-500	his lance would produce a wound equal to nine opposing lances And Arthur called to Kynthelig the guide Go thou upon this expedition with the chieftain
7263-86687-0021	train-other-500	For as good a guide was he in a land which he had never seen as he was in his own
none	none	 He called Gwrhyr Gwalstawt Ieithoedd because he knew all tongues He called Gwalchmai the son of Gwyar because he never returned home without achieving the adventure of which he went in quest 
7263-86687-0022	train-other-500	He was the best of footmen and the best of knights He was nephew to Arthur the son of his sister and his cousin And Arthur called Menw the son of Tiergwaeth in order that if they went into a savage country
7263-86687-0023	train-other-500	he might cast a charm and an illusion over them so that none might see them whilst they could see every one They journeyed on till they came to a vast open plain wherein they saw a great castle
7263-86687-0024	train-other-500	which was the fairest in the world But so far away was it that at night it seemed no nearer and they scarcely reached it on the third day When they came before the castle they beheld a vast flock of sheep boundless and without end
7263-86687-0025	train-other-500	They told their errand to the herdsman who endeavoured to dissuade them since none who had come thither on that quest had returned alive They gave to him a gold ring which he conveyed to his wife telling her who the visitors were
7263-86687-0026	train-other-500	On the approach of the latter she ran out with joy to greet them and sought to throw her arms about their necks But Kay snatching a billet out of the pile placed the log between her two hands
7263-86687-0027	train-other-500	and she squeezed it so that it became a twisted coil O woman said Kay if thou hadst squeezed me thus none could ever again have set their affections on me Evil love were this They entered the house
7263-86687-0028	train-other-500	and after meat she told them that the maiden Olwen came there every Saturday to wash They pledged their faith that they would not harm her and a message was sent to her So Olwen came clothed in a robe of flame coloured silk
7263-86687-0029	train-other-500	and with a collar of ruddy gold in which were emeralds and rubies about her neck More golden was her hair than the flower of the broom and her skin was whiter than the foam of the wave

7263-86687-0030	train-other-500	amidst the spray of the meadow fountain Brighter were her glances than those of a falcon her bosom was more snowy than the breast of the white swan her cheek redder than the reddest roses
7263-86687-0031	train-other-500	Whoso beheld was filled with her love Four white trefoils sprang up wherever she trod and therefore was she called Olwen Then Kilhuch sitting beside her on a bench told her his love
7263-86687-0032	train-other-500	and she said that he would win her as his bride if he granted whatever her father asked Accordingly they went up to the castle and laid their request before him Raise up the forks beneath my two eyebrows which have fallen over my eyes
none	none	 said Yspathaden Penkawr 
7263-86687-0033	train-other-500	that I may see the fashion of my son in law They did so and he promised them an answer on the morrow
none	none	 But as they were going forth Yspathaden seized one of the three poisoned darts 
7263-86687-0034	train-other-500	that lay beside him and threw it back after them And Bedwyr caught it and flung it back
none	none	 wounding Yspathaden in the knee Then said he A cursed ungentle son in law 
7263-86687-0035	train-other-500	truly I shall ever walk the worse for his rudeness This poisoned iron pains me like the bite of a gad fly Cursed be the smith who forged it
none	none	 and the anvil whereon it was wrought Illustration The knights rested in the house of Custennin 
7263-86687-0036	train-other-500	the herdsman but the next day at dawn they returned to the castle and renewed their request
none	none	 Yspathaden said it was necessary that he should consult Olwen s four great grandmothers 
7263-86687-0037	train-other-500	and her four great grand sires The knights again withdrew and as they were going he took the second dart and cast it after them But Menw caught it and flung it back
none	none	 piercing Yspathaden s breast with it so that it came out at the small of his back 
7263-86687-0038	train-other-500	A cursed ungentle son in law truly says he the hard iron pains me like the bite of a horse leech Cursed be the hearth whereon it was heated Henceforth whenever I go up a hill
7263-86687-0039	train-other-500	I shall have a scant in my breath and a pain in my chest
none	none	 On the third day the knights returned once more to the palace and Yspathaden took the third dart and cast it at them 
7263-86687-0040	train-other-500	But Kilhuch caught it and threw it vigorously and wounded him through the eyeball so that the dart came out at the back of his head A cursed ungentle son in law truly As long as I remain alive my eyesight will be the worse
7263-86687-0041	train-other-500	Whenever I go against the wind my eyes will water and peradventure my head will burn and I shall have a giddiness every new moon
none	none	 Cursed be the fire in which it was forged Like the bite of a mad dog is the stroke of this poisoned iron And they went to meat Said Yspathaden Penkawr 
7263-86687-0042	train-other-500	Is it thou that seekest my daughter It is I answered Kilhuch I must have thy pledge that thou wilt not do towards me otherwise than is just and when I have gotten that which I shall name my daughter thou shalt have
none	none	 I promise thee that willingly said Kilhuch 
7263-86687-0043	train-other-500	name what thou wilt I will do so said he Throughout the world there is not a comb or scissors with which I can arrange my hair on account of its rankness except the comb and scissors that are between the two ears
none	none	 of Turch Truith the son of Prince Tared He will not give them of his own free will and thou wilt not be able to compel him It will be easy for me to compass this although thou mayest think that it will not be easy Though thou get this there is yet that which thou wilt not get It will not be possible to hunt Turch Truith without Drudwyn the whelp of Greid the son of Eri and know that throughout the world there is not a huntsman who can hunt with this dog except Mabon the son of Modron He was taken from his mother when three nights old and it is not known where he is now nor whether he is living or dead It will be easy for me to compass this although thou mayest think that it will not be easy Though thou get this there is yet that which thou wilt not get Thou wilt not get Mabon for it is not known where he is unless thou find Eidoel his kinsman in blood the son of Aer For it would be useless to seek for him He is his cousin It will be easy for me to compass this although thou mayest think that it will not be easy Horses shall I have and chivalry and my lord and kinsman Arthur will obtain for me all these things And I shall gain thy daughter and thou shalt lose thy life Go forward And thou shalt not be chargeable for food or raiment for my daughter while thou art seeking these things and when thou hast compassed all these marvels thou shalt have my daughter for wife Now when they told Arthur how they had sped Arthur said Which of these marvels will it be best for us to seek first It will be best said they to seek Mabon the son of Modron and he will not be found unless we first find Eidoel the son of Aer his kinsman Then Arthur rose up and the warriors of the Islands of Britain with him to seek for Eidoel and they proceeded until they came before the castle of Glivi where Eidoel was imprisoned Glivi stood on the summit of his castle and said Arthur what requirest thou of me since nothing remains to me in this fortress and I have neither joy nor pleasure in it neither wheat nor oats 
7263-86687-0044	train-other-500	Said Arthur Not to injure thee came I hither but to seek for the prisoner that is with thee I will give thee my prisoner though I had not thought to give him up to any one and therewith shalt thou have my support and my aid
7263-86687-0045	train-other-500	His followers then said unto Arthur Lord go thou home thou canst not proceed with thy host in quest of such small adventures as these Then said Arthur
none	none	 It were well for thee Gwrhyr Gwalstawt Ieithoedd to go upon this quest 
7263-86687-0046	train-other-500	for thou knowest all languages
none	none	 and art familiar with those of the birds and the beasts Go Eidoel 
7263-86687-0047	train-other-500	likewise with my men in search of thy cousin
none	none	 And as for you Kay and Bedwyr I have hope of whatever adventure ye are in quest of 
7263-86687-0048	train-other-500	that ye will achieve it Achieve ye this adventure for me These went forward until they came
none	none	 to the Ousel of Cilgwri and Gwrhyr adjured her for the sake of Heaven saying 
7263-86687-0049	train-other-500	Tell me if thou knowest aught of Mabon the son of Modron who was taken when three nights old from between his mother and the wall And the ousel answered When I first came here there was a smith s anvil in this place and I was then a young bird
7263-86687-0050	train-other-500	and from that time no work has been done upon it save the pecking of my beak every evening and now there is not so much as the size of a nut remaining thereof yet the vengeance of Heaven be upon me if during all that time
none	none	 I have ever heard of the man for whom you inquire 
7263-86687-0051	train-other-500	Nevertheless there is a race of animals who were formed before me and I will be your guide to them So they proceeded to the place where was the Stag of Redynvre
none	none	 Stag of Redynvre 
7263-86687-0052	train-other-500	behold we are come to thee an embassy from Arthur for we have not heard of any animal older than thou Say knowest thou aught of Mabon The stag said
none	none	 When first I came hither there was a plain all around me 
7263-86687-0053	train-other-500	without any trees save one oak sapling which grew up to be an oak with an hundred branches And that oak has since perished so that now nothing remains of it but the withered stump and from that day to this I have been here
7263-86687-0054	train-other-500	yet have I never heard of the man for whom you inquire Nevertheless I will be your guide to the place where there is an animal which was formed before I was So they proceeded to the place where was the
none	none	 Owl of Cwm Cawlwyd to inquire of him concerning Mabon 
7263-86687-0055	train-other-500	And the owl said If I knew I would tell you When first I came hither the wide valley you see was a wooded glen And a race of men came and rooted it up And there grew there a second wood
7263-86687-0056	train-other-500	and this wood is the third My wings are they not withered stumps Yet all this time even until to day
none	none	 I have never heard of the man for whom you inquire 
7263-86687-0057	train-other-500	Nevertheless I will be the guide of Arthur s embassy until you come to the place where is the oldest animal in this world and the one who has travelled most the Eagle of Gwern Abwy When they came to the eagle
none	none	 Gwrhyr asked it the same question but it replied 
7263-86687-0058	train-other-500	I have been here for a great space of time and when I first came hither there was a rock here from the top of which I pecked at the stars every evening and now it is not so much as a span high From that day to this I have been here
7263-86687-0059	train-other-500	and I have never heard of the man for whom you inquire except once when I went in search of food as far as Llyn Llyw And when I came there I stuck my talons into a salmon thinking he would serve me as food for a long time
7263-86687-0060	train-other-500	But he drew me into the deep
none	none	 and I was scarcely able to escape from him After that I went with my whole kindred to attack him and to try to destroy him 
7263-86687-0061	train-other-500	but he sent messengers and made peace with me and came and besought me to take fifty fish spears out of his back
none	none	 Unless he know something of him whom you seek I cannot tell you who may 
7263-86687-0062	train-other-500	However I will guide you to the place where he is So they went thither
none	none	 and the eagle said Salmon of Llyn Llyw 
7263-86687-0063	train-other-500	I have come to thee with an embassy from Arthur to ask thee if thou knowest aught concerning Mabon the son of Modron who was taken away at three nights old from between his mother and the wall And the salmon answered
7263-86687-0064	train-other-500	As much as I know I will tell thee With every tide I go along the river upwards until I come near to the walls of Gloucester
none	none	 and there have I found such wrong as I never found elsewhere and to the end that ye may give credence thereto let one of you go thither upon each of my two shoulders So Kay and Gwrhyr went upon his shoulders and they proceeded till they came to the wall of the prison and they heard a great wailing and lamenting from the dungeon Said Gwrhyr Who is it that laments in this house of stone And the voice replied Alas it is Mabon the son of Modron who is here imprisoned Then they returned and told Arthur who summoning his warriors attacked the castle Illustration Gwrhyr and Eidoel talk with the Eagle of Gwern Abwy And whilst the fight was going on Kay and Bedwyr mounting on the shoulders of the fish broke into the dungeon and brought away with them Mabon the son of Modron Then Arthur summoned unto him all the warriors that were in the three islands of Britain 
7263-86687-0065	train-other-500	and in the three islands adjacent
none	none	 and he went as far as Esgeir Oervel 
7263-86687-0066	train-other-500	in Ireland where the Boar Truith was with his seven young pigs And the dogs were let loose upon him from all sides But he wasted the fifth part of Ireland and then set forth through the sea to Wales
7263-86687-0067	train-other-500	Arthur and his hosts and his horses and his dogs followed hard after him But ever and awhile the boar made a stand and many a champion of Arthur s did he slay Throughout all Wales did Arthur follow him
7263-86687-0068	train-other-500	and one by one the young pigs were killed At length when he would fain have crossed the Severn and escaped into Cornwall Mabon the son of Modron came up with him and Arthur fell upon him together with the champions of Britain
7263-86687-0069	train-other-500	On the one side Mabon the son of Modron spurred his steed and snatched his razor from him whilst Kay came up with him on the other side and took from him the scissors
7263-86687-0070	train-other-500	But before they could obtain the comb he had regained the ground with his feet and from the moment that he reached the shore neither dog nor man nor horse could overtake him until he came to Cornwall
7263-86687-0071	train-other-500	There Arthur and his host followed in his track until they overtook him in Cornwall Hard had been their trouble before but it was child s play to what they met in seeking the comb Win it they did
7263-86687-0072	train-other-500	and the Boar Truith they hunted into the deep sea and it was never known whither he went
none	none	 Then Kilhuch set forward and as many as wished ill to Yspathaden Penkawr 
7263-86687-0073	train-other-500	And they took the marvels with them to his court And Kaw of North Britain came and shaved his beard skin and flesh clean off to the very bone from ear to ear Art thou shaved man said Kilhuch
7263-86687-0074	train-other-500	I am shaved answered he Is thy daughter mine now
none	none	 She is thine but therefore needst thou not thank me but Arthur who hath accomplished this for thee By my free will thou shouldst never have had her for with her I lose my life Then Goreu the son of Custennin seized him by the hair of his head and dragged him after him to the keep and cut off his head and placed it on a stake on the citadel Thereafter the hosts of Arthur dispersed themselves each man to his own country Thus did Kilhuch son of Kelython win to wife Olwen the daughter of Yspathaden Penkawr 
7218-86688-0000	train-other-500	Jack and His Comrades Once there was a poor widow as often there has been and she had one son A very scarce summer came
7218-86688-0001	train-other-500	and they didn t know how they d live till the new potatoes would be fit for eating So Jack said to his mother one evening Mother bake my cake and kill my hen till I go seek my fortune and if I meet it
7218-86688-0002	train-other-500	never fear but I ll soon be back to share it with you So she did as he asked her and he set out at break of day on his journey His mother came along with him to the yard gate and says she Jack
7218-86688-0003	train-other-500	which would you rather have half the cake and half the hen with my blessing or the whole of em with my curse O musha mother says Jack
none	none	 why do you ax me that question 
7218-86688-0004	train-other-500	sure you know I wouldn t have your curse and Damer s estate along with it Well then Jack says she here s the whole lot of em with my thousand blessings along with them
7218-86688-0005	train-other-500	So she stood on the yard fence and blessed him as far as her eyes could see him Well he went along and along till he was tired and ne er a farmer s house he went into wanted a boy
7218-86688-0006	train-other-500	At last his road led by the side of a bog and there was a poor ass up to his shoulders near a big bunch of grass he was striving to come at Ah
none	none	 then Jack asthore says he 
7218-86688-0007	train-other-500	help me out or I ll be drowned Never say t twice says Jack and he pitched in big stones and sods into the slob till the ass got good ground under him
7218-86688-0008	train-other-500	Thank you Jack says he when he was out on the hard road I ll do as much for you another time Where are you going Faith I m going to seek my fortune till harvest comes in God bless it
7218-86688-0009	train-other-500	And if you like says the ass I ll go along with you who knows what luck we may have With all my heart it s getting late let us be jogging
none	none	 Well they were going through a village and a whole army of gossoons were hunting a poor dog 
7218-86688-0010	train-other-500	with a kettle tied to his tail He ran up to Jack for protection and the ass let such a roar out of him
none	none	 that the little thieves took to their heels as if the ould boy was after them 
7218-86688-0011	train-other-500	More power to you Jack says the dog
none	none	 I m much obleeged to you where is the baste and yourself going

7218-86688-0013	train-other-500	Well well throw your tail over your arm and come along They got outside the town and sat down under an old wall and Jack pulled out his bread and meat and shared with the dog
7218-86688-0014	train-other-500	and the ass made his dinner on a bunch of thistles While they were eating and chatting what should come by but a poor half starved cat and the moll row he gave out of him would make your heart ache
7218-86688-0015	train-other-500	You look as if you saw the tops of nine houses since breakfast says Jack here s a bone and something on it May your child never know a hungry belly says Tom it s myself that s in need of your kindness
7218-86688-0016	train-other-500	May I be so bold as to ask where yez are all going We re going to seek our fortune till the harvest comes in and you may join us if you like And that I ll do with a heart and a half says the cat
7218-86688-0017	train-other-500	and thank ee for asking me Off they set again and just as the shadows of the trees were three times as long as themselves they heard a great cackling in a field inside the road and out over the ditch
7218-86688-0018	train-other-500	jumped a fox with a fine black cock in his mouth Oh you anointed villain says the ass roaring like thunder At him good dog says Jack
7218-86688-0019	train-other-500	and the word wasn t out of his mouth when Coley was in full sweep after the Red Dog Reynard dropped his prize like a hot potato and was off like a shot
7218-86688-0020	train-other-500	and the poor cock came back fluttering and trembling to Jack and his comrades O musha naybours says he wasn t it the height o luck that threw you in my way
7218-86688-0021	train-other-500	Maybe I won t remember your kindness if ever I find you in hardship and where in the world are you all going We re going to seek our fortune till the harvest comes in
7218-86688-0022	train-other-500	you may join our party if you like and sit on Neddy s crupper when your legs and wings are tired Well the march began again and just as the sun was gone down they looked around
7218-86688-0023	train-other-500	and there was neither cabin nor farm house in sight Well well says Jack the worse luck now the better another time and it s only a summer night after all
7218-86688-0024	train-other-500	We ll go into the wood and make our bed on the long grass No sooner said than done Jack stretched himself on a bunch of dry grass the ass lay near him the dog and cat lay in the ass s warm lap
7218-86688-0025	train-other-500	and the cock went to roost in the next tree Well the soundness of deep sleep was over them all when the cock took a notion of crowing
none	none	 Bother you Black 
7218-86688-0026	train-other-500	Cock says the ass you disturbed me from as nice a whisp of hay as ever I tasted What s the matter It s daybreak that s the matter don t you see light yonder
7218-86688-0027	train-other-500	I see a light indeed says Jack but it s from a candle it s coming and not from the sun As you ve roused us we may as well go over and ask for lodging
7218-86688-0028	train-other-500	So they all shook themselves and went on through grass and rocks and briars till they got down into a hollow and there was the light coming through the shadow and along with it came singing
7218-86688-0029	train-other-500	and laughing and cursing
none	none	 Easy boys says Jack 
7218-86688-0030	train-other-500	walk on your tippy toes till we see what sort of people we have to deal with So they crept near the window and there they saw six robbers inside
7218-86688-0031	train-other-500	with pistols and blunderbushes and cutlashes sitting at a table eating roast beef and pork and drinking mulled beer and wine and whisky punch
7218-86688-0032	train-other-500	Wasn t that a fine haul we made at the Lord of Dunlavin s says one ugly looking thief with his mouth full and it s little we d get only for the honest porter here s his purty health
7218-86688-0033	train-other-500	The porter s purty health cried out every one of them and Jack bent his finger
none	none	 at his comrades Illustration Close your ranks my men says he in a whisper 
7218-86688-0034	train-other-500	and let every one mind the word of command So the ass put his fore hoofs on the sill of the window
none	none	 the dog got on the ass s head the cat on the dog s head and the cock on the cat s head Then Jack made a sign and they all sang out like mad Hee haw hee haw roared the ass bow wow barked the dog meaw meaw cried the cat cock a doodle doo crowed the cock Level your pistols cried Jack and make smithereens of em 
7218-86688-0035	train-other-500	Don t leave a mother s son of em alive present fire With that they gave another halloo and smashed every pane in the window The robbers were frightened out of their lives They blew out the candles threw down the table
none	none	 and skelped out at the back door as if they were in earnest 
7218-86688-0036	train-other-500	and never drew rein till they were in the very heart of the wood Jack and his party got into the room closed the shutters lighted the candles
7218-86688-0037	train-other-500	and ate and drank till hunger and thirst were gone Then they lay down to rest Jack in the bed the ass in the stable the dog on the door mat the cat by the fire
7218-86688-0038	train-other-500	and the cock on the perch At first the robbers were very glad to find themselves safe in the thick wood but they soon began to get vexed
7218-86688-0039	train-other-500	This damp grass is very different from our warm room says one I was obliged to drop a fine pig s foot says another I didn t get a tayspoonful of my last tumbler says another
7218-86688-0040	train-other-500	And all the Lord of Dunlavin s gold and silver that we left behind says the last I think I ll venture back says the captain and see if we can recover anything
none	none	 That s a good boy said they all 
7218-86688-0041	train-other-500	and away he went The lights were all out and so he groped his way to the fire and there the cat flew in his face
7218-86688-0042	train-other-500	and tore him with teeth and claws He let a roar out of him and made for the room door to look for a candle inside He trod on the dog s tail and if he did
7218-86688-0043	train-other-500	he got the marks of his teeth in his arms and legs and thighs Thousand murders cried he I wish I was out of this unlucky house
7218-86688-0044	train-other-500	When he got to the street door the cock dropped down upon him with his claws and bill and what the cat and dog done to him was only a flay bite to what he got from the cock
none	none	 Oh 
7218-86688-0045	train-other-500	tattheration to you all you unfeeling vagabones says he when he recovered his breath and he staggered and spun round and round till he reeled into the stable back foremost
7218-86688-0046	train-other-500	but the ass received him with a kick on the broadest part of his small clothes and laid him comfortably on the dunghill When he came to himself he scratched his head and began to think what happened him
7218-86688-0047	train-other-500	and as soon as he found that his legs were able to carry him he crawled away dragging one foot after another till he reached the wood Well well cried them all when he came within hearing
7218-86688-0048	train-other-500	any chance of our property You may say chance says he and it s itself is the poor chance all out Ah will any of you pull a bed of dry grass for me
7218-86688-0049	train-other-500	All the sticking plaster in Enniscorthy will be too little for the cuts and bruises I have on me Ah if you only knew what I have gone through for you
7218-86688-0050	train-other-500	When I got to the kitchen fire looking for a sod of lighted turf what should be there but an old woman carding flax and you may see the marks she left on my face with the cards I made to the room door as fast as I could
7218-86688-0051	train-other-500	and who should I stumble over but a cobler and his seat
none	none	 and if he did not work at me with his awls and his pinchers you may call me a rogue 
7218-86688-0052	train-other-500	Well I got away from him somehow but when I was passing through the door it must be the divil himself that pounced down on me with his claws and his teeth that were equal to sixpenny nails
7218-86688-0053	train-other-500	and his wings ill luck be in his road Well at last I reached the stable and there by way of salute I got a pelt from a sledge hammer that sent me half a mile off
7218-86688-0054	train-other-500	If you don t believe me I ll give you leave to go and judge for yourselves Oh my poor captain says they we believe you to the nines
7218-86688-0055	train-other-500	Catch us indeed going within a hen s race of that unlucky cabin Well before the sun shook his doublet next morning Jack and his comrades were up and about
7218-86688-0056	train-other-500	They made a hearty breakfast on what was left the night before and then they all agreed to set off to the castle of the Lord of Dunlavin and give him back all his gold and silver Jack put it all in the two ends of a sack
7218-86688-0057	train-other-500	and laid it across Neddy s back and all took the road in their hands Away they went through bogs up hills down dales and sometimes along the yellow high road
7218-86688-0058	train-other-500	till they came to the hall door of the Lord of Dunlavin and who should be there airing his powdered head his white stockings and his red breeches but the thief of a porter
7218-86688-0059	train-other-500	He gave a cross look to the visitors and says he to Jack What do you want here my fine fellow there isn t room for you all We want says Jack what I m sure you haven t to give us
7218-86688-0060	train-other-500	and that is common civility Come be off you lazy strollers says he
none	none	 while a cat ud be licking her ear or I ll let the dogs at you

none	none	 and all were as happy as you please The Shee an Gannon and the Gruagach Gaire The Shee an Gannon was born in the morning named at noon and went in the evening to ask his daughter of the king of Erin I will give you my daughter in marriage said the king of Erin you won t get her though unless you go and bring me back the tidings that I want and tell me what it is that put a stop to the laughing of the Gruagach Gaire who before this laughed always and laughed so loud that the whole world heard him There are twelve iron spikes out here in the garden behind my castle On eleven of the spikes are the heads of kings sons who came seeking my daughter in marriage and all of them went away to get the knowledge I wanted Not one was able to get it and tell me what stopped the Gruagach Gaire from laughing I took the heads off them all when they came back without the tidings for which they went and I m greatly in dread that your head ll be on the twelfth spike for I ll do the same to you that I did to the eleven kings sons unless you tell what put a stop to the laughing of the Gruagach The Shee an Gannon made no answer but left the king and pushed away to know could he find why the Gruagach was silent He took a glen at a step a hill at a leap and travelled all day till evening Then he came to a house The master of the house asked him what sort was he and he said A young man looking for hire Well said the master of the house I was going to morrow to look for a man to mind my cows If you ll work for me you ll have a good place the best food a man could have to eat in this world and a soft bed to lie on The Shee an Gannon took service and ate his supper Then the master of the house said I am the Gruagach Gaire now that you are my man and have eaten your supper you ll have a bed of silk to sleep on Next morning after breakfast the Gruagach said to the Shee an Gannon Go out now and loosen my five golden cows and my bull without horns and drive them to pasture but when you have them out on the grass be careful you don t let them go near the land of the giant The new cowboy drove the cattle to pasture and when near the land of the giant he saw it was covered with woods and surrounded by a high wall He went up put his back against the wall and threw in a great stretch of it then he went inside and threw out another great stretch of the wall and put the five golden cows and the bull without horns on the land of the giant Then he climbed a tree ate the sweet apples himself and threw the sour ones down to the cattle of the Gruagach Gaire Soon a great crashing was heard in the woods the noise of young trees bending and old trees breaking The cowboy looked around and saw a five headed giant pushing through the trees and soon he was before him Poor miserable creature said the giant but weren t you impudent to come to my land and trouble me in this way You re too big for one bite and too small for two I don t know what to do but tear you to pieces You nasty brute said the cowboy coming down to him from the tree tis little I care for you and then they went at each other So great was the noise between them that there was nothing in the world but what was looking on and listening to the combat They fought till late in the afternoon when the giant was getting the upper hand and then the cowboy thought that if the giant should kill him his father and mother would never find him or set eyes on him again and he would never get the daughter of the king of Erin The heart in his body grew strong at this thought He sprang on the giant and with the first squeeze and thrust he put him to his knees in the hard ground with the second thrust to his waist and with the third to his shoulders I have you at last you re done for now said the cowboy Then he took out his knife cut the five heads off the giant and when he had them off he cut out the tongues and threw the heads over the wall Then he put the tongues in his pocket and drove home the cattle That evening the Gruagach couldn t find vessels enough in his palace to hold the milk of the five golden cows But when the cowboy was on the way home with the cattle the son of the king of Tisean came and took the giant s heads and claimed the princess in marriage when the Gruagach Gaire should laugh After supper the cowboy would give no talk to his master but kept his mind to himself and went to the bed of silk to sleep On the morning the cowboy rose before his master and the first words he said to Gruagach were What keeps you from laughing you who used to laugh so loud that the whole world heard you I m sorry said the Gruagach that the daughter of the king of Erin sent you here If you don t tell me of your own will I ll make you tell me said the cowboy and he put a face on himself that was terrible to look at and running through the house like a madman could find nothing that would give pain enough to the Gruagach but some ropes made of untanned sheep skin hanging on the wall He took these down caught the Gruagach fastened him by the three smalls and tied him so that his little toes were whispering to his ears When he was in this state the Gruagach said I ll tell you what stopped my laughing if you set me free So the cowboy unbound him the two sat down together and the Gruagach said I lived in this castle here with my twelve sons We ate drank played cards and enjoyed ourselves till one day when my sons and I were playing a slender brown hare came rushing in jumped on to the hearth tossed up the ashes to the rafters and ran away On another day he came again but if he did we were ready for him my twelve sons and myself As soon as he tossed up the ashes and ran off we made after him and followed him till nightfall when he went into a glen We saw a light before us I ran on and came to a house with a great apartment where there was a man named Yellow Face with twelve daughters and the hare was tied to the side of the room near the women There was a large pot over the fire in the room and a great stork boiling in the pot The man of the house said to me There are bundles of rushes at the end of the room go there and sit down with your men He went into the next room and brought out two pikes one of wood the other of iron and asked me which of the pikes would I take I said I ll take the iron one for I thought in my heart that if an attack should come on me I could defend myself better with the iron than the wooden pike Yellow Face gave me the iron pike and the first chance of taking what I could out of the pot on the point of the pike I got but a small piece of the stork and the man of the house took all the rest on his wooden pike We had to fast that night and when the man and his twelve daughters ate the flesh of the stork they hurled the bare bones in the faces of my sons and myself We had to stop all night that way beaten on the faces by the bones of the stork Next morning when we were going away the man of the house asked me to stay a while and going into the next room he brought out twelve loops of iron and one of wood and said to me Put the heads of your twelve sons into the iron loops or your own head into the wooden one and I said I ll put the twelve heads of my sons in the iron loops and keep my own out of the wooden one He put the iron loops on the necks of my twelve sons and put the wooden one on his own neck Then he snapped the loops one after another till he took the heads off my twelve sons and threw the heads and bodies out of the house but he did nothing to hurt his own neck When he had killed my sons he took hold of me and stripped the skin and flesh from the small of my back down and when he had done that he took the skin of a black sheep that had been hanging on the wall for seven years and clapped it on my body in place of my own flesh and skin and the sheep skin grew on me and every year since then I shear myself and every bit of wool I use for the stockings that I wear I clip off my own back When he had said this the Gruagach showed the cowboy his back covered with thick black wool After what he had seen and heard the cowboy said I know now why you don t laugh and small blame to you But does that hare come here still He does indeed said the Gruagach Both went to the table to play and they were not long playing cards when the hare ran in and before they could stop him he was out again But the cowboy made after the hare and the Gruagach after the cowboy and they ran as fast as ever their legs could carry them till nightfall and when the hare was entering the castle where the twelve sons of the Gruagach were killed the cowboy caught him by the two hind legs and dashed out his brains against the wall and the skull of the hare was knocked into the chief room of the castle and fell at the feet of the master of the place Who has dared to interfere with my fighting pet screamed Yellow Face I said the cowboy and if your pet had had manners he might be alive now The cowboy and the Gruagach stood by the fire A stork was boiling in the pot as when the Gruagach came the first time The master of the house went into the next room and brought out an iron and a wooden pike and asked the cowboy which would he choose I ll take the wooden one said the cowboy and you may keep the iron one for yourself So he took the wooden one and going to the pot brought out on the pike all the stork except a small bite and he and the Gruagach fell to eating and they were eating the flesh of the stork all night The cowboy and the Gruagach were at home in the place that time In the morning the master of the house went into the next room took down the twelve iron loops with a wooden one brought them out and asked the cowboy which would he take the twelve iron or the one wooden loop What could I do with the twelve iron ones for myself or my master I ll take the wooden one He put it on and taking the twelve iron loops put them on the necks of the twelve daughters of the house then snapped the twelve heads off them and turning to their father said I ll do the same thing to you unless you bring the twelve sons of my master to life and make them as well and strong as when you took their heads The master of the house went out and brought the twelve to life again and when the Gruagach saw all his sons alive and as well as ever he let a laugh out of himself and all the Eastern world heard the laugh Then the cowboy said to the Gruagach It s a bad thing you have done to me for the daughter of the king of Erin will be married the day after your laugh is heard Oh then we must be there in time said the Gruagach and they all made away from the place as fast as ever they could the cowboy the Gruagach and his twelve sons They hurried on and when within three miles of the king s castle there was such a throng of people that no one could see a step ahead We must clear a road through this said the cowboy Illustration We must indeed said the Gruagach and at it they went threw the people some on one side and some on the other and soon they had an opening for themselves to the king s castle As they went in the daughter of the king of Erin and the son of the king of Tisean were on their knees just going to be married The cowboy drew his hand on the bridegroom and gave a blow that sent him spinning till he stopped under a table at the other side of the room What scoundrel struck that blow asked the king of Erin It was I said the cowboy What reason had you to strike the man who won my daughter It was I who won your daughter not he and if you don t believe me the Gruagach Gaire is here himself He ll tell you the whole story from beginning to end and show you the tongues of the giant So the Gruagach came up and told the king the whole story how the Shee an Gannon had become his cowboy had guarded the five golden cows and the bull without horns cut off the heads of the five headed giant killed the wizard hare and brought his own twelve sons to life And then said the Gruagach he s the only man in the whole world I have ever told why I stopped laughing and the only one who has ever seen my fleece of wool When the king of Erin heard what the Gruagach said and saw the tongues of the giant fitted in the head he made the Shee an Gannon kneel down by his daughter and they were married on the spot Then the son of the king of Tisean was thrown into prison and the next day they put down a great fire and the deceiver was burnt to ashes The wedding lasted nine days and the last day was better than the first The Story Teller at Fault At the time when the Tuatha De Danann held the sovereignty of Ireland there reigned in Leinster a king who was remarkably fond of hearing stories Like the other princes and chieftains of the island he had a favourite story teller who held a large estate from his Majesty on condition of telling him a new story every night of his life before he went to sleep Many indeed were the stories he knew so that he had already reached a good old age without failing even for a single night in his task and such was the skill he displayed that whatever cares of state or other annoyances might prey upon the monarch s mind his story teller was sure to send him to sleep One morning the story teller arose early and as his custom was strolled out into his garden turning over in his mind incidents which he might weave into a story for the king at night But this morning he found himself quite at fault after pacing his whole demesne he returned to his house without being able to think of anything new or strange He found no difficulty in there was once a king who had three sons or one day the king of all Ireland but further than that he could not get At length he went in to breakfast and found his wife much perplexed at his delay Why don t you come to breakfast my dear said she I have no mind to eat anything replied the story teller long as I have been in the service of the king of Leinster I never sat down to breakfast without having a new story ready for the evening but this morning my mind is quite shut up and I don t know what to do I might as well lie down and die at once I ll be disgraced for ever this evening when the king calls for his story teller Just at this moment the lady looked out of the window Do you see that black thing at the end of the field said she I do replied her husband They drew nigh and saw a miserable looking old man lying on the ground with a wooden leg placed beside him Who are you my good man asked the story teller Oh then tis little matter who I am I m a poor old lame decrepit miserable creature sitting down here to rest awhile An what are you doing with that box and dice I see in your hand I am waiting here to see if any one will play a game with me replied the beggarman Play with you Why what has a poor old man like you to play for I have one hundred pieces of gold in this leathern purse replied the old man You may as well play with him said the story teller s wife and perhaps you ll have something to tell the king in the evening A smooth stone was placed between them and upon it they cast their throws It was but a little while and the story teller lost every penny of his money Much good may it do you friend said he What better hap could I look for fool that I am Will you play again asked the old man Don t be talking man you have all my money Haven t you chariot and horses and hounds Well what of them I ll stake all the money I have against thine Nonsense man Do you think for all the money in Ireland I d run the risk of seeing my lady tramp home on foot Maybe you d win said the bocough Maybe I wouldn t said the story teller Play with him husband said his wife I don t mind walking if you do love I never refused you before said the story teller and I won t do so now Down he sat again and in one throw lost horses hounds and chariot Will you play again asked the beggar Are you making game of me man what else have I to stake I ll stake all my winnings against your wife said the old man The story teller turned away in silence but his wife stopped him Accept his offer said she This is the third time and who knows what luck you may have You ll surely win now They played again and the story teller lost No sooner had he done so than to his sorrow and surprise his wife went and sat down near the ugly old beggar Is that the way you re leaving me said the story teller Sure I was won said she You would not cheat the poor man would you Have you any more to stake asked the old man You know very well I have not replied the story teller I ll stake the whole now wife and all against your own self said the old man Again they played and again the story teller lost Well Here I am and what do you want with me I ll soon let you know said the old man and he took from his pocket a long cord and a wand Now said he to the story teller what kind of animal would you rather be a deer a fox or a hare You have your choice now but you may not have it later To make a long story short the story teller made his choice of a hare the old man threw the cord round him struck him with the wand and lo a long eared frisking hare was skipping and jumping on the green But it wasn t for long who but his wife called the hounds and set them on him The hare fled the dogs followed Round the field ran a high wall so that run as he might he couldn t get out and mightily diverted were beggar and lady to see him twist and double In vain did he take refuge with his wife she kicked him back again to the hounds until at length the beggar stopped the hounds and with a stroke of the wand panting and breathless the story teller stood before them again And how did you like the sport said the beggar It might be sport to others replied the story teller looking at his wife for my part I could well put up with the loss of it Would it be asking too much he went on to the beggar to know who you are at all or where you come from or why you take a pleasure in plaguing a poor old man like me Oh replied the stranger I m an odd kind of good for little fellow one day poor another day rich but if you wish to know more about me or my habits come with me and perhaps I may show you more than you would make out if you went alone I m not my own master to go or stay said the story teller with a sigh The stranger put one hand into his wallet and drew out of it before their eyes a well looking middle aged man to whom he spoke as follows By all you heard and saw since I put you into my wallet take charge of this lady and of the carriage and horses and have them ready for me whenever I want them Scarcely had he said these words when all vanished and the story teller found himself at the Foxes Ford near the castle of Red Hugh O Donnell He could see all but none could see him O Donnell was in his hall and heaviness of flesh and weariness of spirit were upon him Go out said he to his doorkeeper and see who or what may be coming The doorkeeper went and what he saw was a lank grey beggarman half his sword bared behind his haunch his two shoes full of cold road a wayish water sousing about him the tips of his two ears out through his old hat his two shoulders out through his scant tattered cloak and in his hand a green wand of holly Save you O Donnell said the lank grey beggarman And you likewise said O Donnell Whence come you and what is your craft I come from the outmost stream of earth From the glens where the white swans glide A night in Islay a night in Man A night on the cold hill side It s the great traveller you are said O Donnell May be you ve learnt something on the road I am a juggler said the lank grey beggarman and for five pieces of silver you shall see a trick of mine Illustration You shall have them said O Donnell and the lank grey beggarman took three small straws and placed them in his hand The middle one said he I ll blow away the other two I ll leave Thou canst not do it said one and all But the lank grey beggarman put a finger on either outside straw and whiff away he blew the middle one Tis a good trick said O Donnell and he paid him his five pieces of silver For half the money said one of the chief s lads I ll do the same trick Take him at his word O Donnell The lad put the three straws on his hand and a finger on either outside straw and he blew and what happened but that the fist was blown away with the straw Thou art sore and thou wilt be sorer said O Donnell Six more pieces O Donnell and I ll do another trick for thee said the lank grey beggarman Six shalt thou have Seest thou my two ears One I ll move but not t other Tis easy to see them they re big enough but thou canst never move one ear and not the two together The lank grey beggarman put his hand to his ear and he gave it a pull O Donnell laughed and paid him the six pieces Call that a trick said the fistless lad any one can do that and so saying he put up his hand pulled his ear and what happened was that he pulled away ear and head Sore thou art and sorer thou lieutenant be said O Donnell Well O Donnell said the lank grey beggarman strange are the tricks I ve shown thee but I ll show thee a stranger one yet for the same money Thou hast my word for it said O Donnell With that the lank grey beggarman took a bag from under his arm pit and from out the bag a ball of silk and he unwound the ball and he flung it slant wise up into the clear blue heavens and it became a ladder then he took a hare and placed it upon the thread and up it ran again he took out a red eared hound and it swiftly ran up after the hare Now said the lank grey beggarman has any one a mind to run after the dog and on the course I will said a lad of O Donnell s Up with you then said the juggler but I warn you if you let my hare be killed I ll cut off your head when you come down The lad ran up the thread and all three soon disappeared After looking up for a long time the lank grey beggarman said I m afraid the hound is eating the hare and that our friend has fallen asleep Saying this he began to wind the thread and down came the lad fast asleep and down came the red eared hound and in his mouth the last morsel of the hare He struck the lad a stroke with the edge of his sword and so cast his head off As for the hound if he used it no worse he used it no better It s little I m pleased and sore I m angered said O Donnell that a hound and a lad should be killed at my court Five pieces of silver twice over for each of them said the juggler and their heads shall be on them as before Thou shalt get that said O Donnell Five pieces and again five were paid him and lo the lad had his head and the hound his And though they lived to the uttermost end of time the hound would never touch a hare again and the lad took good care to keep his eyes open Scarcely had the lank grey beggarman done this when he vanished from out their sight and no one present could say if he had flown through the air or if the earth had swallowed him up He moved as wave tumbling o er wave As whirlwind following whirlwind As a furious wintry blast So swiftly sprucely cheerily Right proudly And no stop made Until he came To the court of Leinster s King He gave a cheery light leap O er top of turret Of court and city Of Leinster s King Heavy was the flesh and weary the spirit of Leinster s king Twas the hour he was wont to hear a story but send he might right and left not a jot of tidings about the story teller could he get Go to the door said he to his doorkeeper and see if a soul is in sight who may tell me something about my story teller The doorkeeper went and what he saw was a lank grey beggarman half his sword bared behind his haunch his two old shoes full of cold road a wayish water sousing about him the tips of his two ears out through his old hat his two shoulders out through his scant tattered cloak and in his hand a three stringed harp What canst thou do said the doorkeeper I can play said the lank grey beggarman Never fear added he to the story teller thou shalt see all and not a man shall see thee Illustration When the king heard a harper was outside he bade him in It is I that have the best harpers in the five fifths of Ireland said he and he signed them to play They did so and if they played the lank grey beggarman listened Heardst thou ever the like said the king Did you ever O king hear a cat purring over a bowl of broth or the buzzing of beetles in the twilight or a shrill tongued old woman scolding your head off That I have often said the king More melodious to me said the lank grey beggarman were the worst of these sounds than the sweetest harping of thy harpers When the harpers heard this they drew their swords and rushed at him but instead of striking him their blows fell on each other and soon not a man but was cracking his neighbour s skull and getting his own cracked in turn When the king saw this he thought it hard the harpers weren t content with murdering their music but must needs murder each other Hang the fellow who began it all said he and if I can t have a story let me have peace Up came the guards seized the lank grey beggarman marched him to the gallows and hanged him high and dry Back they marched to the hall and who should they see but the lank grey beggarman seated on a bench with his mouth to a flagon of ale Never welcome you in cried the captain of the guard didn t we hang you this minute and what brings you here Is it me myself you mean Who else said the captain May your hand turn into a pig s foot with you when you think of tying the rope why should you speak of hanging me Back they scurried to the gallows and there hung the king s favourite brother Back they hurried to the king who had fallen fast asleep Please your Majesty said the captain we hanged that strolling vagabond but here he is back again as well as ever Hang him again said the king and off he went to sleep once more They did as they were told but what happened was that they found the king s chief harper hanging where the lank grey beggarman should have been The captain of the guard was sorely puzzled Are you wishful to hang me a third time said the lank grey beggarman Go where you will said the captain and as fast as you please if you ll only go far enough It s trouble enough you ve given us already Now you re reasonable said the beggarman and since you ve given up trying to hang a stranger because he finds fault with your music I don t mind telling you that if you go back to the gallows you ll find your friends sitting on the sward none the worse for what has happened As he said these words he vanished and the story teller found himself on the spot where they first met and where his wife still was with the carriage and horses Now said the lank grey beggarman I ll torment you no longer There s your carriage and your horses and your money and your wife do what you please with them For my carriage and my horses and my hounds said the story teller I thank you but my wife and my money you may keep No said the other I want neither and as for your wife don t think ill of her for what she did she couldn t help it Not help it Not help kicking me into the mouth of my own hounds Not help casting me off for the sake of a beggarly old I m not as beggarly or as old as ye think I am Angus of the Bruff many a good turn you ve done me with the king of Leinster This morning my magic told me the difficulty you were in and I made up my mind to get you out of it As for your wife there the power that changed your body changed her mind Forget and forgive as man and wife should do and now you have a story for the king of Leinster when he calls for one and with that he disappeared It s true enough he now had a story fit for a king From first to last he told all that had befallen him so long and loud laughed the king that he couldn t go to sleep at all And he told the story teller never to trouble for fresh stories but every night as long as he lived he listened again and he laughed afresh at the tale of the lank grey beggarman The Sea Maiden There was once a poor old fisherman and one year he was not getting much fish On a day of days while he was fishing there rose a sea maiden at the side of his boat and she asked him Are you getting much fish The old man answered and said Not I What reward would you give me for sending plenty of fish to you Ach said the old man I have not much to spare Will you give me the first son you have said she I would give ye that were I to have a son said he Then go home and remember me when your son is twenty years of age and you yourself will get plenty of fish after this Everything happened as the sea maiden said and he himself got plenty of fish but when the end of the twenty years was nearing the old man was growing more and more sorrowful and heavy hearted while he counted each day as it came He had rest neither day nor night The son asked his father one day Is any one troubling you The old man said Some one is but that s nought to do with you nor any one else The lad said I must know what it is His father told him at last how the matter was with him and the sea maiden Let not that put you in any trouble said the son I will not oppose you You shall not you shall not go my son though I never get fish any more If you will not let me go with you go to the smithy and let the smith make me a great strong sword and I will go seek my fortune His father went to the smithy and the smith made a doughty sword for him His father came home with the sword The lad grasped it and gave it a shake or two and it flew into a hundred splinters He asked his father to go to the smithy and get him another sword in which there should be twice as much weight and so his father did and so likewise it happened to the next sword it broke in two halves Back went the old man to the smithy and the smith made a great sword its like he never made before There s thy sword for thee said the smith and the fist must be good that plays this blade The old man gave the sword to his son he gave it a shake or two This will do said he it s high time now to travel on my way On the next morning he put a saddle on a black horse that his father had and he took the world for his pillow When he went on a bit he fell in with the carcass of a sheep beside the road And there were a great black dog a falcon and an otter and they were quarrelling over the spoil So they asked him to divide it for them He came down off the horse and he divided the carcass amongst the three Three shares to the dog two shares to the otter and a share to the falcon For this said the dog if swiftness of foot or sharpness of tooth will give thee aid mind me and I will be at thy side Said the otter If the swimming of foot on the ground of a pool will loose thee mind me and I will be at thy side Said the falcon If hardship comes on thee where swiftness of wing or crook of claw will do good mind me and I will be at thy side On this he went onward till he reached a king s house and he took service to be a herd and his wages were to be according to the milk of the cattle He went away with the cattle and the grazing was but bare In the evening when he took them home they had not much milk the place was so bare and his meat and drink was but spare that night On the next day he went on further with them and at last he came to a place exceedingly grassy in a green glen of which he never saw the like But about the time when he should drive the cattle homewards who should he see coming but a great giant with a sword in his hand HI HO HO GARACH says the giant Those cattle are mine they are on my land and a dead man art thou I say not that says the herd there is no knowing but that may be easier to say than to do He drew the great clean sweeping sword and he neared the giant The herd drew back his sword and the head was off the giant in a twinkling He leaped on the black horse and he went to look for the giant s house In went the herd and that s the place where there was money in plenty and dresses of each kind in the wardrobe with gold and silver and each thing finer than the other At the mouth of night he took himself to the king s house but he took not a thing from the giant s house And when the cattle were milked this night there was milk He got good feeding this night meat and drink without stint and the king was hugely pleased that he had caught such a herd He went on for a time in this way but at last the glen grew bare of grass and the grazing was not so good So he thought he would go a little further forward in on the giant s land and he sees a great park of grass He returned for the cattle and he put them into the park They were but a short time grazing in the park when a great wild giant came full of rage and madness HI HAW HOGARAICH said the giant It is a drink of thy blood that will quench my thirst this night There is no knowing said the herd but that s easier to say than to do And at each other went the men There was shaking of blades At length and at last it seemed as if the giant would get the victory over the herd Then he called on the dog and with one spring the black dog caught the giant by the neck and swiftly the herd struck off his head He went home very tired this night but it s a wonder if the king s cattle had not milk The whole family was delighted that they had got such a herd Next day he betakes himself to the castle When he reached the door a little flattering carlin met him standing in the door All hail and good luck to thee fisher s son tis I myself am pleased to see thee great is the honour for this kingdom for thy like to be come into it thy coming in is fame for this little bothy go in first honour to the gentles go on and take breath In before me thou crone I like not flattery out of doors go in and let s hear thy speech In went the crone and when her back was to him he drew his sword and whips her head off but the sword flew out of his hand And swift the crone gripped her head with both hands and puts it on her neck as it was before The dog sprang on the crone and she struck the generous dog with the club of magic and there he lay But the herd struggled for a hold of the club of magic and with one blow on the top of the head she was on earth in the twinkling of an eye He went forward up a little and there was spoil Gold and silver and each thing more precious than another in the crone s castle He went back to the king s house and there was rejoicing He followed herding in this way for a time but one night after he came home instead of getting All hail and good luck from the dairymaid all were at crying and woe He asked what cause of woe there was that night The dairymaid said There is a great beast with three heads in the loch and it must get some one every year and the lot had come this year on the king s daughter and at midday to morrow she is to meet the Laidly Beast at the upper end of the loch but there is a great suitor yonder who is going to rescue her What suitor is that said the herd Oh he is a great General of arms said the dairymaid and when he kills the beast he will marry the king s daughter for the king has said that he who could save his daughter should get her to marry Illustration But on the morrow when the time grew near the king s daughter and this hero of arms went to give a meeting to the beast and they reached the black rock at the upper end of the loch They were but a short time there when the beast stirred in the midst of the loch but when the General saw this terror of a beast with three heads he took fright and he slunk away and he hid himself And the king s daughter was under fear and under trembling with no one at all to save her Suddenly she sees a doughty handsome youth riding a black horse and coming where she was He was marvellously arrayed and full armed and his black dog moved after him There is gloom on your face girl said the youth what do you here Oh that s no matter said the king s daughter It s not long I ll be here at all events I say not that said he A champion fled as likely as you and not long since said she He is a champion who stands the war said the youth And to meet the beast he went with his sword and his dog But there was a spluttering and a splashing between himself and the beast The dog kept doing all he might and the king s daughter was palsied by fear of the noise of the beast One of them would now be under and now above But at last he cut one of the heads off it It gave one roar and the son of earth echo of the rocks called to its screech and it drove the loch in spindrift from end to end and in a twinkling it went out of sight Good luck and victory follow you lad said the king s daughter I am safe for one night but the beast will come again and again until the other two heads come off it He caught the beast s head and he drew a knot through it and he told her to bring it with her there to morrow She gave him a gold ring and went home with the head on her shoulder and the herd betook himself to the cows But she had not gone far when this great General saw her and he said to her I will kill you if you do not say twas I took the head off the beast Oh says she tis I will say it who else took the head off the beast but you They reached the king s house and the head was on the General s shoulder But here was rejoicing that she should come home alive and whole and this great captain with the beast s head full of blood in hand On the morrow they went away and there was no question at all but that this hero would save the king s daughter They reached the same place and they were not long there when the fearful Laidly Beast stirred in the midst of the loch and the hero slunk away as he did on yesterday but it was not long after this when the man of the black horse came with another dress on No matter she knew that it was the very same lad It is I am pleased to see you said she I am in hopes you will handle your great sword to day as you did yesterday Come up and take breath But they were not long there when they saw the beast steaming in the midst of the loch At once he went to meet the beast but there was Cloopersteich and Claperstich spluttering splashing raving and roaring on the beast They kept at it thus for a long time and about the mouth of the night he cut another head off the beast He put it on the knot and gave it to her She gave him one of her earrings and he leaped on the black horse and he betook himself to the herding The king s daughter went home with the heads The General met her and took the heads from her and he said to her that she must tell that it was he who took the head off the beast this time also Who else took the head off the beast but you said she They reached the king s house with the heads Then there was joy and gladness Illustration About the same time on the morrow the two went away The officer hid himself as he usually did The king s daughter betook herself to the bank of the loch The hero of the black horse came and if roaring and raving were on the beast on the days that were passed this day it was horrible But no matter he took the third head off the beast and drew it through the knot and gave it to her She gave him her other earring and then she went home with the heads When they reached the king s house all were full of smiles and the General was to marry the king s daughter the next day The wedding was going on and every one about the castle longing till the priest should come But when the priest came she would marry only the one who could take the heads off the knot without cutting it Who should take the heads off the knot but the man that put the heads on said the king The General tried them but he could not loose them and at last there was no one about the house but had tried to take the heads off the knot but they could not The king asked if there were any one else about the house that would try to take the heads off the knot They said that the herd had not tried them yet Word went for the herd and he was not long throwing them hither and thither But stop a bit my lad said the king s daughter the man that took the heads off the beast he has my ring and my two earrings The herd put his hand in his pocket and he threw them on the board Thou art my man said the king s daughter The king was not so pleased when he saw that it was a herd who was to marry his daughter but he ordered that he should be put in a better dress but his daughter spoke and she said that he had a dress as fine as any that ever was in his castle and thus it happened The herd put on the giant s golden dress and they married that same day They were now married and everything went on well But one day and it was the namesake of the day when his father had promised him to the sea maiden they were sauntering by the side of the loch and lo and behold she came and took him away to the loch without leave or asking The king s daughter was now mournful tearful blind sorrowful for her married man she was always with her eye on the loch An old soothsayer met her and she told how it had befallen her married mate Then he told her the thing to do to save her mate and that she did She took her harp to the sea shore and sat and played and the sea maiden came up to listen for sea maidens are fonder of music than all other creatures But when the wife saw the sea maiden she stopped The sea maiden said Play on but the princess said No not till I see my man again So the sea maiden put up his head out of the loch Then the princess played again and stopped till the sea maiden put him up to the waist Then the princess played and stopped again and this time the sea maiden put him all out of the loch and he called on the falcon and became one and flew on shore But the sea maiden took the princess his wife Sorrowful was each one that was in the town on this night Her man was mournful tearful wandering down and up about the banks of the loch by day and night The old soothsayer met him The soothsayer told him that there was no way of killing the sea maiden but the one way and this is it In the island that is in the midst of the loch is the white footed hind of the slenderest legs and the swiftest step and though she be caught there will spring a hoodie out of her and though the hoodie should be caught there will spring a trout out of her but there is an egg in the mouth of the trout and the soul of the sea maiden is in the egg and if the egg breaks she is dead Now there was no way of getting to this island for the sea maiden would sink each boat and raft that would go on the loch He thought he would try to leap the strait with the black horse and even so he did The black horse leaped the strait He saw the hind and he let the black dog after her but when he was on one side of the island the hind would be on the other side Oh would the black dog of the carcass of flesh were here No sooner spoke he the word than the grateful dog was at his side and after the hind he went and they were not long in bringing her to earth But he no sooner caught her than a hoodie sprang out of her Would that the falcon grey of sharpest eye and swiftest wing were here No sooner said he this than the falcon was after the hoodie and she was not long putting her to earth and as the hoodie fell on the bank of the loch out of her jumps the trout Oh that thou wert by me now oh otter No sooner said than the otter was at his side and out on the loch she leaped and brings the trout from the midst of the loch but no sooner was the otter on shore with the trout than the egg came from his mouth He sprang and he put his foot on it Twas then the sea maiden appeared and she said Break not the egg and you shall get all you ask Deliver to me my wife In the wink of an eye she was by his side When he got hold of her hand in both his hands he let his foot down on the egg and the sea maiden died A Legend of Knockmany What Irish man woman or child has not heard of our renowned Hibernian Hercules the great and glorious Fin M Coul Not one from Cape Clear to the Giant s Causeway nor from that back again to Cape Clear And by the way speaking of the Giant s Causeway brings me at once to the beginning of my story Well it so happened that Fin and his men were all working at the Causeway in order to make a bridge across to Scotland when Fin who was very fond of his wife Oonagh took it into his head that he would go home and see how the poor woman got on in his absence So accordingly he pulled up a fir tree and after lopping off the roots and branches made a walking stick of it and set out on his way to Oonagh Oonagh or rather Fin lived at this time on the very tiptop of Knockmany Hill which faces a cousin of its own called Cullamore that rises up half hill half mountain on the opposite side There was at that time another giant named Cuhullin some say he was Irish and some say he was Scotch but whether Scotch or Irish sorrow doubt of it but he was a targer No other giant of the day could stand before him and such was his strength that when well vexed he could give a stamp that shook the country about him The fame and name of him went far and near and nothing in the shape of a man it was said had any chance with him in a fight By one blow of his fists he flattened a thunderbolt and kept it in his pocket in the shape of a pancake to show to all his enemies when they were about to fight him Undoubtedly he had given every giant in Ireland a considerable beating barring Fin M Coul himself and he swore that he would never rest night or day winter or summer till he would serve Fin with the same sauce if he could catch him However the short and long of it was with reverence be it spoken that Fin heard Cuhullin was coming to the Causeway to have a trial of strength with him and he was seized with a very warm and sudden fit of affection for his wife poor woman leading a very lonely uncomfortable life of it in his absence He accordingly pulled up the fir tree as I said before and having snedded it into a walking stick set out on his travels to see his darling Oonagh on the top of Knockmany by the way In truth the people wondered very much why it was that Fin selected such a windy spot for his dwelling house and they even went so far as to tell him as much What can you mane mister M Coul said they by pitching your tent upon the top of Knockmany where you never are without a breeze day or night winter or summer and where you re often forced to take your nightcap without either going to bed or turning up your little finger ay an where besides this there s the sorrow s own want of water Why said Fin ever since I was the height of a round tower I was known to be fond of having a good prospect of my own and where the dickens neighbours could I find a better spot for a good prospect than the top of Knockmany As for water I am sinking a pump and plase goodness as soon as the Causeway s made I intend to finish it Now this was more of Fin s philosophy for the real state of the case was that he pitched upon the top of Knockmany in order that he might be able to see Cuhullin coming towards the house All we have to say is that if he wanted a spot from which to keep a sharp look out and between ourselves he did want it grievously barring Slieve Croob or Slieve Donard or its own cousin Cullamore he could not find a neater or more convenient situation for it in the sweet and sagacious province of Ulster God save all here said Fin good humouredly on putting his honest face into his own door Musha Fin avick an you re welcome home to your own Oonagh you darlin bully Here followed a smack that is said to have made the waters of the lake at the bottom of the hill curl as it were with kindness and sympathy Fin spent two or three happy days with Oonagh and felt himself very comfortable considering the dread he had of Cuhullin This however grew upon him so much that his wife could not but perceive something lay on his mind which he kept altogether to himself Let a woman alone in the meantime for ferreting or wheedling a secret out of her good man when she wishes Fin was a proof of this It s this Cuhullin said he that s troubling me When the fellow gets angry and begins to stamp he ll shake you a whole townland and it s well known that he can stop a thunderbolt for he always carries one about him in the shape of a pancake to show to any one that might misdoubt it As he spoke he clapped his thumb in his mouth which he always did when he wanted to prophesy or to know anything that happened in his absence and the wife asked him what he did it for He s coming said Fin I see him below Dungannon Thank goodness dear an who is it avick Glory be to God That baste Cuhullin replied Fin and how to manage I don t know If I run away I am disgraced and I know that sooner or later I must meet him for my thumb tells me so When will he be here said she To morrow about two o clock replied Fin with a groan Well my bully don t be cast down said Oonagh depend on me and maybe I ll bring you better out of this scrape than ever you could bring yourself by your rule o thumb She then made a high smoke on the top of the hill after which she put her finger in her mouth and gave three whistles and by that Cuhullin knew he was invited to Cullamore for this was the way that the Irish long ago gave a sign to all strangers and travellers to let them know they were welcome to come and take share of whatever was going In the meantime Fin was very melancholy and did not know what to do or how to act at all Cuhullin was an ugly customer to meet with and the idea of the cake aforesaid flattened the very heart within him What chance could he have strong and brave though he was with a man who could when put in a passion walk the country into earthquakes and knock thunderbolts into pancakes Fin knew not on what hand to turn him Right or left backward or forward where to go he could form no guess whatsoever Oonagh said he can you do nothing for me Where s all your invention Am I to be skivered like a rabbit before your eyes and to have my name disgraced for ever in the sight of all my tribe and me the best man among them How am I to fight this man mountain this huge cross between an earthquake and a thunderbolt with a pancake in his pocket that was once Be easy Fin replied Oonagh troth I m ashamed of you Keep your toe in your pump will you Talking of pancakes maybe we ll give him as good as any he brings with him thunderbolt or otherwise If I don t treat him to as smart feeding as he s got this many a day never trust Oonagh again Leave him to me and do just as I bid you This relieved Fin very much for after all he had great confidence in his wife knowing as he did that she had got him out of many a quandary before Oonagh then drew the nine woollen threads of different colours which she always did to find out the best way of succeeding in anything of importance she went about She then platted them into three plats with three colours in each putting one on her right arm one round her heart and the third round her right ankle for then she knew that nothing could fail with her that she undertook Having everything now prepared she sent round to the neighbours and borrowed one and twenty iron griddles which she took and kneaded into the hearts of one and twenty cakes of bread and these she baked on the fire in the usual way setting them aside in the cupboard according as they were done She then put down a large pot of new milk which she made into curds and whey Having done all this she sat down quite contented waiting for his arrival on the next day about two o clock that being the hour at which he was expected for Fin knew as much by the sucking of his thumb Now this was a curious property that Fin s thumb had In this very thing moreover he was very much resembled by his great foe Cuhullin for it was well known that the huge strength he possessed all lay in the middle finger of his right hand and that if he happened by any mischance to lose it he was no more for all his bulk than a common man At length the next day Cuhullin was seen coming across the valley and Oonagh knew that it was time to commence operations She immediately brought the cradle and made Fin to lie down in it and cover himself up with the clothes You must pass for your own child said she so just lie there snug and say nothing but be guided by me About two o clock as he had been expected Cuhullin came in God save all here said he is this where the great Fin M Coul lives Indeed it is honest man replied Oonagh God save you kindly won t you be sitting Thank you ma am says he sitting down you re missus M Coul I suppose I am said she and I have no reason I hope to be ashamed of my husband No said the other he has the name of being the strongest and bravest man in Ireland but for all that there s a man not far from you that s very desirous of taking a shake with him Is he at home Why then no she replied and if ever a man left his house in a fury he did It appears that some one told him of a big basthoon of a giant called Cuhullin being down at the Causeway to look for him and so he set out there to try if he could catch him Troth I hope for the poor giant s sake he won t meet with him for if he does Fin will make paste of him at once Well said the other I am Cuhullin and I have been seeking him these twelve months but he always kept clear of me and I will never rest night or day till I lay my hands on him At this Oonagh set up a loud laugh of great contempt by the way and looked at him as if he was only a mere handful of a man Did you ever see Fin said she changing her manner all at once How could I said he he always took care to keep his distance I thought so she replied I judged as much and if you take my advice you poor looking creature you ll pray night and day that you may never see him for I tell you it will be a black day for you when you do But in the meantime you perceive that the wind s on the door and as Fin himself is from home maybe you d be civil enough to turn the house for it s always what Fin does when he s here This was a startler even to Cuhullin but he got up however and after pulling the middle finger of his right hand until it cracked three times he went outside and getting his arms about the house turned it as she had wished When Fin saw this he felt the sweat of fear oozing out through every pore of his skin but Oonagh depending upon her woman s wit felt not a whit daunted Arrah then said she as you are so civil maybe you d do another obliging turn for us as Fin s not here to do it himself You see after this long stretch of dry weather we ve had we feel very badly off for want of water Now Fin says there s a fine spring well somewhere under the rocks behind the hill here below and it was his intention to pull them asunder but having heard of you he left the place in such a fury that he never thought of it Now if you try to find it troth I d feel it a kindness She then brought Cuhullin down to see the place which was then all one solid rock and after looking at it for some time he cracked his right middle finger nine times and stooping down tore a cleft about four hundred feet deep and a quarter of a mile in length which has since been christened by the name of Lumford s Glen You ll now come in said she and eat a bit of such humble fare as we can give you Fin even although he and you are enemies would scorn not to treat you kindly in his own house and indeed if I didn t do it even in his absence he would not be pleased with me She accordingly brought him in and placing half a dozen of the cakes we spoke of before him together with a can or two of butter a side of boiled bacon and a stack of cabbage she desired him to help himself for this be it known was long before the invention of potatoes Cuhullin put one of the cakes in his mouth to take a huge whack out of it when he made a thundering noise something between a growl and a yell Blood and fury he shouted how is this Here are two of my teeth out What kind of bread is this you gave me What s the matter said Oonagh coolly Matter shouted the other again why here are the two best teeth in my head gone Why said she that s Fin s bread the only bread he ever eats when at home but indeed I forgot to tell you that nobody can eat it but himself and that child in the cradle there I thought however that as you were reported to be rather a stout little fellow of your size you might be able to manage it and I did not wish to affront a man that thinks himself able to fight Fin Here s another cake maybe it s not so hard as that Cuhullin at the moment was not only hungry but ravenous so he accordingly made a fresh set at the second cake and immediately another yell was heard twice as loud as the first Thunder and gibbets he roared take your bread out of this or I will not have a tooth in my head there s another pair of them gone Well honest man replied Oonagh if you re not able to eat the bread say so quietly and don t be wakening the child in the cradle there There now he s awake upon me Fin now gave a skirl that startled the giant as coming from such a youngster as he was supposed to be Mother said he I m hungry get me something to eat Oonagh went over and putting into his hand a cake that had no griddle in it Fin whose appetite in the meantime had been sharpened by seeing eating going forward soon swallowed it Cuhullin was thunderstruck and secretly thanked his stars that he had the good fortune to miss meeting Fin for as he said to himself I d have no chance with a man who could eat such bread as that which even his son that s but in his cradle can munch before my eyes I d like to take a glimpse at the lad in the cradle said he to Oonagh for I can tell you that the infant who can manage that nutriment is no joke to look at or to feed of a scarce summer Illustration With all the veins of my heart replied Oonagh get up acushla and show this decent little man something that won t be unworthy of your father Fin M Coul Fin who was dressed for the occasion as much like a boy as possible got up and bringing Cuhullin out Are you strong said he Thunder an ounds exclaimed the other what a voice in so small a chap Are you strong said Fin again are you able to squeeze water out of that white stone he asked putting one into Cuhullin s hand The latter squeezed and squeezed the stone but in vain Ah you re a poor creature said Fin You a giant Give me the stone here and when I ll show what Fin s little son can do you may then judge of what my daddy himself is Fin then took the stone and exchanging it for the curds he squeezed the latter until the whey as clear as water oozed out in a little shower from his hand I ll now go in said he to my cradle for I scorn to lose my time with any one that s not able to eat my daddy s bread or squeeze water out of a stone Bedad you had better be off out of this before he comes back for if he catches you it s in flummery he d have you in two minutes Cuhullin seeing what he had seen was of the same opinion himself his knees knocked together with the terror of Fin s return and he accordingly hastened to bid Oonagh farewell and to assure her that from that day out he never wished to hear of much less to see her husband I admit fairly that I m not a match for him said he strong as I am tell him I will avoid him as I would the plague and that I will make myself scarce in this part of the country while I live Fin in the meantime had gone into the cradle where he lay very quietly his heart at his mouth with delight that Cuhullin was about to take his departure without discovering the tricks that had been played off on him It s well for you said Oonagh that he doesn t happen to be here for it s nothing but hawk s meat he d make of you I know that said Cuhullin divil a thing else he d make of me but before I go will you let me feel what kind of teeth Fin s lad has got that can eat griddle bread like that With all pleasure in life said she only as they re far back in his head you must put your finger a good way in Cuhullin was surprised to find such a powerful set of grinders in one so young but he was still much more so on finding when he took his hand from Fin s mouth that he had left the very finger upon which his whole strength depended behind him He gave one loud groan and fell down at once with terror and weakness This was all Fin wanted who now knew that his most powerful and bitterest enemy was at his mercy He started out of the cradle and in a few minutes the great Cuhullin that was for such a length of time the terror of him and all his followers lay a corpse before him Thus did Fin through the wit and invention of Oonagh his wife succeed in overcoming his enemy by cunning which he never could have done by force Fair Brown and Trembling King Hugh Curucha lived in Tir Conal and he had three daughters whose names were Fair Brown and Trembling Fair and Brown had new dresses and went to church every Sunday Trembling was kept at home to do the cooking and work They would not let her go out of the house at all for she was more beautiful than the other two and they were in dread she might marry before themselves They carried on in this way for seven years At the end of seven years the son of the king of Emania fell in love with the eldest sister One Sunday morning after the other two had gone to church the old henwife came into the kitchen to Trembling and said It s at church you ought to be this day instead of working here at home How could I go said Trembling I have no clothes good enough to wear at church and if my sisters were to see me there they d kill me for going out of the house I ll give you said the henwife a finer dress than either of them has ever seen And now tell me what dress will you have I ll have said Trembling a dress as white as snow and green shoes for my feet Then the henwife put on the cloak of darkness clipped a piece from the old clothes the young woman had on and asked for the whitest robes in the world and the most beautiful that could be found and a pair of green shoes That moment she had the robe and the shoes and she brought them to Trembling who put them on When Trembling was dressed and ready the henwife said I have a honey bird here to sit on your right shoulder and a honey finger to put on your left At the door stands a milk white mare with a golden saddle for you to sit on and a golden bridle to hold in your hand Trembling sat on the golden saddle and when she was ready to start the henwife said You must not go inside the door of the church and the minute the people rise up at the end of Mass do you make off and ride home as fast as the mare will carry you When Trembling came to the door of the church there was no one inside who could get a glimpse of her but was striving to know who she was and when they saw her hurrying away at the end of Mass they ran out to overtake her But no use in their running she was away before any man could come near her From the minute she left the church till she got home she overtook the wind before her and outstripped the wind behind She came down at the door went in and found the henwife had dinner ready She put off the white robes and had on her old dress in a twinkling When the two sisters came home the henwife asked Have you any news to day from the church We have great news said they We saw a wonderful grand lady at the church door The like of the robes she had we have never seen on woman before It s little that was thought of our dresses beside what she had on and there wasn t a man at the church from the king to the beggar but was trying to look at her and know who she was The sisters would give no peace till they had two dresses like the robes of the strange lady but honey birds and honey fingers were not to be found Next Sunday the two sisters went to church again and left the youngest at home to cook the dinner After they had gone the henwife came in and asked Will you go to church to day I would go said Trembling if I could get the going What robe will you wear asked the henwife The finest black satin that can be found and red shoes for my feet What colour do you want the mare to be I want her to be so black and so glossy that I can see myself in her body The henwife put on the cloak of darkness and asked for the robes and the mare That moment she had them When Trembling was dressed the henwife put the honey bird on her right shoulder and the honey finger on her left The saddle on the mare was silver and so was the bridle Illustration TREMBLING AT THE CHURCH DOOR When Trembling sat in the saddle and was going away the henwife ordered her strictly not to go inside the door of the church but to rush away as soon as the people rose at the end of Mass and hurry home on the mare before any man could stop her That Sunday the people were more astonished than ever and gazed at her more than the first time and all they were thinking of was to know who she was But they had no chance for the moment the people rose at the end of Mass she slipped from the church was in the silver saddle and home before a man could stop her or talk to her The henwife had the dinner ready Trembling took off her satin robe and had on her old clothes before her sisters got home What news have you to day asked the henwife of the sisters when they came from the church Oh we saw the grand strange lady again And it s little that any man could think of our dresses after looking at the robes of satin that she had on And all at church from high to low had their mouths open gazing at her and no man was looking at us The two sisters gave neither rest nor peace till they got dresses as nearly like the strange lady s robes as they could find Of course they were not so good for the like of those robes could not be found in Erin When the third Sunday came Fair and Brown went to church dressed in black satin They left Trembling at home to work in the kitchen and told her to be sure and have dinner ready when they came back After they had gone and were out of sight the henwife came to the kitchen and said Well my dear are you for church to day I would go if I had a new dress to wear I ll get you any dress you ask for What dress would you like asked the henwife A dress red as a rose from the waist down and white as snow from the waist up a cape of green on my shoulders and a hat on my head with a red a white and a green feather in it and shoes for my feet with the toes red the middle white and the backs and heels green The henwife put on the cloak of darkness wished for all these things and had them When Trembling was dressed the henwife put the honey bird on her right shoulder and the honey finger on her left and placing the hat on her head clipped a few hairs from one lock and a few from another with her scissors and that moment the most beautiful golden hair was flowing down over the girl s shoulders Then the henwife asked what kind of a mare she would ride She said white with blue and gold coloured diamond shaped spots all over her body on her back a saddle of gold and on her head a golden bridle The mare stood there before the door and a bird sitting between her ears which began to sing as soon as Trembling was in the saddle and never stopped till she came home from the church The fame of the beautiful strange lady had gone out through the world and all the princes and great men that were in it came to church that Sunday each one hoping that it was himself would have her home with him after Mass The son of the king of Emania forgot all about the eldest sister and remained outside the church so as to catch the strange lady before she could hurry away The church was more crowded than ever before and there were three times as many outside There was such a throng before the church that Trembling could only come inside the gate As soon as the people were rising at the end of Mass the lady slipped out through the gate was in the golden saddle in an instant and sweeping away ahead of the wind But if she was the prince of Emania was at her side and seizing her by the foot he ran with the mare for thirty perches and never let go of the beautiful lady till the shoe was pulled from her foot and he was left behind with it in his hand She came home as fast as the mare could carry her and was thinking all the time that the henwife would kill her for losing the shoe Seeing her so vexed and so changed in the face the old woman asked What s the trouble that s on you now Oh I ve lost one of the shoes off my feet said Trembling Don t mind that don t be vexed said the henwife maybe it s the best thing that ever happened to you Then Trembling gave up all the things she had to the henwife put on her old clothes and went to work in the kitchen When the sisters came home the henwife asked Have you any news from the church We have indeed said they for we saw the grandest sight to day The strange lady came again in grander array than before On herself and the horse she rode were the finest colours of the world and between the ears of the horse was a bird which never stopped singing from the time she came till she went away The lady herself is the most beautiful woman ever seen by man in Erin After Trembling had disappeared from the church the son of the king of Emania said to the other kings sons I will have that lady for my own They all said You didn t win her just by taking the shoe off her foot you ll have to win her by the point of the sword you ll have to fight for her with us before you can call her your own Well said the son of the king of Emania when I find the lady that shoe will fit I ll fight for her never fear before I leave her to any of you Then all the kings sons were uneasy and anxious to know who was she that lost the shoe and they began to travel all over Erin to know could they find her The prince of Emania and all the others went in a great company together and made the round of Erin they went everywhere north south east and west They visited every place where a woman was to be found and left not a house in the kingdom they did not search to know could they find the woman the shoe would fit not caring whether she was rich or poor of high or low degree The prince of Emania always kept the shoe and when the young women saw it they had great hopes for it was of proper size neither large nor small and it would beat any man to know of what material it was made One thought it would fit her if she cut a little from her great toe and another with too short a foot put something in the tip of her stocking But no use they only spoiled their feet and were curing them for months afterwards The two sisters Fair and Brown heard that the princes of the world were looking all over Erin for the woman that could wear the shoe and every day they were talking of trying it on and one day Trembling spoke up and said Maybe it s my foot that the shoe will fit Oh the breaking of the dog s foot on you Why say so when you were at home every Sunday They were that way waiting and scolding the younger sister till the princes were near the place The day they were to come the sisters put Trembling in a closet and locked the door on her When the company came to the house the prince of Emania gave the shoe to the sisters But though they tried and tried it would fit neither of them Is there any other young woman in the house asked the prince There is said Trembling speaking up in the closet I m here Oh we have her for nothing but to put out the ashes said the sisters But the prince and the others wouldn t leave the house till they had seen her so the two sisters had to open the door When Trembling came out the shoe was given to her and it fitted exactly The prince of Emania looked at her and said You are the woman the shoe fits and you are the woman I took the shoe from Then Trembling spoke up and said Do you stay here till I return Then she went to the henwife s house The old woman put on the cloak of darkness got everything for her she had the first Sunday at church and put her on the white mare in the same fashion Then Trembling rode along the highway to the front of the house All who saw her the first time said This is the lady we saw at church Then she went away a second time and a second time came back on the black mare in the second dress which the henwife gave her All who saw her the second Sunday said That is the lady we saw at church A third time she asked for a short absence and soon came back on the third mare and in the third dress All who saw her the third time said That is the lady we saw at church Every man was satisfied and knew that she was the woman Then all the princes and great men spoke up and said to the son of the king of Emania You ll have to fight now for her before we let her go with you I m here before you ready for combat answered the prince Then the son of the king of Lochlin stepped forth The struggle began and a terrible struggle it was They fought for nine hours and then the son of the king of Lochlin stopped gave up his claim and left the field Next day the son of the king of Spain fought six hours and yielded his claim On the third day the son of the king of Nyerfoi fought eight hours and stopped The fourth day the son of the king of Greece fought six hours and stopped On the fifth day no more strange princes wanted to fight and all the sons of kings in Erin said they would not fight with a man of their own land that the strangers had had their chance and as no others came to claim the woman she belonged of right to the son of the king of Emania The marriage day was fixed and the invitations were sent out The wedding lasted for a year and a day When the wedding was over the king s son brought home the bride and when the time came a son was born The young woman sent for her eldest sister Fair to be with her and care for her One day when Trembling was well and when her husband was away hunting the two sisters went out to walk and when they came to the seaside the eldest pushed the youngest sister in A great whale came and swallowed her The eldest sister came home alone and the husband asked Where is your sister She has gone home to her father in Ballyshannon now that I am well I don t need her Well said the husband looking at her I m in dread it s my wife that was gone Oh no said she it s my sister Fair that s gone Since the sisters were very much alike the prince was in doubt That night he put his sword between them and said If you are my wife this sword will get warm if not it will stay cold Illustration In the morning when he rose up the sword was as cold as when he put it there It happened when the two sisters were walking by the sea shore that a little cowboy was down by the water minding cattle and saw Fair push Trembling into the sea and next day when the tide came in he saw the whale swim up and throw her out on the sand When she was on the sand she said to the cowboy When you go home in the evening with the cows tell the master that my sister Fair pushed me into the sea yesterday that a whale swallowed me and then threw me out but will come again and swallow me with the coming of the next tide then he ll go out with the tide and come again with tomorrow s tide and throw me again on the strand The whale will cast me out three times I m under the enchantment of this whale and cannot leave the beach or escape myself Unless my husband saves me before I m swallowed the fourth time I shall be lost He must come and shoot the whale with a silver bullet when he turns on the broad of his back Under the breast fin of the whale is a reddish brown spot My husband must hit him in that spot for it is the only place in which he can be killed When the cowboy got home the eldest sister gave him a draught of oblivion and he did not tell Next day he went again to the sea The whale came and cast Trembling on shore again She asked the boy Did you tell the master what I told you to tell him I did not said he I forgot How did you forget asked she The woman of the house gave me a drink that made me forget Well don t forget telling him this night and if she gives you a drink don t take it from her As soon as the cowboy came home the eldest sister offered him a drink He refused to take it till he had delivered his message and told all to the master The third day the prince went down with his gun and a silver bullet in it He was not long down when the whale came and threw Trembling upon the beach as the two days before She had no power to speak to her husband till he had killed the whale Then the whale went out turned over once on the broad of his back and showed the spot for a moment only That moment the prince fired He had but the one chance and a short one at that but he took it and he hit the spot and the whale mad with pain made the sea all around red with blood and died That minute Trembling was able to speak and went home with her husband who sent word to her father what the eldest sister had done The father came and told him any death he chose to give her to give it The prince told the father he would leave her life and death with himself The father had her put out then on the sea in a barrel with provisions in it for seven years In time Trembling had a second child a daughter The prince and she sent the cowboy to school and trained him up as one of their own children and said If the little girl that is born to us now lives no other man in the world will get her but him The cowboy and the prince s daughter lived on till they were married The mother said to her husband You could not have saved me from the whale but for the little cowboy on that account I don t grudge him my daughter The son of the king of Emania and Trembling had fourteen children and they lived happily till the two died of old age Jack and His Master A poor woman had three sons The eldest and second eldest were cunning clever fellows but they called the youngest Jack the Fool because they thought he was no better than a simpleton The eldest got tired of staying at home and said he d go look for service He stayed away a whole year and then came back one day dragging one foot after the other and a poor wizened face on him and he as cross as two sticks When he was rested and got something to eat he told them how he got service with the Grey Churl of the Townland of Mischance and that the agreement was whoever would first say he was sorry for his bargain should get an inch wide of the skin of his back from shoulder to hips taken off If it was the master he should also pay double wages if it was the servant he should get no wages at all But the thief says he gave me so little to eat and kept me so hard at work that flesh and blood couldn t stand it and when he asked me once when I was in a passion if I was sorry for my bargain I was mad enough to say I was and here I am disabled for life Vexed enough were the poor mother and brothers and the second eldest said on the spot he d go and take service with the Grey Churl and punish him by all the annoyance he d give him till he d make him say he was sorry for his agreement Oh won t I be glad to see the skin coming off the old villain s back said he All they could say had no effect he started off for the Townland of Mischance and in a twelvemonth he was back just as miserable and helpless as his brother All the poor mother could say didn t prevent Jack the Fool from starting to see if he was able to regulate the Grey Churl He agreed with him for a year for twenty pounds and the terms were the same Now Jack said the Grey Churl if you refuse to do anything you are able to do you must lose a month s wages I m satisfied said Jack and if you stop me from doing a thing after telling me to do it you are to give me an additional month s wages I am satisfied said the master Or if you blame me for obeying your orders you must give the same I am satisfied said the master again The first day that Jack served he was fed very poorly and was worked to the saddleskirts Next day he came in just before the dinner was served up to the parlour They were taking the goose off the spit but well becomes Jack he whips a knife off the dresser and cuts off one side of the breast one leg and thigh and one wing and fell to In came the master and began to abuse him for his assurance Oh you know master you re to feed me and wherever the goose goes won t have to be filled again till supper Are you sorry for our agreement The master was going to cry out he was but he bethought himself in time Oh no not at all said he That s well said Jack Next day Jack was to go clamp turf on the bog They weren t sorry to have him away from the kitchen at dinner time He didn t find his breakfast very heavy on his stomach so he said to the mistress I think ma am it will be better for me to get my dinner now and not lose time coming home from the bog That s true Jack said she So she brought out a good cake and a print of butter and a bottle of milk thinking he d take them away to the bog But Jack kept his seat and never drew rein till bread butter and milk went down the red lane Now mistress said he I ll be earlier at my work to morrow if I sleep comfortably on the sheltry side of a pile of dry peat on dry grass and not be coming here and going back So you may as well give me my supper and be done with the day s trouble She gave him that thinking he d take it to the bog but he fell to on the spot and did not leave a scrap to tell tales on him and the mistress was a little astonished He called to speak to the master in the haggard and said he What are servants asked to do in this country after aten their supper Nothing at all but to go to bed Oh very well sir He went up on the stable loft stripped and lay down and some one that saw him told the master He came up Jack you anointed scoundrel what do you mean To go to sleep master The mistress God bless her is after giving me my breakfast dinner and supper and yourself told me that bed was the next thing Do you blame me sir Yes you rascal I do Hand me out one pound thirteen and fourpence if you please sir One divil and thirteen imps you tinker what for Oh I see you ve forgot your bargain Are you sorry for it Oh ya no I mean I ll give you the money after your nap Next morning early Jack asked how he d be employed that day You are to be holding the plough in that fallow outside the paddock The master went over about nine o clock to see what kind of a ploughman was Jack and what did he see but the little boy driving the bastes and the sock and coulter of the plough skimming along the sod and Jack pulling ding dong again the horses What are you doing you contrary thief said the master An ain t I strivin to hold this divil of a plough as you told me but that ounkrawn of a boy keeps whipping on the bastes in spite of all I say will you speak to him No but I ll speak to you Didn t you know you bosthoon that when I said holding the plough I meant reddening the ground Faith an if you did I wish you had said so Do you blame me for what I have done The master caught himself in time but he was so stomached he said nothing Go on and redden the ground now you knave as other ploughmen do An are you sorry for our agreement Oh not at all not at all Jack ploughed away like a good workman all the rest of the day In a day or two the master bade him go and mind the cows in a field that had half of it under young corn Be sure particularly said he to keep Browney from the wheat while she s out of mischief there s no fear of the rest About noon he went to see how Jack was doing his duty and what did he find but Jack asleep with his face to the sod Browney grazing near a thorn tree one end of a long rope round her horns and the other end round the tree and the rest of the beasts all trampling and eating the green wheat Down came the switch on Jack Jack you vagabone do you see what the cows are at And do you blame me master To be sure you lazy sluggard I do Illustration Hand me out one pound thirteen and fourpence master You said if I only kept Browney out of mischief the rest would do no harm There she is as harmless as a lamb Are you sorry for hiring me master To be that is not at all I ll give you your money when you go to dinner Now understand me don t let a cow go out of the field nor into the wheat the rest of the day Never fear master and neither did he But the churl would rather than a great deal he had not hired him The next day three heifers were missing and the master bade Jack go in search of them Where will I look for them said Jack Oh every place likely and unlikely for them all to be in Illustration The churl was getting very exact in his words When he was coming into the bawn at dinnertime what work did he find Jack at but pulling armfuls of the thatch off the roof and peeping into the holes he was making What are you doing there you rascal Sure I m looking for the heifers poor things What would bring them there I don t think anything could bring them in it but I looked first into the likely places that is the cow houses and the pastures and the fields next em and now I m looking in the unlikeliest place I can think of Maybe it s not pleasing to you it is And to be sure it isn t pleasing to me you aggravating goose cap Please sir hand me one pound thirteen and fourpence before you sit down to your dinner I m afraid it s sorrow that s on you for hiring me at all May the div oh no I m not sorry Will you begin if you please and put in the thatch again just as if you were doing it for your mother s cabin Oh faith I will sir with a heart and a half and by the time the farmer came out for his dinner Jack had the roof better than it was before for he made the boy give him new straw Says the master when he came out Go Jack and look for the heifers and bring them home And where will I look for em Go and search for them as if they were your own The heifers were all in the paddock before sunset Next morning says the master Jack the path across the bog to the pasture is very bad the sheep does be sinking in it every step go and make the sheep s feet a good path About an hour after he came to the edge of the bog and what did he find Jack at but sharpening a carving knife and the sheep standing or grazing around Is this the way you are mending the path Jack said he Everything must have a beginning master said Jack and a thing well begun is half done I am sharpening the knife and I ll have the feet off every sheep in the flock while you d be blessing yourself Feet off my sheep you anointed rogue and what would you be taking their feet off for An sure to mend the path as you told me Says you Jack make a path with the foot of the sheep Oh you fool I meant make good the path for the sheep s feet It s a pity you didn t say so master Hand me out one pound thirteen and fourpence if you don t like me to finish my job Divil do you good with your one pound thirteen and fourpence It s better pray than curse master Maybe you re sorry for your bargain And to be sure I am not yet any way The next night the master was going to a wedding and says he to Jack before he set out I ll leave at midnight and I wish you to come and be with me home for fear I might be overtaken with the drink If you re there before you may throw a sheep s eye at me and I ll be sure to see that they ll give you something for yourself About eleven o clock while the master was in great spirits he felt something clammy hit him on the cheek It fell beside his tumbler and when he looked at it what was it but the eye of a sheep Well he couldn t imagine who threw it at him or why it was thrown at him After a little he got a blow on the other cheek and still it was by another sheep s eye Well he was very vexed but he thought better to say nothing In two minutes more when he was opening his mouth to take a sup another sheep s eye was slapped into it He sputtered it out and cried Man o the house isn t it a great shame for you to have any one in the room that would do such a nasty thing Master says Jack don t blame the honest man Sure it s only myself that was throwin them sheep s eyes at you to remind you I was here and that I wanted to drink the bride and bridegroom s health You know yourself bade me I know that you are a great rascal and where did you get the eyes An where would I get em but in the heads of your own sheep Would you have me meddle with the bastes of any neighbour who might put me in the Stone Jug for it Sorrow on me that ever I had the bad luck to meet with you You re all witness said Jack that my master says he is sorry for having met with me My time is up Master hand me over double wages and come into the next room and lay yourself out like a man that has some decency in him till I take a strip of skin an inch broad from your shoulder to your hip Every one shouted out against that but says Jack You didn t hinder him when he took the same strips from the backs of my two brothers and sent them home in that state and penniless to their poor mother When the company heard the rights of the business they were only too eager to see the job done The master bawled and roared but there was no help at hand He was stripped to his hips and laid on the floor in the next room and Jack had the carving knife in his hand ready to begin Now you cruel old villain said he giving the knife a couple of scrapes along the floor I ll make you an offer Give me along with my double wages two hundred guineas to support my poor brothers and I ll do without the strip No said he I d let you skin me from head to foot first Here goes then said Jack with a grin but the first little scar he gave Churl roared out Stop your hand I ll give the money Now neighbours said Jack you mustn t think worse of me than I deserve I wouldn t have the heart to take an eye out of a rat itself I got half a dozen of them from the butcher and only used three of them So all came again into the other room and Jack was made sit down and everybody drank his health and he drank everybody s health at one offer And six stout fellows saw himself and the master home and waited in the parlour while he went up and brought down the two hundred guineas and double wages for Jack himself When he got home he brought the summer along with him to the poor mother and the disabled brothers and he was no more Jack the Fool in the people s mouths but Skin Churl Jack Beth Gellert Prince Llewelyn had a favourite greyhound named Gellert that had been given to him by his father in law King John He was as gentle as a lamb at home but a lion in the chase One day Llewelyn went to the chase and blew his horn in front of his castle All his other dogs came to the call but Gellert never answered it So he blew a louder blast on his horn and called Gellert by name but still the greyhound did not come At last Prince Llewelyn could wait no longer and went off to the hunt without Gellert He had little sport that day because Gellert was not there the swiftest and boldest of his hounds He turned back in a rage to his castle and as he came to the gate who should he see but Gellert come bounding out to meet him But when the hound came near him the Prince was startled to see that his lips and fangs were dripping with blood Llewelyn started back and the greyhound crouched down at his feet as if surprised or afraid at the way his master greeted him Now Prince Llewelyn had a little son a year old with whom Gellert used to play and a terrible thought crossed the Prince s mind that made him rush towards the child s nursery And the nearer he came the more blood and disorder he found about the rooms He rushed into it and found the child s cradle overturned and daubed with blood Illustration Prince Llewelyn grew more and more terrified and sought for his little son everywhere He could find him nowhere but only signs of some terrible conflict in which much blood had been shed At last he felt sure the dog had destroyed his child and shouting to Gellert Monster thou hast devoured my child he drew out his sword and plunged it in the greyhound s side who fell with a deep yell and still gazing in his master s eyes As Gellert raised his dying yell a little child s cry answered it from beneath the cradle and there Llewelyn found his child unharmed and just awakened from sleep But just beside him lay the body of a great gaunt wolf all torn to pieces and covered with blood Too late Llewelyn learned what had happened while he was away Gellert had stayed behind to guard the child and had fought and slain the wolf that had tried to destroy Llewelyn s heir In vain was all Llewelyn s grief he could not bring his faithful dog to life again So he buried him outside the castle walls within sight of the great mountain of Snowdon where every passer by might see his grave and raised over it a great cairn of stones And to this day the place is called Beth Gellert or the Grave of Gellert and men say I repent me as much as the man that slew his greyhound The Tale of Ivan Illustration There were formerly a man and a woman living in the parish of Llanlavan in the place which is called Hwrdh And work became scarce so the man said to his wife I will go search for work and you may live here So he took fair leave and travelled far toward the East and at last came to the house of a farmer and asked for work What work can ye do said the farmer I can do all kinds of work said Ivan Then they agreed upon three pounds for the year s wages When the end of the year came his master showed him the three pounds See Ivan said he here s your wage but if you will give it me back I ll give you a piece of advice instead Give me my wage said Ivan No I ll not said the master I ll explain my advice Tell it me then said Ivan Then said the master Never leave the old road for the sake of a new one After that they agreed for another year at the old wages and at the end of it Ivan took instead a piece of advice and this was it Never lodge where an old man is married to a young woman The same thing happened at the end of the third year when the piece of advice was Honesty is the best policy But Ivan would not stay longer but wanted to go back to his wife Don t go to day said his master my wife bakes to morrow and she shall make thee a cake to take home to thy good woman And when Ivan was going to leave Here said his master here is a cake for thee to take home to thy wife and when ye are most joyous together then break the cake and not sooner So he took fair leave of them and travelled towards home and at last he came to Wayn Her and there he met three merchants from Tre Rhyn of his own parish coming home from Exeter Fair Oho Ivan said they come with us glad are we to see you Where have you been so long I have been in service said Ivan And now I m going home to my wife Oh come with us you ll be right welcome But when they took the new road Ivan kept to the old one And robbers fell upon them before they had gone far from Ivan as they were going by the fields of the houses in the meadow They began to cry out Thieves and Ivan shouted out Thieves too And when the robbers heard Ivan s shout they ran away and the merchants went by the new road and Ivan by the old one till they met again at Market Jew Oh Ivan said the merchants we are beholding to you but for you we would have been lost men Come lodge with us at our cost and welcome When they came to the place where they used to lodge Ivan said I must see the host The host they cried what do you want with the host Here is the hostess and she s young and pretty If you want to see the host you ll find him in the kitchen So he went into the kitchen to see the host he found him a weak old man turning the spit Oh oh quoth Ivan I ll not lodge here but will go next door Not yet said the merchants sup with us and welcome Now it happened that the hostess had plotted with a certain monk in Market Jew to murder the old man in his bed that night while the rest were asleep and they agreed to lay it on the lodgers So while Ivan was in bed next door there was a hole in the pine end of the house and he saw a light through it So he got up and looked and heard the monk speaking I had better cover this hole said he or people in the next house may see our deeds So he stood with his back against it while the hostess killed the old man But meanwhile Ivan out with his knife and putting it through the whole cut a round piece off the monk s robe The very next morning the hostess raised the cry that her husband was murdered and as there was neither man nor child in the house but the merchants she declared they ought to be hanged for it So they were taken and carried to prison till at last Ivan came to them Alas alas Ivan cried they bad luck sticks to us our host was killed last night and we shall be hanged for it Ah tell the justices said Ivan to summon the real murderers Who knows they replied who committed the crime Who committed the crime said Ivan If I cannot prove who committed the crime hang me in your stead So he told all he knew and brought out the piece of cloth from the monk s robe and with that the merchants were set at liberty and the hostess and the monk were seized and hanged Then they came all together out of Market Jew and they said to him Come as far as Coed Carrn y Wylfa the Wood of the Heap of Stones of Watching in the parish of Burman Then their two roads separated and though the merchants wished Ivan to go with them he would not go with them but went straight home to his wife And when his wife saw him she said Home in the nick of time Here s a purse of gold that I ve found it has no name but sure it belongs to the great lord yonder I was just thinking what to do when you came Then Ivan thought of the third counsel and he said Let us go and give it to the great lord So they went up to the castle but the great lord was not in it so they left the purse with the servant that minded the gate and then they went home again and lived in quiet for a time But one day the great lord stopped at their house for a drink of water and Ivan s wife said to him I hope your lordship found your lordship s purse quite safe with all its money in it What purse is that you are talking about said the lord Sure it s your lordship s purse that I left at the castle says Ivan Come with me and we will see into the matter said the lord So Ivan and his wife went up to the castle and there they pointed out the man to whom they had given the purse and he had to give it up and was sent away from the castle And the lord was so pleased with Ivan that he made him his servant in the stead of the thief Honesty s the best policy quoth Ivan as he skipped about in his new quarters How joyful I am Then he thought of his old master s cake that he was to eat when he was most joyful and when he broke it lo and behold inside it was his wages for the three years he had been with him Andrew Coffey My grandfather Andrew Coffey was known to the whole barony as a quiet decent man And if the whole barony knew him he knew the whole barony every inch hill and dale bog and pasture field and covert Fancy his surprise one evening when he found himself in a part of the demesne he couldn t recognise a bit He and his good horse were always stumbling up against some tree or stumbling down into some bog hole that by rights didn t ought to be there On the top of all this the rain came pelting down wherever there was a clearing and the cold March wind tore through the trees Glad he was when he saw a light in the distance and drawing near found a cabin though for the life of him he couldn t think how it came there However in he walked after tying up his horse and right welcome was the brushwood fire blazing on the hearth And there stood a chair right and tight that seemed to say Come sit down in me There wasn t a soul else in the room Well he did sit and got a little warm and cheered after his drenching But all the while he was wondering and wondering Andrew Coffey Andrew Coffey Good heavens who was calling him and not a soul in sight Look around as he might indoors and out he could find no creature with two legs or four for his horse was gone Andrew Coffey Andrew Coffey Tell me a story It was louder this time and it was nearer And then what a thing to ask for It was bad enough not to be let sit by the fire and dry oneself without being bothered for a story Andrew Coffey Andrew Coffey Tell me a story or it ll be the worse for you My poor grandfather was so dumfounded that he could only stand and stare Andrew Coffey Andrew Coffey I told you it d be the worse for you And with that out there bounced from a cupboard that Andrew Coffey had never noticed before a man And the man was in a towering rage But it wasn t that And he carried as fine a blackthorn as you d wish to crack a man s head with But it wasn t that either But when my grandfather clapped eyes on him he knew him for Patrick Rooney and all the world knew he d gone overboard fishing one night long years before Andrew Coffey would neither stop nor stay but he took to his heels and was out of the house as hard as he could He ran and he ran taking little thought of what was before till at last he ran up against a big tree And then he sat down to rest He hadn t sat for a moment when he heard voices It s heavy he is the vagabond Steady now we ll rest when we get under the big tree yonder Now that happened to be the tree under which Andrew Coffey was sitting At least he thought so for seeing a branch handy he swung himself up by it and was soon snugly hidden away Better see than be seen thought he The rain had stopped and the wind fallen The night was blacker than ever but Andrew Coffey could see four men and they were carrying between them a long box Under the tree they came set the box down opened it and who should they bring out but Patrick Rooney Never a word did he say and he looked as pale as old snow Well one gathered brushwood and another took out tinder and flint and they soon had a big fire roaring and my grandfather could see Patrick plainly enough If he had kept still before he kept stiller now Soon they had four poles up and a pole across right over the fire for all the world like a spit and on to the pole they slung Patrick Rooney He ll do well enough said one but who s to mind him whilst we re away who ll turn the fire who ll see that he doesn t burn With that Patrick opened his lips Andrew Coffey said he Andrew Coffey Andrew Coffey Andrew Coffey Andrew Coffey I m much obliged to you gentlemen said Andrew Coffey but indeed I know nothing about the business You d better come down Andrew Coffey said Patrick It was the second time he spoke and Andrew Coffey decided he would come down The four men went off and he was left all alone with Patrick Then he sat and he kept the fire even and he kept the spit turning and all the while Patrick looked at him Poor Andrew Coffey couldn t make it all out at all at all and he stared at Patrick and at the fire and he thought of the little house in the wood till he felt quite dazed Ah but it s burning me ye are says Patrick very short and sharp I m sure I beg your pardon said my grandfather but might I ask you a question If you want a crooked answer said Patrick turn away or it ll be the worse for you But my grandfather couldn t get it out of his head hadn t everybody far and near said Patrick had fallen overboard There was enough to think about and my grandfather did think Andrew Coffey Andrew Coffey It s burning me ye are Sorry enough my grandfather was and he vowed he wouldn t do so again You d better not said Patrick and he gave him a cock of his eye and a grin of his teeth that just sent a shiver down Andrew Coffey s back Well it was odd that here he should be in a thick wood he had never set eyes upon turning Patrick Rooney upon a spit You can t wonder at my grandfather thinking and thinking and not minding the fire Andrew Coffey Andrew Coffey It s the death of you I ll be And with that what did my grandfather see but Patrick unslinging himself from the spit and his eyes glared and his teeth glistened Illustration It was neither stop nor stay my grandfather made but out he ran into the night of the wood It seemed to him there wasn t a stone but was for his stumbling not a branch but beat his face not a bramble but tore his skin And wherever it was clear the rain pelted down and the cold March wind howled along Glad was he to see a light and a minute after he was kneeling dazed drenched and bedraggled by the hearth side The brushwood flamed and the brushwood crackled and soon my grandfather began to feel a little warm and dry and easy in his mind Andrew Coffey Andrew Coffey It s hard for a man to jump when he has been through all my grandfather had but jump he did And when he looked around where should he find himself but in the very cabin he had first met Patrick in Andrew Coffey Andrew Coffey tell me a story Is it a story you want said my grandfather as bold as may be for he was just tired of being frightened Well if you can tell me the rights of this one I ll be thankful And he told the tale of what had befallen him from first to last that night The tale was long and maybe Andrew Coffey was weary It s asleep he must have fallen for when he awoke he lay on the hill side under the open heavens and his horse grazed at his side The Battle of the Birds Illustration I will tell you a story about the wren There was once a farmer who was seeking a servant and the wren met him and said What are you seeking I am seeking a servant said the farmer to the wren Will you take me said the wren You you poor creature what good would you do Try me said the wren So he engaged him and the first work he set him to do was threshing in the barn The wren threshed what did he thresh with Why a flail to be sure and he knocked off one grain A mouse came out and she eats that I ll trouble you not to do that again said the wren He struck again and he struck off two grains Out came the mouse and she eats them So they arranged a contest to see who was strongest and the wren brings his twelve birds and the mouse her tribe You have your tribe with you said the wren As well as yourself said the mouse and she struck out her leg proudly But the wren broke it with his flail and there was a pitched battle on a set day When every creature and bird was gathering to battle the son of the king of Tethertown said that he would go to see the battle and that he would bring sure word home to his father the king who would be king of the creatures this year The battle was over before he arrived all but one fight between a great black raven and a snake The snake was twined about the raven s neck and the raven held the snake s throat in his beak and it seemed as if the snake would get the victory over the raven When the king s son saw this he helped the raven and with one blow takes the head off the snake When the raven had taken breath and saw that the snake was dead he said For thy kindness to me this day I will give thee a sight Come up now on the root of my two wings The king s son put his hands about the raven before his wings and before he stopped he took him over nine Bens and nine Glens and nine Mountain Moors Now said the raven see you that house yonder Go now to it It is a sister of mine that makes her dwelling in it and I will go bail that you are welcome And if she asks you Were you at the battle of the birds say you were And if she asks Did you see any one like me say you did but be sure that you meet me to morrow morning here in this place The king s son got good and right good treatment that night Meat of each meat drink of each drink warm water to his feet and a soft bed for his limbs On the next day the raven gave him the same sight over six Bens and six Glens and six Mountain Moors They saw a bothy far off but though far off they were soon there He got good treatment this night as before plenty of meat and drink and warm water to his feet and a soft bed to his limbs and on the next day it was the same thing over three Bens and three Glens and three Mountain Moors On the third morning instead of seeing the raven as at the other times who should meet him but the handsomest lad he ever saw with gold rings in his hair with a bundle in his hand The king s son asked this lad if he had seen a big black raven Said the lad to him You will never see the raven again for I am that raven I was put under spells by a bad druid it was meeting you that loosed me and for that you shall get this bundle Now said the lad you must turn back on the self same steps and lie a night in each house as before but you must not loose the bundle which I gave ye till in the place where you would most wish to dwell The king s son turned his back to the lad and his face to his father s house and he got lodging from the raven s sisters just as he got it when going forward When he was nearing his father s house he was going through a close wood It seemed to him that the bundle was growing heavy and he thought he would look what was in it When he loosed the bundle he was astonished In a twinkling he sees the very grandest place he ever saw A great castle and an orchard about the castle in which was every kind of fruit and herb He stood full of wonder and regret for having loosed the bundle for it was not in his power to put it back again and he would have wished this pretty place to be in the pretty little green hollow that was opposite his father s house but he looked up and saw a great giant coming towards him Bad s the place where you have built the house king s son says the giant Yes but it is not here I would wish it to be though it happens to be here by mishap says the king s son What s the reward for putting it back in the bundle as it was before What s the reward you would ask says the king s son That you will give me the first son you have when he is seven years of age says the giant If I have a son you shall have him said the king s son In a twinkling the giant put each garden and orchard and castle in the bundle as they were before Now says the giant take your own road and I will take mine but mind your promise and if you forget I will remember The king s son took to the road and at the end of a few days he reached the place he was fondest of He loosed the bundle and the castle was just as it was before And when he opened the castle door he sees the handsomest maiden he ever cast eye upon Advance king s son said the pretty maid everything is in order for you if you will marry me this very day It s I that am willing said the king s son And on the same day they married But at the end of a day and seven years who should be seen coming to the castle but the giant The king s son was reminded of his promise to the giant and till now he had not told his promise to the queen Leave the matter between me and the giant says the queen Turn out your son says the giant mind your promise You shall have him says the king when his mother puts him in order for his journey The queen dressed up the cook s son and she gave him to the giant by the hand The giant went away with him but he had not gone far when he put a rod in the hand of the little laddie The giant asked him If thy father had that rod what would he do with it If my father had that rod he would beat the dogs and the cats so that they shouldn t be going near the king s meat said the little laddie Thou rt the cook s son said the giant He catches him by the two small ankles and knocks him against the stone that was beside him The giant turned back to the castle in rage and madness and he said that if they did not send out the king s son to him the highest stone of the castle would be the lowest Said the queen to the king We ll try it yet the butler s son is of the same age as our son She dressed up the butler s son and she gives him to the giant by the hand The giant had not gone far when he put the rod in his hand If thy father had that rod says the giant what would he do with it He would beat the dogs and the cats when they would be coming near the king s bottles and glasses Thou art the son of the butler says the giant and dashed his brains out too The giant returned in a very great rage and anger The earth shook under the soles of his feet and the castle shook and all that was in it OUT HERE WITH THY SON says the giant or in a twinkling the stone that is highest in the dwelling will be the lowest So they had to give the king s son to the giant When they were gone a little bit from the earth the giant showed him the rod that was in his hand and said What would thy father do with this rod if he had it The king s son said My father has a braver rod than that And the giant asked him Where is thy father when he has that brave rod And the king s son said He will be sitting in his kingly chair Then the giant understood that he had the right one The giant took him to his own house and he reared him as his own son On a day of days when the giant was from home the lad heard the sweetest music he ever heard in a room at the top of the giant s house At a glance he saw the finest face he had ever seen She beckoned to him to come a bit nearer to her and she said her name was Auburn Mary but she told him to go this time but to be sure to be at the same place about that dead midnight And as he promised he did The giant s daughter was at his side in a twinkling and she said To morrow you will get the choice of my two sisters to marry but say that you will not take either but me My father wants me to marry the son of the king of the Green City but I don t like him On the morrow the giant took out his three daughters and he said Now son of the king of Tethertown thou hast not lost by living with me so long Thou wilt get to wife one of the two eldest of my daughters and with her leave to go home with her the day after the wedding If you will give me this pretty little one says the king s son I will take you at your word The giant s wrath kindled and he said Before thou gett saint her thou must do the three things that I ask thee to do Say on says the king s son The giant took him to the byre Now says the giant a hundred cattle are stabled here and it has not been cleansed for seven years I am going from home to day and if this byre is not cleaned before night comes so clean that a golden apple will run from end to end of it not only thou shalt not get my daughter but tis only a drink of thy fresh goodly beautiful blood that will quench my thirst this night He begins cleaning the byre but he might just as well keep baling the great ocean After midday when sweat was blinding him the giant s youngest daughter came where he was and she said to him You are being punished king s son I am that says the king s son Come over says Auburn Mary and lay down your weariness I will do that says he there is but death awaiting me at any rate He sat down near her He was so tired that he fell asleep beside her When he awoke the giant s daughter was not to be seen but the byre was so well cleaned that a golden apple would run from end to end of it and raise no stain In comes the giant and he said Hast thou cleaned the byre king s son I have cleaned it says he Somebody cleaned it says the giant You did not clean it at all events said the king s son Well well says the giant since thou wert so active to day thou wilt get to this time to morrow to thatch this byre with birds down from birds with no two feathers of one colour The king s son was on foot before the sun he caught up his bow and his quiver of arrows to kill the birds He took to the moors but if he did the birds were not so easy to take He was running after them till the sweat was blinding him About midday who should come but Auburn Mary You are exhausting yourself king s son says she I am said he There fell but these two blackbirds and both of one colour Come over and lay down your weariness on this pretty hillock says the giant s daughter It s I am willing said he He thought she would aid him this time too and he sat down near her and he was not long there till he fell asleep When he awoke Auburn Mary was gone He thought he would go back to the house and he sees the byre thatched with feathers When the giant came home he said Hast thou thatched the byre king s son I thatched it says he Somebody thatched it says the giant You did not thatch it says the king s son Yes yes says the giant Now says the giant there is a fir tree beside that loch down there and there is a magpie s nest in its top The eggs thou wilt find in the nest I must have them for my first meal Not one must be burst or broken and there are five in the nest Early in the morning the king s son went where the tree was and that tree was not hard to hit upon Its match was not in the whole wood From the foot to the first branch was five hundred feet The king s son was going all round the tree She came who was always bringing help to him You are losing the skin of your hands and feet Ach I am says he I am no sooner up than down This is no time for stopping says the giant s daughter Now you must kill me strip the flesh from my bones take all those bones apart and use them as steps for climbing the tree When you are climbing the tree they will stick to the glass as if they had grown out of it but when you are coming down and have put your foot on each one they will drop into your hand when you touch them Be sure and stand on each bone leave none untouched if you do it will stay behind Put all my flesh into this clean cloth by the side of the spring at the roots of the tree When you come to the earth arrange my bones together put the flesh over them sprinkle it with water from the spring and I shall be alive before you But don t forget a bone of me on the tree Illustration The Giant s Daughter BIDS the BIRDS watch her Father s byre How could I kill you asked the king s son after what you have done for me If you won t obey you and I are done for said Auburn Mary You must climb the tree or we are lost and to climb the tree you must do as I say The king s son obeyed He killed Auburn Mary cut the flesh from her body and unjointed the bones as she had told him As he went up the king s son put the bones of Auburn Mary s body against the side of the tree using them as steps till he came under the nest and stood on the last bone Then he took the eggs and coming down put his foot on every bone then took it with him till he came to the last bone which was so near the ground that he failed to touch it with his foot He now placed all the bones of Auburn Mary in order again at the side of the spring put the flesh on them sprinkled it with water from the spring She rose up before him and said Didn t I tell you not to leave a bone of my body without stepping on it Now I am lame for life You left my little finger on the tree without touching it and I have but nine fingers Now says she go home with the eggs quickly and you will get me to marry to night if you can know me I and my two sisters will be arrayed in the same garments and made like each other but look at me when my father says Go to thy wife king s son and you will see a hand without a little finger He gave the eggs to the giant Yes yes said the giant be making ready for your marriage Then indeed there was a wedding and it was a wedding Giants and gentlemen and the son of the king of the Green City was in the midst of them They were married and the dancing began that was a dance The giant s house was shaking from top to bottom But bed time came and the giant said It is time for thee to go to rest son of the king of Tethertown choose thy bride to take with thee from amidst those She put out the hand off which the little finger was and he caught her by the hand Thou hast aimed well this time too but there is no knowing but we may meet thee another way said the giant But to rest they went Now says she sleep not or else you are a dead man We must fly quick quick or for certain my father will kill you Out they went and on the blue grey filly in the stable they mounted Stop a while says she and I will play a trick to the old hero She jumped in and cut an apple into nine shares and she put two shares at the head of the bed and two shares at the foot of the bed and two shares at the door of the kitchen and two shares at the big door and one outside the house The giant awoke and called Are you asleep Not yet said the apple that was at the head of the bed At the end of a while he called again Not yet said the apple that was at the foot of the bed A while after this he called again Are you asleep Not yet said the apple at the kitchen door The giant called again The apple that was at the big door answered You are now going far from me says the giant Not yet says the apple that was outside the house You are flying says the giant The giant jumped on his feet and to the bed he went but it was cold empty My own daughter s tricks are trying me said the giant Here s after them says he At the mouth of the day the giant s daughter said that her father s breath was burning her back Put your hand quick said she in the ear of the grey filly and whatever you find in it throw it behind us There is a twig of sloe tree said he Throw it behind us said she No sooner did he that than there were twenty miles of blackthorn wood so thick that scarce a weasel could go through it The giant came headlong and there he is fleecing his head and neck in the thorns My own daughter s tricks are here as before said the giant but if I had my own big axe and wood knife here I would not be long making a way through this He went home for the big axe and the wood knife and sure he was not long on his journey and he was the boy behind the big axe He was not long making a way through the blackthorn I will leave the axe and the wood knife here till I return says he If you leave em leave em said a hoodie that was in a tree we ll steal em steal em If you will do that says the giant I must take them home He returned home and left them at the house At the heat of day the giant s daughter felt her father s breath burning her back Put your finger in the filly s ear and throw behind whatever you find in it He got a splinter of grey stone and in a twinkling there were twenty miles by breadth and height of great grey rock behind them The giant came full pelt but past the rock he could not go The tricks of my own daughter are the hardest things that ever met me says the giant but if I had my lever and my mighty mattock I would not be long in making my way through this rock also There was no help for it but to turn the chase for them and he was the boy to split the stones He was not long in making a road through the rock I will leave the tools here and I will return no more If you leave em leave em says the hoodie we will steal em steal em Do that if you will there is no time to go back At the time of breaking the watch the giant s daughter said that she felt her father s breath burning her back Look in the filly s ear king s son or else we are lost He did so and it was a bladder of water that was in her ear this time He threw it behind him and there was a fresh water loch twenty miles in length and breadth behind them The giant came on but with the speed he had on him he was in the middle of the loch and he went under and he rose no more On the next day the young companions were come in sight of his father s house Now says she my father is drowned and he won t trouble us any more but before we go further says she go you to your father s house and tell that you have the likes of me but let neither man nor creature kiss you for if you do you will not remember that you have ever seen me Every one he met gave him welcome and luck and he charged his father and mother not to kiss him but as mishap was to be an old greyhound was indoors and she knew him and jumped up to his mouth and after that he did not remember the giant s daughter She was sitting at the well s side as he left her but the king s son was not coming In the mouth of night she climbed up into a tree of oak that was beside the well and she lay in the fork of that tree all night A shoemaker had a house near the well and about midday on the morrow the shoemaker asked his wife to go for a drink for him out of the well When the shoemaker s wife reached the well and when she saw the shadow of her that was in the tree thinking it was her own shadow and she never thought till now that she was so handsome she gave a cast to the dish that was in her hand and it was broken on the ground and she took herself to the house without vessel or water Where is the water wife said the shoemaker You shambling contemptible old carle without grace I have stayed too long your water and wood thrall I think wife that you have turned crazy Go you daughter quickly and fetch a drink for your father His daughter went and in the same way so it happened to her She never thought till now that she was so lovable and she took herself home Up with the drink said her father You home spun shoe carle do you think I am fit to be your thrall The poor shoemaker thought that they had taken a turn in their understandings and he went himself to the well He saw the shadow of the maiden in the well and he looked up to the tree and he sees the finest woman he ever saw Your seat is wavering but your face is fair said the shoemaker Come down for there is need of you for a short while at my house The shoemaker understood that this was the shadow that had driven his people mad The shoemaker took her to his house and he said that he had but a poor bothy but that she should get a share of all that was in it One day the shoemaker had shoes ready for on that very day the king s son was to be married The shoemaker was going to the castle with the shoes of the young people and the girl said to the shoemaker I would like to get a sight of the king s son before he marries Come with me says the shoemaker I am well acquainted with the servants at the castle and you shall get a sight of the king s son and all the company And when the gentles saw the pretty woman that was here they took her to the wedding room and they filled for her a glass of wine When she was going to drink what was in it a flame went up out of the glass and a golden pigeon and a silver pigeon sprang out of it They were flying about when three grains of barley fell on the floor The silver pigeon sprang and ate that up Said the golden pigeon to him If you remembered when I cleared the byre you would not eat that without giving me a share Again there fell three other grains of barley and the silver pigeon sprang and ate that up as before If you remembered when I thatched the byre you would not eat that without giving me my share says the golden pigeon Three other grains fall and the silver pigeon sprang and ate that up If you remembered when I harried the magpie s nest you would not eat that without giving me my share says the golden pigeon I lost my little finger bringing it down and I want it still The king s son minded and he knew who it was that was before him Well said the king s son to the guests at the feast when I was a little younger than I am now I lost the key of a casket that I had I had a new key made but after it was brought to me I found the old one Now I ll leave it to any one here to tell me what I am to do Which of the keys should I keep My advice to you said one of the guests is to keep the old key for it fits the lock better and you re more used to it Then the king s son stood up and said I thank you for a wise advice and an honest word This is my bride the daughter of the giant who saved my life at the risk of her own I ll have her and no other woman So the king s son married Auburn Mary and the wedding lasted long and all were happy But all I got was butter on a live coal porridge in a basket and paper shoes for my feet and they sent me for water to the stream and the paper shoes came to an end Brewery of Eggshells Illustration In Treneglwys there is a certain shepherd s cot known by the name of Twt y Cymrws because of the strange strife that occurred there There once lived there a man and his wife and they had twins whom the woman nursed tenderly One day she was called away to the house of a neighbour at some distance She did not much like going and leaving her little ones all alone in a solitary house especially as she had heard tell of the good folk haunting the neighbourhood Well she went and came back as soon as she could but on her way back she was frightened to see some old elves of the blue petticoat crossing her path though it was midday She rushed home but found her two little ones in the cradle and everything seemed as it was before But after a time the good people began to suspect that something was wrong for the twins didn t grow at all The man said They re not ours The woman said Whose else should they be And so arose the great strife so that the neighbours named the cottage after it It made the woman very sad so one evening she made up her mind to go and see the Wise Man of Llanidloes for he knew everything and would advise her what to do So she went to Llanidloes and told the case to the Wise Man Now there was soon to be a harvest of rye and oats so the Wise Man said to her When you are getting dinner for the reapers clear out the shell of a hen s egg and boil some pottage in it and then take it to the door as if you meant it as a dinner for the reapers Then listen if the twins say anything If you hear them speaking of things beyond the understanding of children go back and take them up and throw them into the waters of Lake Elvyn But if you don t hear anything remarkable do them no injury So when the day of the reap came the woman did all that the Wise Man ordered and put the eggshell on the fire and took it off and carried it to the door and there she stood and listened Then she heard one of the children say to the other Acorn before oak I knew An egg before a hen But I never heard of an eggshell brew A dinner for harvest men So she went back into the house seized the children and threw them into the Llyn and the goblins in their blue trousers came and saved their dwarfs and the mother had her own children back and so the great strife ended The Lad with the Goat skin Long ago a poor widow woman lived down near the iron forge by Enniscorth and she was so poor she had no clothes to put on her son so she used to fix him in the ash hole near the fire and pile the warm ashes about him and according as he grew up she sunk the pit deeper At last by hook or by crook she got a goat skin and fastened it round his waist and he felt quite grand and took a walk down the street So says she to him next morning Tom you thief you never done any good yet and you six foot high and past nineteen take that rope and bring me a faggot from the wood Never say t twice mother says Tom here goes When he had it gathered and tied what should come up but a big giant nine foot high and made a lick of a club at him Well become Tom he jumped a one side and picked up a ram pike and the first crack he gave the big fellow he made him kiss the clod If you have e er a prayer says Tom now s the time to say it before I make fragments of you I have no prayers says the giant but if you spare my life I ll give you that club and as long as you keep from sin you ll win every battle you ever fight with it Tom made no bones about letting him off and as soon as he got the club in his hands he sat down on the bresna and gave it a tap with the kippeen and says Faggot I had great trouble gathering you and run the risk of my life for you the least you can do is to carry me home And sure enough the wind o the word was all it wanted It went off through the wood groaning and crackling till it came to the widow s door Well when the sticks were all burned Tom was sent off again to pick more and this time he had to fight with a giant that had two heads on him Tom had a little more trouble with him that s all and the prayers he said was to give Tom a fife that nobody could help dancing when he was playing it Begorries he made the big faggot dance home with himself sitting on it The next giant was a beautiful boy with three heads on him He had neither prayers nor catechism no more nor the others and so he gave Tom a bottle of green ointment that wouldn t let you be burned nor scalded nor wounded And now says he there s no more of us You may come and gather sticks here till little Lunacy Day in Harvest without giant or fairy man to disturb you Well now Tom was prouder nor ten paycock and used to take a walk down street in the heel of the evening but some o the little boys had no more manners than if they were Dublin jackeens and put out their tongues at Tom s club and Tom s goat skin He didn t like that at all and it would be mean to give one of them a clout At last what should come through the town but a kind of a bell man only it s a big bugle he had and a huntsman s cap on his head and a kind of painted shirt So this he wasn t a bell man and I don t know what to call him bugle man maybe proclaimed that the king of Dublin s daughter was so melancholy that she didn t give a laugh for seven years and that her father would grant her in marriage to whoever could make her laugh three times That s the very thing for me to try says Tom and so without burning any more daylight he kissed his mother curled his club at the little boys and off he set along the yalla highroad to the town of Dublin At last Tom came to one of the city gates and the guards laughed and cursed at him instead of letting him in Tom stood it all for a little time but at last one of them out of fun as he said drove his bayonet half an inch or so into his side Tom done nothing but take the fellow by the scruff o the neck and the waistband of his corduroys and fling him into the canal Some run to pull the fellow out and others to let manners into the vulgarian with their swords and daggers but a tap from his club sent them headlong into the moat or down on the stones and they were soon begging him to stay his hands So at last one of them was glad enough to show Tom the way to the palace yard and there was the king and the queen and the princess in a gallery looking at all sorts of wrestling and sword playing and long dances and mumming all to please the princess but not a smile came over her handsome face Well they all stopped when they seen the young giant with his boy s face and long black hair and his short curly beard for his mother couldn t afford to buy razors and his great strong arms and bare legs and no covering but the goat skin that reached from his waist to his knees But an envious wizened bit of a fellow with a red head that wished to be married to the princess and didn t like how she opened her eyes at Tom came forward and asked his business very snappishly My business said Tom says he is to make the beautiful princess God bless her laugh three times Do you see all them merry fellows and skilful swordsmen said the other that could eat you up with a grain of salt and not a mother s soul of em ever got a laugh from her these seven years So the fellows gathered round Tom and the bad man aggravated him till he told them he didn t care a pinch o snuff for the whole bilin of em let em come on six at a time and try what they could do The king who was too far off to hear what they were saying asked what did the stranger want He wants said the red headed fellow to make hares of your best men Oh says the king if that s the way let one of em turn out and try his mettle So one stood forward with sword and pot lid and made a cut at Tom He struck the fellow s elbow with the club and up over their heads flew the sword and down went the owner of it on the gravel from a thump he got on the helmet Another took his place and another and another and then half a dozen at once and Tom sent swords helmets shields and bodies rolling over and over and themselves bawling out that they were kilt and disabled and damaged and rubbing their poor elbows and hips and limping away Tom contrived not to kill any one and the princess was so amused that she let a great sweet laugh out of her that was heard over all the yard King of Dublin said Tom I ve quarter of your daughter And the king didn t know whether he was glad or sorry and all the blood in the princess s heart run into her cheeks So there was no more fighting that day and Tom was invited to dine with the royal family Next day Redhead told Tom of a wolf the size of a yearling heifer that used to be serenading about the walls and eating people and cattle and said what a pleasure it would give the king to have it killed With all my heart says Tom send a jackeen to show me where he lives and we ll see how he behaves to a stranger The princess was not well pleased for Tom looked a different person with fine clothes and a nice green birredh over his long curly hair and besides he d got one laugh out of her However the king gave his consent and in an hour and a half the horrible wolf was walking into the palace yard and Tom a step or two behind with his club on his shoulder just as a shepherd would be walking after a pet lamb The king and queen and princess were safe up in their gallery but the officers and people of the court that wor padrowling about the great bawn when they saw the big baste coming in gave themselves up and began to make for doors and gates and the wolf licked his chops as if he was saying Wouldn t I enjoy a breakfast off a couple of yez The king shouted out O Tom with the Goat skin take away that terrible wolf and you must have all my daughter But Tom didn t mind him a bit He pulled out his flute and began to play like vengeance and dickens a man or boy in the yard but began shovelling away heel and toe and the wolf himself was obliged to get on his hind legs and dance Tatther Jack Walsh along with the rest A good deal of the people got inside and shut the doors the way the hairy fellow wouldn t pin them but Tom kept playing and the outsiders kept dancing and shouting and the wolf kept dancing and roaring with the pain his legs were giving him and all the time he had his eyes on Redhead who was shut out along with the rest Wherever Redhead went the wolf followed and kept one eye on him and the other on Tom to see if he would give him leave to eat him But Tom shook his head and never stopped the tune and Redhead never stopped dancing and bawling and the wolf dancing and roaring one leg up and the other down and he ready to drop out of his standing from fair tiresomeness Illustration When the princess seen that there was no fear of any one being kilt she was so divarted by the stew that Redhead was in that she gave another great laugh and well become Tom out he cried King of Dublin I have two halves of your daughter Oh halves or alls says the king put away that divil of a wolf and we ll see about it So Tom put his flute in his pocket and says he to the baste that was sittin on his currabingo ready to faint Walk off to your mountain my fine fellow and live like a respectable baste and if ever I find you within seven miles of any town I ll He said no more but spit in his fist and gave a flourish of his club It was all the poor divil of a wolf wanted he put his tail between his legs and took to his pumps without looking at man or mortal and neither sun moon nor stars ever saw him in sight of Dublin again At dinner every one laughed but the foxy fellow and sure enough he was laying out how he d settle poor Tom next day Well to be sure says he King of Dublin you are in luck There s the Danes moidhering us to no end Deuce run to Lusk wid em and if any one can save us from em it is this gentleman with the goat skin There is a flail hangin on the collar beam in hell and neither Dane nor devil can stand before it So says Tom to the king will you let me have the other half of the princess if I bring you the flail No no says the princess I d rather never be your wife than see you in that danger But Redhead whispered and nudged Tom about how shabby it would look to reneague the adventure So he asked which way he was to go and Redhead directed him Well he travelled and travelled till he came in sight of the walls of hell and bedad before he knocked at the gates he rubbed himself over with the greenish ointment When he knocked a hundred little imps popped their heads out through the bars and axed him what he wanted I want to speak to the big divil of all says Tom open the gate It wasn t long till the gate was thrune open and the Ould Boy received Tom with bows and scrapes and axed his business My business isn t much says Tom I only came for the loan of that flail that I see hanging on the collar beam for the king of Dublin to give a thrashing to the Danes Well says the other the Danes is much better customers to me but since you walked so far I won t refuse Hand that flail says he to a young imp and he winked the far off eye at the same time So while some were barring the gates the young devil climbed up and took down the flail that had the hand staff and booltheen both made out of red hot iron The little vagabond was grinning to think how it would burn the hands o Tom but the dickens a burn it made on him no more nor if it was a good oak sapling Illustration Thankee says Tom Now would you open the gate for a body and I ll give you no more trouble Oh tramp says Ould Nick is that the way It is easier getting inside them gates than getting out again Take that tool from him and give him a dose of the oil of stirrup So one fellow put out his claws to seize on the flail but Tom give him such a welt of it on the side of the head that he broke off one of his horns and made him roar like a devil as he was Well they rushed at Tom but he gave them little and big such a thrashing as they didn t forget for a while At last says the ould thief of all rubbing his elbow Let the fool out and woe to whoever lets him in again great or small So out marched Tom and away with him without minding the shouting and cursing they kept up at him from the tops of the walls and when he got home to the big bawn of the palace there never was such running and racing as to see himself and the flail When he had his story told he laid down the flail on the stone steps and bid no one for their lives to touch it If the king and queen and princess made much of him before they made ten times more of him now but Redhead the mean scruff hound stole over and thought to catch hold of the flail to make an end of him His fingers hardly touched it when he let a roar out of him as if heaven and earth were coming together and kept flinging his arms about and dancing that it was pitiful to look at him Tom ran at him as soon as he could rise caught his hands in his own two and rubbed them this way and that and the burning pain left them before you could reckon one Well the poor fellow between the pain that was only just gone and the comfort he was in had the comicalest face that you ever see it was such a mixtherum gatherum of laughing and crying Everybody burst out a laughing the princess could not stop no more than the rest and then says Tom Now ma am if there were fifty halves of you I hope you ll give me them all Well the princess looked at her father and by my word she came over to Tom and put her two delicate hands into his two rough ones and I wish it was myself was in his shoes that day Tom would not bring the flail into the palace You may be sure no other body went near it and when the early risers were passing next morning they found two long clefts in the stone where it was after burning itself an opening downwards nobody could tell how far But a messenger came in at noon and said that the Danes were so frightened when they heard of the flail coming into Dublin that they got into their ships and sailed away Well I suppose before they were married Tom got some man like Pat Mara of Tomenine to learn him the principles of politeness fluxions gunnery and fortification decimal fractions practice and the rule of three direct the way he d be able to keep up a conversation with the royal family Whether he ever lost his time learning them sciences I m not sure but it s as sure as fate that his mother never more saw any want till the end of her days Illustration MAN OR WOMAN BOY OR GIRL THAT READS WHAT FOLLOWS three TIMES SHALL FALL ASLEEP AN HUNDRED YEARS JOHN D BATTEN DREW THIS AUG twenty nineTH eighteen ninety one GOOD NIGHT Notes and References It may be as well to give the reader some account of the enormous extent of the Celtic folk tales in existence I reckon these to extend to two thousand though only about two hundred fifty are in print The former number exceeds that known in France Italy Germany and Russia where collection has been most active and is only exceeded by the MS collection of Finnish folk tales at Helsingfors said to exceed twelve thousand As will be seen this superiority of the Celts is due to the phenomenal and patriotic activity of one man the late J F Campbell of Islay whose Popular Tales and MS collections partly described by mister Alfred Nutt in Folk Lore i three hundred sixty nine eighty three contain references to no less than twelve eighty one tales many of them of course variants and scraps Celtic folk tales while more numerous are also the oldest of the tales of modern European races some of them e g Connla in the present selection occurring in the oldest Irish vellums They include one fairy tales properly so called i e tales or anecdotes about fairies hobgoblins et cetera told as natural occurrences two hero tales stories of adventure told of national or mythical heroes three folk tales proper describing marvellous adventures of otherwise unknown heroes in which there is a defined plot and supernatural characters speaking animals giants dwarfs et cetera and finally four drolls comic anecdotes of feats of stupidity or cunning The collection of Celtic folk tales began in IRELAND as early as eighteen twenty five with T Crofton Croker s Fairy Legends and Traditions of the South of Ireland This contained some thirty eight anecdotes of the first class mentioned above anecdotes showing the belief of the Irish peasantry in the existence of fairies gnomes goblins and the like The Grimms did Croker the honour of translating part of his book under the title of Irische Elfenmarchen Among the novelists and tale writers of the schools of Miss Edgeworth and Lever folk tales were occasionally utilised as by Carleton in his Traits and Stories by S Lover in his Legends and Stories and by G Griffin in his Tales of a Jury Room These all tell their tales in the manner of the stage Irishman Chapbooks Royal Fairy Tales and Hibernian Tales also contained genuine folk tales and attracted Thackeray s attention in his Irish Sketch Book The Irish Grimm however was Patrick Kennedy a Dublin bookseller who believed in fairies and in five years eighteen sixty six seventy one printed about one hundred folk and hero tales and drolls classes two three and four above in his Legendary Fictions of the Irish Celts eighteen sixty six Fireside Stories of Ireland eighteen seventy and Bardic Stories of Ireland eighteen seventy one all three are now unfortunately out of print He tells his stories neatly and with spirit and retains much that is volkstumlich in his diction He derived his materials from the English speaking peasantry of County Wexford who changed from Gaelic to English while story telling was in full vigour and therefore carried over the stories with the change of language Lady Wilde has told many folk tales very effectively in her Ancient Legends of Ireland eighteen eighty seven More recently two collectors have published stories gathered from peasants of the West and North who can only speak Gaelic These are an American gentleman named Curtin Myths and Folk Tales of Ireland eighteen ninety and doctor Douglas Hyde who has published in Beside the Fire eighteen ninety one spirited English versions of some of the stories he had published in the original Irish in his Leabhar Sgeulaigheachta Dublin eighteen eighty nine Miss Maclintock has a large MS collection part of which has appeared in various periodicals and Messrs Larminie and D Fitzgerald are known to have much story material in their possession But beside these more modern collections there exist in old and middle Irish a large number of hero tales class two which formed the staple of the old ollamhs or bards Of these tales of cattle liftings elopements battles voyages courtships caves lakes feasts sieges and eruptions a bard of even the fourth class had to know seven fifties presumably one for each day of the year Sir William Temple knew of a north country gentleman of Ireland who was sent to sleep every evening with a fresh tale from his bard The Book of Leinster an Irish vellum of the twelfth century contains a list of one hundred eighty nine of these hero tales many of which are extant to this day E O Curry gives the list in the Appendix to his MS Materials of Irish History Another list of about seventy is given in the preface to the third volume of the Ossianic Society s publications doctor Joyce published a few of the more celebrated of these in Old Celtic Romances others appeared in Atlantis see notes on Deirdre others in Kennedy s Bardic Stories mentioned above Turning to SCOTLAND we must put aside Chambers s Popular Rhymes of Scotland eighteen forty two which contains for the most part folk tales common with those of England rather than those peculiar to the Gaelic speaking Scots The first name here in time as in importance is that of J F Campbell of Islay His four volumes Popular Tales of the West Highlands Edinburgh eighteen sixty two recently republished by the Islay Association contain some one hundred twenty folk and hero tales told with strict adherence to the language of the narrators which is given with a literal a rather too literal English version This careful accuracy has given an un English air to his versions and has prevented them attaining their due popularity What Campbell has published represents only a tithe of what he collected At the end of the fourth volume he gives a list of seven hundred ninety one tales c collected by him or his assistants in the two years eighteen fifty nine sixty one and in his MS collections at Edinburgh are two other lists containing four hundred more tales Only a portion of these are in the Advocates Library the rest if extant must be in private hands though they are distinctly of national importance and interest Campbell s influence has been effective of recent years in Scotland The Celtic Magazine vols xii and xiii while under the editorship of mister MacBain contained several folk and hero tales in Gaelic and so did the Scottish Celtic Review These were from the collections of Messrs Campbell of Tiree Carmichael and K Macleod Recently Lord Archibald Campbell has shown laudable interest in the preservation of Gaelic folk and hero tales Under his auspices a whole series of handsome volumes under the general title of Waifs and Strays of Celtic Tradition has been recently published four volumes having already appeared each accompanied by notes by mister Alfred Nutt which form the most important aid to the study of Celtic Folk Tales since Campbell himself Those to the second volume in particular Tales collected by reverend D MacInnes fill one hundred pages with condensed information on all aspects of the subject dealt with in the light of the most recent research on the European folk tales as well as on Celtic literature Thanks to mister Nutt Scotland is just now to the fore in the collection and study of the British Folk Tale WALES makes a poor show beside Ireland and Scotland Sikes s British Goblins and the tales collected by Prof Rhys in Y Cymmrodor vols ii vi are mainly of our first class fairy anecdotes Borrow in his Wild Wales refers to a collection of fables in a journal called The Greal while the Cambrian Quarterly Magazine for eighteen thirty and eighteen thirty one contained a few fairy anecdotes including a curious version of the Brewery of Eggshells from the Welsh In the older literature the Iolo MSS published by the Welsh MSS Society has a few fables and apologues and the charming Mabinogion translated by Lady Guest has tales that can trace back to the twelfth century and are on the border line between folk tales and hero tales CORNWALL and MAN are even worse off than Wales Hunt s Popular Romances of the West of England has nothing distinctively Celtic and it is only by a chance Lhuyd chose a folk tale as his specimen of Cornish in his Archaeologia Britannica seventeen oh nine see Tale of Ivan The Manx folk tales published including the most recent by mister Moore in his Folk Lore of the Isle of Man eighteen ninety one are mainly fairy anecdotes and legends From this survey of the field of Celtic folk tales it is clear that Ireland and Scotland provide the lion s share The interesting thing to notice is the remarkable similarity of Scotch and Irish folk tales The continuity of language and culture between these two divisions of Gaeldom has clearly brought about this identity of their folk tales As will be seen from the following notes the tales found in Scotland can almost invariably be paralleled by those found in Ireland and vice versa The result is a striking confirmation of the general truth that the folk lores of different countries resemble one another in proportion to their contiguity and to the continuity of language and culture between them Another point of interest in these Celtic folk tales is the light they throw upon the relation of hero tales and folk tales classes two and three above Tales told of Finn or Cuchulainn and therefore coming under the definition of hero tales are found elsewhere told of anonymous or unknown heroes The question is were the folk tales the earliest and were they localised and applied to the heroes or were they heroic sagas generalised and applied to an unknown Greek tis All the evidence in my opinion inclines to the former view which as applied to Celtic folk tales is of very great literary importance for it is becoming more and more recognised thanks chiefly to the admirable work of mister Alfred Nutt in his Studies on the Holy Grail that the outburst of European Romance in the twelfth century was due in large measure to an infusion of Celtic hero tales into the literature of the Romance speaking nations Now the remarkable thing is how these hero tales have lingered on in oral tradition even to the present day See a marked case in Deirdre We may therefore hope to see considerable light thrown on the most characteristic spiritual product of the Middle Ages the literature of Romance and the spirit of chivalry from the Celtic folk tales of the present day mister Alfred Nutt has already shown this to be true of a special section of Romance literature that connected with the Holy Grail and it seems probable that further study will extend the field of application of this new method of research The Celtic folk tale again has interest in retaining many traits of primitive conditions among the early inhabitants of these isles which are preserved by no other record Take for instance the calm assumption of polygamy in Gold tree and Silver tree That represents a state of feeling that is decidedly pre Christian The belief in an eternal soul Life Index recently monographed by mister Frazer in his Golden Bough also finds expression in a couple of the tales see notes on Sea Maiden and Fair Brown and Trembling and so with many other primitive ideas Care however has to be taken in using folk tales as evidence for primitive practice among the nations where they are found For the tales may have come from another race that is for example probably the case with Gold tree and Silver tree see Notes Celtic tales are of peculiar interest in this connection as they afford one of the best fields for studying the problem of diffusion the most pressing of the problems of the folk tales just at present at least in my opinion The Celts are at the further most end of Europe Tales that travelled to them could go no further and must therefore be the last links in the chain For all these reasons then Celtic folk tales are of high scientific interest to the folk lorist while they yield to none in imaginative and literary qualities In any other country of Europe some national means of recording them would have long ago been adopted M Luzel e g was commissioned by the French Minister of Public Instruction to collect and report on the Breton folk tales England here as elsewhere without any organized means of scientific research in the historical and philological sciences has to depend on the enthusiasm of a few private individuals for work of national importance Every Celt of these islands or in the Gaeldom beyond the sea and every Celt lover among the English speaking nations should regard it as one of the duties of the race to put its traditions on record in the few years that now remain before they will cease for ever to be living in the hearts and memories of the humbler members of the race In the following Notes I have done as in my English Fairy Tales and given first the sources whence I drew the tales then parallels at length for the British Isles with bibliographical references for parallels abroad and finally remarks where the tales seemed to need them In these I have not wearied or worried the reader with conventional tall talk about the Celtic genius and its manifestations in the folk tale on that topic one can only repeat Matthew Arnold when at his best in his Celtic Literature Nor have I attempted to deal with the more general aspects of the study of the Celtic folk tale For these I must refer to mister Nutt s series of papers in The Celtic Magazine vol xii or still better to the masterly introductions he is contributing to the series of Waifs and Strays of Celtic Tradition and to doctor Hyde s Beside the Fireside In my remarks I have mainly confined myself to discussing the origin and diffusion of the various tales so far as anything definite could be learnt or conjectured on that subject Before proceeding to the Notes I may put in as the lawyers say a few summaries of the results reached in them Of the twenty six tales twelve i ii v viii ix x xi xv xvi xvii xix xxiv have Gaelic originals three vii xiii xxv are from the Welsh one xxii from the now extinct Cornish one an adaptation of an English poem founded on a Welsh tradition xxi Gellert and the remaining nine are what may be termed Anglo Irish Regarding their diffusion among the Celts twelve are both Irish and Scotch iv v vi ix x xiv xvii xix xx xxiv one xxv is common to Irish and Welsh and one xxii to Irish and Cornish seven are found only among the Celts in Ireland i iii xii xviii xxii xxvi two viii xi among the Scotch and three vii xiii xxi among the Welsh Finally so far as we can ascertain their origin four v xvi xxi xxii are from the East five vi x xiv xx xxv are European drolls three of the romantic tales seem to have been imported vii ix xix while three others are possibly Celtic exportations to the Continent xv xvii xxiv though the last may have previously come thence the remaining eleven are as far as known original to Celtic lands Somewhat the same result would come out I believe as the analysis of any representative collection of folk tales of any European district I CONNLA AND THE FAIRY MAIDEN Source From the old Irish Echtra Condla chaim maic Cuind Chetchathaig of the Leabhar na h Uidhre Book of the Dun Cow which must have been written before eleven oh six when its scribe Maelmori Servant of Mary was murdered The original is given by Windisch in his Irish Grammar p one hundred twenty also in the Trans Kilkenny Archaeol Soc for eighteen seventy four A fragment occurs in a Rawlinson MS described by doctor W Stokes Tripartite Life p xxxvi I have used the translation of Prof Zimmer in his Keltische Beitrage ii Zeits f deutsches Altertum Bd xxxiii two hundred sixty two four doctor Joyce has a somewhat florid version in his Old Celtic Romances from which I have borrowed a touch or two I have neither extenuated nor added aught but the last sentence of the Fairy Maiden s last speech Part of the original is in metrical form so that the whole is of the cante fable species which I believe to be the original form of the folk tale Cf Eng Fairy Tales notes p two hundred forty and infra p two hundred fifty seven Parallels Prof Zimmer s paper contains three other accounts of the terra repromissionis in the Irish sagas one of them being the similar adventure of Cormac the nephew of Connla or Condla Ruad as he should be called The fairy apple of gold occurs in Cormac Mac Art s visit to the Brug of Manannan Nutt s Holy Grail one hundred ninety three Remarks Conn the hundred fighter had the head kingship of Ireland one hundred twenty three one hundred fifty seven A D according to the Annals of the Four Masters i one hundred five On the day of his birth the five great roads from Tara to all parts of Ireland were completed one of them from Dublin is still used Connaught is said to have been named after him but this is scarcely consonant with Joyce s identification with Ptolemy s Nagnatai Irish Local Names i seventy five But there can be little doubt of Conn s existence as a powerful ruler in Ireland in the second century The historic existence of Connla seems also to be authenticated by the reference to him as Conly the eldest son of Conn in the Annals of Clonmacnoise As Conn was succeeded by his third son Art Enear Connla was either slain or disappeared during his father s lifetime Under these circumstances it is not unlikely that our legend grew up within the century after Conn i e during the latter half of the second century As regards the present form of it Prof Zimmer l c two hundred sixty one two places it in the seventh century It has clearly been touched up by a Christian hand who introduced the reference to the day of judgment and to the waning power of the Druids But nothing turns upon this interpolation so that it is likely that even the present form of the legend is pre Christian i e for Ireland pre Patrician before the fifth century The tale of Connla is thus the earliest fairy tale of modern Europe Besides this interest it contains an early account of one of the most characteristic Celtic conceptions that of the earthly Paradise the Isle of Youth Tir na n Og This has impressed itself on the European imagination in the Arthuriad it is represented by the Vale of Avalon and as represented in the various Celtic visions of the future life it forms one of the main sources of Dante s Divina Commedia It is possible too I think that the Homeric Hesperides and the Fortunate Isles of the ancients had a Celtic origin as is well known the early place names of Europe are predominantly Celtic I have found I believe a reference to the conception in one of the earliest passages in the classics dealing with the Druids Lucan in his Pharsalia i four hundred fifty eight addresses them in these high terms of reverence Et vos barbaricos ritus moremque sinistrum Sacrorum Druidae positis repetistis ab armis Solis nosse Deos et coeli numera vobis Aut solis nescire datum nemora alta remotis Incolitis lucis Vobis auctoribus umbrae Non tacitas Erebi sedes Ditisque profundi Pallida regna petunt regit idem spiritus artus Orbe alio longae canitis si cognita vitae Mors media est The passage certainly seems to me to imply a different conception from the ordinary classical views of the life after death the dark and dismal plains of Erebus peopled with ghosts and the passage I have italicised would chime in well with the conception of a continuance of youth idem spiritus in Tir na n Og orbe alio One of the most pathetic beautiful and typical scenes in Irish legend is the return of Ossian from Tir na n Og and his interview with saint Patrick The old faith and the new the old order of things and that which replaced it meet in two of the most characteristic products of the Irish imagination for the Patrick of legend is as much a legendary figure as Oisin himself Ossian had gone away to Tir na n Og with the fairy Niamh under very much of the same circumstances as Condla Ruad time flies in the land of eternal youth and when Ossian returns after a year as he thinks more than three centuries had passed and saint Patrick had just succeeded in introducing the new faith The contrast of Past and Present has never been more vividly or beautifully represented II GULEESH Source From doctor Douglas Hyde s Beside the Fire one hundred four twenty eight where it is a translation from the same author s Leabhar Sgeulaighteachta doctor Hyde got it from one Shamus O Hart a game keeper of French park One is curious to know how far the very beautiful landscapes in the story are due to doctor Hyde who confesses to have only taken notes I have omitted a journey to Rome paralleled as mister Nutt has pointed out by the similar one of Michael Scott Waifs and Strays i forty six and not bearing on the main lines of the story I have also dropped a part of Guleesh s name in the original he is Guleesh na guss dhu Guleesh of the black feet because he never washed them nothing turns on this in the present form of the story but one cannot but suspect it was of importance in the original form Parallels doctor Hyde refers to two short stories Midnight Ride to Rome and Stolen Bride in Lady Wilde s Ancient Legends But the closest parallel is given by Miss Maclintock s Donegal tale of Jamie Freel and the Young Lady reprinted in mister Yeats Irish Folk and Fairy Tales fifty two nine In the Hibernian Tales Mann o Malaghan and the Fairies as reported by Thackeray in the Irish Sketch Book c xvi begins like Guleesh III FIELD OF BOLIAUNS Source T Crofton Croker s Fairy Legends of the South of Ireland ed Wright pp one hundred thirty five nine In the original the gnome is a Cluricaune but as a friend of mister Batten s has recently heard the tale told of a Lepracaun I have adopted the better known title Remarks Lepracaun is from the Irish leith bhrogan the one shoemaker cf brogue according to doctor Hyde He is generally seen and to this day too working at a single shoe cf Croker s story Little Shoe l c pp one hundred forty two four According to a writer in the Revue Celtique i two hundred fifty six the true etymology is luchor pan little man doctor Joyce also gives the same etymology in Irish Names and Places i one hundred eighty three where he mentions several places named after them IV HORNED WOMEN Source Lady Wilde s Ancient Legends the first story Parallels A similar version was given by mister D Fitzgerald in the Revue Celtique iv one hundred eighty one but without the significant and impressive horns He refers to Cornhill for February eighteen seventy seven and to Campbell s Sauntraigh No xxii Pop Tales ii fifty two four in which a woman of peace a fairy borrows a woman s kettle and returns it with flesh in it but at last the woman refuses and is persecuted by the fairy I fail to see much analogy A much closer one is in Campbell ii p sixty three where fairies are got rid of by shouting Dunveilg is on fire The familiar lady bird lady bird fly away home your house is on fire and your children at home will occur to English minds Another version in Kennedy s Legendary Fictions p one hundred sixty four Black Stairs on Fire Remarks Slievenamon is a famous fairy palace in Tipperary according to doctor Joyce l c i one hundred seventy eight It was the hill on which Finn stood when he gave himself as the prize to the Irish maiden who should run up it quickest Grainne won him with dire consequences as all the world knows or ought to know Kennedy Legend Fict two hundred twenty two How Fion selected a Wife V CONALL YELLOWCLAW Source Campbell Pop Tales of West Highlands No v pp one hundred five eight Conall Cra Bhuidhe I have softened the third episode which is somewhat too ghastly in the original I have translated Cra Bhuide Yellowclaw on the strength of Campbell s etymology l c p one hundred fifty eight Parallels Campbell s vi and vii are two variants showing how wide spread the story is in Gaelic Scotland It occurs in Ireland where it has been printed in the chapbook Hibernian Tales as the Black Thief and the Knight of the Glen the Black Thief being Conall and the knight corresponding to the King of Lochlan it is given in mister Lang s Red Fairy Book Here it attracted the notice of Thackeray who gives a good abstract of it in his Irish Sketch Book ch xvi He thinks it worthy of the Arabian Nights as wild and odd as an Eastern tale That fantastic way of bearing testimony to the previous tale by producing an old woman who says the tale is not only true but who was the very old woman who lived in the giant s castle is almost why almost mister Thackeray a stroke of genius The incident of the giant s breath occurs in the story of Koisha Kayn MacInnes s Tales p two hundred forty one as well as the Polyphemus one ibid two hundred sixty five One eyed giants are frequent in Celtic folk tales e g in The Pursuit of Diarmaid and in the Mabinogi of Owen Remarks Thackeray s reference to the Arabian Nights is especially apt as the tale of Conall is a framework story like The ten oh one Nights the three stories told by Conall being framed as it were in a fourth which is nominally the real story This method employed by the Indian story tellers and from them adopted by Boccaccio and thence into all European literatures Chaucer Queen Margaret c is generally thought to be peculiar to the East and to be ultimately derived from the Jatakas or Birth Stories of the Buddha who tells his adventures in former incarnations Here we find it in Celtdom and it occurs also in The Story teller at Fault in this collection and the story of Koisha Kayn in MacInnes s Argyllshire Tales a variant of which collected but not published by Campbell has no less than nineteen tales enclosed in a framework The question is whether the method was adopted independently in Ireland or was due to foreign influences Confining ourselves to Conall Yellowclaw it seems not unlikely that the whole story is an importation For the second episode is clearly the story of Polyphemus from the Odyssey which was known in Ireland perhaps as early as the tenth century see Prof K Meyer s edition of Merugud Uilix maic Leirtis Pref p xii It also crept into the voyages of Sindbad in the Arabian Nights And as told in the Highlands it bears comparison even with the Homeric version As mister Nutt remarks Celt Mag xii the address of the giant to the buck is as effective as that of Polyphemus to his ram The narrator James Wilson was a blind man who would naturally feel the pathos of the address it comes from the heart of the narrator says Campbell l c one hundred forty eight it is the ornament which his mind hangs on the frame of the story VI HUDDEN AND DUDDEN Source From oral tradition by the late D W Logie taken down by mister Alfred Nutt Parallels Lover has a tale Little Fairly obviously derived from this folk tale and there is another very similar Darby Darly Another version of our tale is given under the title Donald and his Neighbours in the chapbook Hibernian Tales whence it was reprinted by Thackeray in his Irish Sketch Book c xvi This has the incident of the accidental matricide on which see Prof R Kohler on Gonzenbach Sicil Marchen ii two hundred twenty four No less than four tales of Campbell are of this type Pop Tales ii two hundred eighteen thirty one M Cosquin in his Contes populaires de Lorraine the storehouse of storiology has elaborate excursuses in this class of tales attached to his Nos x and xx mister Clouston discusses it also in his Pop Tales ii two hundred twenty nine eighty eight Both these writers are inclined to trace the chief incidents to India It is to be observed that one of the earliest popular drolls in Europe Unibos a Latin poem of the eleventh and perhaps the tenth century has the main outlines of the story the fraudulent sale of worthless objects and the escape from the sack trick The same story occurs in Straparola the European earliest collection of folk tales in the sixteenth century On the other hand the gold sticking to the scales is familiar to us in Ali Baba Cf Cosquin l c i two hundred twenty five six two hundred twenty nine Remarks It is indeed curious to find as M Cosquin points out a cunning fellow tied in a sack getting out by crying I won t marry the princess in countries so far apart as Ireland Sicily Gonzenbach No seventy one Afghanistan Thorburn Bannu p one hundred eighty four and Jamaica Folk Lore Record iii fifty three It is indeed impossible to think these are disconnected and for drolls of this kind a good case has been made out for the borrowing hypotheses by M Cosquin and mister Clouston Who borrowed from whom is another and more difficult question which has to be judged on its merits in each individual case This is a type of Celtic folk tales which are European in spread have analogies with the East and can only be said to be Celtic by adoption and by colouring They form a distinct section of the tales told by the Celts and must be represented in any characteristic selection Other examples are xi xv xx and perhaps xxii VII SHEPHERD OF MYDDVAI Source Preface to the edition of The Physicians of Myddvai their prescription book from the Red Book of Hergest published by the Welsh MS Society in eighteen sixty one The legend is not given in the Red Book but from oral tradition by mister W Rees p xxi As this is the first of the Welsh tales in this book it may be as well to give the reader such guidance as I can afford him on the intricacies of Welsh pronunciation especially with regard to the mysterious w s and y s of Welsh orthography For w substitute double o as in fool and for y the short u in b u t and as near approach to Cymric speech will be reached as is possible for the outlander It may be added that double d equals th and double l is something like Fl as Shakespeare knew in calling his Welsh soldier Fluellen Llewelyn Thus Meddygon Myddvai would be Anglice Methugon Muthvai Parallels Other versions of the legend of the Van Pool are given in Cambro Briton ii three hundred fifteen W Sikes British Goblins p forty mister E Sidney Hartland has discussed these and others in a set of papers contributed to the first volume of The Archaeological Review now incorporated into Folk Lore the substance of which is now given in his Science of Fairy Tales two hundred seventy four three hundred thirty two See also the references given in Revue Celtique iv one hundred eighty seven and two hundred sixty eight mister Hartland gives there an ecumenical collection of parallels to the several incidents that go to make up our story one The bride capture of the Swan Maiden two the recognition of the bride three the taboo against causeless blows four doomed to be broken and five disappearance of the Swan Maiden with six her return as Guardian Spirit to her descendants In each case mister Hartland gives what he considers to be the most primitive form of the incident With reference to our present tale he comes to the conclusion if I understand him aright that the lake maiden was once regarded as a local divinity The physicians of Myddvai were historic personages renowned for their medical skill for some six centuries till the race died out with John Jones fl seventeen forty three To explain their skill and uncanny knowledge of herbs the folk traced them to a supernatural ancestress who taught them their craft in a place still called Pant y Meddygon Doctors Dingle Their medical knowledge did not require any such remarkable origin as mister Hartland has shown in a paper On Welsh Folk Medicine contributed to Y Cymmrodor vol xii On the other hand the Swan Maiden type of story is wide spread through the Old World mister Morris s Land East of the Moon and West of the Sun in The Earthly Paradise is taken from the Norse version Parallels are accumulated by the Grimms ii four hundred thirty two Kohler on Gonzenbach ii twenty or Blade one hundred forty nine Stokes s Indian Fairy Tales two hundred forty three two hundred seventy six and Messrs Jones and Koopf Magyar Folk Tales three hundred sixty two five It remains to be proved that one of these versions did not travel to Wales and become there localised We shall see other instances of such localisation or specialisation of general legends VIII THE SPRIGHTLY TAILOR Source Notes and Queries for December twenty one eighteen sixty one to which it was communicated by Cuthbert Bede the author of Verdant Green who collected it in Cantyre Parallels Miss Dempster gives the same story in her Sutherland Collection No vii referred to by Campbell in his Gaelic list at end of vol iv missus John Faed I am informed by a friend knows the Gaelic version as told by her nurse in her youth Chambers s Strange Visitor Pop Rhymes of Scotland sixty four of which I gave an Anglicised version in my English Fairy Tales No xxxii is clearly a variant Remarks The Macdonald of Saddell Castle was a very great man indeed Once when dining with the Lord Lieutenant an apology was made to him for placing him so far away from the head of the table Where the Macdonald sits was the proud response there is the head of the table IX DEIRDRE Source Celtic Magazine xiii p sixty nine seq I have abridged somewhat made the sons of Fergus all faithful instead of two traitors and omitted an incident in the house of the wild men called here strangers The original Gaelic was given in the Transactions of the Inverness Gaelic Society for eighteen eighty seven p two hundred forty one seq by mister Carmichael I have inserted Deirdre s Lament from the Book of Leinster Parallels This is one of the three most sorrowful Tales of Erin the other two Children of Lir and Children of Tureen are given in doctor Joyce s Old Celtic Romances and is a specimen of the old heroic sagas of elopement a list of which is given in the Book of Leinster The outcast child is a frequent episode in folk and hero tales an instance occurs in my English Fairy Tales No xxxv and Prof Kohler gives many others in Archiv f Slav Philologie i two hundred eighty eight mister Nutt adds tenth century Celtic parallels in Folk Lore vol ii The wooing of hero by heroine is a characteristic Celtic touch See Connla here and other examples given by mister Nutt in his notes to MacInnes s Tales The trees growing from the lovers graves occurs in the English ballad of Lord Lovel and has been studied in Melusine Remarks The Story of Deirdre is a remarkable instance of the tenacity of oral tradition among the Celts It has been preserved in no less than five versions or six including Macpherson s Darthula ranging from the twelfth to the nineteenth century The earliest is in the twelfth century Book of Leinster to be dated about eleven forty edited in facsimile under the auspices of the Royal Irish Academy i one hundred forty seven seq Then comes a fifteenth century version edited and translated by doctor Stokes in Windisch s Irische Texte II ii one hundred nine seq Death of the Sons of Uisnech Keating in his History of Ireland gave another version in the seventeenth century The Dublin Gaelic Society published an eighteenth century version in their Transactions for eighteen oh eight And lastly we have the version before us collected only a few years ago yet agreeing in all essential details with the version of the Book of Leinster Such a record is unique in the history of oral tradition outside Ireland where however it is quite a customary experience in the study of the Finn saga It is now recognised that Macpherson had or could have had ample material for his rechauffe of the Finn or Fingal saga His Darthula is a similar cobbling of our present story I leave to Celtic specialists the task of settling the exact relations of these various texts I content myself with pointing out the fact that in these latter days of a seemingly prosaic century in these British Isles there has been collected from the lips of the folk a heroic story like this of Deirdre full of romantic incidents told with tender feeling and considerable literary skill No other country in Europe except perhaps Russia could provide a parallel to this living on of Romance among the common folk Surely it is a bounden duty of those who are in a position to put on record any such utterances of the folk imagination of the Celts before it is too late X MUNACHAR AND MANACHAR Source I have combined the Irish version given by doctor Hyde in his Leabhar Sgeul and translated by him from mister Yeats s

to this day by Bengali women at the end of each folk tale they recite L B Day Folk Tales of Bengal Pref Remarks Two ingenious suggestions have been made as to the origin of this curious jingle both connecting it with religious ceremonies one Something very similar occurs in Chaldaic at the end of the Jewish Hagada or domestic ritual for the Passover night It has however been shown that this does not occur in early MSS or editions and was only added at the end to amuse the children after the service and was therefore only a translation or adaptation of a current German form of the jingle two M Basset in the Revue des Traditions populaires eighteen ninety t v p five hundred forty nine has suggested that it is a survival of the old Greek custom at the sacrifice of the Bouphonia for the priest to contend that he had not slain the sacred beast the axe declares that the handle did it the handle transfers the guilt further and so on This is ingenious but fails to give any reasonable account of the diffusion of the jingle in countries which have had no historic connection with classical Greece XI GOLD TREE AND SILVER TREE one Source Celtic Magazine xiii two hundred thirteen eight Gaelic and

one No other version is known in the British Isles Footnote one Since the first issue mister Nutt has made a remarkable discovery with reference to this tale which connects it with Marie de France s Lai d Eliduc c twelve hundred and renders it probable that the tale is originally Celtic mister Nutt thinks that the German version may be derived from England Remarks It is unlikely I should say impossible that this tale with the incident of the dormant heroine should have arisen independently in the Highlands it is most likely an importation from abroad Yet in it occurs a most primitive incident the bigamous household of the hero this is glossed over in mister Macleod s other variant On the survival method of investigation this would possibly be used as evidence for polygamy in the Highlands Yet if as is probable the story came from abroad this trait may have come with it and only implies polygamy in the original home of the tale XII KING O TOOLE AND HIS GOOSE Source S Lover s

Curtin Myths and Folk Lore of Ireland p one hundred fourteen seq I have shortened the earlier part of the tale and introduced into the latter a few touches from Campbell s story of Fionn s Enchantment in Revue Celtique t i one hundred ninety three seq Parallels The early part is similar to the beginning of The Sea Maiden No xvii which see The latter part is practically the same as the story of Fionn s Enchantment just referred to It also occurs in MacInnes s Tales No iii The King of Albainn see mister Nutt s notes four hundred fifty four The head crowned spikes are Celtic cf mister Nutt s notes MacInnes s Tales four hundred fifty three Remarks Here again we meet the question whether the folk tale precedes the hero tale about Finn or was derived from it and again the probability seems that our story has the priority as a folk tale and was afterwards applied to the national hero Finn This is confirmed by the fact that a thirteenth century French romance Conte du Graal has much the same incidents and was probably derived from a similar folk tale of the Celts Indeed mister Nutt is inclined to think that the original form of our story which contains a mysterious healing vessel is the germ out of which the legend of the Holy Grail was evolved see his Studies in the Holy Grail p two hundred two seq XVI THE STORY TELLER AT FAULT Source Griffin s Tales from a Jury Room combined with Campbell No xvii c The Slim Swarthy Champion Parallels Campbell gives another variant l c i three hundred eighteen doctor Hyde has an Irish version of Campbell s tale written down in seventeen sixty two from which he gives the incident of the air ladder which I have had to euphemise in my version in his Beside the Fireside p one hundred ninety one and other passages in his Preface The most remarkable parallel to this incident however is afforded by the feats of Indian jugglers reported briefly by Marco Polo and illustrated with his usual wealth of learning by the late Sir Henry Yule in his edition vol i p three hundred eight seq The accompanying illustration reduced from Yule will tell its own tale it is taken from the Dutch account of the travels of an English sailor E Melton Zeldzaame Reizen seventeen oh two p four hundred sixty eight It tells the tale in five acts all included in one sketch Another instance quoted by Yule is still more parallel so to speak The twenty third trick performed by some conjurors before the Emperor Jahangueir Memoirs p one hundred two is thus described They produced a chain of fifty cubits in length and in my presence threw one end of it toward the sky where it remained as if fastened to something in the air A dog was then brought forward and being placed at the lower end of the chain immediately ran up and reaching the other end immediately disappeared in the air In the same manner a hog a panther a lion and a tiger were successively sent up the chain It has been suggested that the conjurors hypnotise the spectators and make them believe they see these things This is practically the suggestion of a wise Mohammedan who is quoted by Yule as saying Wallah tis my opinion there has been neither going up nor coming down tis all hocus pocus hocus pocus being presumably the Mohammedan term for hypnotism Illustration Remarks doctor Hyde l c Pref xxix thinks our tale cannot be older than thirteen sixty two because of a reference to one O Connor Sligo which occurs in all its variants it is however omitted in our somewhat abridged version mister Nutt ap Campbell The Fians Introd xix thinks that this does not prevent a still earlier version having existed I should have thought that the existence of so distinctly Eastern a trick in the tale and the fact that it is a framework story another Eastern characteristic would imply that it is a rather late importation with local allusions supperadded cf notes on Conall Yellowclaw No v The passages in verse from pp one hundred forty nine one hundred fifty three and the description of the Beggarman pp one hundred forty nine one hundred fifty four are instances of a curious characteristic of Gaelic folk tales called runs Collections of Conventional epithets are used over and over again to describe the same incident the beaching of a boat sea faring travelling and the like are inserted in different tales These runs are often similar in both the Irish and the Scotch form of the same tale or of the same incident The volumes of Waifs and Strays contain numerous examples of these runs which have been indexed in each volume These runs are another confirmation of my view that the original form of the folk tale was that of the Cante fable see note on Connla and on Childe Rowland in English Fairy Tales XVII SEA MAIDEN Source Campbell Pop Tales No four I have omitted the births of the animal comrades and transposed the carlin to the middle of the tale mister Batten has considerately idealised the Sea Maiden in his frontispiece When she restores the husband to the wife in one of the variants she brings him out of her mouth So the sea maiden put up his head Who do you mean Out of her mouth to be sure She had swallowed him Parallels The early part of the story occurs in No xv Shee An Gannon and the last part in No xix Fair Brown and Trembling both from Curtin Campbell s No one The Young King is much like it also MacInnes s No iv Herding of Cruachan and No viii Lod the Farmer s Son The third of mister Britten s Irish folk tales in the Folk Lore Journal is a Sea Maiden story The story is obviously a favourite one among the Celts Yet its main incidents occur with frequency in Continental folk tales Prof Kohler has collected a number in his notes on Campbell s Tales in Orient und Occident Bnd ii one hundred fifteen eight The trial of the sword occurs in the saga of Sigurd yet it is also frequent in Celtic saga and folk tales see mister Nutt s note MacInnes s Tales four hundred seventy three and add Curtin three hundred twenty The hideous carlin and her three giant sons is also common form in Celtic The external soul of the Sea Maiden carried about in an egg in a trout in a hoodie in a hind is a remarkable instance of a peculiarly savage conception which has been studied by Major Temple Wide awake Stories four hundred four five by mister E Clodd in the Philosophy of Punchkin in Folk Lore Journal vol ii and by mister Frazer in his Golden Bough vol ii Remarks As both Prof Rhys Hibbert Lect four hundred sixty four and mister Nutt MacInnes s Tales four hundred seventy seven have pointed out practically the same story that of Perseus and Andromeda is told of the Ultonian hero Cuchulain in the Wooing of Emer a tale which occurs in the Book of Leinster a MS of the twelfth century and was probably copied from one of the eighth Unfortunately it is not complete and the Sea Maiden incident is only to be found in a British Museum MS of about thirteen hundred In this Cuchulain finds that the daughter of Ruad is to be given as a tribute to the Fomori who according to Prof Rhys Folk Lore ii two hundred ninety three have something of the night mare about their etymology Cuchulain fights three of them successively has his wounds bound up by a strip of the maiden s garments and then departs Thereafter many boasted of having slain the Fomori but the maiden believed them not till at last by a stratagem she recognises Cuchulain I may add to this that in mister Curtin s Myths three hundred thirty the threefold trial of the sword is told of Cuchulain This would seem to trace our story back to the seventh or eighth century and certainly to the thirteenth If so it is likely enough that it spread from Ireland through Europe with the Irish missions for the wide extent of which see map in missus Bryant s Celtic Ireland The very letters that have spread through all Europe except Russia are to be traced to the script of these Irish monks why not certain folk tales There is a further question whether the story was originally told of Cuchulain as a hero tale and then became departicularised as a folk tale or was the process vice versa Certainly in the form in which it appears in the Tochmarc Emer it is not complete so that here as elsewhere we seem to have an instance of a folk tale applied to a well known heroic name and becoming a hero tale or saga XVIII LEGEND OF KNOCKMANY Source W Carleton Traits and Stories of the Irish Peasantry Parallels Kennedy s Fion MacCuil and the Scotch Giant Legend Fict two hundred three five Remarks Though the venerable name of Finn and Cucullin Cuchulain are attached to the heroes of this story this is probably only to give an extrinsic interest to it The two heroes could not have come together in any early form of their sagas since Cuchulain s reputed date is of the first Finn s of the third century A D c f however MacDougall s Tales notes two hundred seventy two Besides the grotesque form of the legend is enough to remove it from the region of the hero tale On the other hand there is a distinct reference to Finn s wisdom tooth which presaged the future to him on this see Revue Celtique v two hundred one Joyce Old Celt Rom four hundred thirty four five and MacDougall l c two hundred seventy four Cucullin s power finger is another instance of the life index or external soul on which see remarks on Sea Maiden mister Nutt informs me that parodies of the Irish sagas occur as early as the sixteenth century and the present tale may be regarded as a specimen XIX FAIR BROWN AND TREMBLING Source Curtin Myths c of Ireland seventy eight seq

printed privately as a broadsheet in eighteen hundred when it was composed August eleven eighteen hundred Dolymalynllyn is the colophon It was published in Spencer s Poems eighteen eleven pp seventy eight eighty six These dates it will be seen are of importance Spencer states in a note The story of this ballad is traditionary in a village at the foot of Snowdon where Llewellyn the Great had a house The Greyhound named Gelert was given him by his father in law King John in the year twelve oh five and the place to this day is called Beth Gelert or the grave of Gelert As a matter of fact no trace of the tradition in connection with Bedd Gellert can be found before Spencer s time It is not mentioned in Leland s Itinerary ed Hearne v p thirty seven Beth Kellarth in Pennant s Tour seventeen seventy ii one hundred seventy six or in Bingley s Tour in Wales eighteen hundred Borrow in his Wild Wales p one hundred forty six gives the legend but does not profess to derive it from local tradition Parallels The only parallel in Celtdom is that noticed by Croker in his third volume the legend of Partholan who killed his wife s greyhound from jealousy this is found sculptured in stone at Ap Brune company Limerick As is well known and has been elaborately discussed by mister Baring Gould Curious Myths of the Middle Ages p one hundred thirty four seq and mister W A Clouston Popular Tales and Fictions ii one hundred sixty six seq the story of the man who rashly slew the dog ichneumon weasel c that had saved his babe from death is one of those which have spread from East to West It is indeed as mister Clouston points out still current in India the land of its birth There is little doubt that it is originally Buddhistic the late Prof S Beal gave the earliest known version from the Chinese translation of the Vinaya Pitaka in the Academy of Nov four eighteen eighty two The conception of an animal sacrificing itself for the sake of others is peculiarly Buddhistic the hare in the moon is an apotheosis of such a piece of self sacrifice on the part of Buddha Sasa Jataka There are two forms that have reached the West the first being that of an animal saving men at the cost of its own life I pointed out an early instance of this quoted by a Rabbi of the second century in my Fables of AEsop i one hundred five This concludes with a strangely close parallel to Gellert They raised a cairn over his grave and the place is still called The Dog s Grave The Culex attributed to Virgil seems to be another variant of this The second form of the legend is always told as a moral apologue against precipitate action and originally occurred in The Fables of Bidpai in its hundred and one forms all founded on Buddhistic originals cf Benfey Pantschatantra Einleitung No two hundred one two Thence according to Benfey it was inserted in the Book of Sindibad another collection of Oriental Apologues framed on what may be called the missus Potiphar formula This came to Europe with the Crusades and is known in its Western versions as the Seven Sages of Rome The Gellert story occurs in all the Oriental and Occidental versions e g it is the First Master s story in Wynkyn de Worde s ed G L Gomme for the Villon Society From the Seven Sages it was taken into the particular branch of the Gesta Romanorum current in England and known as the English Gesta where it occurs as c xxxii Story of Folliculus We have thus traced it to England whence it passed to Wales where I have discovered it as the second apologue of the Fables of Cattwg the Wise in the Iolo MS published by the Welsh MS Society p five hundred sixty one The man who killed his Greyhound These Fables mister Nutt informs me are a pseudonymous production probably of the sixteenth century This concludes the literary route of the Legend of Gellert from India to Wales Buddhistic Vinaya Pitaka Fables of Bidpai Oriental Sindibad Occidental Seven Sages of Rome English Latin Gesta Romanorum Welsh Fables of Cattwg Footnote two It occurs in the same chapter as the story of La Perrette which has been traced after Benfey by Prof M Muller in his Migration of Fables Sel Essays i five hundred seventy four exactly the same history applies to Gellert Illustration Remarks We have still to connect the legend with Llewelyn and with Bedd Gelert But first it may be desirable to point out why it is necessary to assume that the legend is a legend and not a fact The saving of an infant s life by a dog and the mistaken slaughter of the dog are not such an improbable combination as to make it impossible that the same event occurred in many places But what is impossible in my opinion is that such an event should have independently been used in different places as the typical instance of and warning against rash action That the Gellert legend before it was localised was used as a moral apologue in Wales is shown by the fact that it occurs among the Fables of Cattwg which are all of that character It was also utilised as a proverb Yr wy n edivaru cymmaint a r Gwr a laddodd ei Vilgi I repent as much as the man who slew his greyhound The fable indeed from this point of view seems greatly to have attracted the Welsh mind perhaps as of especial value to a proverbially impetuous temperament Croker Fairy Legends of Ireland vol iii p one hundred sixty five points out several places where the legend seems to have been localised in place names two places called Gwal y Vilast Greyhound s Couch in Carmathen and Glamorganshire Llech y Asp Dog s Stone in Cardigan and another place named in Welsh Spring of the Greyhound s Stone mister Baring Gould mentions that the legend is told of an ordinary tomb stone with a knight and a greyhound in Abergavenny Church while the Fable of Cattwg is told of a man in Abergarwan So wide spread and well known was the legend that it was in Richard III s time adopted as the national crest In the Warwick Roll at the Herald s Office after giving separate crests for England Scotland and Ireland that for Wales is given as figured in the margin and blazoned on a coronet in a cradle or a greyhound argent for Walys see J R Planche Twelve Designs for the Costume of Shakespeare s Richard III eighteen thirty frontispiece If this Roll is authentic the popularity of the legend is thrown back into the fifteenth century It still remains to explain how and when this general legend of rash action was localised and specialised at Bedd Gelert I believe I have discovered this There certainly was a local legend about a dog named Gelert at that place E Jones in the first edition of his Musical Relicks of the Welsh Bards seventeen eighty four p forty gives the following englyn or epigram Claddwyd Cylart celfydd ymlyniad Ymlaneau Efionydd Parod giuio i w gynydd Parai r dydd yr heliai Hydd which he Englishes thus The remains of famed Cylart so faithful and good The bounds of the cantred conceal Whenever the doe or the stag he pursued His master was sure of a meal No reference was made in the first edition to the Gellert legend but in the second edition of seventeen ninety four p seventy five a note was added telling the legend There is a general tradition in North Wales that a wolf had entered the house of Prince Llewellyn Soon after the Prince returned home and going into the nursery he met his dog Kill hart all bloody and wagging his tail at him Prince Llewellyn on entering the room found the cradle where his child lay overturned and the floor flowing with blood imagining that the greyhound had killed the child he immediately drew his sword and stabbed it then turning up the cradle found under it the child alive and the wolf dead This so grieved the Prince that he erected a tomb over his faithful dog s grave where afterwards the parish church was built and goes by that name Bedd Cilhart or the grave of Kill hart in Carnarvonshire From this incident is elicited a very common Welsh proverb that given above which occurs also in The Fables of Cattwg it will be observed that it is quite indefinite Prince Llewellyn ab Jorwerth married Joan natural daughter of King John by Agatha daughter of Robert Ferrers Earl of Derby and the dog was a present to the prince from his father in law about the year twelve oh five It was clearly from this note that the honorable mister Spencer got his account oral tradition does not indulge in dates Anno Domini The application of the general legend of the man who slew his greyhound to the dog Cylart was due to the learning of E Jones author of the Musical Relicks I am convinced of this for by a lucky chance I am enabled to give the real legend about Cylart which is thus given in Carlisle s Topographical Dictionary of Wales s v Bedd Celert published in eighteen eleven the date of publication of mister Spencer s Poems Its name according to tradition implies The Grave of Celert a greyhound which belonged to Llywelyn the last Prince of Wales and a large Rock is still pointed out as the monument of this celebrated Dog being on the spot where it was found dead together with the stag which it had pursued from Carnarvon which is thirteen miles distant The cairn was thus a monument of a record run of a greyhound the englyn quoted by Jones is suitable enough for this while quite inadequate to record the later legendary exploits of Gelert Jones found an englyn devoted to an exploit of a dog named Cylart and chose to interpret it in his second edition seventeen ninety four as the exploit of a greyhound with which all the world in Wales were acquainted mister Spencer took the legend from Jones the reference to the date twelve oh five proves that enshrined it in his somewhat banal verses which were lucky enough to be copied into several reading books and thus became known to all English speaking folk It remains only to explain why Jones connected the legend with Llewelyn Llewelyn had local connection with Bedd Gellert which was the seat of an Augustinian abbey one of the oldest in Wales An inspeximus of Edward I given in Dugdale Monast Angl ed pr ii one hundreda quotes as the earliest charter of the abbey Cartam Lewelini magni The name of the abbey was Beth Kellarth the name is thus given by Leland l c and as late as seventeen ninety four an engraving at the British Museum is entitled Beth Kelert while Carlisle gives it as Beth Celert The place was thus named after the abbey not after the cairn or rock This is confirmed by the fact of which Prof Rhys had informed me that the collocation of letters rt is un Welsh Under these circumstances it is not impossible I think that the earlier legends of the marvellous run of Cylart from Carnarvon was due to the etymologising fancy of some English speaking Welshman who interpreted the name as Kill hart so that the simpler legend would be only a folk etymology But whether Kellarth Kelert Cylart Gelert or Gellert ever existed and ran a hart from Carnarvon to Bedd Gellert or no there can be little doubt after the preceding that he was not the original hero of the fable of the man that slew his greyhound which came to Wales from Buddhistic India through channels which are perfectly traceable It was Edward Jones who first raised him to that proud position and William Spencer who securely installed him there probably for all time The legend is now firmly established at Bedd Gellert There is said to be an ancient air Bedd Gelert as sung by the Ancient Britons it is given in a pamphlet published at Carnarvon in the fifties entitled Gellert s Grave or Llewellyn s Rashness a Ballad by the honorable W R Spencer to which is added that ancient Welsh air Bedd Gelert as sung by the Ancient Britons The air is from R Roberts Collection of Welsh Airs but what connection it has with the legend I have been unable to ascertain This is probably another case of adapting one tradition to another It is almost impossible to distinguish palaeozoic and cainozoic strata in oral tradition According to Murray s Guide to N Wales p one hundred twenty five the only authority for the cairn now shown is that of the landlord of the Goat Inn who felt compelled by the cravings of tourists to invent a grave Some old men at Bedd Gellert Prof Rhys informs me are ready to testify that they saw the cairn laid They might almost have been present at the birth of the legend which if my affiliation of it is correct is not yet quite one hundred years old XXII STORY OF IVAN Source Lluyd Archaeologia Britannia seventeen oh seven the first comparative Celtic grammar and the finest piece of work in comparative philology hitherto done in England contains this tale as a specimen of Cornish then still spoken in Cornwall I have used the English version contained in Blackwood s Magazine as long ago

probability from the Gesta Romanorum c one hundred three where two of the three pieces of advise are Avoid a byeway Beware of a house where the housewife is younger than her husband It is likely

discussion of the tale MacInnes Tales four hundred forty one makes the interesting suggestion that the obstacles to pursuit the forest the mountain and the river exactly represent the boundary of the old Teutonic Hades so that the story was originally one of the Descent to Hell Altogether it seems likely that it is one of the oldest folk tales in existence and belonged to the story store of the original Aryans whoever they were was passed by them with their language on to the Hellenes and perhaps to the Indians was developed in its modern form in Scandinavia where its best representative The Master Maid of Asbjornsen is still found was passed by them to the Celts and possibly was transmitted by these latter to other parts of Europe perhaps by early Irish monks see notes on Sea Maiden The
